The lines that surface most frequently in praise of her work and her person are moving declarations of racial pride, courage, steadfastness.\" -Toni Morrison\n\u201cFor me,\u201d Lucille Clifton (1936-2010) said, \u201cpoetry is a way of living in the world.\u201d What this beloved author found in poetry is the gift she gives readers: a way of living in the world, of looking at and navigating through the challenges of lived experience. The poems Clifton wrote during her fifty-year career are encapsulations of hope, beauty, courage, and strength.\nBOA Editions invites you to join us in celebrating Lucille Clifton\u2019s legacy with the publication of How to Carry Water, a collection of two-hundred of her most poignant poems\u2014ten of which are previously unpublished\u2014selected by award-winning poet Aracelis Girmay.\nBOA Editions will publish a hardcover edition of How to Carry Water in fall 2020. Your support will help BOA bring this essential book of one by America\u2019s most prized poets to readers everywhere. \n the woman who feels everything\nsits in her new house\n waiting for someone to come\n who knows how to carry water\n without spilling, who knows\n why the desert is sprinkled\n with salt, why tomorrow\n is such a long and ominous word.\n -Lucille Clifton, from \u201cwater sign woman\u201d\nLucille Clifton is the only poet to have two books selected in the same year as finalists for the Pulitzer Prize. Her many accolades include the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize, the Robert Frost Medal, the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award, and the National Book Award.\nAuthor Toni Morrison described Clifton\u2019s poetry as \u201cseductive with the simplicity of an atom, which is to say highly complex, explosive underneath an apparent quietude.\u201d\nWriting for the New York Times, Reginald Dwayne Betts praised the timeliness\u2014and timelessness\u2014of Clifton\u2019s work: \u201cClifton\u2019s earliest poems could have been written yesterday, and her later works could have been written decades ago. Each poem is always its own world.\u201d\nPoet W.S. Merwin found in Clifton\u2019s work an \u201cabiding joy\u201d in the face of \u201cgreat loss and trouble, pain and loneliness.\u201d\nLucille Clifton (photo by Rachel Eliza Griffiths Hires)\n \u201cNo one writes like Lucille Clifton, and yet, if it were possible to open a voice, like a suitcase, to see what it carries inside it, I believe that inside the voices of many contemporary U.S. American poets are the poems of Lucille Clifton. There is the ferocity of her clear sight. There is the constellatory thinking where every thing is kin.\u201d  -Aracelis Girmay, from the Foreword of How to Carry Water \nAracelis Girmay, Editor of How to Carry Water, is author of three poetry collections: the black maria (BOA, 2016); Kingdom Animalia (BOA, 2011), winner of the Isabella Gardner Poetry Award and the GLCA New Writers Award, and a finalist for both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Hurston/Wright Legacy Award; and Teeth (Curbstone Press, 2007). The recipient of fellowships from Cave Canem, Civitella Ranieri, and the National Endowment for the Arts, Girmay is the winner of a 2015 Whiting Award for Poetry.  \n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to overstate how important it was to me to have Aracelis Girmay edit the Lucille Clifton Selected. I trust implicitly in her fierce integrity, discernment, intelligence, and formidable poetic powers \u2014 I was literally gleeful at the idea of discovering what she\u2019d select and how she would shape the collection. Her passion for Lucille Clifton\u2019s work is palpable and I knew that Aracelis regarded her as an artistic model, inspiration, and one of America\u2019s best poets. It has been a true pleasure watching Aracelis work on this book and sharing the experience of (as she describes in her Foreword) 'waiting to hear from Ms. Lucille' with another one of America\u2019s best poets.\u201d -BOA Publisher Peter Conners\nAracelis Girmay (photo by Sheila Griffin)\nIn times of uncertainty, poetry speaks. \nLucille Clifton's poems are often shared on social media, held up as gems of insight in times of celebration and triumph; in times of struggle and loss. This book of poetry offers Clifton's piercing insight, fierce intelligence, and reassuring humor for devoted fans and new readers alike. An essential collection of poetry, needed now and always. \n new bones\nwe will wear\nnew bones again.\nwe will leave\nthese rainy days,\nbreak out through\nanother mouth\ninto sun and honey time.\nworlds buzz over us like bees,\nwe be splendid in new bones.\nother people think they know\nhow long life is\nhow strong life is.\nwe know.\nLucille Clifton was no stranger to adversity. And yet, her poems manage to address struggle, illness, injustice, and hardship with characteristic JOY. In fact, Joy! was how Clifton inscribed each of her books: it was her wish for her readers. \n Join us in celebrating Clifton\u2019s legacy. Her spirit. Her poems. Her joy.  \nThe Lannan Foundation has backed this project with a $40,000 Matching Grant. To date, BOA has raised $19,406 to meet this match\u2014your pledges will get us the rest of the way!

The press was founded in 1976 by the late poet, editor, and translator, A.

Today, BOA continues in this spirit by publishing new voices and providing a home for a diverse group of poets and writers. The books BOA publishes each year represent a diversity of voices, aesthetics, and forms. BOA and its authors have received many accolades and awards, including the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. After nearly half a century of independent publishing, BOA remains steadfast in its mission to foster and promote readership of contemporary literature.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are launching this campaign despite the COVID-19 pandemic because we know that while poetry is not deemed an \"Essential Service\" it is indeed essential.

The sound and wonder of them, but also the fact of the girl born Thelma Lucille Clifton, with twelve fingers, under a moon nearly half lit and half in shadow. Born through a poet into a poet, making a Dahomey sound in Buffalo, carrying anguish already, and making her poems before, after, through. Extraordinary and ordinary and Black and female and magic. It is very alphabet I walk behind listening toward the old, new sense she both awakens and makes possible with her work.

As we travel and explore the US by way of interstate highways, truck stops, and the couches of friends and friendly strangers, we have awakened to the beauty our own country and the myriad stories it has to tell.\nThroughout this time we have been gathering and collecting images and stories and they have evolved into some of the most honest, fully-realized, and artistically cohesive songs that we've ever written.\nAnd now we are ready to share these songs with the world...\nHow We Got Here\nIn 2014, you helped us create our debut album, What a Difference a Melody Makes. By helping us fund that album, you became an invaluable part of The Singer and The Songwriter. \nThese past few years, as we have grown, and you have continued to support us: the generous friends-of-friends who have housed us; eager fans who have bought our albums, shared our music and hosted us for house concerts; and incredibly generous strangers who have welcomed us - you have all become our community and our family, and every tour, we look forward to seeing you and sharing our music and stories, triumphs and heartaches with you.\nWe've loved watching this community grow organically, and as we embark on our most ambitious collection of music yet, we are reaching out to you for support, inspiration, and encouragement. \nModern Folk Songs\nfolk music (n.) music that originates in traditional popular culture or that is written in such a style. Folk music is typically [...] transmitted orally from generation to generation.\nWe\u2019ve always had a connection to folk music because it is music about people. Throughout history, folk songs have served as documentation, a true account of our shared experiences. We have always been drawn to the humanity in these stories and how they bear witness to the truth. \nThis is an album of modern folk songs, and these are true stories.\nWe have always had an \u201coral tradition\u201d in the way we write since neither of us read or write music. We sing melodies back and forth to each other until something sticks. And through this imperfect oral tradition, the melody changes and morphs into a song. Thu will teach a song to Rachel and she will sing it back and eventually, Thu will sing Rachel\u2019s version and Rachel will sing Thu\u2019s version, and the final product is something wholly different than its origin. For us, that's folk music.\nThe Inspiration\nThe title for this album came from the town of McDermitt, NV - a small, \u201cmodern-day ghost town\u201d on the border of Nevada and Oregon. There was an old abandoned shop with a sign in the window that read: Dreams! The Dead! Ghost! Future \nThis intriguing series of words felt so evocative to us, and we felt that they perfectly captured the human experiences that we have been writing about in these new songs.\nThe Dreams... Team\nNick Luca - Producer/Engineer - We are enlisting a producer and engineer that we\u2019ve admired for a long time: Nick Luca from Los Angeles, CA. He\u2019s worked with Iron & Wine, Neko Case, and Calexico, and he mixed our second release, Ballads for Trying Times. His warmth, ease, and collaborative nature (as well as his multi-talented musicianship) make him the perfect person to bring these songs to life.\nJJ Golden - Mastering Engineer - For our past two releases, we have loved working with JJ Golden and the team at Golden Mastering in Ventura, CA. JJ has lent his light touch, and incredible breadth of experience to our music and has contributed so much to our recordings. We are excited for him to master this album.\nWe will also be bringing on a drummer and bass player for this album as well as a few other musicians as needed, and we are excited to introduce them to you as they sign on for the project! \nThe Timeline\nIn early 2020, we will join Nick in Los Angeles to track and mix 10-12 songs for this album over the course of about 2 weeks. From there, we will send the final mixes to Golden Mastering with a goal to have a completed album that's ready for release in late spring of 2020.\nThe Budget\nWe want to be transparent with you about exactly where all the funds will go for this project.\n 36% of the funds will go to paying our producer and the studio rental \n 15% of the funds will go to the post-production process (i.e. mixing and mastering)\n 15% of the funds will go to a promotional campaign for the album's release\n 17% of the funds will go to manufacturing merchandise (CD's, Vinyl, T-shirts, and more!)\n 8% of funds will go to the various fees from Kickstarter and Amazon\nThe remaining 9% of funds and anything over our goal will go toward making music videos, creating more great merch for you, and extra promotional efforts for the album's release.\nFolk of Color\nWe consider our diverse cultural backgrounds (Vietnamese-American and mixed-race Mexican-American) to be unique assets in creating folk music. We are proud to carry on the folk music tradition of sharing our perspective and experience of the world through music and storytelling, and we feel that the representation of our identities as people of color in this field is important. We have always had a goal of inclusivity in our music, and we hope that through our inclusion in the folk music community, we inspire the inclusion of others as well.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMost of the songs on this album are finished and ready to record, but a few are still in the process of being written, so there is a chance that there may be a delay in completing the arrangements in order to be ready for the studio.

In which case, this may delay the manufacturing of CD's and Vinyl.\n\nWe are a two-person operation - from graphic design to marketing to booking - we do it all.

There will be twelve performances over three weekends from September 27th and October 13th at Automata in Los Angeles as part of Los Angeles Exchange [LAX] Festival, 6th Ed.\n2014, Automata, Photo: Rafael Hernandez\nThe Story\nObject of Her Affection follows the emotional journey of protagonist, Andrea Lowe, after she has mysteriously fallen from a building.  In her final moments, she reflects on her meaningful relationships starting with her first love, a baby\u2019s blanket.  As an adolescent, she loses her virginity to a bad-boy hunting rifle and subsequently becomes infatuated with a controversial wall.  As Andrea evolves, so do her desires. In adulthood, she forms doomed relationships with monumental structures: a high-profile statue, tragic twin skyscrapers, and a bridge who cheats.  Each of these relationships has a profound effect, shaping Andrea\u2019s views on life and love. Finally,  she finds solace in Roy, a crumbling tenement who ultimately fails her. \nThe Performance\nObject of Her Affection is a visual narrative about human beings (flesh and blood) developing intimate relationships with inanimate things and the universal development and loss of relationships we encounter on our journey through life.\n \u201cThe piece, which questions on a cosmic level our artificial divide between the animate and the inanimate, has the appealing, droll humor and structural unity of a David Sedaris story.\u201d \u2013 LA Weekly\n2014, REDCAT, Photo: Steve Gunther\nInspiration\nI\u2019ve been developing the ideas behind Object of Her Affection for a while: Back in 2010 -  my wheels started spinning when I stumbled upon footage of a woman who wanted to marry an amusement park ride.  While her story was unusual, there was something about her authenticity and earnestness that was relatable and refreshing.\nAs an artist who recontextualizes objects and puppets, I\u2019m constantly thinking about animism and the suspension of disbelief.  As a queer person, object sexuality resonated with something inside me that had been festering: on the one hand sexual minorities were making historic strides. On the other it seemed like LGBT identity was being gentrified in a heteronormative push towards respectability politics.  \nYou bet I was fascinated by the concept of object sexuality.  There was something appealing about the emotional, physical, and romantic desire towards inanimate objects.  It explodes traditional categorizations of sexual identity and turns our ideas about love inside out.  People with object sexuality fall in love with things, rather than humans.  They don\u2019t so much want a place at the table as they might long for a relationship with one.\n2016, Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery, photos: Alex Griffin\nHistory\nThere have been many iterations of the material from this project in the last eight years from artist talks (Calgary\u2019s International Festival of Animated Objects, Maryland Institute College of Art), readings and workshops (Eugene O\u2018Neill Theater Center, Automata, REDCAT), to an installation at Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery in which I created over a thousand distressed handmade rag dolls. \nIt\u2019s 2018, and I\u2019m thrilled Los Angeles Performance Practice has invited us to perform at Automata for a three-weekend run. It has been a dream of mine to have a longer run where more people can experience Object of Her Affection. I hope through wider exposure, the performance will one day be able tour. Your support will help me to create a dynamic performance that occupies a precarious border between beauty and terror as I further examine the fringes of our shared world.  \nWe need your help!\nWith your help I hope to raise a minimum of $3,000 to addresses urgent, necessary artist fees and production costs crucial to the project\u2019s completion. Your donations will ensure we can present the performance in the best possible light by completing our lighting, projection, and sound budget items. Anything raised towards our stretch goal of $10,000 will help increase production value, take some financial strain off mounting a large scale production, and put us in a better position for future runs and touring possibilities  \n2016, Haus of Marsian, Photo: William Short\nCreative Team\nMarsian De Lellis (writer, performer, creator) is an interdisciplinary artist who combines sculpture, objects, installation, performance and handmade spectacles to memorialize obsessional lives. Their work celebrates stories of unconventional people whose private manias become public fodder for tabloids and reality television. \nMichele Spears (director) is a director/choreographer, performer, theatre producer, and arts educator. Her work has been recognized with New York Nightlife, L.A. Weekly, Saturn, UNIMA, Stagescene L.A., Dramalogue, and Santa Barbara Independent Awards, as well as American Choreographers Award  and Ovation Award nominations.\nAndrew Schmedake (Lighting designer) is a lighting designer for theater, dance and live events. His career has ranged from opera and ballet to cruise ships, haunted houses and immersive theater. Presently, Andrew lives in Los Angeles and lectures at UC Santa Barbara. He earned his MFA in Lighting Design from Carnegie Mellon University.\nBecca Kessin (sound designer) is a sound designer working in Los Angeles and regionally since 2006. She teaches Sound Design at California State University, Fullerton, after previously teaching at Santa Monica College, Cal Poly Pomona, and the Orange County High School for the Arts.

At the \u201cFWB\u201d ($10) level, we\u2019ll acknowledge your alluring micro-philanthropy online + social media, so friends, family, co-workers, and foreign adversaries will all know how generous you are. Or for slightly more, at the \u201cDiscreet\u201d ($25) level, we\u2019ll try to be  \u201cdiscreet\u201d (whatever that means) about your generosity and NOT acknowledge your allure on social media. Note: We can\u2019t exactly guarantee foreign adversaries won\u2019t find out how kind you are, and reserve the right to print your name in the program + websites)\nIs anything ever safe? At the \u201cSafe Word\u201d ($50) level, we\u2019ll send a digital pdf of the script you can read anywhere. \u201cSafe Word\u201d is ideal for waiting rooms or plane rides (where nosey seat mates can look over your shoulder and speculate about you). There\u2019s also the printed \u201cSapio\u201d ($69) option signed by the writer and sealed in an envelope licked with the writer\u2019s own saliva. This hard copy is a much sought after night stand (or jury duty) conversation starter. \nWe know many of you want the performance to tour to your far away city, or maybe you live in L.A., but don't want to get out of bed. No worries!  We\u2019ve got you covered with the \u201cVoyeur\u201d ($113) reward. You\u2019ll receive private downloadable videos from our newly edited 51-minute Automata workshop and 29-minute REDCAT performance (both 2014) and any new bonus footage as it becomes available.\nShow your soft, yet aggressive side at the \u201cRough Trade\u201d ($160/$169+) level, with a miniature (4\u201d-6\u201d), cardboard taxidermized feline head. These cruelty-free, artesanal handmade items, are the purrr-fect holiday gift that can diffuse the fiercest of vegangelical friends (or that family member with Social Justice Disorder). Every reward at the \u201cRough Trade\u201d level and beyond comes with or without the plus option with tickets for Angelenos and LA visitors. Plus tickets are made available on a first-come, first-reserve basis. \nAt the \u201cSituationship\u201d ($260/$269+) level, you can adopt your very own small* (4\u201d-6\u201d) distressed, handmade rag doll from the \u201c(In)/Animate Objects\u201d collection. Situationship dolls could be a thoughtful winter solstice gift for that FWB who may be agnostic, buddhist, or in some form of bereavement. Contemplate impermanence as you watch this one of a kind art piece decay over time.  The \u201cSituationship\u201d reward is also available with 2 tickets (for you and an emotional service human).\nAt the \u201cGainer\u201d ($560/569+) level, you can own a large 12\u201d tall* distressed, handmade, artist rag doll from the \u201c(In)/Animate Objects\u201d collection. Ruminate into the tangles of dysfunctional primitive stitchery, brooding over the ephemeral nature of life and the inevitability of death, while your doll slowly deteriorates right before your eyes. Indulge yourself in mock burials, or invest in your contemporary art collection. \u201cGainer\u201d level dolls come with the option of 2 tickets. Suggested: bring an ex to the performance and bestow upon them this charming closure gift before you abandon each other. \nBoth \u201cSituationship\u201d and \u201cGainer\u201d level dolls are sourced from the \"(In)/Animate Objects\" collection, a 2016 installation that formed the second half of a diptych with its companion, the performance, \"Object of Her Affection\". In the installation, years have passed since Andrea fatally fell from the crumbling tenement she was in love with.  In a dark room, a mountain of decaying dolls tower to the ceiling upon which their maker, Andrea\u2019s grandmother, presides from the throne of her wingback chair. The thousands of dolls she has amassed in sorrow testify to the insatiable need for love at the heart of the obsessional life. *Note: \u201cSituationship\u201d and \u201cGainer\u201d level dolls are designed to be irregular, and may come burned, stained, soiled, and/or damaged with evidence of wear and tear. \nI am also designing a small but sensual, limited edition, signed photo book of images and ephemera from our performances at the \u201cPornographer\u201d ($360/$369+) level.  A delightfully provocative conversation piece, the \u201cPornographer\u201d level art book, comes with the option of 2 tickets for you and a trick.\nFinally, at the \u201cThrouple\u201d ($960/969) level you\u2019ll triple your pleasure with three rewards: a unique 12\u201d \u201cGainer\u201d level artist doll, a visually stimulating \u201cPornographer\u201d level photo book, and a \u201cRough Trade\u201d level Cardboard Taxidermy collectable...

Excitement and joy because it's an honor to be given the gift of music and have the opportunity to share it with the world. I've been blessed to have the good fortune to do what I love, sing, and sing jazz to be more specific. I've shared the stage with many great jazz musicians and have been mentored by them. I've traveled abroad to perform this music and every time I do there is the same excitement and joy I felt when I was a kid.\nStill, I would be lying if I didn't say I felt a bit of fear and trepidation as I move forward in this next chapter of my musical career. Putting forth my original compositions and the arrangements that have been swirling around in my head is a bit daunting. But fear of the unknown is a wonderful place for a jazz musician to be in and I accept the challenge wholeheartedly.\n I was asked by my friend, pianist/composer/producer Bill Mays, \"Why now? What took so long?\", and the truth is, I wasn't ready. Jazz is a process. It's about growth and maturity. It's about the experience one gains from playing and living this great music and hopefully developing a sound or voice that's uniquely your own.\nOn my debut CD, I hope to share with you original compositions and standards that are personal to me. I have been busy writing and arranging songs that express where I am today both musically and emotionally. Songs and ideas that convey the things that excite me and concern me, the choices that shaped my life and the emotions I feel when I think about the beauty and immensity of this world. For those of you who have seen me perform you know what I mean. I leave it all out for you to enjoy!\nJoining me on this project will be, my collaborator, Nicki Adams. Nicki is an emotionally sensitive pianist, amazing technician and my partner in fleshing out musical ideas and arrangements. He is also a fine composer in his own right. It's important for a singer to have a pianist you can work with consistently and he has been an integral part of this journey. He along with a rhythm section will comprise the nucleus of the band for this project.\nIn closing, know that I regard your contribution, no matter how large or small, as a gracious gesture and I recognize that I'm blessed that you believe in me. The decision is personal.

Empathy, evolution and beauty. We humbly ask for your support to fulfill these musical promises.\nTHANK YOU! \n-----\nLOOONG STORY\nTHE PERSONAL: \nIt\u2019s been 8 years \u2013 almost to the day \u2013 since I decided I was going to be a rock star. In that time I\u2019ve put out two demos, two EPs, a live album, a full length album, a Folk Opera (with my first Kickstarter campaign in 2010), six professional videos and a series of commissioned works for the Puppets & Poets Festival 2015. I've landed two licensing contracts (which have yet to place anything), started on the road towards the professional songwriting/publishing world, quit my day job twice and restarted it once. \nAnd, between growing and birthing a child and a hard turn a few years back, my sense of the world has exploded open and everything that\u2019s come before has been rewritten with the new knowledge of the suffering and miracles of existence. \nDuring some of that less desirable time \u2013 when the first truth of Buddhism (\u201cAll life is suffering\u201d) suddenly became apparent \u2013 I experienced my first creative block. I was paralyzed in the lower regions of Maslow\u2019s hierarchy while we weathered some vast unknowns regarding the child\u2019s health*. It was a sort of torture. But like all things in time, it changed, and here I am today exploding with creative energy, writing better music than ever, and almost singularly focused on bringing it into the world in its proper format. \nFor me, these songs represent not only the more universal themes described below, but also a personal evolution: since those hard times I have been constantly living in them, cycling through bouts of despair and gratitude. These songs have helped me learn to tuck despair into my heart, a constant companion, and keep moving along anyway. We are all suffering in our own ways, but we are not suffering all the time, as a great friend helped me remember. These songs are meant to both bridge an understanding to the suffering of their subjects, but also bring light and beauty to life. \n(*HE IS GLORIOUSLY HEALTHY NOW! All is well. Blessed be.)  \nTHE MUSIC: \nMy mission is to build empathic bridges between people. The new songs do this exponentially better than anything I\u2019ve written before. Empathy has always been my impetus, but now I truly break and am reborn in the stories of people I meet, love, or have known. \nWhy does empathy matter? Empathy hurts. It requires courage and vulnerability over and over. It is not easy. But, with empathy we put aside our personal fears and assumptions and listen to what someone else is saying. And we feel what they feel for a moment \u2013 our bridge to them. We\u2019re then less likely to hate them, judge them, or ignore systems that hurt them. I believe this is our best tool in the fight against the hate that surrounds us in the present age.\n \u201cWhat We Said\u201d \u2013 This song, with newly edited lyrics, is written in the voice of a woman who refuses to leave her husband (until death) even though he cheats. We want to judge this woman \u2013 and so many are\u2013 for this decision, but we don\u2019t understand her. The conflict here is between personal happiness and the devotion to a vow. (Hear the old lyric-version here, to get the haunting melody and Jeremy's sick bass line stuck in your head.)  \n\n\u201cNikki\u2019s Song\u201d \u2013 (A working title) An ode to the stupendous Nicole McRory (whose body left us 5 years ago April 29th), a transsexual woman and rock goddess like none other. This song gives voice not only to a tiny fraction of her struggle as a trans person, but also her courage as someone who never gave up keeping her heart open to the pain and beauty of the world ... with a strong nod to the Beckett\u2019s Family Reunion that happened every Wednesday night from 2002-2007. The song is for and from Nikki - the last line (\"Just like she feared / Her life fell apart / But that's the way / She'd always say / You earn your Diamond Heart\") came to me while Emmylou Harris sang \"The Pearl\" ten feet in front of me in Nashville a few weeks ago - it felt like a gift from Nicole. Not a bad way to receive a song-gift ... (It was effing amazing actually.)\nAnnie & Nikki\nBoth songs lean back towards the electric sounds of light to see dark, our 2012 album, leaving behind most of the acoustic instrumentation of Stranded Songs (except Jeremy\u2019s u-bass \u263a). As always, we keep strong the folk roots and pop sensibilities. Tal Ariel will be lending his expertise as a Producer to these tunes, and we\u2019ll have a few special guests sitting in with us. \nWe'll also be creating a video for each song. This is one of the best and most compelling ways that people discover and share music these days and we consider it essential to the process. We'll have more details on this as we confirm our collaborators. \nWe see a big life for these songs. Bigger than any song I've released before. \nTHE TEAM\nThe efforts of Jeremy Mulder (my sweet love) and dear friends Tal Ariel and Omar Cuellar during the last few years have been loving and full of excitement. These men don\u2019t just show up and play, they work on arrangements, help with production decisions, make me laugh, and encourage me to keep working. Not to mention their immense talent uplifting my work at every turn. \nfive people, four males, three beards, two mulders & one Bacon\nWe also have on board collaborators old and new: Gabriel Goldstein, who directed, shot and/or edited this, this, and this video of ours; Do I Dare, who remixed this song and this one of ours; Bunnie Reiss, who made the dress below and is my FAVORITE contemporary artist (she's creating an original piece of art for us); 25th Street Recording studios; and more!\nThe Team is ready!\ndress by Nooworks with Bunnie Reiss art - photo by Nate Chavez\nTHE BUDGET & TIMELINE:\nFull funding of the project is $7,000. If we raise $10,000 our videos will be properly funded, at $14,000 we can do an additional day of recording (1-2 more songs), and if you INSIST that we do a whole album, help us get to $20,000. \nFor years now I've been skimping and making magic happen by asking people to volunteer their efforts - including many of you. And what magic!!! But that is unsustainable. These fine people need to feed their landlords and babies. What you see below is the (almost) true cost of a DIY recording project. (None of this money stays with me, and many of these are modest & discounted fees.)\nStudio / Mixing / Mastering $1100\nMusicians & Producer $2800\nArtwork & Design $500\nPromotion & materials $1400 \nDigital Distribution $50 \nDownload Card / Stickers  $200\n2 Videos $1400\n2 Remixes $200 \nMisc Recording costs $250\nKickstarter & Amazon Payment Fees $800 \nBudget Total: $8700\nCash on hand $1700\n          Total Needed: $7000\nFor this amount we can pay 3-5 people in the studio process, plus 7 musicians and a producer (all of whom you probably know), an independent artist & a designer, a local promoter, and 2-4 independent filmmakers. That's 15-20 people whose creative livelihoods you're directly supporting in addition to giving wings to my songs. \nWe will be in the studio on April 23rd for our initial tracking session. With some small overdubs, mixing and mastering, we expect the songs to be finished by mid June. Digital delivery of the songs to our backers will take place as soon as they are completed, and we will host a listening party for all local backers in July here in SF.  Videos will be created over the summer with a fall release expected ... and don't be surprised if we ask you to be in one of the videos ;) \nTHE ASK: \nWe know you love music. If you need it as much as we need to make it, let\u2019s work together to make this magic in the world, and help others care about people they might not know how to care about. \nCommunity funding (a more democratic version of the ancient patronage systems) is an essential component in the modern era of music sharing/streaming, where it takes 1,190 Spotify listens to equal a single album purchase. Lacking any income from music sales, and while licensing and publishing efforts are still in embryonic stages, crowdfunding allows us to connect your desire to fund the arts with our need to fund them. \nUnlike my talent show birthday parties, participation in this is not mandatory. Please only give if it feels GREAT to you to give. Your support feels so good to us, and we are big on consent, so we want to be sure your YES is loud and clear. If it is, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! \nAs musicians, we are offering MUSIC for perks! Lessons, performances, sing-alongs ... The side-bar is full of musical services for your choosing pleasure. We are also willing to entertain most (reasonable) offers for fulfilling musical needs. \nAnd remember there are more ways than just money to support us: cover our campaign on your local blog; write an impassioned plea to your community about why this music deserves support; volunteer to help us get the perks out on the back end; or pass out campaign flyers at work.\nTell your friends! \nAnd please know our gratitude is immense. \nLove, \nAnnie, Tal, Omar, Jeremy et al", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no risks to human or animal life involved in this project.

Or, if you\u2019re of a different ideological bent \u2014 or someone who\u2019s gotten evicted to make way for a mayonnaise store \u2014 replace \u201cyoung people\u201d with \u201cdevelopers and gentrifiers\u201d and \u201cstart bands\u201d with \u201cdestroy everything that was once good about the place.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the same story as in numerous other cities, where \u201crevitalized\u201d urban neighborhoods have sprung up in recent years, germinating Thai takeout and juice bars wherever they go.\nYet the real story of the New Brooklyn is far more complex. It's a tale of quick-buck land flippers and city officials playing cat-and-mouse as each pursue their own self-interested ends; of artists and entrepreneurs and sideshow hucksters seeking to claim neighborhoods for their own, while at the same time hoping to fight off the next wave of colonists who invariably follow them; of unemployed master puppeteers on soup kitchen lines and longtime shopkeepers alike trying to fight through the tidal surge of the new Brooklyn economy; and of young newcomers who seek apartments by riding the L train until they find a neighborhood they can afford. All are helping to shape Brooklyn in their own way, though some are more influential shapers than others.\nThese are just some of the people you\u2019ll meet in \u201cThe Brooklyn Wars,\u201d a full-length book that will zoom in on four key battlegrounds in the borough\u2019s transformation:\n\u2022 The redevelopment of Coney Island, which began as a complicated four-way battle between amusement park operators, city planners, real estate magnates, and low-income residents. It's resulted in a beachfront that has been transformed, but not in ways that everyone agrees is for the better.\n\u2022 Downtown Brooklyn and Bushwick, two neighborhoods on the front lines of the borough\u2019s gentrification battles, pitting longtime residents against wealthier (and whiter) newcomers.\n\u2022 The outer Brooklyn neighborhoods, from eastern Bedford-Stuyvesant to Flatlands and Canarsie, where most of the borough\u2019s one million poor live, and where economic benefits haven\u2019t always trickled down.\n\u2022 The new Barclays Center arena for the Brooklyn Nets, which sparked a decade-long fight over \u201cjobs, hoops, and housing\u201d involving the strangest of bedfellows.\nThese are all areas that I\u2019ve covered extensively for more than a decade, for such publications as the Village Voice, City Limits, and Metro NY. (See demause.net for links to recent articles.) \u201cThe Brooklyn Wars\u201d will take the best of this reporting \u2014 including a backlog of material that wouldn\u2019t fit into a 500-word op-ed column \u2014 and mix it with new research to create an all-new work intended to answer the question: How has Brooklyn changed, who are the winners and losers, and what does this mean for other cities facing similar transformations?\nSo why, exactly, do I need your help with this? Right now, I have tons of stories to tell, but they\u2019re scattered across dozens of articles in multiple outlets (many no longer available online), not to mention countless notebooks and minidisc cartridges that have piled up over the years.

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

Behind the Lid is an evocation not only of Ms. Nagrin but also of an entire theatrical subculture that now has only a flickering existence.\"\n                            - Ben Brantley, The New York Times.  2007\nTHE STORY\nLee Nagrin was a pivotal and influential figure in the Avant-Garde movement of the second half of the 20th century.  She had a immeasurable impact on countless downtown artists thriving today.  With her assimilation of many artistic mediums, Nagrin was considered a multi-media artist long before the term was even invented.   \nBehind The Lid,  a theatrical experience created slowly over nine years by Lee Nagrin and world-renowned puppeteer Basil Twist, received its world premiere on June 3, 2007 at the Silver Whale Gallery in New York City to great critical acclaim. It ran for only 6 weeks. \nThe intimate audience of 18 people per-performance took an expanded and revealing journey through a special hand-made world. Twist and four puppeteers performed alongside effigies and totems of Nagrin. Her longtime home and work space, Silver Whale Gallery at 21 Bleecker Street, was utterly transformed into in a site-specific and ambulatory experience, delving into Nagrin\u2019s personal history and that of the 20th century.\nLee died on June 7, 2007, just 4 days after the premiere, and her Silver Whale Gallery no longer exists.  \nThe film of Behind the Lid is one of the remaining preservations of her work.  It was shot directly after the close of the run, performed solely for the cameras over 2 days, before the sets, puppets and props were permanently struck.  The phantom camera takes you through the performance experience as if you were the sole person seeing it, and also from the perspective of the puppet effigy of Lee.  The film is both an elegy and a unique document of this sensory theatrical event.\nReviews of the original BEHIND THE LID production:\nBen Brantley. NY Times. 6.16.2007\nHelen Shaw. New York Sun. 6.19.2007\n\"Hiroshima\" scene. Photo Credit: Richard Termine\nFrom the film's director: \nBack in July 2007, when my friend Basil Twist approached me to film his and Lee Nagrin's theater piece Behind the Lid, I came to it as most of the audience did - ready for wonder, embracing mystery, and open to the adventure. Due to its limited run and access, I saw the show just once in preparation, but it was indelibly seared in my brain. I never met Lee in this world, but certainly met her in the world she created here with Basil. To describe it more would tell you what to expect or how to feel, and I'd rather you discover that through this film.\nBenevolent and talented colleagues from Basil and Lee's team joined together with my team to preserve art, and make art.  We captured Behind the Lid in marathon sessions, rough and tumble in just 2 days, but with a vision to translate and preserve Basil and Lee's bold and astonishing work to another medium.  Thanks to the generosity of Kodak, we shot on 16mm, in homage to Lee's earlier films.  To me, the textures and colors feel like memory.\nThis is a feature-length film documentary of a narrative performance experience unlike anything else, shot under remarkably limited conditions, driven by creative instinct, adrenaline, and above all, purpose.  Yet, from chaos comes beauty.\nNow, with your care and support, we'll see it finished in 2014. That we may succeed, with your generosity, is cause for reflection and celebration.  Lee is gone.  The sets are gone.  The landscape that nurtures this kind of theater has dwindled.  The end of shooting on film is declared near.  And yet, here we are, with all the spirits and mediums preserved.\nWith this film of Behind the Lid - and your help to finish it - we'll have created a portal and a conduit to the seemingly ephemeral. Trust me, this is to be treasured.\n- Steve Lippman aka Flip.  NYC, 2014\nGOALS and WHY WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT\nThe filming of Behind the Lid took place on July 8th and 9th, 2007.  The shoot was made possible by the generous donations of talent and services behind and in front of the camera.  Any essential financial commitments were covered by private donors, before the advent of outlets like Kickstarter.  \nDuring the shoot, we were usually limited to just 2 or 3 takes of each scene, covered by two 16mm cameras, given our limited supply of film stock.  \nThe exposed 16mm was transferred and archived to HD.  Through additional private donor funding,  the film was then edited on and off over a period of 6 weeks in 2008, covering about 40 minutes of the final estimated 90 minutes.  The film and project has laid dormant since then. \nThe desire to finish the film has always been there, but resources, schedules and the progress of other creative endeavors would push it to \"next year.\"  And of course, there was the question of funding such a specialized work. \nNow, with the outlet of Kickstarter and your help, we can realistically finish the film to the point where it can finally be screened at film festivals, museums, and arts events. \nThe money raised will cover the following:\n\u2022 Editorial\n\u2022 Color correction\n\u2022 Titles/credit design\n\u2022 Additional dialogue recording/dubbing\n\u2022 Sound mix\n\u2022 Screening / archive masters\nAs many of you may know, but worth repeating,  we only are funded if we make our Kickstarter goal.  This is an all or nothing proposition.  We have set our total at the lowest possible to complete our goals.  Finishing with this budget will still require heavily reduced fees, and lots of in-kind favors, but we know we can do it.   \nIf we are lucky enough, thanks to you, to reach and exceed our goal, then rest assured that there's still use for your funding. There's a whole other level to achieve that will enable us to bring the film to an even wider audience than our initial sights.  But first, let's climb this initial plateau.\nThank you for joining us on this journey.\n ABOUT THE ARTISTS\nOriginal Behind the Lid Production Credits: \nCo-Created by Lee Nagrin and Basil Twist \u2022 Directed & Design by Basil Twist \u2022 Costume Design by Sally Ann Parsons \u2022 Lighting Design by Tony Giovanetti \u2022 Projection Design by Daniel Brodie \u2022 Sound Design by Moira MacDonald \u2022 Performed by Basil Twist, Oliver Dalzell, Yvette Edery, Randy Ginsburg, Kirsten Kammermeyer and Jamie Moore.\nPrincipal film production:  Jeremy Kotin, Shane Sigler, David Teague and David Bartolomi.

In June/July of 1982, Whorl was performed at Danspace, St. Mark\u2019s Church, New York. All these works were produced by the Women\u2019s Interart Center. In 1986, Nagrin premiered two works: Bone Orchard and Bird/Bear. The latter won an OBIE Award for Best New American Play. In 1990, Dragon\u2019s Nest was presented at La Mama Annex in association with Women\u2019s Interart Center.  Angels Elegy (1994) premiered at the Silver Whale Gallery. In 1995, a video production of Sky Fish was added to the Museum of Modern Art Film Archive Collection. In 1997, Nagrin directed Pathways by choreographer Margaret Beals, which The Boston Globe included as its \"Best Theatre Works\" of the year. In 2000, The Valley of Iao was presented at La Mama Annex, co-produced by La Mama in association with Dance Street Productions.\nNagrin also performed in the following Karen Malpede\u2019s plays: Blue Heaven (1992) at Theatre for the New City, and a workshop production of Beekeeper\u2019s Daughter (1994-95) in a role wrote for her that toured Italy. In 1995 she performed in Foundry Theatre\u2019s production of Deviant Craft by OBIE Award winning playwright W. David Hancock , at Brooklyn Bridge Anchorage.

It all happened suddenly toward the end, so there was not time to write about stretch goals. A \"stretch goal\" is a new or added goal, beyond the original goal, in the event the project exceeds its funding. In our case, we have a number of people lined up who are ready to pledge, so I want to emphasize that we can still take those additional pledges and that they will continue to advance our cause. Here, then, is our stretch goal.\nFunds beyond our target will go toward a commission. We will approach Johnny Simons with a proposal that he create a new original theatre work that will complement the archived works on our website. The idea is that he will write a piece -- perhaps to be premiered at the Hip Pocket Theatre in 2014 -- that will round out the works that we are digitizing from the early Simons and Balentine years. We will find a way to videotape the performance, using some of the digitizing/editing activities that will be underway at that time. This -- the newest in a long line of Simons originals -- will then cap the website archives, demonstrating the ongoing vitality and creativity of live original theatre in Fort Worth.\nWe hope that we can raise enough in these final countdown hours to award this special commission to Johnny as a special thank you for his prolific output, and as a tribute to Douglas and their very special creative relationship. So please, keep those pledges coming!\nNew pledges from this point may request that donor names be associated with this new commission, as well as with the website itself.\nProject in a Nutshell\nAt the end of this one-year project there will exist a website with 25-30 of Doug and Johnny's shows (video and audio), plus early home-made tapes, garage recordings, and the visual reference material that goes with them. An archive if you will, of the important collaboration between Johnny Simons and Douglas Balentine in those early years of the seventies and eighties at Fort Worth's Hip Pocket Theatre.\nBackground\nMy name is Bruce Balentine, but this project is not about me; it is about my brother, Douglas. I want to preserve his music and see it live again. Doug worked for some 30 years with Johnny Simons\u2014his collaborator, mentor, friend, and soul-brother\u2014producing innova\u00adtive musical theatre in Fort Worth, Texas. Johnny wrote the scripts and lyrics, Doug composed the music. Johnny directed and cho\u00adreographed; Doug played piano, assembled the musicians and rehearsed the singers. In 1977, they and Johnny\u2019s wife Diane founded Hip Pocket Theatre, a Fort Worth institution. You can learn more about them here:\nhttp://www.hippocket.org\nThe theater is still flourishing today, and will be starting its 38th season in June 2014.\nThe image above shows Doug at his keyboard at the original Hip Pocket Theatre on Highway 80 (1979). The theatre moved later to two subsequent sites, but always retained the rustic and improvised texture that is its unique trademark -- as if the theatre and its music grew spontaneously right up from the scrub brush and oak trees on the west side of Fort Worth.\nDouglas died in 2008. He left behind a room full of reel-to-reel and cassette tapes: more than 30 full-length musical theatre pieces, plus albums, songs, half-finished scraps, and the scores, scripts, and printed materials that go with them. Some of the most beautiful music I\u2019ve ever heard lies buried in those tapes; and some of the most moving lyrics, Johnny\u2019s lyrics, are brought alive by Doug\u2019s musical in\u00adterpretation and by the stories and staging captured on the \u00be-inch U-Matic video cassettes filling a second storage room.\n The Problem\nThese old analog tapes are degrading with each passing day that we do not digitize them. I have devoted much of the past four years to converting those tapes into digital form. I al\u00adready have more than 50 hours of material on my hard drives. Digitized music is in the form of 44.1 KHz stereo .wav files, and video is MPEG2. But it is very time-consuming, and I have a full-time job. I am increasingly worried that the material is vanishing faster than I can get to it.\nThe Solution\nWhat\u2019s needed is a professional who is paid to do the digitizing. This professional needs to have the following skills:\nKnowledge of analog tape formats;\nSkill with tape splicing;\nSkill with tape \u201ccooking\u201d;\nAbility to handle NAB hubs and reels; and,\nAbility to edit multimedia (audio & video) files on computer.\nWe have located and lined up those professionals. But it costs money. The first phase of this project involves getting these fragile tapes digitized and secure.\nDoug and Johnny don their tuxedos for picture call in the dance studio (1980)\nDoug and Johnny shortly before Doug\u2019s death (2008)\nPhase I: There are three phases to our plan. The first is by far the most important: digitizing the analog tapes to stop their continued degradation. We have found several firms able to do this work both in San Antonio (where most of the tapes are) and in Fort Worth (where video cassettes are stored). My brother Jim is in San Antonio to supervise the tape work there, and\u2014since the Hip Pocket Theatre is located in Fort Worth\u2014that area holds many long-time aficionados who can help with labeling and indexing. During digitizing, the transfer specialists will set levels and ensure the best copy. They will also encounter old worn-out splices and broken tapes, requiring splicing and other repairs. In some cases they must \u201ccook\u201d the tapes (due to an unfortunate design flaw in a particular brand of Ampex recording tape popular at the time). We have the appropriate tape decks, cooking and splicing equipment and will provide them to the audio company. We will also work closely with them to assist in this digitizing phase.\nHere is a breakdown of the tape collection:\n115 reel-to-reel tapes (7\" and 10.5\")\n165 audio cassettes\n90 video cassettes (VHS)\n75 video cassettes (3/4\" U-Matic)\nThat's 280 audio and 165 video tapes -- a total of 445 tapes representing some 720 hours of material. Many of the tapes will run easily at real-time (for example, it's been my experience doing this in my home studio that most of the cassettes have remained in good shape and experience no problems). Others -- the larger R2R tapes especially -- will exhibit a lot of damage. We'll go from easy to hard to make the early phase produce output quickly. Almost half of the budget is targeted at Phase I based on the expectation that we'll experience problems with about a third of the R2R tapes but little problem with the rest.\nPhase I digitizing will require six months.\nPhase II: Once we have the tapes in digital form, we can distribute the rest of the archiving effort thoughtfully across many people The second phase is for organizing, labeling, tagging, and preparing the material for uploading. Most of this work will be done by me at no cost, but some significant budget is set aside for data entry and cataloguing tasks that must be done by team members associated with the Hip Pocket Theatre. Peggy Bott Kirby is the main person assigned this task. We expect to receive offers of assistance by the many scores of Hip Pocket exes who have enjoyed this remarkable theatre for so many years to help with this effort instead of (or in addition) to their backing pledges, as described in the rewards. Phase II will require six months.\nPhase III: The third phase develops the website and populates it with these materials -- audio, video, and images. Much of the work can be done by website talent already working with the theatre -- for example Robert Bourdage -- who maintains the current hippocket.org website now. But we will need to bring in outside expertise for some of the details associated with content management and copyright protection issues. We have dedicated the rest of the budget to that technical assistance. Phase III will require four months.\nSchedule\nThe phases overlap as shown in the figure above. Phase I will begin with the easy tapes. So we will have several shows ready after two months to begin the indexing and cataloguing effort. Phase I and Phase II then proceed in parallel for the majority of the project, which is scheduled to last exactly one year. By the seventh month, we will have a very large body of material ready, and can then begin the website itself. That development is expected to take four months, during which any difficulties with the digitizing and cataloguing of the \"problem\" tapes can be addressed. In this way, we'll meet our schedule even if an unexpectedly large number of tapes exhibit difficulties.\nThe End Result\nThere are more than 30 full-length musical-theatre productions that represent the Simons and Balentine early years. See the video for the top 14 (approximately 2:30 in the Kickstarter video above). When this project has ended, the website will contain as many of these 30 shows as we can locate and catalogue -- one page per show. Each page will hold the musical selections and any video footage that we have been able to recover, as well as photographs and images of scripts, programs and posters.\nAbove is a wireframe showing one concept for the home page of the website. Design details will be worked out in the early phases with the finished wireframes presented to the web developer for rendering.\nThe wireframe above shows one concept for user-selection -- in this case, material from the early years prior to the founding of Hip Pocket Theatre. Songs from the Christmas albums, \"The Lake Worth Monster\", and Casa Playhouse shows contain many of the concepts that seeded the theatre and its early burst of creative output.\nThe wireframe above shows what one of the show pages might look like. In this case, we have a well-archived show called \"Elder Oaks.\" Along the right, the user can listen to and/or download each song from the show (in mp3 or wav format). In the gray boxes will be promotional materals, a synopsis of the play, and other visual (scanned) material. A scrapbook link and download buttons are placeholders for other materials, which may grow to include scrapbook photos, scripts, cast listings, and a video of the original show performance (if it exists).\nThere will be some 25 or 30 of these pages, depending on how many shows have survived and what kind of condition the tapes are in. We cannot know for sure the exact page count until Phase I is complete.\nI have a detailed project plan showing budgets, timelines, and the technical inventory of all of the tapes. Get in touch with me if you want to see and review it, or if you want to contribute some of your time to assisting in its execution. - Bruce Balentine", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe first and most important part of this project is the digitizing, and there is ample money in the budget to accomplish this. There will be snags -- tapes will break, some material may be lost forever -- but getting it into digital form is the immediate goal. We have lined up several different recovery specialists, and failure by one will lead to hand-offs to another.\n\nThe greatest risk is that we experience more problems than expected with the analog tapes. In severe cases, the plan is to try to locate alternative sources. There are thousands of ex-Hip Pocketeers scattered around the world, and one of them may have the cassette of a show that otherwise is taking too many hours to digitize. This Kickstarter project will have the added value of exposing our predicament to all of those performers, stage hands, audience members, and backers that will now have a central focus -- recovering this material -- and we may receive many tapes from people with whom we've long lost touch. In other cases, we'll have to settle for fragmentary pages -- for example a show that has no audio record other than the original piano rehearsal tape recorded by Doug in his home studio. Making these choices will be the dominant activity by those of us immediately responsible for this project, and, of course, we will keep every one of our backers notified as we discover the state and demands of a given show.\n\nLoss of material by having to ship tapes is another obstacle, so we have selected local specialists for most of this work. We also will deliver the tapes (now secure in air-conditioned storage) in small lots to prevent unexpected loss due to theft, fire, incompetence, or other contingencies.\n\nAfter digitization, there are two major hurdles: first, the material must be annotated, labeled, and organized. Second, the website must be brought up. Much of the former is an act of love (read: no charge) by those who know this material well. But we must pay someone to organize and coordinate the tagging and final labeling, the metadata, cross-referencing, and the uploading. There is money in the budget to accomplish this if we're careful, but the contingency in the event that this task is underestimated is for each of us on this project to chip in the extra that will be required to get everything upload-ready. Luckily, once the material is digitized, this activity will be safer -- we'll be working from copies, and the digital version will not be degrading like the analog tapes are doing.\n\nThe final part is the website, and this requires technical skills (i.e., a webmaster) who can develop an effective and accessible website using content-management software. The domain names are already purchased, but there will be server costs (this is a lot of audio and video) and development costs. All of this is budgeted, but unexpected setbacks could delay the work. In such a case, we plan to go to our backers and ask their indulgence as we bring up a subset of the website -- something that they can see and touch and hear -- while we complete the rest in phases.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Long Time No Chat", "update_content": "Hello, friends and contributors.

New rewards! Announcing our website: IndieVanGameJam.com!\nThe series is about asking a question. Every episode is a question about game design that we think the studio we\u2019re visiting is trying to answer. As we travel to their studio in the Indie Van, we explore the answer to that question ourselves in the form of a game jam.\nA Sample Episode\nFor example, say we travel to BioWare (not an Indie, but a great example!), they usually make games that involve branched storytelling and choices. The question for them might be \u2018is truly consequential branched storytelling actually possible in video games?\u2019 This is a question many folks have asked about game design over the years. Once we have The Question that is right for the studio, we hop in the Indie Van and game jam along the way, trying our hardest to answer the question ourselves. When we arrive at the studio, we interview the developers and ask them The Question \u2013 then we show them the current state of our game jam and see what insights they have. Now, armed with the sage wisdom of the masters, we finish the game jam in the van on the way home and release it with the episode as a digital download. (More on that later.) \nCheck out a video teaser for what kind of talk we talk with someone like Stoic!\nA Series?\nYes, indeed! We want to film an 8 episode series. That means we want to create 8 web episodes, featuring 8 indie developers, spanning 8 different cities, and delivering 8 small game jam games which could range from totally awesome to total trainwreck! These games will be made available for download at the same time the episode airs, so you can join us on the adventure.\nThe series is about the DIY spirit \u2013 start working now! Do it yourself! Just go find the people who are experts and ask them how they got there! You don\u2019t need to wait to be discovered, go out and get it! The series is about travel! We wander through the world seeking out our heroes and trying to meet them at eye level! We explore the world and turn up pockets of awesomeness all over the place! We get travel-weary and car-crazy and grumpy and eat weird local food! We try to become a part of these places we\u2019re visiting, like travelers, not tourists! The series is about Zeb and Chad and our dumb sense of humor! Our own weird perspectives on games and what we think is awesome about them! Our dumb jokes! About how our personalities are both similar and different and the celebration of that!\nGames!\nGames as well! Every episode features us doing a Game Jam that seeks to explore The Question that we are posing to the Indie Sages. As we make our way around North America, we will meet both success and failure in making bite-sized games in numerous styles in a bite-sized amount of time. Whether we win or lose, you can check out the awesome or awesomely bad results for yourself. Right beside each episode will be a way to buy the game from the episode. Since these games can be a gamble, we won't charge more than 99 cents for the awesome ones and the awesomely bad will be free.\nBinary Solo is a two-man indie studio formed by Chad Stewart and Zeb West in Austin, TX. Our mission is simple: Make the games that we would want to play, and play the games that we would want to make. \nChad and Zeb met while working on Star Wars: The Old Republic at BioWare Austin and bonded over a shared desire to charge into the vibrant indie scene which has erupted in North America. With new tools, markets and funding channels available to the masses, and a rebellious dissatisfaction with the increasingly bland games being turned out by large publishers, now is the time to make the game you dreamed about. Chad is programming and president, Zeb is production and design. Together they are on a crusade to stamp out the jive and bring in the love. \nThe Indie game scene is so vibrant right now, with the tools for development and distribution being democratized \u2013 readily available and in the hands of the people! That\u2019s causing some outrageous games to come out as a result of a revolution \u2013 shaking up the games that large publishers have been delivering to gamers, and giving rise to vibrant, experimental new flavors and genres, answering an outcry for something new. We thought it would be fun to get right inside this bustling scene, and show what the indie developers are doing \u2013 how they\u2019re going about things differently, how that \u2018do it yourself\u2019 indie spirit is spawning innovation and creativity. Seeing how a small pack of passionate developers can turn out something better and more interesting than armies of corporate developers who might be so compartmentalized and disenfranchised that they've lost the fire for the games they\u2019re making!\nVideo games are such a young industry it\u2019s easy to forget that the development structure and a publishing model is still being defined! What happens when you put the tools of production in the hands of smart, savvy, hungry creatives who care more about making the games they want, than making the games they think would sell like a blockbuster?  \nThis series will be vital to the next generation of gamers. They will get a window into the pioneers on the indie front. They\u2019ll be inspired by that \u2018do it yourself\u2019 spirit and hopefully make the connection that everything they need is in front of them.

It's an opportunity to share the show with audiences for whom I would never otherwise play, and to meet other theatre artists from all over the world. It's a step toward me learning how to incorporate touring into my repertoire of ways to make a living as a movement theatre artist. \nThe Last Show You'll Ever See is a trombone concert interrupted by the end of the world, which I developed with coaching by Giovanni Fusetti, direction by Elizabeth Baron, and artistic collaboration from the Geniuses. In keeping with the theme of the show, I have made all of the prizes for donating items from an End of the World Preparedness Kit. I would also like to offer all donors free tickets to see the show! This is tricky, because most people I know are not in Canada. But if you are, or if you go there, I'll make sure there's a ticket for you.\n\nClick here to see a trailer I made for the show.\n\nHere's an excerpt from the press release: \"Offbeat humor and virtuosic pantomime ensue as our intrepid trombonist encounters, discovers, and causes scenarios of impending doom. Dinosaurs perish. Empires collapse. Horsemen melt in fiery lakes. The trombone plays on \u2026\"\n\"The Last Show You'll Ever See\" Canada tour general poster.\nIf all goes according to plan, my box office income at these festivals will pay for all the major expenses on the road - travel, marketing, stage manager, eating food, etc. But each festival charges money to be part of it. This kickstarter is to cover the festival entrance fees:\n$661.69 (Saskatoon) + $669.96 (Edmonton) + $519.90 (Victoria) + $708.98 (Vancouver) = $2560.53. \nThank you so much for considering supporting this tour!! Each little donation helps a lot. This is an incredible new adventure for me, and your support means a whole, whole lot. Again, thank you.\nYours in cahoots,\nSarah", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne risk on this adventure is financial. As I said, the plan hinges on me making enough in ticket sales to cover the cost of the tour. It's expensive to drive 2650 miles, to print marketing materials, and to compensate my trusty roadie for 6 weeks of his time. Although I'm scheming various ways to get people to come to the show, I don't know how it will go. But I have four festivals to figure it out, and will be constantly learning and making new schemes ... and my roadie is looking for a dinosaur costume to wear while we're flyering, which I think is a winning tactic. (Who wouldn't take a flyer from a representative of an extinct species?) \n\nAnother, related, challenge is more personal. The fringe festivals are full of lots of shows competing for audience. One has to strategize, and do a lot of promotion. And, honestly, self-promotion is challenging! Preparing for this tour and making this kickstarter has already been a very interesting journey. I'm gearing up for 6 straight weeks of self-promotion, and am excited to learn a ton.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "55 backers pledged $2,610"}, {"Project launches": "JULY 24, 2013"}]}], "comment_no": 0, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1409086316/the-last-show-youll-ever-see-in-canada", "project_name": "'The Last Show You'll Ever See' in Canada!"}}, {"backer": "Amber West", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "What is it?\nIn one wild hour, award-winning solo performer Zeb L.

To coincide with Emory Douglas', the former Minister of Culture for the Black Panther Party, residency in its space, EDELO (En Donde Era La ONU), a creative laboratory, will develop an art exhibition and single-issue newsletter. The exhibition will showcase pieces by local Zapatista artists and will explore their artistic identification with the Zapatista and Black Panther movements; the newsletter will pay homage to Douglas' work in the Black Panthers' popular press and will showcase new articles and artworks that will explore the connections between art and social movements as manifested in today's multifaceted world.\nProject Overview\nAt the peak of its popularity in 1970, 139,000 copies of The Black Panther newsletter were distributed throughout the United States on a weekly basis. Within its pages, Emory Douglas, the movement\u2019s Minister of Culture, published his artworks in an effort to \u201cillustrate[e] conditions that made revolution seem necessary; and... construct a visual mythology of power for people who felt powerless and victimized.\u201d The newsletter and its accompanying illustrations played a central role in the articulation of the \u201cWhat We Want, What We Believe\u201d portion of the Black Panther\u2019s Ten Point Program\nIn 1994, the Zapatista uprising, a Mexican, indigenous movement originating in the southern state of Chiapas, generated and disseminated a different sort of mass communication made possible by the rise of the internet. Photographic, video, and written information regarding the movement\u2019s actions spread around the world in real time, increasing awareness of the Zapatista cause while also building solidarity for what the New York Times termed \u201cthe first post-modern revolution.\u201d Positioning itself as a struggle against neoliberalism waged against 500 years of oppression, Zapatismo has employed new technologies of information distribution in order to articulate their wants, beliefs, and various identities to themselves and to their global audience. \nThe Black Panther and the Zapatista movements occurred in distinct cultural, political, and historical milieus; nonetheless, the two share a common appreciation of the power of the image and the written word to build their respective social movements into personal, collective, transformative, and public experiences. In contrast to the strong self-definition established and disseminated by these two movements via pertinent media channels, today\u2019s multimedia, plugged-in landscape seems to promote the opposite development.\nToday we tweet, text, and browse through myriad contexts, occasionally gaining a glimpse into the exterior world but more frequently losing ourselves in the internet\u2019s echo chamber of opinions and perspectives. ZAPANTERA NEGRA (ZPN) will be a single-run magazine of 20,000 full-color copies that will merge the powerful imagery and layout style of Emory Douglas with the visions and voices of Zapatista painters and embroidery collectives. It will bring the two similar movements together on the page to demonstrate their commonalities, tie the movements to the present, and articulate a new, collaborative, interdisciplinary mode of information distribution and political, social, and economic self-identification.\nEmory Douglas, the former Minister of Culture for the Black Panther Party, will be in residency at EDELO in Chiapas, Mexico in November of 2012. During his time  in Chiapas, he will visit Zapatista communities and work with Zapatista painters while simultaneously guiding a team of artists and editors in the layout and construction of ZPN. The newsletter will also include personal reflections authored by writers, academics, and artists on how art has moved and encouraged their own self-definition, work, and hope in a possible, better world.\nZAPANTERA NEGRA will be distributed in five countries and within select educational, artistic, and political institutions. Its project coordinators hope to develop a grassroots distribution network that will also allow for its dissemination to communities with little access to alternative media. The newsletter will also have a social media platform where \u201cfriends,\u201d \u201cfollowers,\u201d and \u201cfans\u201d will be able to download, print, and wheatpaste the newsletter on overpasses and walkways. The newsletter production and distribution will be paralleled by the production of a collection of tapestries made by Zapatista embroidering communities that merge and exchange Black Panther imagery as articulated by Emory Douglas with that of the Zapatista movement.\nThis work is an attempt to highlight the positive and transformative roles art has played with in social, cultural, and revolutionary movements in promoting the possibilities of imagining other worlds. It is also a project that demonstrates how contemporary art practices side step between the traditionally, political, and conceptual performative works, from the ground up, with in communities of struggle, as opposed to contemporary \"high\" art practices taught by leading art institutions. This is a grass roots effort to bring together two very powerful visual and political social movements of our time. And in times of much revolutionary fever and economic insecurity, we feel it is important to share what Art can and has done to create change and break societies notions of normality.\nTEAM\nEmory Douglas \u2013 Lead Artist \u2013 San Francisco, CA RIGO 23 - Artistic direction \u2013 San Francisco, CA Caleb Duarte \u2013 Project Coordinator - Chiapas MX Grace Remington \u2013 Editor \u2013 Lima Peru Francisco Duarte \u2013 Translation \u2013 Nogales Mexico Mia Eve Rollow \u2013 EDELO Residency Coordinator - Chiapas MX Jose Luis \u2013 Exhibition coordination and Zapatista Painter Chiapas MX Antonio Vazquez\u2013 Painter from the community of Chenalho Chiapas MX.

It's called \"Sorry To Bother You\". \nThis is the best work we've ever done, songwriting and production-wise. I'm very proud of it excited for all of you to hear it. I talk more about the album down further. Here's the thing: I'm tired of having secret albums that come out that most people don't find out about til years later.\nThis time, we're going to hit the road hard and bring this music to the world. We also want to use our music, as has always been the goal, to help build this new movement that is taking the world by storm.\nWe want you to help us buy a tour bus.\nAt the level that The Coup has been at up til now, we either fly in and do one-off dates (rare) or we tour in a van, driving during the day to get to the gig and sleeping in hotels at night.\nHaving to get hotels for the band makes the expenses for a Coup show such that we end up having to skip over, or turn down offers in, many places where we haven't had the chance to build up a following yet. We want to end that practice, and get to all these places.\nIf we have a bus, we'll sleep on the bus and save on hotel rooms- this means will be able to get to many areas we've neglected in the past.\nWith the bus, we'll travel at night, get to towns in the morning and be able to connect with local organizers and be involved in things throughout the day before soundcheck and the show. In this way, we can participate with local campaigns across the US and Canada. This makes touring all the more worth it for me.\nI got into doing music to help build a movement. I love helping with my music via recordings or at the show, but I feel I could do more than that. This bus will free up some time and space for us to combine the touring with organizing in new ways.\nWe're also working with some great, creative folks on taking our show to new levels with set design and integrating some very cool light, visual, and theatrical elements. If you've seen our show, you know that we give it our all- dancing and playing our asses off while leaving our clothes and our audience drenched in sweat.  We plan to make the new show an extension of that ethos.\nIf we had a bus, there's even more we can bring with us- making the show possibilities even crazier.\nWe're not hoping to get a brand new bus- we will buy a used one in good condition. I've been pricing them out and checking them out for years now. Money that we get beyond the price of the bus will be used for the crazy show ideas we have.\nThis album will be coming out on Epitaph Records. They are supplying the new album to me at wholesale price so that I can give the CD and vinyl as rewards on this kickstarter campaign. Many people have had a hard time finding our albums when they are released. Now you can get in early and get the album, while helping us get this bus. The difference between the reward price and the wholesale price will go directly towards buying this bus and taking this show to another level.\nHere's the cover!\nAbout the new album, \"Sorry To Bother You\":\nWe put our souls on this album. Every album I make is somewhat different than the last. This album was produced through a collaboration of me and my good friend Damion Gallegos. We had fun making crazy sounds with organic, electric, and electronic toys, culminating in something that sounds like an aggressive, danceable, punk/funk raptacular explosion. It's as if Rick James, The Pixies, Ohio Players, The Clash, Salman Rushdie, Richard Pryor, and me went in the studio drunk off Sailor Jerry Rum (don't do it) and made a baby named \"Sorry To Bother You\".\nWe collaborated with Das Racist, Killer Mike, Anti-Flag, Jolie Holland, Japanther, Vernon Reid, Joe Henry, Eric McFadden, Gabby La La, Emily Jane, Bhi Bhiman, Jazz Mafia Horns, and The Classical Revolution.\nThis album is the soundtrack to a movie I wrote.\nThe movie is dark comedy with magical realism, inspired by my time as a telemarketer. It's also called \"Sorry To Bother You\". It is being directed by Alex Rivera (Sleep Dealer), and produced by Ted Hope (21 Grams, The Ice Storm, American Splendor). It's gonna be fucking crazy. The movie won't come out until 2013.\n\nVinyl Fiends:\nThe vinyl of the album is double vinyl, playable at 45rpm, and comes with the CD packaged inside.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Missing addresses, voicemail, and books.", "update_content": "We did it!\nWe made our goal, now we'll be rolling through your town in our tour bus!\nWe are so damned excited about this.

During a yearlong recovery from a serious health issue, I had time to reflect on the goals for my company, and now finally, renewed and energized, I'm overjoyed to announce our third season presenting two exciting premieres: Let\u2019s Pretend We\u2019re All Wearing Sunglasses and Bloom. The company tours to Chicago for two performances at the Ruth Page Performing Arts Center, September 14-15, and returns to New York City a week later for two performances at the Manhattan Movement Arts Center, September 21-22. That's only four shows for the entire year. So please do save the dates and come see us! \nWE\u2019RE ILLUMINATING THE SUBCONSCIOUS\nLet's Pretend We're All Wearing Sunglasses confronts the theme of human desensitization through the exploration of varied topical issues including the abuse of women, environmental dilemmas, and legalized dog fighting. The inspiration for the dance evolved after viewing The Stoning of Soraya M., a true account of an Iranian woman falsely accused of adultery. I found the story so moving that it prompted me to reflect on other atrocities happening to women around the world, which further prompted me to consider other marginalized groups. The work includes spoken text developed in collaboration with the company's nine dancers during the creation process. The dancers and I discussed issues that were important to them. We introduced these ideas and emotions through movement and voice into the dance. In this instance I believe incorporating spoken word gives voice to the more commonly voiceless dancer and contributes additional humanness to Let's Pretend We're All Wearing Sunglasses. Up-and-coming composer M. Anthony Reimer, whose compositions for theater and concert hall often mix electronic, traditional and collected sounds forming layered soundscapes, created the original score.\nIn creating Bloom, a mystical contemporary work danced barefoot and en pointe, I explored the theme of betrayal from both religious and secular contexts, juxtaposing heterosexual and homosexual couplings and book-ended by a modern take on a court dance. Bloom is set to the sweeping \"Summa for Strings,\" and the \"Strings and Cello\" and \"Cello and Piano\" versions of Arvo Pa\u0308rt\u2019s Fratres'. Happenings, relationships, and references to blame, need, and prejudice bloom and fade like cloud formations, and the work is full of round and thick movement weighted by gesture. \nWE\u2019RE FIERCE\nThis season\u2019s Collective consists of nine truly magnificent dancers from Columbia, Chicago, Denver, Italy, New York, and San Francisco. Our 2012 company includes former Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater star Clifton Brown, and the return of Giorgia Bovo \u2013 a critics and audience favorite. Also returning is costume designer Karen Young, of Lady Gaga\u2019s Monster Ball tour and Matthew Barney\u2019s films Cremaster 1 and 5. You will not want to miss these gifted artists who bring freshness to the new work. \nThe 2012 Collective Body Dance Lab dancers are Giorgia Bovo, Clifton Brown, Amy Fogarty, Adam Gauzza, Cristian Laverde Koenig, Kathleen Leigh, Amy Miller, Micah Savin, and Shannon Nash Spicer.\nLighting Designer: Brandon Wardell\nVideographer: Adam Boyer\nWE\u2019RE ASKING YOU TO JOIN US\nOur goal is to raise $10,000 to cover part of the artists' fees. As public funding and grants such as the NEA diminish their support levels all arts organizations in the U.S. depend on corporate sponsorship and private funding to meet their financial goals. It is with the understanding and consideration of these fiscal realities that I humbly ask your help in donating to COLLECTIVE BODY | DANCELAB.\nWE\u2019RE EXCITED TO SEE YOU\nPlease save the date for our upcoming premieres!

Imagine a nationwide flowering of spectacle puppet theater joyously spreading a new public consciousness!!\nGreetings from Liberty Square!\nI am part of the Arts & Culture working group at Occupy Wall Street, and we have begun plans for some puppets for the halloween parade (and marches/parades afterwards) as part of OccupyHalloween.  The puppets we are trying to make include a giant bull puppet that will battle Lady Liberty (Who has already been built), a horde of corporate vampires, and a 40 foot long Chinese dragon style Brooklyn Bridge puppet with puppet protestors on the top of it.\nOur biggest need right now is some studio space to build these puppets, so if you know of anywhere in manhattan or not too far away in Brooklyn that would be willing to donate studio & storage space, that would be the most important thing to let me know about (just message me).\nThe original budget stood around $1790 for these puppets (with free labor from nyc puppet artists), but Halloween is coming up so we have shortened our fundraising goal to $500 in 1 week.  It's ambitious, and we didn't want to risk not getting any of the money by shooting for more than that.  So by all means help us get to $500, but if we can push beyond that it will help a lot!\nIf we raise enough money, we may be able to rent studio space for this project.  \nDepending on the amount we raise, we are also looking to invest in equipment to document the process and communicate how to build large puppets to other occupations around the country.\nAlso, we are looking for donations of the following materials:\n1) rods (lightweight long broom handles with screw tops are great, but \n1\" or bigger dowels that are 4 feet or longer.  also long bamboo pieces \ncould work)  \n2) Paint (lemme know what you have lying around!  \n3) Burlap -does anyone know how I can get this cheap/free?

The piece is based on an August Strindberg play, A Dream Play, but has been rewritten to create an original piece of experimental theater.  It uses masks, rod puppets both small and gigantic, toy theater puppets, and hand puppets.  It also has a Suzuki-trained chorus of 8 puppeteers who play Strindberg's creative demons throughout the show.  It was the culmination of a year and a half of research, design, and collaboration.  It was first workshopped at the National Puppetry Conference at the Eugene O'neill Theater and then premiered at The Connecticut Repertory Theater in April of 2011 and sold out every show in its two week run.\nDREAMPLAY AT THE FRINGE\nAs we went into rehearsals at the end of January, I submitted the show to The New York International Fringe Festival.  I recently received word that it was accepted.  Now with another opportunity to continue the development of the play I am in the process of rewriting the script, redesigning puppet elements, and reworking the whole piece. \nHOW YOU CAN HELP\nI have a fabulous team of designers who have donated their time and talents to work on the piece for free .  I also have a wonderful cast of puppeteers and actors who are willing to rehearse and perform for free.  However, even with dozens of people donating their time, there are still large costs in bringing a show of this size to New York City.  Money that is donated to this project will be spent on materials to build new puppets and costumes for the new mounting, transportation & storage of the many large puppets and masks, a composer, housing for the 18 person cast & crew, and publicity (so people actually come and see the show).\n$2000 to bring 18 people and a puppet show to New York is a very small amount!  It is the absolute lowest amount we can do it for and it means 18 people are paying for their own transportation, sleeping on friends' couches, and paying for their own food and all other expenses while in New York.  Raising 200% of our goal would mean some of those costs could be covered.  Raising more would help ease the personal costs of bringing 18 starving artists to perform for 2 weeks in New York that much more!\nVIDEO\nHere's a video of the original production at Connecticut Repertory Theatre:\nIMAGES\nHere are some images from the original production at CRT:\n\"Clockwork angel puppets crowning The Lawyer.\"  Photo by Gerry Goldstein.\n\"The Schoolmaster teaching The Officer and his students.\" Photo by Veseth R.

I'll also be working with Karen Young\u2014design team member to Lady Gaga and Matthew Barney, and the evening will feature composers as diverse as Michael Van Der Aa, Abbey Lincoln, Heiner Goebbels, Me'Shell Ndeg\u00e9ocello, Sean Hagerty, and Bang on a Can artist, Julia Wolfe.\nMy work ventures from Broadway-type audience pleasers to pyrotechnical, non-linear, asymmetrical feats to imagistic, sculptural contemplations on the great themes. SUNRISE IN THE QUANTUM REALM embodies all of those elements in a 50-minute meditation on shadow and light, and is a query into how humans might behave were they to mimic the way molecules interact in the quantum. The work explores various states of existence\u2014physical, emotional, and psychological\u2014tackling the unevenness of human experience. The dancers' movements suggest a duplicity of meaning as the stark, galactic darkness of the set is slowly peeled away to reveal a white, spacious environment; similar to how we perceive objects to be solid when at the molecular level there is hardly any solid matter at all.\nThe company will also be performing an extended version of last year\u2019s LONELY HOUSE, a 15-minute duet symbolizing the arc of a relationship, from the sublime corporeal to existential isolation.\nI've set the Kickstarter goal for this project very low in order to make sure that we actually receive the funds, but the project will take upwards of $25,000 to complete.

We explore traditional popular theater and puppet forms to make shows reflecting contemporary life. Toy Theater is a medium we discovered in 1990 with a news-based series using images cut from daily newspapers. We connected strongly with the form, and have been creating original Toy Theater shows, teaching Toy Theater to people of all ages, and inspiring both performing and visual artists to do their own Toy Theater experimentations. We strive to replace the ubiquitous box which has taken over every living room in the U.S. with a do-it-yourself storytelling box that has its origins in the Victorian parlor.\nUsing flat, paper cut-out figures and miniature scenery, Toy Theater (also known as \u201cpaper theater\u201d and \u201cmodel theater\u201d) originated with 19th-century advances in printing and engraving. The original toy theaters of Europe were complete dramas modeled on stage hits of the day, do-it-yourself home entertainment kits containing scripts, characters, and scenery between the covers of a printed book, available from a specialty shop like those of Pollock, Webb, or Skelt in London, Schreiber in Germany, Seix i Barral in Barcelona, Jacobsen in Denmark, or Scott and McLoughlin in New York.\nDuring the countdown to the first Gulf War in 1990, members of GREAT SMALL WORKS, inspired by Walter Benjamin's notion of a culture in a permanent \u201cstate of emergency,\u201d began performing a surreal serial drama using excerpted texts and images quickly cut from the daily newspapers in response to the banal terror of the mass media. This began our interest in reinventing the 19th century form with miniature versions of classic plays and original adaptations, sparking what has become a full-scale Toy Theater revival movement.\nNow we are embarking on our Ninth International Toy Theater Festival, taking place at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York, May 30th through June 13th. We need financial help so we can mount an extensive exhibition of new and historic Toy Theaters, and present two weeks of performances by artists from all over the world and all around the neighborhood. Programming aims to juxtapose the traditional with the contemporary, and inspire the public to do it themselves.\nArtists from Finland, Mexico, Spain, Canada, California, Washington, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Vermont, as well as Bedford-Stuyvesant (Brooklyn), Corona (Queens), Staten Island and the East Village (Manhattan) fill St. Ann's Warehouse with their interpretations of this accessible, and highly expansive, form. The festival includes performances for adult audiences, performances for family audiences, a workshop for all ages, two symposia, as well as the Temporary Toy Theater Museum which is open free to the public.

Printing limited edition 12\" vinyl, download-cards, and special Puppet Packages for our backers. If you need no more convincing, press that green button to your right. Otherwise read on for our full plan!\n----\nThe Folk Opera is a continuous piece of story-telling music. It uses the Operatic influence to draw out themes hyperbolically (tragedy strikes quick and deep! and love sprouts wings at first sight!) while nestled comfortably in the Americana Folk music form. It is a story of loss (of memory, time, places and people) that rocks between a caricatured portraiture of small-town life and the tragic effects of time's fickle transience.\nHere's the thing. The Folk Opera might not be done yet. There might be more songs to write, and further orchestration to compose. But what it is now is magic. We want to capture its sweet simplicity, stripped down. And we want to make this the First Edition - \u00e1 la Whitman's Leaves of Grass - and make it something really special for you.\n\nHere's what we've come up with (in a timeline):\n\n30 days after we reach our goal: We will have recorded the entire piece live in the Tower* living room. This means we'll record it as one piece - with mics set up all around the room and the whole cast sitting together - and cut it up into separate tracks later. By doing this we think we'll really grab the magic of listening at the feet of the players. The piece will then move on to the mixing and mastering process.\nThe finished tracks will get sent off for a limited edition short pressing of 200 12\" vinyls (yes, that means actual records). They will also get sent off for a run of 1,000 download-cards. (See explanation on why we chose to do this vs printing CDs below.)\n\n45-60 days after we reach our goal: While we wait for the products to come back, we'll make available the \"First Listen\" streaming site for all our backers, and host the exclusive Listening Party at the Tower for those who give $50 or more.\nWhen we get the vinyl + download cards from the printers, we'll mail them to you, along with your very own Puppet Package! WHAT'S THE PUPPET PACKAGE??!!!???!!!! You might ask. Well, this will include paper cutouts of all the major Folk Opera characters and scenic backdrops, along with a manuscript of the Folk Opera itself so that you can put on your own little paper puppet version of the Folk Opera just by adding some popsicle sticks!\n\n90 days after the end of the campaign: We'll host our official album release party & show!\n\nHere's our anticipated budget:\n\n$2,000 - Engineering, mixing, mastering\n$2,000 - 200 12\" vinyl records\n$600 - 1,000 download-cards\n$500 - Design of packaging for vinyl, cards and puppets\n$500 - Production of puppet packages & manuscript\n$400 - Miscellaneous unanticipated expenses\n$300 - 5% Kickstarter Fee\n---------\n$6,300.00 Total\nWe know that it takes a community to raise a child, and this truly is our child. We most graciously ask your assistance at whatever level you're able and are humbled in advance by your generosity.\nLove to you!\nAnnie Bacon\nElizabeth Greenblatt\nJoel Dean Stockdill\nSavannah Jo Lack\nhttp://anniebacon.me\n\n* The Tower is Annie's home (with Jeremy)\n** Why we chose vinyl + download cards vs CDs: We know that most people do not have record players anymore. But we also think CDs have not been able to replicate the amazing listening experience you get from records. Most CDs these days get uploaded to a computer and the packaging thrown out. We figure, why waste all that packaging? Download-cards get the music to you in as good or better digital form without the waste; they are the size of a credit card, each with a unique code that allows you to download the entire album from a designated site. If you want it on a CD - say to listen to in your car - you'll be able to burn it from your computer onto a disc. For those of you who DO still have record players . . . this decision needs no explanation. All vinyl will be accompanied by a download-card as well, so you'll have it in both formats.\n*** Photo by June Moon - Video medley by Iris Clearwater - (Thank you both!!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "The Folk Opera live & a new Kickstarter", "update_content": "Hello friends! \nIt may have been a long time since you've heard from me ... this Kickstarter is all neatly packed up and closed ... but I wanted to share an exciting bit of news about the Folk Opera: (if you haven't heard already) it is being adapted as a verse puppet play (a puppet show!) for the Puppets and Poets festival at the Obie-winning off-off broadway Bushwick Starr theatre in Brooklyn, New York  ...
