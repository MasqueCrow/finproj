[{"backer": "Daniel Johnson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Return to the world of Root with The Marauder Expansion. Raze the Woodland to the ground as the fearsome Lord of the Hundreds, or recover precious relics from this destructive conflict as the Keepers in Iron. Explore dozens of faction combinations, including many new head-to-head matchups with the hirelings and advanced setup cards. New and experienced players have never had so many ways to enjoy Root!\nThe Keepers in Iron are an order of itinerant warriors who have come to the Woodland to recover ancient relics. To find them, they must manage their Woodland contacts carefully, as only the local animals know how to find the relics they seek. Paragons of discipline, their warriors sport pristine armor of a quality rarely seen here, making them a terror in battle. However, to keep their forces well-supplied and mobile, they must maintain a network of caravans and waystations.\nClaiming to be the true voice of the Woodland, the Lord of the Hundreds spreads distrust and division among its inhabitants, inciting torch-wielding mobs to destroy the enemies of their righteous dominion. His swarming army can overwhelm all but the toughest defense. By looting items from the undeserving and adding them to his towering hoard, his power grows as he develops an increasingly fearsome monomania.\nRoot's hirelings lend their services to factions willing to pay the price. Court the Marquise's infamous Forest Patrol or sway the rampaging Last Dynasty from the Eyrie to join your cause. Whether you are playing with two players or six, the hirelings are sure to offer you exciting new ways to play Root. \nDiscover new corners of the world of Root.  Fight for control of the cosmopolitan Free City of Root or attempt to secure influence over the Black Market. Build buildings among the Elder Treetops or secure the Legendary Forge. Each landmark offers players new strategic challenges and tactical possibilities. Best of all, they work with each of Root's four maps!\nWith your support in 2019, the Underworld Kickstarter brought Root to more players than ever before. In the years since the game\u2019s release, Root continues to enjoy a vibrant and welcoming community of old and new players alike.\nAt Leder Games, we are deeply grateful for this community. Because of you all, we can keep food on our tables and the lights on at the office. You also give us space to take risks and develop new games. And, perhaps best of all, your support means that we can continue exploring the world of Root!\nRoot: The Marauder Expansion is the next chapter in the series. The expansion offers two new factions: the Lord of the Hundreds and the Keepers in Iron. Both factions are designed to work seamlessly with all previous factions and provide players with unique gameplay challenges and the dramatic, narrative-first asymmetry that has become a hallmark of Root\u2019s design.\nThe expansion also introduces the hireling system. This is a gameplay option that can be used at any player count and faction mix. Hirelings are perfect for folks wanting the experience of Root as a two-player contest or who want to inject their multiplayer games with even more combos and color from the game\u2019s wider world.\nRoot is a fully asymmetric strategy board game designed by Cole Wehrle, lavishly illustrated by Kyle Ferrin, and brought to life by the team at Leder Games. Stalk the woods as one of the Vagabonds, seize the initiative with the Eyrie birds of prey, rule over your subjects as the Marquise de Cat, or command the Woodland Alliance to create a new order. In Root, the players drive the narrative, and the differences among the roles create unparalleled interaction and replayability.    \nTo understand how Root integrates with all of our products in this campaign, as well as our current existing expansions, please refer to our New to Root Chart.\nRoot is currently in-stock and available on our webstore for most regions. (For North American backers, we have a pre-order open for late Spring delivery.) If you want to obtain a copy as fast as possible, check with your Friendly Local Game Store or consider ordering from our site. For other expansions and products, you can order directly from our webstore or visit your neighborhood game seller. We will not offer an \u201cAll-In\u201d pledge, or include previous releases as add-ons for this campaign. \nAt Leder Games, we are committed to sharing our design process openly. As with campaigns in the past, we'll be releasing preview kits both as print-and-play files and mods for Tabletop Simulator. The first kit will be released on Thursday the 25th, and the second will arrive on the week following. \nClick here to download the preview kit!\n\nIf you are looking for players, you can find a huge community over on Leder Games' official Discord channel, the Woodland Warriors. \nShipping will be charged post-campaign in Backerkit.\n\nCustoms and Duty-Free Shipping\nLeder Games will pre-pay the duties and taxes for the backers who receive their games in the US, EU, Canada, and Australia. All other countries or regions may be subject to additional customs fees upon delivery.\n\nFor our UK friends: At this time the UK has not provided a mechanism that will allow this type of pre-payment for crowdfunded projects fulfilling after June 2021. We are working with our VAT agency to find a solution, but at this time there is not one available. It is likely that by the time we\u2019re making plans for fulfillment there will not be additional VAT, but we cannot promise this with the ongoing legislation changes. We are keeping a close eye on developments, and will provide updates as we are able during the campaign and leading up to fulfillment. We assure you we wish Brexit had less effect, but alas here we are.\nCountries we cannot ship to: Afghanistan, Congo, Ivory Coast, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Liberia, Libya, Myanmar, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan,  and Syria.

If we raise enough funds on Kickstarter, we will make sure that you get your games. \n\nThat said, the global pandemic has put stress on supply chains everywhere.

TVs aren\u2019t always convenient so we made a way to take console gaming with you wherever you are without the need of an internet connection.       \n\n\n\nAs lifelong console gamers, we know there may be some PC master race gamers who gawk at the idea of playing Mario on their powerful gaming computer.  But we say the more games we can play, on even more platforms, the better! \nSeamless console docking to your laptop. It's that simple!\nLaptops are Really Versatile Screens\nThe biggest benefit of course is to take advantage of the screen you\u2019re always carrying already.  Not one of those additional portable monitors but a laptop that we use daily for like\u2026 school, work, shopping and creative stuff. \nShadowCast completely hides in the shadows of the original Switch dock!\nLet's imagine a time before 2020... and you were waiting at an airport for a flight to board and you wanted to get a couple rounds of Smash Bros in with a friend\u2026 or two\u2026 or three. Tabletop mode is nice\u2026 but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the most ergonomic. With ShadowCast you can easily plug your Nintendo Switch to your laptop and play on a screen over 4x the size.\nNot quite as easy as adjusting the viewing angle of a laptop, is it?\nYou Could Always use Another TV\nThere's also many situations where there just isn\u2019t a HDMI display available - many of us are happy with our laptops and integrated desktop computers. I think back to the times when I lived in a dorm room or even living abroad for brief periods where having my laptop, a PS5, and a ShadowCast would\u2019ve been amazing. \nWorks with current-gen and next-gen with up to 4K input\nAnd then there\u2019s always competing for the living room television - whether it\u2019s someone in your household streaming a whole season of the latest Netflix series or just having another gamer in the household. Oh and it also makes having a second television for multiplayer that much more convenient to set up. \nPS5 on an iMac - when a TV just simply isn't available\nOur App Makes the Difference\nAccompanying the ShadowCast is our new Genki Arcade app. We literally have made it easier than reaching for the TV remote and hitting the \"input\" button. We've designed Genki Arcade from the ground up to minimize computing resources and prioritize latency for gaming performance. Just open the app, and it'll auto detect ShadowCast and you'll be playing immediately without any settings to fiddle with.\nTV vs. ShadowCast - HDMI splitter shows a 0-0.02s difference in Smash Bros.\nGenki Arcade (left) is 50ms faster than OBS (right) and uses less than 1/3 of the CPU\nWe've developed a native Mac OS app that's optimized for both Apple Silicon and Intel processors as well as a dedicated app for Windows. Additionally, we're in the process of making a web browser version that allows you to play on shared/public computers and other systems without installing any software (compatibility will vary, for example iPadOS currently doesn\u2019t detect external video devices but we\u2019re confident it will someday!).\nWindows or Mac, we got your Animal Crossing addiction covered\n The beauty of being able to connect your gaming console to your computer means you can actually record, edit, and stream your gameplay. While it may not be at the same level as a professional grade capture card that costs 5-10x more, it\u2019s more than capable for most gameplay capturing needs while being much more flexible and easy to use across multiple platforms. \nWe're making last year's best capture cards feel a bit outdated.\nRecord To Your Heart\u2019s Content\nSure you can use the built-in video recording feature on the Nintendo Switch but that\u2019s limited to 30 seconds - that mean you'll have to rush that epic boss fight or finish that speed-run extra fast.  It's is also a pain to export and you\u2019re limited by an already small internal storage and expensive memory cards. With ShadowCast you don't have to worry about recording length and can rewatch your whole session of Among Us, add your commentary, and refine your strategy.\nWith a 30 second limit everyone is sus!\nWe\u2019ve actually created what we believe is the most simple to use, not just for playing but also to record gameplay videos.  Here\u2019s a sample of a recording of us playing on various consoles with the ShadowCast: \nThese videos are screen recordings of gameplay played off an early build of our dedicated Genki Arcade app.\nPlays Nice with Others \nWe made the Genki Arcade app to be truly simple to use, but for those that need more complexity you\u2019ll be happy to know that ShadowCast is compatible with popular professional capture card applications such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, and much more. This will allow you to capture video with detailed customizations and even overlay various webcam feeds, graphics, and animations.\nIt's pretty much compatible with everything you throw at it\n\nBegin Your Career as an Influencer\nUltimately the main reason for anyone to capture video is so that they can share it with the world. ShadowCast can easily upload your previously recorded or edited videos and even stream live to your favorite platform - whether your team Twitch, YouTube, or FaceBook, we got you covered.  \nTo maximize compatibility across as many platforms as possible, we\u2019ve disguised ShadowCast as a webcam so that it can do a few more party tricks. This means it can actually be selected as a webcam under many typical apps popular today thanks to all the remote working, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and FaceTime - and further even supports video players like QuickTime and VLC if you don\u2019t have our app installed.\nVideo Chat Your Gameplay\nThis allows you to not only share your gameplay live with anyone, but you can actually play with your friends and see them on split screen just as if you were playing in couch co-op mode in-person.\nYou can play any of your favorite games in split-screen even without being on a couch\nDon\u2019t Settle for a Weak Webcam\nAs an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. \nKickstarter compresses these images, but hopefully you get the idea!\nThe Perfect Stay-at-Home Camera Assistant\nIt\u2019s also quite useful for situations where you just need to see what you're photographing or recording on a bigger laptop screen - no need for expensive wireless monitors! \nA better view of your DSLR in real-time so you can skip the expensive screen monitor\nWe actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.\nMight as well make it as small as possible right?\nHere's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:\nPLAY\n\nSetup ShadowCast in 3 simple steps!\nIf you need a more visual adventure we've prepared a short video showing the 3 simple steps in real-time to setup ShadowCast.\nPLAY\n\nThis is really, really small\nDimensions are 25 x 52 x 9mm or 0.98\" x 2.1\" x 0.35\"\nWeighs just 10 grams (latest prototype)\nHDMI 2.0 input brings in 4K video from the latest game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4/5, and XBox Series S/X\nUSB-C output transfers to computer up to 1920x1080 @ 60fps\nGenki Arcade app requires macOS 10.12+ or Windows 7+\nIncludes USB-C 2.0 Cable 1.8m long cable\n\n\n Get more ShadowCasts if you wanted various colors or one for every console:\nGet a Covert Dock, a pocketable dock and GaN charger for the Switch and more:\nGet a Genki Audio, connects 2 Bluetooth headphones to your Switch (and other consoles) works docked, and has a port to charge your Switch:\nGet a Genki Audio Lite, a slimmer portable Bluetooth audio adapter that is optimized for the Switch and Switch Lite (does not fit PS5): \nGet a Force Field Lite, a dual magnetic enclosure grip case with vegan leather to protect your Switch Lite with compatibility for both Genki Audio and Audio Lite: \nIf you're in need of a flexible HDMI, premium USB-C 3.1 cable, or portable metal stand: \nGenki was a brand founded by three guys with a dream to challenge the gaming accessory industry to make more compelling hardware.

Your body will naturally tell you when it\u2019s time to switch positions.\n\nThen, all you have to do is listen to it. BeYou does the rest. Simply adjust and in only a few seconds, the possibilities are endless!\nWith your BeYou transforming chair, you can do waaay more than just sit.\nYou\u2019re free to work on your laptop, play on your phone, lounge to relax, take a zen moment to yourself, do a few yoga poses and even take a power nap.  \nBeYou is more thoughtful than a glass of wine on a bad day and more versatile than a Swiss army knife. \nYour BeYou comes with... wings. Yeah, for real. Kinda \ud83d\ude09 They support you no matter how you choose to sit. They are plush and comfy like grandpa's favourite armchair, yet look super sleek and modern.\nThey\u2019re incredibly easy to adjust. It only takes one click! And you can do it all while sitting down. Put them all the way up, open them flat or anything in between. Whatever works for you.\nEach wing can be set in 5 positions. Use them as armrests, backrest, support for your knees, the perfect place to put up your feet or even as yoga blocks.\nThe adjustable backrest lets you slide it up and down so you get additional back support, even for taller people. Plus, this lets you adjust the height when you're using it as a seat or table.\nThe backrest adjusts in all the right places to make sure BeYou feels like home. Move it backwards or forwards, up or down and even tilt it slightly.\nBut this is so much more than a backrest. When horizontal, it unlocks a whole new list of ways you can sit, relax or work on your BeYou. \nUse it as a laptop stand or a table that\u2019s perfect for your lunch. Or what might be the world's comfiest elbow pad. It fits under your desk and makes typing on your keyboard much easier.\nNo, we\u2019re not done. You can use the backrest as a seat and finally sit comfortably with your legs crossed in a chair made for you. Rest your knees or feet on the seat and play around to find what feels good.\nWith so many of us working remotely now, you can trust that BeYou is perfect for your home or office setup.\nThe minimalist and timeless design looks great in any room. BeYou transforms to help you sit better no matter if you\u2019re working or relaxing... or both.\nWhen you can change your position easily so you feel more comfortable, your level of focus and productivity skyrockets. \nAt home, you can relax and put your feet up, take a moment to unwind and meditate or simply sit comfortably while watching a movie.\nBeYou is also perfectly tailored for your home office. Now you don\u2019t have to move from the couch to the bed then to the floor, trying to find the perfect work spot.\nTo stay focused and productive, it's best to stick to a dedicated work space in your home. But you don't have to stick to one position. With BeYou, you can sit however you want.\nBeYou fits under your desk no matter how you like to sit: lounge, cross legged and even backwards.\nYour chair is made with top quality oak veneer. This makes your BeYou very strong, stable and durable.\nBecause mother nature is part of the BeYou, we are committed to do our part for mother nature. That's why we will plant 1 tree for every chair sold.\n\nThe custom built quick release hinges are at the heart of BeYou\u2019s design. They\u2019re super easy to use and help you transform your chair in a matter of seconds.\nBums and backs around the world will be thrilled to sit on BeYou\u2019s extra comfortable high-quality foam cushions.\nWe made BeYou so you can use it for years to come. That's why we use a special cushion fabric that\u2019s stain resistant and withstands wear and tear exceptionally well.\nBeYou comes with a wide base and heavy duty auto-locking wheels that adapt to your weight placed on the chair. \nWhen you\u2019re sitting down, it\u2019s easy to move around with just a push of your legs. When you get up to get a coffee, the chair stays put because the wheels automatically lock in place.\nThe wheels work great on both carpet and hard surfaces. And you can use the wheels or the fixed casters (included in your package).\nThe BeYou wheel base is up to 40% wider than traditional chairs. Plus, we shifted the piston 4x further back compared to traditional chairs, which also shifts its centre of gravity, giving it excellent stability. \nThat way, you can rely on the base and backrest to support you without compromise, even when using the backrest as a seat in the highest positions. \n\nYou probably googled \"ergonomic\" at some point. But do you actually know what it means? \nIt's actually pretty simple. It's something designed for efficiency and comfort in a working environment. BeYou easily checks all the boxes, which is why it's a truly ergonomic chair made for how you sit. \nWhen you're sitting for long hours every day, back pain is quite common. Because on BeYou it's so easy to change positions, you get a lot of variety. You're not forced to sit in one position, so there's no more stiffness.\nBeYou's special backrest is a natural prompt for you to stay mindful of your posture. It's a great reminder to sit up straight on your own, without leaning back on a backrest that usually prompts us to slouch a little bit in our chairs.\nAnd for those intense deep work sessions when you need the perfect support, the curved cushions frame your body better and the backrest goes up as high as 43cm / 16.9\".\nWe believe your peace of mind is important. BeYou comes with a 1 year warranty, so you can focus on making the most of it and discovering your favourite positions. \nWatch The Video!\nBeYou is all about helping you sit however it feels good to be you. The need to keep changing positions is natural. With BeYou, you can enjoy the benefits of movement even when you\u2019re sitting.\nWe can\u2019t promise you won\u2019t get addicted to BeYou\u2026 but we can assure you you\u2019ll love every second of it!   \n\n\nHow are we able to offer BeYou at such a competitive price? We cut out all the middlemen that inflate traditional retail prices, so we can bring you BeYou at the best possible rate. \ud83d\udc4d\n Packaging dimensions: 100 x 49 x 27 cm (39.4\u201d x 19.3\u201d x 10.6\u201d in)  \nWe are doing our best to cover duties and taxes for all countries we ship to, however there might be some regions where this is not possible. We'll keep you posted through our campaign updates.\nShipping fees will be collected after the campaign ends, on the pledge management platform we'll be using. Please check out our FAQs for more information. \n\n Weight: 25kg (55 pounds)\n   Supports up to: 181 kg (400 pounds) on the main seat. For the sitting positions where you use the backrest as a seat, we\u2019ve tested it so far to 125 kg (275 pounds).\n  BeYou Unboxing & Assembly Video\nYou can put together your BeYou chair in under 20 minutes \ud83d\ude0a with a screwdriver and a hex / Allen key (included in the package). \nA lot goes into making a stunning piece of functional furniture \ud83d\ude0a \nBeYou is built by a group of friends with decades of experience in sitting. We sit in an office, we sit working from home, we sit down to relax, we sit while eating. But despite our years of experience, we suck at it.\nMeet The Team \ud83d\ude01\nJennifer is a fidgeter, always looking for the next (weird) spot she can sit in. David is the super focused type that converts into a statue for hours, then struggles to un-stiff himself (easier said than done!). Kate can only sit cross legged, so she always ends up sitting on the floor. Macey is a yoga addict who does yoga poses day and night. Mark randomly squats cause that\u2019s what feels comfortable to him. And Phil\u2019s just using every possible moment to chill, he sleeps anytime, anywhezzzzzzzzzzz.\nSo we wanted to do better for ourselves... and for you. BeYou is the only chair that solved our different problems and transformed all our lives. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTaking an idea and bringing it to life is a complex process and we\u2019ve learned so much about it in the past year. \n\nWe know there might always be challenges when creating a new product, but we\u2019ve done our best to minimise them. The suppliers and factories we are working with have dozens of years of experience.\n\nWe\u2019ve already iterated 9 versions of the BeYou chair and we\u2019ve been using & loving 5 fully functional prototypes for the past few months. We\u2019re bringing BeYou to Kickstarter because we are confident that we can deliver on the project to all our backers.\n\nThe only challenge is bringing BeYou to a larger audience, which is where you come in. Because of your support here on Kickstarter, we can be sure that you\u2019ll always be free to\u2026 be you.\n\nGlobal shipping and logistics is mind-boggling, which is why we enlist experts to help with that. Because BeYou is a fairly large item, we\u2019ve opted for sea freight in bulk to different hubs around the world, which is more environmentally friendly than air shipping. That also means we can only use certain carriers, which comes with its own unpredictable challenges, but we\u2019ll do our best to go through this process hiccup-free.\n\nSometimes, despite everyone doing everything perfectly, stuff happens. Snow storms, hurricanes, materials getting stuck in customs or factories losing electricity for a day. We\u2019ve done our best to account for any unforeseen challenges and we\u2019ve set a conservative timeline.\n\nIn all honesty, anything can happen. We might discover we\u2019re all living in a simulation game tomorrow and such a thing might slow down the delivery of your BeYou \ud83d\ude04 But no matter what happens, we promise we\u2019ll always be honest and transparent with you and we\u2019ll always keep you up to date with our progress post-campaign.

Players might attempt to bolster the power of the Chancellor or scheme to bring the empire to ruin. The consequences of one game will ripple through those that follow, changing what resources and actions future players may have at their disposal and even altering the game's core victory condition.\nEvery system in Oath is built from the ground up to be responsive and adaptable. A single decision could reverberate for dozens of games afterwards.\nThe core rules are simple: Players will spend their turns adventuring within the Chancellor's realm and the lands that surround it. They will gather support, recruit warbands, and discover dark and dangerous secrets. Over the course of the game, players will collectively populate the world with a cast of strange and wonderful characters and institutions. This world is essentially a shared tableau, which every player can interact with and seek to control.\nMost players begin as Exiles, powerful figures living on the edge of polite society. An Exile wins the game by directly challenging the Chancellor's power or by attempting to fulfill a new Vision.\nThe Chancellor wins the game by maintaining their grip on the empire. To this end, they may wish to make offers of citizenship to one or more Exiles. If accepted, these new Citizens will help the Chancellor maintain control, but the Chancellor will need to be careful. These new Citizens present threats to their own succession. Though players will sometimes need to work together, only one player will ever win.\nIn the video below, Cole, Oath's designer, will walk you through a few turns of the game so that you can see some of the systems in action:\nPLAY\n\nEvery game in Oath affects the games that follow. If one game ends with the fall of an empire, the next game will be played in its still-smoldering ruin. There is no pre-written narrative or pre-determined end point. Oath is not a legacy game. Instead, it is a game about legacy where the choices the players make will determine what happens next.\nAt the end of each game of Oath, players will take account of what happened in their game during the Chronicle Phase. During this phase, the game\u2019s board will be re-centered around the territory of the game\u2019s victor, the victory condition may be adjusted, and new cards will be introduced to the deck depending on how the game was won. When they have completed this process, they will have advanced the history of their world by a generation and set the stage for the next crisis.\nAt this point, players can opt to play another game or they can pack up the game into the box in a way that will preserve the game state for easy setup for the next game. Games of Oath take about 6 minutes to pack up and no more than 3 minutes to set up.\nSet up the game in three minutes or less.\n\nThose looking for an epic, multi-generational game can play several sessions of Oath in a row easily. Each game only takes 45 minutes to a couple hours depending on the players' experience and what happens in the game. But it\u2019s also easy to play a single round, clean up the game, and then resume it days or weeks later. And, because of the game\u2019s design, your playgroup doesn't need to remain consistent. After playing the game on a Saturday night with your regular group, you can continue to develop the world during the week with your partner or by yourself with the game\u2019s solo mode, and then continue the story with your group when you meet again the following week.\nTo catch our live streams, make sure to follow us on Twitch. Recordings of our live streams will be posted on Youtube.\nYou can follow Leder Games on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.\nFor more information about Oath and designer diaries, head on over to the BGG page!\n For Retailer Orders, please email clay@ledergames.com.\nSince 2014, Leder Games has been building immersive designs that put players first. In 2015 we released Vast: The Crystal Caverns, a ground-breaking asymmetric strategy game. In 2018, we released Root, which has won numerous international gaming awards for both its design and production.\nAt Leder Games we believe in creating socially conscious games that reward repeat play and study. These are games meant to be enjoyed for many years. Game design, art direction, illustration, and product design are all handled holistically from the start of every project until its completion.\nThis creative spirit extends to the structure of the company. The vast majority of our staff are employed full-time and have benefits. Everyone is enfranchised in the success of all of our games, both old and new. We pay our interns too.\nThis means we might be a little slower at making games than your average game company, but we work hard to treat our titles with the utmost care and create games that we think can stand the test of time.\nIf you're interested in getting your hands on previous titles, we still have copies of Vast: The Mysterious Manor, the stand-alone sequel to Vast: The Crystal Caverns, available on our website here.\nWe will resume selling Root and its expansions in February, after we have completed the bulk of fulfillment for the Underworld Expansion.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLeder Games now has 10 employees covering a wide range of tasks. Our project management, production, and logistical details have grown considerably.\n\nWe recently completed Vast: The Mysterious Manor and we are currently shipping Root: The Underworld.\nAtlas, our North American warehouse and shipping partner, has moved to a larger facility and can ship things much more quickly. Our shipping outside of North America is being handled by another firm, and currently, they need to receive all of their inventory before shipping which could cause delays.\n\nWe have many established business partners in every part of the process, from printing to customer service to fulfillment. We do not foresee any challenges but can change partners as needed.\n\nProduction-wise if our partner were to close under the weight of new tariffs or from the competition. We would simply employ one of the other production relationships we have been working on to continue the print.\n\nLogistically we have had a few snags in the past. Part of the confusion is a lack of understanding that our larger international shipping partners are either massively overbooked or dependent on all of the inventory arriving before they will process any orders. As we move into the future we will continue exploring our logistical options and we strive to improve the process. When shipping starts we now have many more Leder Games personnel to dedicate to the task. If there is a disaster in the logistics step (such as a boat sinking) we are insured and will be able to replace any print run.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Oath Pledge", "descp": "One copy of Oath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile base game plus all Kickstarter extras.\nINCLUDES:\nOath: Chronicles of Empire and Exile\nOath: Chronicle Session Journal\nOath: Deluxe Component Set", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2021"}], "stat": ["12,299 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update #3", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\n\nPlease read below on our current shipping status for Oath.\n\nPlease remember that your Backerkit account status will NOT be accurate on your current shipping status since direct tracking emails are being sent instead."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update #2", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\n\nHere\u2019s a small update on where we currently are with fulfillment:\n\nUpdate by Region\nUS, Canada, and Mexico"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Address Lock Down and Current Shipping Estimates", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nPlease read below on the current status of fulfillment and ensure that your addresses are correct and up to date by Friday.\n\nAddress Lock Down"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #24", "update_userinfo": "Oath MPC Arrives and Estimate of Address Lock", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nWell things got a little delayed thanks to the holiday postal traffic, but we now have the Oath MPC in the office.

Whenever recording a species, a player immediately takes one of 5 possible bonus actions that allow the player to set themselves up for future turns or alter the landscape. Players continue to take turns until The Rift Tile is revealed, making the portal to the new world unstable. Once The Rift begins, players add an additional phase to their turns, taking part in dismantling the landscape they have opened up for exploration. The game comes to a close as they race to complete their tasks and return home. When the game ends, players receive prestige points for their recorded species and bonuses are earned for specializing in specific sets of species. The Darwinaut with the most points will win the game and go down in history as a pioneer in this new age of discovery.\n Darwinauts is a game for 1-4 players, ages 13 and up and plays in 30-45 minutes.\n\nDarwinauts comes in our bigger box size 9.5\" x 7.25\" x 2\". The same size as Forest of Fun!\nWe think Darwinauts is GREAT but don't just take our word for it! Check out these previews and other helpful links! (Please note that all pictures use prototype components and don't always reflect the final product.)  \nCheck out the live play-through from Board Game Spotlight:\n\n\"Chaining tiles for resources, researching new species for VPs, and art from Vincent Dutrait makes this a fantastic, thinky filler with the depth of a larger game.\" -Derek Funkhouser, Board Game Spotlight\n\"The amount of fun in Darwinauts is exceeded only by it's ease of learning and ability to make you want to play it again and again! The Mechanics feel familiar enough that you understand it in an instant yet deep enough to make you want to explore more options during each play.\" -Dan Patriss, Geek All-Stars\n\nRichard Ham of Rahdo Runs Through takes a look right here: \nClick the logo below for a live play-through that Jason did with Infectious Play (Jonathan Gilmour and Ian Moss) :\nTantrum House shares their thoughts:\nEdo take a look here:\n\"Darwinauts has a little bit of the feel of other tile-laying games like Carcassone, but the \u201cremove explorers\u201d action to acquire resources is new. I like how it keeps the game clock ticking, and pushes everyone inevitably toward the end. The one thing it doesn\u2019t share with other tile-laying games is the way you can enjoy the map at the end of the game\u2014because, by the end, there\u2019s almost nothing left! If you like tile-laying games and far-out alien creatures, maybe you\u2019ll want to become a Darwinaut yourself.\" -Jonathan Liu, GeekDad\n\n\nListen to Draft Mechanic gush about Vincent's art here!\n\"The growth and collapse of the map in each game of Darwinauts makes every decision feel vital. It\u2019s a tight balance between efficiency and exploration enhanced by Dutrait\u2019s excellent artwork!\" -Draft Mechanic\n\"It\u2019s the perfect combination of tension and strategy.\" - Angelica, Married Meeples\n\nA video update from designer Chris Bryan about the journey to Darwinauts:\nAnd more to come...\nWe have plans to add value (STRETCH GOALS!) to Darwinauts that we think you will really appreciate. We plan to add value by upgrading components and adding content to make this cool game even cooler! We have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our previous campaigns, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery.  \nThat being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way.  \nHere's a peek at the first few stretch goals! We'll announce more funding thresholds as we get closer to funding!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n If you've checked out the videos and read the reviews and still want more info, you can check out the First Edition Rules PDF RIGHT HERE!\nThe rules are currently being edited and reformatted for clarity and to match the updated graphic design.  \n\n                         UK and EU copies will be shipping from within the UK with VAT paid! (Currently seeking alternatives to UK shipping in case Brexit becomes an issue!)\nNote: International Backers outside of the UK and EU will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package.  \nWe have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor, especially with the ever-changing rates of the US Postal Service. We must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail.  \nWe understand that shipping to our international friends can be cost prohibitive and that others have found creative ways to mitigate some of this cost. We have managed to work with a partner in the UK to ship our UK and EU packages to backers to help alleviate VAT charges. As a small company that mostly handles our own fulfillment, we simply pass our shipping cost on to our backers. In addition, it is our goal to continue to develop our network of awesome international partners that we have worked with to localize Darwinauts for game markets around the world. \nChris Bryan is a filmmaker and game designer. You might know him from the award winning web series he co-created, Board with Life. Or you might know him from the Golden Geek Award winning D&D Podcast, Board with Life: Adventures where he plays as a Tabaxi Fighter named Prince Smith Dith Rith the 5th, (the strongest boy alive.) His previous game designs include Lanterns Dice: Lights in the Sky, Favelas, and Dragonball Z: Perfect Cell. When he isn't writing bios about himself he enjoys camping, gardening, climbing, playing drums, and spending time with his wife, 2 cats, and tiny dog in Denton, Texas.   \nThe visual world of Darwinauts was brought to life by legendary artist, Vincent Dutrait (Elysium, Lewis and Clark, New York: 1901, Rise of Augustus) who painstakingly crafted the various species by hand.\nOver the last 20 years, Vincent Dutrait has become one of the most beloved illustrators in the board game industry. His body of work includes art direction, graphic design, and illustration in the game industry and in children's book publishing. Vincent currently lives with his family in South Korea.

I plan to avoid delays and common pitfalls by paying special attention to the following areas and building on previous experience:\n\nArt and Design. The art and design for the game is nearly complete so we'll be ready to print shortly after the close of the campaign. I always like to show you I mean business by paying for the art and design upfront!\n\nPlaytesting and Reviewing. Darwinauts has been tested by many different playtesters and even a bunch of game designers. I have sent a bunch of prototypes to a variety of reviewers. I want to earn your trust by providing you with a solid product that has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by folks from varying backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nPast Experience. This is the thirteenth Kickstarter project I've run for Green Couch Games and I have helped with several other successful campaigns. Also, having spent many years working in retail and customer service, I understand the importance of treating backers with respect and following through with projects.\n\nOf course, there are always unexpected circumstances that pop up, but I PROMISE to communicate every step of the way and do my best to use creative problem solving meet the challenges head on.\n\nThank you so much for giving Green Couch Games a chance.

Lets get this one. Back and share!\nThe year is 1792, and you and 23 New York City stockbrokers just signed the Buttonwood Agreement. In a few short years, this group of brokers would be known as the New York Stock Exchange, one of the greatest and most influential pillars in the global economy.\n\"It's unlike any game I've ever played\"  - Playtester feedback\nExchange is a stock trading game of strategy and wit. Players carefully plan their strategy, phase by phase, trying to cash in big in a constantly changing market. However, playing the market is only half the battle- the only thing harder to predict than the stock market might just be the players sitting at the table with you. The one who can best match wits with their opponents will reign victorious in this fast-paced battle of social elite.\nDesigned to be easy to learn and fast to play, but with a surprising depth of strategy, Exchange is a great gateway game, with a high level of replay ability. This game has been enjoyed by serious gamers, casual gamers, and even my mother, who typically says, \"I would rather just watch\" (unless we are play Settlers of course).  \n\"A very welcoming game to all types of players\" - Lee, Geek City USA\n Over the course of five rounds players will make a series of decisions about which stock they would like to trade, how many they would like to buy or sell, and how they would like to influence the stock market. After these phases, a random Market Forces card is drawn and the market is adjusted accordingly. Once the final price for each stock is set, players buy or sell stocks based on the decisions made earlier in the round. At the end of five rounds, the player with the highest net worth will be crowned victorious.\nHow the market changed during actual gameplay\nSimultaneous play and reveal every phase\nIndecision. It happens to the best of us.\nDeciding which stock to trade and how many to buy or sell before the final price is set is no small task. However, the greatest difficulty is trying to do so while accurately predicting what your opponents will do. Not to mention, the closer the stock is to the market bubble, the less predictable your opponents become and the stakes only get higher- resulting in a battle of wits almost as intense as this classic scene from The Princess Bride. It truly will take a dizzying intellect. \nI had Lee rom Geek City USA review Exchange. You can check out both his review and the full How to Play video below: \nWatch Lee's Summary:\n\"Gameplay is smooth and easy to pick up.\"\n\"I wouldn't call it a light game by any means, but it is definitely a game that is accessible to everybody.\"\n\"A game you can play with casual gamers as well as heavy style gamers.\"\nWatch The Full Review:\nQuotes from Playtesters\n\"This is the exact type of game my board game lunch group at work is looking for!\"  \n\"There are few games where the theme and mechanics compliment each other so well. Quick and easy to learn, but with a lot of depth.\" \n\"To be honest, I was apprehensive to play Exchange at first...But, once I played it, I was hooked! It\u2019s fun and easy to learn. I would definitely play this game again.\"\n\"At first, I thought the game would be too complicated to play and I'd be terrible at it. I was wrong! It's easy to catch on too, but not too easy and predictable because there is always an unknown variable of what the player next to you will do and how it will effect you.\"\n\"I love this game...and I don't really like most board games\"\nDream Weaver: Personalized Thank you Card and Sticker\nStock Broker: 1 copy of Exchange\nDream Waver + Stock Broker: Thank you card, sticker, and 1 copy of Exchange (at early bird price)\nCollectors Edition.

Six Character Cards (UNLOCKED)\nThe character cards mentioned in the video do not come standard in the game, but will be unlocked with the first stretch goal. These cards are designed to make every game different and jump start your decision making and feature the name of one of the actual signees of the Buttonwood Agreement. \n2. Advanced Gameplay Descriptions (UNLOCKED)\nAs stated, I designed this game to be easy to learn. Throughout the process, there were many elements tested and removed due to their added complexity. However, I captured a few of my favorite elements or alternative game play options that were the hardest to exclude from the game. For more serious gamers, or for those who want a new experience every time, these advanced gameplay options will be included in an expanded rule book if this stretch goal is unlocked. \n3. Six Additional Character Cards\nIn addition to the six character cards unlocked with the first stretch goal, six new character cards will be unlocked. This creates even greater variance and allows players to be dealt two cards and choose their favorites.\n4. Box Divider Insert\nThe divider insert is designed to maximize the efficiency of how the components are stored in the box. Creating compartments for the cards as well as an elevated platform for the Market Value and Ledger Boards, and makes the product designer in me smile. \n5. Premium Linen Cards\nThe cards will be upgraded to linen cards for a more premium \"old timey\" feel and elevate the quality, look, and feel of the game. \n6. Reverse \"Advanced\" Side of the Board\nIf we reach $50,000, the reverse side of the Market Value Board will feature an advanced option, where the possible values will differ for each stock to better represent the stocks they represent. For example, bonds will be a more stable investment by not changing in price as quickly and drastically as the other stocks. The three color-coded tracks will have unique pricing structures adding even more complexity and strategy to the game than the base version. \nMore to Come\nMore stretch goals will be released and unlocked if we exceed $50,000.  \nShoutouts & Collaborators\nArtwork: Patrick Dewenter\nVideo: Tanner Daniels\nVideo Music: www.bensound.com\nYou made it this far, congrats!

Beyond the seas, beyond the woods, and beyond high mountains was a fortress ruled by a stern and powerful king. This stronghold was unbreakable and the king's army was undefeatable.  \nEvery year the king held an event called \"The Royal Games\" for his noble subjects to train to become highly skilled knights. Beneath this fortress lay a dungeon used to test their wits and strength. These knights faced rigorous obstacles including traps, weaponry, and psychological tactics. Only the most resilient knights prevailed. Whoever was worthy during the treacherous journey earned the rank among the king's elite.\nKnights of Glory is a board game designed by Linh Nguyen. It is for ages 8 and up, for 2-5 players, and gameplay may run between 15-45 minutes. It is simple to teach, easy to learn, and has endless replayability. It can be considered a family friendly or party game. But most of all it is enjoyable by all ages. \nIn Knights of Glory, you play as one of the king's knights seeking the ultimate goal of becoming a Royal Games victor. Advance through a treacherous dungeon by using the art of bluffing. Each player will try to make their way to the exit through deception and deduction by using the mechanics of poker and BS. More than one knight may prevail. \nKnights of Glory has a very unique element that closely resembles a lot of the attributes from poker such as \"Sitting Out\", \"Deal Me In\", and \"Deal Me Out\". Therefore, anyone can jump in a game or leave a game and it will not affect the game at all. \nThe game takes place over several rounds until a player exits the dungeon. Each round consist of 3 Phases: \nAction\nVoting\nRefreshing\nThe first player will take the first player marker (Rook). On each player\u2019s turn, they MUST decide to perform one of the following three actions:  \nAdvance\nPass\nDiscard\nAlways look at the Tier Path ahead of you. If the card is face-down, reveal it by flipping the card over to see what trap you must overcome. Roll as many Weapon Dice as shown on the Dice Indicator and play a Weapon Card.  \nADVANCE BY PLAYING THE DICE ROLLED:\nADVANCE BY PLAYING A WEAPON SUBSTITUTION: \nThere are more dice advancement options but above are the most common rules. For the full version of the rules, you may download it here. \nThis simply means your turn ends and the next player in the rotation takes their turn. \nYou may discard your cards up to the Tier Level you are currently on, but it must be face-down and this ends your turn. Example: If you are on Tier 2, you may discard up to 2 cards. All discarded cards will be placed in a pile known as the \"Discard Pile.\" \nAfter you perform your turn action to advance, you will be judged. Opponents will secretly cast their votes by placing their Voting Card face-down in front of them. Once all the votes are locked in, opponents will then reveal their Voting Cards simultaneously. Depending on what your opponents vote, the following will happen: \nIf all opponents agree, you will NOT reveal your Weapon Card(s) and discard them. You will then advance to the next Tier Path. \nYou will reveal your Weapon Card(s) and discard them. You will then advance to the next Tier Path. All opponents that agreed will stay where they are. All opponents that disagreed will retreat to the previous Tier Path. \nYou will reveal your Weapon Card(s) and discard them. You will then retreat to the previous Tier Path and immediately end your turn. All opponents that agreed will do nothing. All opponents that disagreed will advance to the next Tier Path.  \nIf you successfully advance after the Voting Phase, you may decide whether to push your luck and perform one of your turn actions again. \nThere are some exceptions and restrictions but above are the most common rules.. For the full version of the rules, you may download it here.\nNOTE: This phase will only occur after the last player in the rotation has ended their turn. \nWhen the round rotates back to the first player, the first player is now the last player. Pass the Rook clockwise to the next player in the rotation. The next player is now the first player in the new round.  \nWhen the last player ends their turn, it is time to replenish every player\u2019s hand back to 5 cards again. Players will be able to keep any remaining cards that they still have.   \nIf there is an Unknown Deck, deal these cards first. Otherwise, shuffle the Discard Pile and deal them to each player.\nTo do this, deal each player starting with the first player until they have 5 cards before dealing the next player in the rotation.\nThere may be more than one winner. When a player successfully arrives to the Exit Path, they are considered the winner, but other players have a chance to win as well and play one final turn. The game continues, starting with the next player in the rotation. However, the Voting and Refreshing Phases are eliminated, and all Weapon Cards must be played face-up. \nEach time a player successfully advances to the Exit Path, the Tier Paths will gradually collapse starting with the Cell, Start, and all of Tier 1 together; and then, when another player wins, Tier 2; and finally, Tier 3.\nWhen all the Tier Paths collapse or the last player fails to exit, the game then ends, and players that successfully advanced to the Exit Path are considered the winners as well.\nThere are some exceptions and restrictions but above are the main rules. For the full version of the rules, you may download it here.\n             The Merchant Pledge Level are for Retail stores only.

Players take on the role of a fledgling nation, which they will seek to grow into an empire whose influence will echo through the ages\u2026\nExpand your population and attain the knowledge that will determine how your society is shaped over time. You can use this Knowledge to build Cities and erect Monuments as well as developing and mastering Skills. Each of these actions gives you access to new ways to score Victory Points and at the end of the game the player with the most wins!\nWill your Civilization become a wealthy hub of trade and commerce? A cultural and political powerhouse? A haven of Science and craftsmanship? The birthplace of a great religion? It\u2019s up to you\u2026\nDominations is an expert level Eurogame which offers players a great amount of freedom to choose and develop their strategies. The core mechanics of the game are simple yet offer a lot of depth, keeping the game fluid and immersive. Veteran board gamers will be able to draw out all the subtleties of the game\u2019s vast array of possibilities whereas novice players can quickly assimilate the core rules before moving on to learn the key elements of the Eurogame genre.\nDominations is the second game written by Olivier Melison and Eric Dubus (Museum) and illustrated by the talented Florian Stitz (Pathfinder, Splittermond) and our in-house artist Lo\u00efc Muzy (Call of Cthulhu, Orcquest, Mythic Battles) along with Agathe Piti\u00e9, Amber Scharf and Floriane Habbak.\nAn expert Eurogame with unusual domino placement and colour matching elements\nDeceptively simple mechanics that deliver a vast array of strategic possibilities.\nFluid, fast-paced gameplay with very little downtime.\nA Civilization-building and management game with no war or direct conflict between players.\nFrom 2-4 players with a duration of 45 minutes per player.\n\nIt\u2019s time for the History of your Nation to be written!\nA game of Dominations : Road to Civilization starts at the Cradle of Humanity. As their nations progress, players will be placing their triangular dominoes around this starting point to gain Knowledge, which is the main resource of the game.\nThere are six different Domains of Knowledge upon which to build your Civilisation: Craftmanship, Commerce, Art, Science, Government and Religion. Each one of these Domains has its own colour. The types of Knowledge that you produce will determine how your society is shaped over time.\nBy matching up the Knowledge colours on the dominoes, players can gain additional Knowledge points.\nThe Knowledge points you obtain can then be used in a number of different ways. Players can build Cities and Monuments on the board to obtain extra points and special bonuses. They can also use their Knowledge to acquire and master skills. Each step your Civilization takes will earn you points, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins!\n A game of Dominations is played over three Ages, representing around 3 thousand years in the existence of your Civilization. During an Age, players will each play 5 Turns. A turn is comprised of three Phases:\nThe Grow Phase, during which the player must place a domino onto the board\nThe Build phase, during which the player may either build a City OR a Monument\nThe Develop Phase, during which the player may Master a new Skill OR perfect a previously mastered skill.\nDuring the Grow Phase of Dominations, the active player places a domino on the board. These dominoes represent the growth of your population and its expansion into new territories! As your nation grows, its people will learn - placing a new domino allows you to generate Knowledge.\nTo place a domino correctly, one of its edges must line up completely with either the edge of another domino, or the Cradle of Humanity starting tile. You then generate Knowledge points depending on the colours of the gems you matched up. 1 gem is worth 1 Knowledge point of that colour. You are not obliged to match the colours, but if you do so, you will obtain a bonus point \u2013 2 matched gems earns you 3 points instead of 2. The player also scores a resource point of the colour of the Camp space on the domino they just placed.\nIf a player closes a full circle of dominoes, they create a Locus. This allows them to score all of the resources in the centre of the Locus, along with the Camp space.\nDuring the Build Phase, the player may choose to either build a City, or participate in the construction of a Monument.\nBuilding a City on the Camp space of a domino allows your Nation to settle, increasing the maximum limit of Knowledge that you can generate at any one time! Cities also allow you to gain additional resources - each time you or another player places a domino next to a tile that has one of your Cities on it, that City is activated, gaining you 1 Knowledge point of the domain colour that it was built on. On top of that, whenever a full circle of dominoes, or Locus, is created, all of the Cities on the Locus are activated! Building Cities also gains you Influence points, which earn you considerable advantages during the game.\nMonuments are common objectives, and all players can participate in their construction! When a player constructs a Monument, a special tile along with a standee is added to the board. Monuments bring additional bonuses and victory points to the players that contribute to their construction.\nDuring the Development Phase, players will master the skills that will become the pillars of their society! Each time you master a skill, you gain additional powers and victory points as your nation\u2019s power increases. At the start of the game, your Civilization tree will be nothing more than a Campfire card, but over time, it will grow as your nation leaves it mark on history. Each new skill you acquire will add a Mastery card to your Civilization tree.\nTo be integrated into your Civilisation tree, a Mastery card must connect to one of the coloured gems around your Campfire card, or another Mastery card, to form a Nodus. A Nodus must be in one colour, and Mastery cards must always face towards the player. If a player cannot place a Mastery card into their tree in accordance with these rules, then they cannot acquire that card. But not to worry: each Mastery card comes in four copies, each with a different Nodus configuration, and players may choose the card that best suits their needs.\nOnce all players have had five turns, the End of Age scoring phase is triggered.\nFirst, any cards with an \"End of Age\" effect are triggured. Then we move on to Influence.\nThere are two different types of points in Dominations: Victory points - which ultimately allow you to win the game - and Influence points, which you gain by building Cities and also from certain Mastery cards. There are no wars or conflicts in Dominations, but your Influence represents how powerful and influential your Nation has become over time. The player with the most Influence points may copy a Skill from another player\u2019s Civilisation tree for free.\nPlayers also score the same number of Victory points as the number of Influence points that they possess at the end of each Age.\nBefore moving on to the next Age, the player with the most remaining Knowledge points in any one Domain becomes the Master of that Domain, gaining them the aid of a special Character for the next Age! These Characters grant additional Victory points and special bonuses. For example, the player with the most remaining Craftmanship points at the end of the Age gains the help of the Craftsman. The Craftsman, as well as awarding one Victory Point, allows the player to place 1 additional domino during the next Age.\n\nOnce all of the Characters have been distributed, players replenish their hand of dominoes and the next Age begins! This process is repeated at the end of the second age too!\nThe end of Age Three is much like a normal end of Age, but there are three differences that will determine which civilisation will be crowned the greatest!\nCharacters: You have one final opportunity to dominate each of the six Domains. However as there is no age four, the powers are not included. Instead, the Characters are now all worth 3 Victory points each rather than their normal value.\nBoth End of age effects and Influence are resolved as normal.\nObjectives: The game\u2019s Objective cards give you the opportunity to walk in the steps of one of the great civilisations of the past. They offer you a sense of direction at the beginning of the game, constraining you to achieve certain results but also awarding you with points if you meet their rather hefty requirements. Did you restrain yourself to follow these objectives or did you prefer to forge your own path?\nThe Civilisation Tree: Your tree represents your civilisation\u2019s mastery over each of the 6 Knowledge Domains, traits of culture and ingenuity for which your empire will be remembered in the ages to come!

For each Domain, multiply the number of Mastery cards from that Domain (advanced cards count for 3!) by the number of Nodus of that colour in your tree.

A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to complete it. Here you'll be able to tell us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\nCurrently the core mechanics for Domination are set in stone and after many months of playtesting we are very happy with them. Given the nature of Eurogames though, the balancing and polishing comes from everything built around those mechanics. In our case that\u2019s the Mastery, Monuments and Objective cards. We\u2019re still tinkering and playtesting these elements and will continue to do so even after the campaign has ended so as to provide you with the best gaming experience possible.\nWith this in mind, don\u2019t worry if you see certain elements change during the campaign. Continued development is part of the very nature of Kickstarter itself and we look forward to getting your feedback and ideas to help us make Dominations an even better game!\nIllustration wise, the lion\u2019s share of graphical elements have already been prepared with certain details (remaining Mastery and objective card illustrations for example) currently being finalised.\nAs for stretch goals and other content we may unlock during the campaign: The game design for the majority of these elements has been tested and finalized. And many of the graphical elements have already been started.\nHowever, all this depends on the route the campaign takes. We have prepared as much as possible but developments during the campaign may cause delays so please bear this in mind!\nOlivier Melison and Eric Dubus have known each other for over 30 years, during which time they have played a huge selection of games together! When they're not creating amazing games together, Olivier works in international publishing, and Eric is a history teacher.\nThough so far relatively unknown in the boardgame industry, Florian Stitz has nearly a decade of experience in working on fantasy and science fiction roleplaying and tabletop miniatures games. His illustrations can be found in several games such as Pathfinder, Splittermond, Warmachine and Hordes, Warhammer 40k rpgs and Descent, to name a few. Besides that his works are really popular in the Warmachine and Hordes gaming community for which he provided several mascots and logos over the last years.\nIllustrator and character-design specialist, Lo\u00efc Muzy has been working in the world of gaming since 2008 and as Holy Grail Games' in-house illustrator and Art Director since 2018. He started by designing minatures for wargaming, then made a name for himself in the world of board games (Fire team zero, Mythic Battles, Orcquest,...). He has also worked on video games projects, such as some based in the Warhammer 40000 universe. He's best known for his illustrations for Call of Cthulhu (role-playing and other derivative products) as an illustrator with Sans-d\u00e9tours editions. Lo\u00efc has been painting figurines for over 20 years, and is passionate about fantasy universes.\nA freelance illustrator, Floriane Habbak has previously worked on the Adventures Role Playing Game by Sans D\u00e9tour. She\u2019s been working on the Mastery cards here in Dominations!\nAgathe Piti\u00e9 is an artist that specialises in immense, Fresco style paintings, which made her perfect for the objective cards in Dominations! She\u2019s also worked on other games such as The Songs of Loss RPG.\nA veritable jack of all trades in illustration, Amber Scharf has previously worked on the Rabbit Island board game and is taking care of the Mastery cards here for Dominations!\n Holy Grail Games is a board game publisher that was born from its creators\u2019 desire to make great, unique games. HGG brings together the experience and passion of Jamie Johnson (community manager on multiple projects including Conan and The 7th Continent Kickstarter campaigns), Olivier Melison (entrepreneur, passionate player and game author) and Eric Dubus (History teacher, Game author and human loudspeaker). They couldn't do that however without the help of the rest of the team including Georgina, Quentin, Owen, Raphael, Jonhatan, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois, Kayla...\nWell, the real question is - why not? Kickstarter and crowdfunding in general are amazing tools for game publishers and have revolutionized our industry. Financially it is one of the most beneficial routes of publishing and helps us ensure that everyone involved in the project earns a good living from each game. At the end of the day, this is what allows us to continue to do what we love! Kickstarter is also an amazing communication tool, allowing us to reach out directly in a unique and engaging way to those most interested in what we have to offer.\nBut that's not all. Beyond good business sense, Kickstarter allows us to prioritise quality over quantity. It allows us to only deal with games that we love and believe in 100%, taking the time and care necessary to push their development as far as it will go.\nWith the leeway and support afforded to us by these kind of projects, we can take a normal gaming experience and make it extraordinary. Via both material and content, our aim is to have all our games provide a unique, exciting, engaging and luxury experience!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by July 2019. This may seem like a long time as the game itself is already quite advanced (as detailed in the \"development\" section). However, knowing the intricacies of board game design, manufacturing and shipping, we'd rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\nShipnaked will be taking care of North America whereas Meeple Logistics will be ensuring delivery In Europe and the surrounding regions as well as other worldwide destinations.\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge. We have however done our best to reduce the costs as much as possible. After the campaign has concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase.\nBelow are the prices for delivery of one copy of Dominations to each Country.\nPurchasing multiple boxes and/or expansions will incur a small increase in postage costs to cover packaging and handling.\nAdditional copies of the core game will cost around 3\u20ac in shipping\nExpansions will cost an additional 1\u20ac in shipping\nFor the price of an Empire pledge, add \u20ac4 to the totals shown above.\nAn additional Empire pledge will cost \u20ac7 in shipping\nIf you have any questions about shipping, please don't hesitate to ask us in the comments section!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first rodeo. As individuals we have been involved in many Kickstarters before and this is Holy Grail Games' fourth project, so are very familiar with any potential pitfalls.\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating an July 2019 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented whilst the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Even if you haven\u2019t received your tracking info yet, your game should already be on its way to you.\n\n As most of you are aware by now, we\u2019ve been having issues with delivery in North America. Packages are only just starting to arrive. Some of you are frustrated, and rightly so. In all honesty we have also been very much in the dark on our end, which has left us unable to answer your questions with certainty. With US and CAN packages finally starting to arrive we\u2019re only just starting to get the key information we\u2019ve needed for some time now.\n\n So, let\u2019s start from the beginning: ITS, the company in charge of shipping for the US are the American collaborators of our European shipping partners. This is the first time we\u2019ve used either of these companies, both of them have a very good track record, and came highly recommended. Up until now, both have been great partners, very reactive and professional. For the European side, this has held out through the delivery process, with delivery already completed as promised. For the American side though, it\u2019s a different story.\n\n We were promised that, on the week of the 6th of January, ITS would be back from their Xmas Holidays and that Dominations shipping prep would begin that week with packages leaving shortly after. Obviously, this hasn\u2019t been the case. It has taken almost two more weeks for them to get things started and, in the meantime, it has been almost impossible for us to get accurate information from them.\n\n What information we did get turned out to be untrue, with messages saying the games were going to be leaving earlier than they did. Now, in the real world, delays happen. We all know this. The issue is that we\u2019ve been passing this false information on to you, creating an expectation which wasn\u2019t met. This has been very frustrating for you guys and it also makes us look bad. So, if our replies recently have made us seem like we were a bit lost and/or not in control of the situation, that\u2019s the reason why.

Feeling strangely nostalgic about the work monitor he used at his previous job, he decided to build a laptop monitor from a broken laptop.\nDuring the process, he realized that most of the secondary monitors available were stationary, and he couldn\u2019t move around with them. So, he built a prototype of a light and portable monitor that he could carry anywhere with him.\nSoon, everyone in the office wanted one, and our product, DUO, was born!\nYao and Banda are from the MIT school of engineering and the MIT Sloan School of Management where they gained funding from MIT Sandbox, which promotes student entrepreneurship.

Visit us at www.fridgecrisis.com for future updates and other projects. Thank you for your support!\n---\nYou were so close. Your party was one adventure away from reclaiming the stolen Amulet of Morgoth and returning it to the rightful king of Riverwood. But none of you were prepared for the elder dragon waiting at the end of the dungeon, nor its fiery breath that snuffed out your life.\nAnd now you're stuck in the Underworld: dark, damp, and packed with more ghosts than you've seen in any ancient tomb during your questing days. You're just another one of those ghosts now, and those days are over.\nOr are they?\nIt turns out that Hades, Lord of the Underworld, is bored with his work, and he's offered you and your heroic friends the chance of a lifetime: entertain him by fighting one last epic battle, and you can return to the world of the living. But here's the catch\u2014there's only one ticket back. And you're going to have to fight your friends for it.\nFor one last time, take up the shield of the valiant Guardian, employ the Assassin's sneak attack, or crack open the Arcanist's dusty book of tricks to prove your worth in free-for-all combat. Earn Hades' favor by inflicting pain and he'll throw some new weapons and spells your way. Only the most aggressive hero will earn passage to the surface and the life they've left behind.\nBlood will be shed. Legends will be born. Feelings will be hurt.\n    Swords & Souls is a quick combat card game with deck-building elements for 3-6 players. You and your opponents will take turns drawing and playing attack cards against each other. If your opponent can block or dodge your attack with a card of their own, they're safe... for now.\nIf not, they'll take damage and you'll earn obols, the silver currency of the dead, which you can use to buy more powerful cards from the arsenal. \nFinish an opponent and you'll take a fragment of their soul. Earn 3 soul fragments to become Hades' chosen champion and return in glory to the life you once lost.\n  Each player begins by choosing one of six heroes, each with their own unique talent and starting deck of 5 cards that represent their core abilities. The Guardian excels at blocking, the Berserker draws extra cards, the Heir has greater access to obols, and so on.\nFrom there, each turn in Swords & Souls follows 3 simple steps:\n1. Draw cards from your deck until you have 3 in your hand. If you need to draw more but you've run out of cards, reshuffle your discard pile and keep on going.\n2. Play cards from your hand. It's as easy as putting the card on the table, doing what it says, and moving the card to your discard pile.\n3. Buy cards from the central arsenal deck by spending the obols you get from playing cards and attacking other players. These cards go into your hand, ready to be used on your next turn.\nBy playing the right cards in the right order at the right time, your attack cards will disarm and damage other players, turning their heart tokens into obols and soul fragments. And if you lose all of your own hearts, don't worry--you're already dead, so your spirit will respawn with new heart tokens, allowing you to continue the game without missing a beat.\nWant to know more? You can read the rules in detail here: [Swords & Souls Rules (3 pages)]\nWe've also got a prototype of the game up on Tabletop Simulator on Steam! We will be hosting a few preview livestreams throughout the campaign. Feel free to check it out for yourself in the meantime.\n  Fridgecrisis Games is technically a one-man team of me, Jaron Frost, but I couldn't do any of this without the help of my wife, Rachel, and so many of my friends near and far.\nSwords & Souls is my second card game. The first, Villages, raised over $132,000 on Kickstarter in February of 2014. It was a huge and unexpected success and there are now over 3,000 copies being played around the world. Woah.\nSoon after finishing Villages, I started a new project. I was inspired by the straightforward battle mechanics of Bang! and I'd been wanting to try designing a simple deck builder, so the two ideas came together to form what would eventually become Swords & Souls.\nThe game was a hit with our friends and family, one of whom actually bought our very first prototype from us sometime in 2015. By playtesting the game further with the Board Game Designer's Guild of Utah, attendees at SaltCON and other conventions, and fans of Villages far and wide, we've sanded down the rough edges and were left with a game I'm proud to bring to Kickstarter today. And I'd like to offer all of you a chance to improve it even further through your ideas and feedback as we move toward launch!\nHere's what a few of our playtesters had to say about the game:\nLeigh: \"While each card is easy to understand and the rules are simple, there's still room for devious strategy and malicious backstabbing between friends - the fun kind you probably forgive after the game is over.\"\nJacob: \"Super easy to learn. Fast gameplay after the first turn.\"\nSummer: \"Quick and easy to play, and the time just goes by while you're having so much fun fighting your way out of Hades' domain.\"\nSophia: \"'Oh s***, that's a dodge!' - sad players next to the Assassin\"\nThanks for checking out Swords & Souls. Tell your friends (and then beat them at the game later)!\nWant to score a copy of your own? Keep reading below or check out the reward levels in the right sidebar to learn more and make your pledge!\n$1 - Hades' Favor: In exchange for your support, Hades' messenger imps will send campaign updates to your inbox. It wasn't easy to train imps to use the internet!\n$5 - Digital Demon: A Print and Play (PnP) copy of Swords & Souls, delivered as a file you can print out at home or your local print shop. It's all the fun without all the cost!\n$20 - Soul Contract: One copy of Swords & Souls, delivered straight to you via a puff of magical fire (or your local post office, whichever is more practical). Also includes access to the Print and Play version.\n$20 - Home Fires: This one's for Salt Lake City locals or travelers! One copy of Swords & Souls, available for pickup at our launch party. Stay tuned for details. Also includes access to the Print and Play version.\n$30 - Hand of Hades: Well, aren't you special? Hades himself will personally sign one copy of Swords & Souls for you in his native language and include a special message with the game.\n$60 - Triple Trouble: Get three copies of Swords & Souls in an economical package: one for you, and two for your unsuspecting friends. All three will be signed by Hades and include his secret message.\n$100 - Underworld Elite: The ultimate Underworld getaway package. Includes one copy of Swords & Souls signed by Hades, a special message from beyond the grave, a premium black T-shirt featuring the Swords & Souls logo, and a 1-hour video chat with the game's designer, Jaron.\nShipping\nIf your pledge contains physical items that need to be mailed to you, Kickstarter will calculate shipping costs based on where you live. Be sure to keep an eye out for this while you're entering your pledge information.\nA Note for Backers Outside the US\nFor our Kickstarter campaign for Villages, we vastly underestimated the cost and complexity of doing our own international shipping. It was a mess. So, for this campaign, we will be using an international fulfillment company for all of our deliveries outside of the US, which should help cut down on costs. \nWe have set shipping rates according to the calculator provided to us by the fulfillment company. The value of each package should be low enough to avoid any significant customs taxes and fees, but I can't safely guarantee it, especially if we're sending you multiple copies of the game. If your government ends up charging you customs fees and this is a problem for you, please let us know and we'll see what we can do.\nAdd more money to your pledge to get extra copies of the game. More add-ons will be made available later once we reach certain stretch goal amounts--read on below for more info.\n$20: An extra copy of Swords & Souls.\n$20: A premium black T-shirt featuring the Swords & Souls logo. See Update #3 for the mock-up image.\nNo additional shipping charges are required for add-ons.\nIf we go above and beyond our campaign goal, the magic of bulk discounts will allow us to make upgrades and add in some extra stuff! These bonuses will be unlocked as we hit the funding levels listed below.\nWe can also begin to offer copies of our previous games as add-ons once we reach our campaign goal, helping propel us to future stretch goals even faster.\nFree Arsenal card: Hook - Attack any player. If this attack fails, draw a card from your deck.\nFree Arsenal card: Focus - At the start of your next turn, discard this card and draw cards until you have 4 in your hand.\nCustom metal tokens! This would be a paid add-on, but it would be amazing. At this funding level, we'd be able to manufacture custom tokens made of actual real-life metal. Imagine slamming hefty custom coins around on the table. Mmm. We're planning on offering a very affordable commemorative set of 3 tokens (1 large, 2 small) and a full set that could replace all of the chipboard tokens in your game.\nFree extra Hero: Hunter - Play when your attack is dodged. Ignore the dodge. Other effects written on the dodging card still apply. Starting deck: Bow, Dodge, Spy, Favor, Favor.\nMore stretch goals will be added as we cross these ones off! How high can we go?\n  We are planning to use the funds from this campaign to get Swords & Souls printed by a major board game manufacturer. These manufacturers have high minimum quantity requirements, making it difficult for us to pay for even the smallest print run ourselves. So, thanks to all of you, we can combine our efforts and get a high-quality product at a decent price!\nIf things go well here, we are planning to print more copies than we need to fulfill this campaign, and continue to sell those extra copies through our website and Amazon. Villages has proven to have a steady record of sales since its release, and we expect Swords & Souls to do the same. The profits from these copies will first go back to the company bank account to pay for further reprints in the future. Only after securing a healthy, sustainable financial foundation for the company will we begin to pay ourselves, hopefully allowing us to spend a little more of our time making new games and less time working extra jobs to make ends meet in our personal lives. That's the goal!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I mentioned above, this is my second Kickstarter campaign for a card game. The campaign for my first game, Villages, grew larger than I had ever imagined, but I was still able to deliver all of the promised rewards and stretch goals. I feel that I learned a lot from that campaign and will be able to use that knowledge to make this campaign an even smoother experience.\n\nThe manufacturer we're currently planning to use, Panda Game Manufacturing, is primarily located in China, but they have a strong reputation among board game designers for being easy to work with and producing high-quality games. We've chosen them over a few other less expensive options for this reason, and I'm confident that the peace of mind will be worthwhile.\n\nThis is also the first time we will be using Floship fulfillment services to deliver rewards to countries outside of North America. Floship is one of the fulfillment companies officially listed on Kickstarter's website, so we are cautiously optimistic about working with them. As stated above in the Rewards section, there are some difficult obstacles to face when it comes to international shipping, but going with a fulfillment company should keep costs down for everyone.\n\nIn the event of delays or problems of any kind, my pledge to you is that I will be as transparent as possible and keep you updated on how things are going. You deserve to know where your money is going and how the project is developing.\n\nIf you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. One of us will personally respond to you as quickly as possible.

Stalk the woods as one of the Vagabonds, seize the initiative with the Eyrie birds of prey, rule over your subjects as the Marquise de Cat, or command the Woodland Alliance to create a new order. With creatures and cunning, you'll rule a fantastic forest kingdom in the ultimate asymmetric game of adventure and war.\nThe nefarious Marquise de Cat has seized the great woodland, intent on harvesting its riches. Under her iron rule, the many creatures of the forest have banded together. This Woodland Alliance will seek to strengthen their presence by building hideouts and launching missions to subvert the rule of the cats.\nIn this effort, the Alliance may enlist the help of the Vagabonds, who are able to move through the more dangerous woodland paths. Though some may sympathize with the Alliance\u2019s hopes and dreams, these wanderers are old enough to remember the great birds of prey who once controlled the woods.\nMeanwhile, at the edge of the region, the proud, squabbling Eyrie have found a new commander whom they hope will lead their faction to reclaim their ancient birthright. The stage is set for a contest that will decide the fate of the great woodland. It is up to the players to decide which group will ultimately take root.\n(Note: prototype board and pieces)\nRoot is the next step in our development of asymmetric design. Like in Vast: the Crystal Caverns, each player in Root has unique capabilities and a different victory condition. Now, with the aid of gorgeous, multi-use cards, a truly asymmetric design has never been more accessible. \nIn Root, the players drive the narrative, and the differences among the roles create unparalleled interaction and replayability. Leder Games invites you and your family to explore the fantastic world of Root!\nRoot is designed by Cole Wehrle (Pax Pamir, An Infamous Traffic, and John Company) and brought to life by master illustrator Kyle Ferrin (Vast: The Crystal Caverns, Vast: The Fearsome Foes, Stitches).\nThe Marquise directs her cats to build up her frontier economy while attempting to police the vast wilderness. By collecting and guarding her wood supplies, the Marquise must build workshops, lumber mills, and recruiters while crafting valuable infrastructure improvements.\nThe Eyrie muster their hawks to take back the woods. They must build roosts and capture as much territory as possible before they collapse back into squabbling and turmoil, choosing a new commander to guide them.\nThe Alliance hide in the shadows, recruiting forces and hatching conspiracies. They begin slowly and build toward a dramatic late-game presence\u2014but only if they can manage to keep the other players in check.\nThe Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict for his own gain. He aids or fights other factions to earn their trust or ire, while picking through forest ruins in search of new equipment, all in service of his hidden, mysterious quest.\nRewards shipping to addresses within Australia, Canada, the EU, and the US will be shipped from within those countries.\nInternational shipments will be subject to customs charges depending on the country to which you are shipping.

Like we said in our campaign use it any place, any time. By the way, we can give you the reassurance that we will ship our product for two main reasons: one we are based of Hong Kong one of the biggest ports in the world shipping products every where in the world, and we will work with the best to get the product to our backers, and two China is so close that we will be able to fix any issue with the assembly line at any time within hours. So rest assured that we will give you the best posible product available on the market. In respect to our product we have developed a product that will not only give you cold or hot at the push of a button, but we have actually taken the time to think about the person that`s going to use our product. We have created a simplistic user interaction, so that a child will know how to use our product. We have also created a more traditional style of watch, making it even more user friendly so that anyone can use it. Our interchangeable straps will give you the confidence that you need to be able to wear your Aircon Watch with any clothes you desire. Apart from all those things we think that we live in a world were wireless technology is a must, so why would you connect your watch to an ugly cable. The Aircon Watch uses a magnetically attached wireless charging that we will provide in the box. For this and many other reason even simple ones like being able to have the time and date. We will continue to develop our product, and to make it the best posible one on the market. \nThank you so much for all the great support that you have given us and we look forward to continue. \nLife has many troubles and some of them are defined by climate. Maybe you are too hot on a summer\u2019s day and wish you could take all your clothes off. Or, perhaps you are too cold during winter and can\u2019t even send a text because your hands are too shaky from shivering. \nWhy we can apply this to our body?\nA close look at the complex systems that keep us functioning can inspire awe. Such is the case with the body's complicated temperature-regulating mechanism. This intricate apparatus balances heat production with heat loss, keeping the body at a temperature just right for optimal function. This balancing act is directed automatically and seamlessly by the hypothalamus, a small portion of the brain that serves as the command center for numerous bodily functions, including the coordination of the autonomic nervous system. Much like a thermostat regulates the temperature inside your home, the hypothalamus regulates your body temperature, responding to internal and external stimuli and making adjustments to keep the body within one or two degrees of 98.6 degrees.  Ref:1\nHow it works?\nWhat if we could change the signal that our nervous system sends to the brain by using the Aircon watch to generate pulses of heat or cold. With this method we can make our body start to feel more aware of the temperatures and thus stabilize our sensations\nAccording to a 2012 research conducted by Standford University, with a cooling glove, heat exchange is possible through the extremities especially the wrist and palms area. Ref:5\nPLAY\n\nThe Core or shell temperature is 36 degrees Celsius (98.6 F) and the skin or surface temperature is usually with an average of 33 degrees Celsius (91.4 F), but reaching 36 to 37 under conditions of heavy work in the heat. On the other hand, it can drop considerably during whole-body and local exposure to cold; tactile sensitivity occurs between 15 and 20 \u00b0C, whereas the critical temperature for manual dexterity is between 12 and 16 \u00b0C. The upper and lower pain threshold values for are approximately 43 \u00b0C and 10 \u00b0C, respectively. (Kenney)     \nThe Aircon watch maintains does temperatures, demonstrated in the test video, reaching the lowest temperature of 12 degrees Celsius and reaching a max temperature of 40 degrees Celsius. These temperatures do not disrupt the upper and lower pain threshold. what it does allow us is to reach faster surface cooling temperatures, 28 degrees Celsius or 82 F.  \n While the Aircon watch gives you the sufficient temperatures to allow your body to feel the changes, we have to remember that this pulse of heat and cold come in intervals of 15 seconds on and 15 seconds off.  \n This Method makes the battery last longer and by sending these pulses of temperature change your body can react each time as if it was a new sensation.  \n We have selected the wrist as the best possible place to use our technology, since a lot of major blood vessels and nerves are closer to the skin in this area of the body, and thus giving us the best chance to achieve the most effective temperature changes. (point, n.d.)  \n The pulse points. These areas of the body are most commonly known are very effective when trying to bring your temperature down or raising it, usually people run warm or cold water on their wrist to achieve this effect, but what we are proposing is similar to what WUSA 9 news tried during a segment earlier this year. project video thumbnail PLAY (wusa9 news, n.d.)  \nPLAY\n\nBibliography  \n(n.d.).

This tiny device will fit on the inner wrist in an area where the nerves are closer to the skin surface so as to allow for maximum transfer of temperature. The watch can be used during any temperature, any season or any time zone.\nImagine that you putting an ice cube on your pulse points (think wrists and sides of your neck) or running them under cold water will cool you down instantly. Since the blood vessels in those areas are close to the surface of your skin, the cold will bring your body temp down much quicker. Ref:6\nWhy does this technique work?\nAbstract, Physical work, high ambient temperature and wearing protective clothing can elevate body temperature and cardiovascular strain sufficiently to degrade performance and induce heat-related illnesses. We have recently developed an Arm Immersion Cooling System (AICS) for use in military training environments and this paper will review literature supporting such an approach and provide details regarding its construction. Extremity cooling in cool or cold water can accelerate body (core temperature) cooling from 0.2 to 1.0 \u00b0C/10 min vs. control conditions, depending on the size/surface area of the extremity immersed. Arm immersion up to the elbow results in greater heat loss than hand- or foot-only immersion and may reduce cardiovascular strain by lowering heart rate by 10\u201325 beats/min and increase work tolerance time by up to 60%. The findings from studies in this paper support the use of AICS prototypes, which have been incorporated as part of the heat stress mitigation procedures employed in US Army Ranger Training and may have great application for sports and occupational use. ( This is an existing military products references) Ref:2\n Your place, your rules\nDoing any outdoor activity most times depends on the temperature and the climate. On the other hand, being inside all depends on if your heater or air conditioner is on and using up electricity. The Aircon watch offers the convenience that you need by freeing you from an energy wasting air conditioner, never limiting you to the outside temperature, and all within the form of a small watch.\nOffice Man\nNo worries! As we know, there are many people wearing suits even in the summer time, or uniforms in outdoor work, now you have the solution.\nOutdoor Lover\nIf you go running or outdoor photography Aircon Watch could be your best friend.\nMenopause \nOne of the reasons why we developed this product was to help women during menopause. Menopause often has hot flashes which can be extremely annoying to the extent where it becomes painful. But what if you could get some relief from a small device that emits a soothing cool temperature.\nWhy we need it in the office?\nIt may be the middle of summer, but you\u2019d never know from looking around offices, where, on the hottest days of the year, it\u2019s not uncommon to see workers wrapped up in sweaters at their desks. As temperatures outside rise, most corporate office buildings become hermetically sealed, air-conditioned ice cubes, forcing workers everywhere to grab a Snuggie. In a study of government office buildings, for instance, 60% of workers complained of thermal stress\u2013that they\u2019re too hot or too cold in their workplace. Why can\u2019t we manage to keep offices at a comfortable temperature? Ref.2\nMen are fine in shirt-sleeves, but the women have to wear cardigans and scarves. \nFirst, the metabolic rate varies enormously\u2014depending on height, weight, fitness, the type of work, and of course, gender. Women usually have both lower height and weight, and a higher percentage of body fat than men. In fact modern researchers reckon women pump out about a third less heat than men do, and so don't need as much cooling. \nThe second problem is also obvious\u2014women tend to wear lighter clothing, and expose more skin. In an office you don't often see a man's naked knees. Ref.2\nSame room different temperature\nIn the office or at home, everyone might have different temperatures.\nWithin a lot of research, we've found the answer.\nSleep Discomfort\nHaving those dreaded night sweats and you can\u2019t turn on the air conditioner because your wife has cold hand?\nNight Sweating and Cold Hands  \n If you suffer from night sweats and cold hands, you can now finally have a cozy night.\n Climbing\nOutdoor Activities \nIf you like climbing, running, biking, outdoor photography, Aircon Watch could be your best friend.\n Tested  \nThe Aircon Watch has been tested with more than a hundred people and using several prototypes. Our experienced design team has worked for more than two years in research and development, to improve Aircon Watch and reach the design and level that we are at today.\nSee what our beta tester say\n   Charging connector \n5 Seconds\nAircon Watch can raise temperature in just 5 seconds, because we have improved the thermal electricity technology by using Climacon (patent pending) Technology, which is faster way to cool down the thermal system. There is a problem of the thermal pad, it releases heat when generating cold, this technology usually needs a heat sink to reduce the temperature of the pad to make it cooler. We have spent 2 years improving the reduction of heat, in order to make more efficient.\nGlobal Warming  \nGlobal warming is gradually destroying the Earth\u2019s entire ecosystem, so why not turn that A/C off and turn on the AirCon Watch. It most definitely will help keep your pocket fuller and your body cooler.\nProduct Spec\nMaterial of the frame: Aluminum Alloy  \nMaterial of the strap: Silicone  \nBattery type: Li-ion  \nBattery size: 400mAh\nStandby time: 48 hours  \nBattery time: 4 hours for cooling mode and 8 hours of heating mode \nScreen type: OLED  \nWater resistance  \nCharging system: Contact Charging  \nAccessories included: Magnetic charger, USB cable.\nShare our page to any of your friends or family to let them know there is new way of climate control : ) \nSharing will enrich everyone with more knowledge.\nAna Monnar (*1954, Cuban-born, founder of Readers Are Leaders U.S.A.)\nClick Icon Directly\n\nNeed help?

However, you must first learn how to live on the island by cultivating the land, befriending villagers, expanding the village and raising your very own magical creatures known as Magnus. \nVenture around the land of Ethia where Vokka island resides to reclaim your memories, but this is no easy task as the world is filled with dangerous Magnus and threatening challenges. \nRe:Legend is heavily inspired by awesome games such as Rune Factory, Digimon World, Fantasy Life and Monster Rancher series. We love monster raising! <3\n                                                    Taming and Raising Magnus  \nMythical creatures known as Magnus roam the land of Ethia, and every single one of them is tamable. They will aid you in many ways such as during combat, farming, fishing, traveling and more. They will also grow and evolve depending on your care, so each of them has unique evolution conditions. Once the Magnus has grown enough and you have gain their trust, you can mount them and use their abilities at will. These abilities will be helpful in your adventure in many ways so make sure to take good care of them!  \n                                                                     Multiplayer\nYou can enjoy the game alone, but why not share the fun with your friends and family? Carry out the activities together and share precious memories!\nGameplay wise, there are plenty of activities that you can experience with your friends. One example would be farming, where you can split the workload between the players and everyone could master a specific part of the job. Different Magnus are better at different jobs, so each of the player can choose a different Magnus suited for different parts of farming. If having Magnus do your chores seems too cruel, you can always do it the traditional way by farming manually. Having friends will speed up the progress significantly.\nMost of the features in the game are built around multiplayer so you will able to enjoy your friend's company throughout the game.\nWe believe that games are meant to be played together so we\u2019re focusing on multiplayer since the early stages. These are just some of the features that have been confirmed and there\u2019s still plenty of room for improvement as we are still experimenting with different ideas. More will be added in the future.  \nNumber of Players: 1 - 4\n                                                                       Farming  \nVokka island\u2019s fertile ground is perfect for crop cultivation, be it on land or underwater. You can plant plenty of crops all year long with different species of plants to be cultivated with each coming season. Each crop can be sold for gold or used to improve your progression in the game. Beside crops, you can also keep and breed the fish that you have caught around the world in your farm. You can let them swim freely in your farm!  \n                                                                      Life Skills \nPractice makes perfect! You gain life skills as you practice them frequently. They level-up passively as you carry out the activities so it is crucial to practice the skill that you want to master as much as you can. Example of life skills: Mining, Fishing, Logging, Cooking, Crafting, Farming, Weaponry and much more! \n                                                                       Story\nWaking up with no memory of your past, you will start your adventure to discover fragments of your memories that were scattered across the land. Each fragment will reveal more about your past and allow you to understand the world a little better. \nYou will find more leads about your memories as you start to develop Vokka Village further throughout the game. People in the village will lend you a hand in uncovering your identity during your adventure so take your time to expand the village. Beside your memories, there's also more to discover as you explore the world!\n                                                             Character customization\nWe feel that it's important for everyone to bring their own uniqueness to Re:Legend, especially because multiplayer is such an important part of the game. To make sure that everyone is special in their own way, you will be able to customize the character to your liking during character creation. Customizable parts will include hair style, hair color, eyes, pupil color, skin color, clothes and so on.\nArmors can be used as vanity as well to mask over the current equipment that you are wearing. If you love how the armor looks but dislike the stats, just wear it as vanity and you will look exactly the way you want without affecting your stats. \n                                                  Building and Expanding Your Village \nVokka Village is where your new life begins! Befriend local villagers and celebrate exciting festivals while having a good time together. Pay attention to their needs and help them out in their daily lives, and they will reward you accordingly. You can recruit more villagers into the village during your adventure, and having more villagers will expand the village. This will allow you to gain access to better resources, and who knows you might even develop a romantic interest in one of them?!\nWe believe that music is the soul of a game because it bring out best in it by triggering a player's emotion throughout their journey in the game world. In order to deliver the best experience for you guys, we're collaborating with none other than the legendary Video Game Orchestra(VGO)! Video Game Orchestra is a Boston-based ensemble that has recorded for huge blockbuster franchises like Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts (Square Enix) to Cytus (Rayark) and Mages of Mystralia (Borealys Games). Their recorded works have been nominated multiple times for Best Soundtrack within various circles, and is internationally renown for its quality and musicality.\nTheir experience and knowledge from those huge titles will be applied to Re:Legend so everything will be blended seamlessly from scene to scene. Audio will be extremely dynamic so you will be able to feel the exact mood of the specific game situation.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nHere are the sample OST that was composed by our star composers for Re:Legend. Hope you guys enjoy it!\nWhile Vokka Island is a peaceful and relaxing place, the outside world is definitely not! There are different regions around Vokka Island and each is a dangerous area filled with wild Magnus. It is always a wise choice to bring along your trusted Magnus before heading out.\nWe have planned 5 different regions so far and each of them will house unique Magnus in their respective ecosystem. There are plenty of exclusive Magnus in those regions that cannot be encountered in other regions where the region\u2019s exclusive Magnus has different strength in terms of their abilities and growth. They will be able to help you in specific sections of your journey so take your time to understand their strengths and raise them carefully.\nThe direction that we are aiming for is a combination of cute and cool so we went with the chibi anime style. We hope that you will enjoy what you see!  \nWe're spending a lot of time taking the monsters from 2D concept art to 3D assets since we want to create a unique feel for the monsters, ranging from distinct physical features to special interaction animations.\nHere\u2019s some of the sample concept that we have developed, enjoy!\nRe:Legend's concept was conceived around December 2015 and we were actually half way through the development. Back then the project had another name and we had poured so much time and effort into it that some of us had our health crippled. But in the end, it was cancelled due to our investor's financial difficulties and more than a year worth of effort was flushed down the drain and destroyed before our very eyes. That was the darkest time of our life and all of us were so lost that we had no idea what to do anymore.\nShortly after the cancellation of the previous project, we put a lot of thought into it and we decided that we had ventured too far to give up on the game, especially after it became one of the top Square Enix Collective projects. It would have been a shame to disappoint those who had taken their time and voted for us during the campaign\u2015it is thanks to them that Re:Legend exists today. \nWe strove to achieve the same result we had with our previous project ever since, and to our delight, Re:Legend is currently the best supported project in Square Enix Collective's history. In fact, we didn't just meet our goal but surpassed it several times over. To everyone who voted for us, you guys are really awesome! We couldn't have made it without your help.\nAfter the major success of our Square Enix Collective campaign, we realized that Re:Legend has huge potential and we want to make it the best it can be. Expectations were really high from you guys and we figured that it would be impossible for our tiny team to fulfill them. This is why we're starting this campaign: To realize the full potential of the game! \nSGD $30(USD $21) Standard Tier - Digital Copy of the game, Backer- exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $50(USD $36) Standard Duo Tier - Digital Copy of the game x2, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $55(USD $40) Digital Collector Tier - Digital Copy of the game, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $70(USD $50) Beta Collector Tier - Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $100(USD $70) Draconewt Tamer Tier - LIMITED Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $100(USD $70) Momochi Tamer Tier - LIMITED Momochi Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $140(USD $99) Master Tamer Tier - LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $210(USD $150) Art Collector Tier - Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x2, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $305(USD $220) Strategic Collector Tier - Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $420(USD $300) Blacksmith Tier - Design a weapon of your choice, Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $700(USD $500) Villager Tier - Immortalized as an NPC in the village, Design a weapon of your choice, Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $1040(USD $750) Legendary Tamer Tier - Design a Magnus consist of 3 evolution stages, Immortalized as an NPC in the village, Design a weapon of your choice, Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $1400(USD $1000) Boss Designer Tier - Design a main story Boss, Design a Magnus consist of 3 evolution stages, Immortalized as an NPC in the village, Design a weapon of your choice, Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nSGD $7000(USD $5000) Game Producer Tier - Become Re:Legend's Producer(Receive monthly Producer exclusive updates and provide creative input), Design a main story Boss, Design a Magnus consist of 3 evolution stages, Immortalized as an NPC in the village, Design a weapon of your choice, Backer-exclusive Weapon & Armor Vanity Set, Digital Strategy Guide, Physical original concept Artbook, LIMITED Momochi & Draconewt Plushie, Early Backer Beta Access, Digital Copy of the game x4, Digital original concept artbook, Backer-exclusive wallpaper, Thank you letter & your name in Re:Legend Credits.\nRe:Legend is currently being developed by a small team of 6 up to date since October 2016.

It is not an expansion to Gloomhaven, but a stand-alone Euro project that features a unique mix of tile placement, action selection, hand management, worker placement, and blind bidding.\nAll 18 stretch goals are included in all copies of the game!\n  In Founders of Gloomhaven, you will have control of a number of resources that you can place on the board as tiles.\nYou must combine your own resource tiles with those of your opponents to create more advanced resource tiles, and then deliver these resources to prestige buildings to earn points.\nThis is all accomplished through your decks of action cards. On your turn, you can play a card to take a variety of actions:\nTrade: Placing resource tiles or buying access to others' resources.\nRecruit: Hiring adviser cards to add to your deck, giving you more influence and extra powerful actions.\nUpgrade: Building advanced resources to increase your income and scoring opportunities.\nConstruct: Erecting personal buildings like houses and bridges, which will give you more control over the board state.\nYou can also call a vote, which will retrieve all the cards you have played, but doing so will allow all other players to collect income, and then it will trigger a blind vote on which new prestige building gets placed on the board and where it gets placed.\nPrestige buildings offer the major scoring opportunities in the game, so you would do well to control the vote whenever possible by spending influence, making sure the building which scores the resources you control is built.\nInterested in trying it out? No problem! One of my main Kickstarter goals is to give everyone the chance to really get in there and play the game before they back the project.\nThere are two main ways you can sit down and give the game a test drive.\nFirst of all, if you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, you can follow this link to the Founders of Gloomhaven module. There's no automation to the file, so you will still need the rule book handy.\nAlternately, you can download the print-and-play files to construct your own physical copy of the game. Currently we just have a high-ink version, but there will be a more printer-friendly version very shortly.\nHigh-Ink: [Double-sided 11x17 cardstock (2 pages)], [Single-sided 11x17 cardstock (8 pages)], [Map board]. (There are two copies of each tile so you can tape/glue them together to give the cardstock more weight and avoid any bleed issues.)\nLow-ink: [Full file - includes map] (Print it all single-sided, then tape/glue together the front and back of each tile.)\nKeep in mind that in all these versions, the art and design is not final and is subject to change.\nOr if you just want to watch someone else play the game, we have you well-covered there, too.\nIntroductory game play through from Rahdo:\nTwo-player full game run through from Tom Heath:\nThree-player full game run through from JonGetsGames:\nFour-player full game run through from Heavy Cardboard:\nSolo full game run through from Rolling Solo:\n      New to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board.  \nBecoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps:\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the city!\n$10 for shipping is included in the base price, which means there is no extra shipping charge for the US, Canada or China. All additional shipping fees for other countries are added automatically when you pledge.\nIn addition, the game will be fulfilled from distribution centers in the US, Canada, the EU, Australia, Singapore, and China, so there will be no customs fees for backers in these regions.\nAlso note you can pledge for additional copies of the game by manually increasing your pledge amount, and you only have to pay the extra shipping fee for every three copies of the game. And don't worry if you can't do the math - the pledge manager will sort you out after the project ends.\nI am no stranger to slaying rats, destroying skeletons, and defacing board game components to honor and commemorate my wonderful Kickstarter supporters. This time around, however, instead of destroying things, I want to build.\nFor anyone who pledges a single dollar to the campaign, I will toil away in a variety of city-building video games and erect a grand structure in your name. This will be caught on camera, of course, for you to marvel at and cherish for years to come. You can watch the videos linked above to get a feel for what this will look like.\nThe main reward level will get you a copy of Founders of Gloomhaven, plain and simple, with no further effort required. All stretch goals are included.\nThere will be no add-ons, no Kickstarter exclusives, just the game delivered to your doorstep before it comes out in retail, at a significant discount off the expected retail price ($60-$70, depending on stretch goals).\nNot only that, but pledging to the Kickstarter gives you a chance to watch and interact with the game as it develops. You will get weekly updates on the progress and development of the game.\nI love bringing games to Kickstarter because it gives me a chance to collaborate with this community, taking suggestions from the game's fans and using them to make the game better.\nFounders of Gloomhaven has been in development for over a year, and I am really excited to get it out into the world. As with all my designs, I believe it offers something unique and innovative to this great hobby, adding an incredibly high level of player interaction to the city-building genre and melding many disparate mechanics into a cohesive and engaging design.\nOnce you have played it, I hope you will feel the same way.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games.

I will always let you know.\n\nAdmittedly, my delivery estimates have been off in the past, but with those mistakes in mind, I firmly believe that January is a very realistic goal to deliver this game to you.\n\nThere is a lot of art left to do, as well as some graphic design and making sure any mechanical changes or additions brought on by the Kickstarter process are implemented well, but all of us are dedicated to delivering this game to you in a timely manner.\n\nI also stand by the quality of the game and my customer service.

Sensible Object here. In 2016 we Kickstarted our digital-tabletop-stacking-meets-strategy game Beasts of Balance (then called Fabulous Beasts), shipped it on time and got a bunch of amazing reviews. Now we're back with a huge gameplay expansion and gorgeous new pieces to collect. Whether you're a beginner balancer or seasoned stacker, read on to find out what we have in store for you...\n(Already played the original game? Skip down a section!)\nBeasts of Balance is an award-winning game of dexterity, strategy and creation. Players take on the role of Divine Creators, tasked to play solo or with friends to build worlds and reach high scores by stacking magical Artefacts into incredible towers. But this is no standard dexterity game - everything added to the tower interacts with a world that evolves on a wirelessly connected digital device. Stack an Octopus and *poof* you\u2019ve just made a digital Octopus! Add a Migrate Artefact and *shazam* you\u2019ve turned it into a land-dwelling Rocktopus! There\u2019s real skill in deciding on the next piece to add to the stack, and it takes smarts and teamwork to build high-scoring towers and find the most elusive beasts.\n (To see a Let\u2019s Play video of the co-op game, click here.)\nThis time round we've made some small-but-lovely changes to the Beasts of Balance core game box. It's slightly smaller (11.4\" x 11.4\" x 4.3\" / 290mm x 290mm x 110mm), and the inserts have been redesigned to allow more space for extra pieces. Apart from that everything else is exactly the same, meaning that the contents of the box are identical to the original edition.\nEveryone up to speed now? Great. Time to share the exciting new stuff we want to make for you! There are three main things in this expansion: Battles, three new Beasts, and Legendaries.\nBattles sees you graduate to the next part of your training. Under the short-tempered gaze of Alberick, spirit of the volcano, it's time to learn the art of war. If you can master the mysterious, destructive Primal Power, then you'll best your rivals.  \nTwo to three players each take on the role of a Divine Creator of a single region: Land, Sea or Sky. The aim of the game is to fill your region with powerful beasts, while stealing and smiting those of your opponents. \nPrimal Power enters your world though a deck of 16 unique NFC Battle Cards. They are used by scanning them on the Plinth, just like the Artefacts. Each player wields a hand of these cards, enabling them to invoke a whole host of weird and wonderful effects on the digital realm. Some are focussed on attack, some will aid in defence, and some will manifest in much more random ways\u2026\n(To see prototypes of all 16 cards, click here.)\nBattles takes all the physical pieces from the core game and gives you an adrenaline-filled competitive way of playing with them. In Battles, skilful stacking is even more important, as disturbing the tower means Alberick rains down fiery lava damage on your beasts (and your beasts only)! So build carefully, or see your lead evaporate with one ill-timed collapse...\nAnd finally, each Divine Creator chooses a digital avatar in the form of a Guardian. Guardians manifest your will in the form of lightning bolts, tidal waves and dirty great lumps of earth. They also have special, customisable powers that modify the game in interesting, strategic ways...\nThere's so much more that we're looking forward to sharing with you as the campaign progresses. We're incredibly excited about all of this new stuff, especially how the three game systems (digital / cards / stacking) combine to make a game that's full of depth, variety, strategy and FUN.  \nWhether you're a seasoned tabletop gamer looking for something truly unique to bring out at your regular games night, or a parent looking for a game designed to get whole families playing together, we can\u2019t wait for you to try it!\n(To see a Let\u2019s Play video of Battles Mode in paper prototype form, click here.)\nA new expansion of Beasts of Balance wouldn't be complete without some more beasts to balance! We've chosen these based on conversations with you, our Kickstarter community, for their perfect formula of:\n(Cute + Weird) x (Fun To Stack + Makes Cool Hybrids) =\nIn the beginning, there was the Omnibeast. A legendary creature born of pure Star Energy and plastic granules. A beast that, when summoned by a deity, would do something special and strange to your weird little world.\nAnd now we've discovered another Legendary!\nLegend tells of an extremely grumpy old dragon with a bit of a beer gut and a ridiculous name. A dragon so unwaveringly cranky that he was banished to far off lands and left to stew in his own fug until he was called forth to battle again.\nMAGMAAARGH brings an additional layer of strategy to the game once summoned by his special card. He's worth *a lot* of points if you have him in your region, but in order to keep him you'll need to feed him Star Energy. Leave him hungry for too long though, or let him take too much damage, and that temper will flair up and things might just turn ugly.\nAnd don't even try to imagine what a half-dragon-half-warthog hybrid looks like. Woo-ee!\n(To find out more about these add-ons, click here.)\n(For a more in-depth look at co-op gameplay take a look at this Let's Play we made last year.)\nWe love Kickstarter, especially you, the Kickstarter community, who were instrumental in allowing us to make Beasts of Balance in the first place. You backed us with your hard earned cash and then you gave us awesome feedback and even better vibes. And that's why we're back. You asked for more stuff, so we're making more stuff. This time around though we're a little older, greyer and wiser. We've shipped our first game, first to our backers and then to retail; we've deepened our manufacturing and logistics partnerships around the world; we've hired some amazing new people. All of which has given us a much greater level of confidence that you'll love your rewards and that you'll get them on time. Don't get us wrong, unexpected things will happen. Spanners will fall and curve balls will be thrown, but our skills, experience and track record mean that we're as confident as we can be that we can handle most things. Except a zombie apocalypse. Possibly.\nWe've learned a lot about shipping over the past 18 months (it's a rather complicated beast to balance) and we're focussed on avoiding the pitfalls that hit us last time (navigating Canadian customs; which courier not to use when shipping to Australia; why is Norway so...different, etc etc).\nLast time round we set the shipping fees upfront, and it...didn't work out so well for us. So this time we'll be following the lead of a lot of other tabletop Kickstarter campaigns and will add on the shipping cost through our pledge manager after the campaign has ended and you've given us your shipping details. This will be done at cost, so we won't make any money from shipping.  \nBelow is a list of our estimated costs, but please keep in mind that the more stuff you back, the higher the cost. These estimates are for shipping the Beasts of Balance core game box in November 2017, with all add-ons and stretch goals following in a second shipment in March 2018. Once the campaign has ended, cheaper shipping options will be available for those who pledge at tiers 3, 4, 6 & 8 and who opt to have all of their rewards delivered in a single shipment in March 2018.\n*Tier 1: Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, Taiwan, Malaysia.\nTier 2: Japan, UAE, Israel, Turkey, Kuwait.\nNon-EU Europe: Norway, Switzerland.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing:\n\nBeasts of Balance is already in the market and has enjoyed both extremely positive customer reviews and very low hardware defect rates ( <0.5%). We're constantly working to optimize the hardware and software to make the game even more stable and easy to use. Adding new components such as the new Beasts, Legendaries and Battle Cards does increase complexity, but we'll be working hard with our manufacturing partners and QA team to ensure that quality is as high as it's always been.\n\nDigital Development:\n\nWe will continue to build out digital features using Unity, which is an extremely well supported cross platform game engine that helps ensure we can deploy app updates compatible with a broad range of iOS and Android devices at a regular cadence. However, as with all software development, there is always the risk of unforeseen challenges and gnarly issues that can slow down development or make certain features that much harder to ship in a given timeframe. We will, however, always be as transparent as possible with our player community in the unlikely event that we need to delay or drop digital features.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter",

I am not a \"professional\" musician anymore, but I will never stop being a musician. We can't all get paid to do what we love, but we all need outlets to do the things that bring us life. For me it is sharing my heart and my hope through creating and recording music. \nFor almost 20 years, Cool Hand Luke has been my primary creative outlet, and it has been a profound honor. You, the supporters of this music, have all been so kind to me and Cool Hand Luke over the years. Cool Hand Luke has never been simply music or simply entertainment. We have always wanted it to be an honest testimony to what it means to be a struggling human being, in light of the gospel of Jesus Christ. If the music points you somewhere, the hope is that it points you not to our merch page, but to Jesus himself. \n\"Cora\" is no exception. It is born out of my wrestling with death, existential questions of vocation, faith, relationships, and purpose. As heavy as all of those things sound, I have had a lot of fun writing these songs, and I've learned a lot through the process. \nAs the fun part of the process comes to an end, I'd like to ask you to consider coming alongside me to bring this record to fruition. I am seeking to raise $8,000 to cover the costs of recording, mixing, and mastering \"Cora,\" as well as the production of CD's and vinyl. \nWith the exception of a 7\" back in the day, Cool Hand Luke has never released any vinyl. My hope is that I will be able to make enough from the sales of \"Cora\" to fund the vinyl releases of previous Cool Hand Luke albums. So many people ask, \"Why don't you release______________ on vinyl?\" The answer is simple: it's is SO stinking expensive. So, hopefully this will help get the ball rolling on that. \nAlso, I am writing music all the time. I have plans for a conceptual worship album, some more piano and string-based music, and some more rockers. I'm hoping that the release of music will sustain the further release of music. So please consider supporting Cool Hand Luke, through contributing to the Kickstarter for \"Cora.\" May the peace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.\n-Mark Nicks", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main challenge for this project is the vinyl production. It is by far the most expensive component.

It has a simple design with endless possibilities that will test your creativity and dexterity. Play with MOKURU for fun or sharpen your skills and style to become a master. You can even play MOKURU with friends. It\u2019s totally up to you! \nIn Japan, \u201cwood\u201d translates to \u201cmoku\u201d, and \u201cflipping\u201d translates to \u201ckuru\u201d. That\u2019s how we came up with the name, \u201cMOKURU\u201d.\nThe Basic Level is simple. Tip MOKURU over gently, and it will flip. Once you get the hang of it, you can get creative and start inventing your own unique tricks! Check out the videos below for some tricks and examples of the different mastery levels - Basic, Advanced and Expert!\nFLIP: Use one finger to flip MOKURU from left to right.\nSQUARE: Flip MOKURU at four points to draw a square.\nTRIANGLE: Flip MOKURU at three points to draw a triangle.\nFLIP & HOLD: Use one finger to flip MOKURU from left to right. Catch and hold it on your hand after you flip MOKURU.\nFLIP & KISS: Use one MOKURU to flip another MOKURU from left to right or up and down.\nBIG SQUARE: Use two MOKURU to create squares with both hands.\nAIR TRAPEZE: Use one finger to flip MOKURU from left to right. Catch and hold it on your hand after you flip MOKURU. Turn it 360 degrees and make it stand up straight.\nTWIN: Use two MOKURU and move them in tandem with one hand.\nFIVE MOVES: Use five MOKURU and move them in tandem with one hand. Balancing each MOKURU is an exceptionally difficult challenge!\nVERSUS: On a large table, flip the MOKURU back and forth between one another.\nMARATHON: With three or more friends, keep flipping the MOKURU down the table continuously.\nThis limited-edition stand is only available to Kickstarter backers!\nMOKURU is truly suitable for anyone! Just playing with MOKURU for a few minutes a day can help you sharpen your focus and hand-eye coordination. No matter what tricks you decide to practice, playing with MOKURU can give you endless hours of fun and joy!\nThe great news is that you can play with MOKURU anywhere you like! During development, it was extremely important to us that the design of MOKURU was one that would look great anywhere, from your home to the bar or your office desk. When it comes to when and where you can play with MOKURU, there are no limits.\nVideo demonstration for MOKURU mat - Bring your game into next level!  \nMOKURU Drawstring bag with Carabiner. You can bring and play it anywhere!\nMOKURU was created in 2010 by Mr. Masakazu Node (\u91ce\u51fa\u6b63\u548c). Born in Tokyo in 1966 as the first son of his family, he joined the toy-making industry with his sights set on becoming an \u201cAdmirable Father\u201d.\nHis motto is simple, \u201cDon't create toys that are safe and easy to play; create toys that can bring joy and happiness.\u201d\n\u201cThe concept of MOKURU can be traced back to around 20 years ago when my friend and craft artist, Mr. Toshio Sato, shaped MOKURU. I was impressed by the design and Mr. Sato agreed to let me turn MOKURU into a next generation skill toy. After extensively testing various designs, we have worked hard to establish the perfect of size, shape and materials for MOKURU. Today, we are happy to bring MOKURU to the world.\u201d - Masakazu Node (\u91ce\u51fa\u6b63\u548c)\nEvery now and then, an object comes along that reinvents how you play. After testing a variety of hand-crafted prototypes with different materials, we've tweaked each detail to arrive at the MOKURU you see today.\nWe have a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of MOKURU.\nThat\u2019s where you come in!  \nMOKURU has been an idea we've been dying to bring to market since it was first conceived in 2010. The product you're seeing in this project is from our initial production test run. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nWe are very excited to get MOKURU into your hands. We're going to continue to work day and night until the very last MOKURU has shipped.\n  Please help us spread the word about MOKURU!\nWe know that not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can\u2019t purchase your own MOKURU, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of! The larger the MOKURU community, the better! We couldn\u2019t do this without you.\nA BIG thank you to Satoshi for the wonderful video and photographs.

The game will be widely available in retail this August/September, so you can pick it up there!\nIt's time to join the adventure! Whether you are a veteran mercenary or this is your first foray into the wilds of Gloomhaven, I am happy to have you on board.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge to receive a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven, complete with new health and experience trackers and a revised rule book and scenario book. Your game will come with miniatures for all the character classes, but you can also purchase extra sets of miniatures and standees.\nIf you already own the game, you can pledge to receive just the upgraded trackers and revised books. In addition, there is also an all-new mini expansion of 17 solo scenarios available.\n If you want to learn how to play Gloomhaven, these two Gaming Rules! videos are all you need.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards to determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nPhoto courtesy of Jinha Yoon\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time, this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up, which will also give them access to more powerful, higher level ability cards.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase useful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nAs players interact with the town through events and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing personal quests. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter, and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like to learn more about the game play, you can find a PDF of the rule book here, or you can watch another overview video:\nOr a game play video:\nAre you ready to start the adventure? Becausewe have started a community-driven expedition that I would love you to participate in.\nJust head on over to the first update to find out what it is all about and join in on the adventure. You won't regret it!\nIf you don't have the physical game in front of you, that's not a problem. There are still plenty of ways to participate. If you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, each scenario in the community-driven campaign is available as a separate workshop file. (Scenario 1) (Scenario 2) (Scenario 3) (Scenario 4) (Scenario 5) (Scenario 6) (Scenario 7) (Scenario 8) (Scenario 9)\nOr you can follow along and watch as the following groups play through the scenarios every third day.\nMike Bennett's YouTube stream is scheduled for 3pm EDT (19:00 GMT).\nAlucard's Twitch stream is scheduled for 7pm EDT (23:00 GMT).\nIf you're just joining us and want to get caught up on the story, you can find everything you need to know here.\nEither way, the important thing is that, when you are ready, I want you to vote on what happens next. This campaign is being run by and for you, and I'm just excited to see where it goes!\nBut the extra adventures don't end when the Kickstarter ends! Starting in November of this year, after everyone has had time to receive their games and enjoy them for a while, we will starting a brand new community driven expedition.\nThe number of scenarios in the new expedition will be directly tied to this Kickstarter's funding goal. Every $100,000 past $2 million will add a new scenario to the expedition. It's going to be huge!\n\n\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board. Becoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps: \\\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nImmediately after I was finished working on Gloomhaven, I realized I wasn't done with the world. I wanted to make a set of scenarios specifically designed for strategic solo play - scenarios that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each class and force players to really get under the hood and learn to play each class masterfully.\nPDFs of these scenarios and the accompanying item rewards are already available online, but now you can pledge $10 to receive a printed version. This includes a 24-page scenario book of 17 all-new solo scenarios and a deck of 17 item cards - rewards for completing each of the missions.\nThe solo scenarios are not included in the base box, but you can add $10 to you pledge to receive them in addition.\nStrictly for those who already own the game, we are offering four health and experience trackers and revised rule and scenario books. These are already included in the reprint pledge, but are upgrades from the original version.\nYou can get the four dials for $7, the upgraded books for $15, and if you'd like the solo scenarios as well, you can bundle all three offers for $25.\nPDFs of the new rule book and scenario book are also available online.\nAnd if you are interested, you can order some cool third-party stuff like removable stickers from Sinister Fish Games and a nice wooden insert from Meeple Realty.\nThe second printing of Gloomhaven comes with a full set of miniatures for each of the 17 character classes. These add-ons are not needed, but if, for whatever reason, you want additional sets of miniatures or standees, you can add $20 to your pledge for additional sets of minis and $5 for additional sets of standees.\nBe forewarned that while the miniatures box comes spoiler-free, the standees will be delivered as a single bare punch-board and may ruin the surprise of some of the unlocked character images.\nGloomhaven is a big, heavy game, so you will need to pay shipping on every copy that you order. The good news is that the cost of shipping to the US is already included and subsidized elsewhere. The price for shipping in other regions per game box is listed in the first column.\nThe second column is the price of shipping when ordering up to six other items (this includes sets of HP/XP dials, the book upgrades, the solo scenarios, sets of miniatures, or sets of standees). The upgrade combo pack is considered three items. If you pledge for more than six items, you will need to pay the second column shipping price again.\nThere's more good news, though. If you order a copy of Gloomhaven and want to add to your pledge the solo scenarios and/or a set of standees, those items are small enough to fit into the game's shipping box, so you won't have to pay any additional shipping on them - just the one shipping price for the main box itself.\nAll of these shipping costs are added automatically when you pledge, but if you add more onto you pledge for additional items, you will have to add the additional shipping costs yourself.\nUnfortunately, I made some mistakes when setting up the initial pledge levels. If you live in the following countries, please use the alternate pledge levels (labeled DE and SG) to get the correct shipping price: Germany, Singapore, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Sorry for the confusion!\nPlease note! Shipping is US, Canada, China, and EU-friendly! You will not have to pay customs if you are in these regions.\nWhile pledging $1 won't get your name into every copy of Gloomhaven, it will get you into my personal copy of Gloomhaven.\nThat's right, I am going to take a sharpie to as many of my components as necessary to commemorate the names of everyone who pledges $1 or adds $1 to their pledge. Not only that, but I'll shoot a video of the whole sordid, game-defacing thing. It will be wonderful.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, three years ago, and its second game, Gloomhaven, was released to much acclaim in February.

We\u2019ve qualified the key component suppliers, narrowed down to 5 final ODMs, and even covered the details such as warehousing, shipping, taxes, packaging and a top class 3PL.\n\nAside from force majeure-level unforeseen circumstances, which are inherently impossible to predict, our only unknown and controlled variable is volume, as we cannot forecast exactly how many pre-orders we will gather \u2013 that\u2019s where you come in! The higher the campaign volume, the more our forecasted time to market accelerates.\n\nWe have thoroughly studied successful crowdfunding campaigns \u2013 including those that delivered on-time and those that delayed delivery \u2013 in order to learn and improve upon our own process. Though we are campaigners now, we have been backers before, and we know first-hand that time is of the essence.\n\nAll products shown in connection with this campaign are prototypes that demonstrate the intended function of the final device.

The primary components are the Bluetooth protocol, battery management, and user-focused design--areas we consider our strengths. There is no mobile application necessary with Jack, meaning ubiquitous device compatibility will be much simpler to achieve.\n\nThe primary risk is of production delays. Coordinating with an overseas factory and maintaining quality throughout every step is a challenge. Fulfillment and shipping becomes a hurdle when dealing with thousands of orders. We will not rush through these steps and will tackle them carefully, one by one. We will take our products to the \"design for manufacturing\" step soon, and the target is to ship out units is June 2017. \n\nThere is some risk that items will not come exactly as pictured, due to manufacturing considerations. The promised function will not be different, and any style changes if any will be iterative and non-significant to the original look and feel.\n\nWe are still involved in the distribution of our Podo cameras but since development and manufacturing setup is scheduled to finish before Jack production is started, the schedule of either product should not be affected.

This means more cables \u2013 cables that quickly get chaotic.\nECLIPSE is the only USB charging hub you won\u2019t want to hide away. With its compact and round design, it can live on your nightstand, desk, and even your wall using the included wall mount.\nUp to three of your USB cables are wound into their own precision-engineered channel, so you\u2019ll never have to worry about them tangling or overlapping. \nWe designed ECLIPSE to be as user-friendly as possible, so you can use the cables you already own (up to 8 feet).\nSince your cables are safe and secure in ECLIPSE, they\u2019ll be out of the way from everyday dangers like people tripping on them, rolling chairs, playful cats, and cable thieves (you know who you are).\nCable boxes and charging stations just hide your mess of cables and force you to untangle them before charging. With ECLIPSE, you can access your cables and unwind them to their maximum length easily and without frustration.\nECLIPSE comes with a braided power cable, essentially extending each of your charging cables by an extra 4 feet.\nECLIPSE exists to get rid of cable clutter, that's why the power cable comes with a genuine leather strap. If you don't need a full 4 feet for your power cable, just wrap it up and keep things neat.\nNow you only need one power socket for your daily charging needs. \nUnlike a lot of underpowered USB hubs out there, ECLIPSE uses smart IC technology to ensure that your devices are always charging at their maximum speed (up to 2.4A, and 3A via USB-C).\nAlways ahead of the curve? We hear you. For the early adopters among you, one of ECLIPSE\u2019s USB-A ports can be turned into a USB-C port.\nWhy would you trust a cheap power adaptor to charge your expensive tech? ECLIPSE uses an advanced transformer to guarantee safe currents that won\u2019t damage your devices\u2019 batteries in the long term.\nWith a single touch, ECLIPSE rises and emits a subtle halo, so you can forget about fumbling around for your cable in the dark. Tap it once more and its halo fades away - along with your cable frustration.\n  ECLIPSE is available with a Type A/B, Type C/E/F/J/L, Type G, or Type I electrical plug.\nNot sure what electrical plug type you need? Check out the list of electrical plugs by country. If ECLIPSE isn't available with your country's plug type, don't worry! It's 110-240V, so you can always use an adapter.\nAbout a year ago, we started to work on a new product with the ambition to transform the way we charge at home. After multiple design directions and prototypes, we are now in the final stage of the development. With your support, we will start the certifications process and open tooling to kick off production.\n  We did our research. We asked thousands of people and discovered that the average person owns 6 devices, but only charges 2 or 3 devices on a daily basis. \nArmed with this information, we went against the status quo. Instead of tons of USB ports, which only adds to our cable frustrations, we stuck to the essentials.Think you need more? Think again. How often do you charge more than 3 devices at the same time?  \nWe have been waiting for wireless charging to become the norm for years now, but the reality is, we're still very much in the cable era. Current technologies require a charging mat or puck that still needs a USB cable to be plugged in to a power source. The charging speed is slower, and you can't comfortably use your mobile device while it charges because it needs direct contact with the mat.\nFurthermore, there are different standards competing with each other (Qi, PMA, etc.) making this market still really niche. We decided that it was not worth increasing the total price and size of ECLIPSE by adding a wireless charging coil that would only benefit a limited number of users. However, ECLIPSE works with most wireless charging devices. Its flat wooden top will be the perfect support for any charging mat.\n      NATIVE UNION was born out of a shared passion for good design and well-made products. By combining the finest materials, functional design, and considered details, we create products with personality, that enhance the way you live with your tech. \nWant to write about ECLIPSE?

We Can Help!\nWhen your everyday pest exterminator just can't cut the snuff, give Douglas Circumstance Monster Extermination Company a holler! Zombies, spider mammoths, carnivorous splorgs, fire-breathing brains - no matter what the infestation, you name it, we exterminate it!\nDouglas Circumstance is a classic PC platform shooter set in a world full of memorable monsters and animated characters. It's a unique combination of pixel-perfect platforming, twitch shooting, and secret-hunting that'll remind you of classics like Mega Man, Duck Tales, and Contra. Help Douglas in his fledgling extermination business by taking dangerous cases from troubled clients with monster infestations and explore a series of challenging non-linear levels. Each 2D stage involves navigating a labyrinth packed with traps, monsters, puzzles, and chock-full of hidden secrets.\nDouglas can take only one hit before dying so players must have quick reflexes and good memory. To help you out, Douglas's brainy sister Douglette has been hard at work in her lab. She's invented a number of extermination cannons like the powerful Bug Blaster and the effective Spread Cannon, as well as a selection of useful tools like the all-purpose Fogger Bomb and the fashionable Hotfoot Darters\u0081\u00ae.\nDoug's adventures can end up taking him to some far-out spots where gameplay changes completely. Be sure to always stay on your toes, or rapelling into a cave, blasting into the skies on a motorcycle, or diving into the midst of another video game could catch you off guard.\nA domestic monster infestation inevitably stems from some especially big baddies, so prepare to encounter tons of hilarious boss monsters. Every level contains 4 to 5 boss fights with huge, disgusting, and ridiculous baddies.\nHere's just a select few of them:\nThe origins of the brain are unknown, only that you can tell it's near by the gathering of whale maggots - not to mention the corpses bursting from the ground and returning to life. Those who have seen it and lived to tell the tale swear that they saw the maggots oozing out from the inside, as though the brain itself was manifesting them.\nPresident and CEO of Monster City's largest chopstick megaconglomerate MITSUBISHI UTENSIL FIRMS, the mysterious President Mitsubishi rose to the top of the industry while never actually revealing her face. After the company's recent merger with IRXQ7P INTERFIBRE the board of executives demanded she finally remove the mask and address them face to face, only to discover her terrible secret...\nGrammie McHenry is out of sorts. She's ever so worried about her beloved husband of over 50 years after he disappeared into the attic days ago. He emerged just once to fetch his cherished tea set, and as he crashed back up the stairs, oozing a trail of slime from his silk gland, she swears he looked different somehow. Since then she's had an infestation of carnivorous splorbs and spider mammoths, and desperately needs Doug's help!\n\"The Blomgerp series of top-of-the-line pizza ovens are the definitive tool for your pizzeria.

YOU %$#&@# DONKEY!!!!!!\nI\u2019ve always imagined Douglas Circumstance as an 8-bit game like those I played growing up, so I\u2019ve tried to make it an authentic experience while still taking advantage of modern PC speeds and 16:9 resolution screens.\nThe art uses a slightly modified NES palette, and most sprites are limited to sets of 2 colors. The game doesn't include any parallax, as I find that look to be distinctly 16-bit. A highway segment, however, does use some of the same tricks NES games used to use to imitate the effect.\nJesse and Jay have both been working in pixel animation for decades. It's in their blood. As a result, the attention to detail and personality in every monster is unrivaled.\nDouglas also brings back the difficulty of the 8-bit days - the challenging \u201cClassic Mode\u201d contains no save system. Blast monsters and find secrets to earn extra lives and more chances to continue, but run out of continues and you're going back to the start.\nFrom the Creators of Dropsy\nJesse Bull - Designer, Artist, Programmer\nProject Director and Lead Artist at A Jolly Corpse, I teamed up with Jay to develop Dropsy, the point-and-click hugventure published by Devolver Digital. Prior to that I directed Wyv and Keep, the co-op puzzler. \nI'm about ready for some shooting!\n99% of the time I'm in my office working on games, but if I'm not there you'll find me playing through Super Metroid, Earthbound, or Shadow of the Colossus one more time. \nJay Tholen - Composer, SFX Engineer, Artist\nJay's responsible for creating Dropsy the clown, and I had an awesome time working with him on bringing the game version of his ideas to life. Our styles mesh really well and I especially dug his wacko musical vibe. Also we both love David Lynch. I asked him to do the soundtrack for Douglas immediately.\nSince 2007 he's released twenty-five albums and EPs in the chiptune and VGM communities. What he's produced so far has surpassed my wildest expectations and I can't wait to hear an entire Douglas Circumstance OST.\nPLAY\n\nThe History of, or, What the Heck's a Douglas Circumstance?\nJay and I both started making games as a hobby as part of the \"Klik\" community, so-called after the game creation software Klik & Play which formed the epicentre. Before indie game developing was widely known or profitable, we all gathered here simply to make things for fun and to show our friends - including some of your favorite young developers.\n\n I ran a website called Fallen Angel Industries where many fledgling developers came together to share these freeware games under a common umbrella label. The original Douglas Circumstance was one of these games.\nFallen Angel Industries on Home of the Underdogs\nFallen Angel Industries on Reloaded.org\nWhile the original project was a very simple game created in a few weeks, I've always had a soft spot for the asthmatic, near-sighted character with the giant gun. I'd love to explore and expand upon this comical world.\nWith many more years and a few games under my belt, I finally feel like I can do it justice!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOn top of making games full time, supporting my family also still requires me to do freelance work. Thus free time for additional side projects with no immediate financial backing is extremely limited. Working on Douglas in this limited free time, I've managed to get about 40% of the game done over the course of two years. This means the finished game probably won't see the light of day for another three years or more, if I manage to finish it at all. Immediate responsibilities mean that the game could be put on hiatus at any time.\nWith a backing from all the great people at Kickstarter, however, I could make Douglas my number one priority. I could take a break from freelance work completely, and commit the time and energy to Douglas Circumstance that I think it deserves. With your help, I'm sure that I can make it the awesome game I know it can be. And, importantly, I can do it much, much faster.\nThis seemed like the right place to ask for help!\nWhere does the funding go?\nAfter covering Kickstarter and Amazon fees and paying taxes, everything raised will go straight into development of the game. This includes my costs for doing the art and programming, Jay's costs for composing the music and SFX, and paying for software.\nThe goal amount of $25,000 is based on what I estimate to be the minimum required to complete the game. If more than the minimum is raised, all will go back into improving the game, in the form of extra polish, additional music, and additional content. You can see more about this below, under Stretch Goals.\nWhat about the rewards?\nIn addition to getting the PC game as soon as it's released, I've planned just a few other fun reward levels for people who want to get more involved in the project. Here's a quick breakdown:\nTeacup Beetle Level - $10.00\nGet your very own DRM-free digital download of Douglas Circumstance for PC on release day! You'll also get access to all of the backer-only development updates all the way up to release.\nCarnivorous Splorb Level - $20.00\nGet the Deluxe Edition of Douglas Circumstance on release day, which includes the digital download of the game, an 8-bit inspired PDF instruction booklet, and the official OST by Jay Tholen.\nPizza Zombie Level - $35.00\nGet the above Deluxe Edition of the game plus a very special Official Player's Guide written by Douglette Circumstance herself. This lovingly crafted guide will be filled with level maps, detailed boss dossiers, a fully complete monsterp\u00e6dia, original concept art, game secrets, and more.\nTengu Mask Level - $40.00\nBecome an early backer! As thanks for supporting the project early on, get access to the below reward for a reduced price. \nLimited number available!\nShaolin Octopus Level - $50.00\nYou're inducted into the order of the Shaolin Octopi. Receive access to the game far ahead of its official release and help steer development by participating in the beta process.\nYou'll also be invited to a private dev forum where Jay and I'll hold daily conversation about what we're working on, post sneak peaks at new levels, bosses, and music, and advance demo builds. You'll talk directly with the devs and your feedback will impact the game.\nFinally, you'll get a special Shaolin Octopus credit in the game's ending roll.\nFire-Breathing Brain Level - $75.00\nA Kickstarter Exclusive! Get a limited edition 24\"x18\" poster of the game's world, Monster City. \nThe poster has been plotted and sketched, and will be pixeled during the campaign. Jesse will even stream some of the work sessions so you can see it come to life before your very eyes. Streaming is done at http://www.twitch.tv/jessebull/\nAlso includes all above rewards.\nThrowy Nage~ru Level - $125.00\nOwn a Piece of History! Jesse will select a piece of original concept work from his treasured collection and bequeath it unto you. Signed if you wish.\n(Not responsible for works that are soaked in parting tears of sadness.)\nAlso includes all above rewards.\nHorned Gryphon Level - $250.00\nBe a Part of the Game! I'll render your lovely face in pixel art and add you as a character somewhere in the game. Alternatively you could use a beloved pet, design a decorative set piece, or force me to insert some bizarre reference only you and your friends will understand. Anything you want!\nIncludes a high quality glossy, signed print of your creation and a special Producer credit in the game's ending roll, as well as all the above rewards.\nBloatwyrm Level - $500.00\nBe an even bigger part of the game! Collaborate with Jesse on the design for your very own monster for Douglas and Douglette to encounter. Decide how it walks, slithers, flies or hops, and what sort of disgusting or spooky powers it uses to attack the duo.\nIncludes two high quality glossy, signed prints - An original concept sketch and a final sprite sheet with all the animation cycles! Also includes a special Producer credit in the game's ending roll and all the rewards up to Throwy Nage~ru level.\nAny stretch goals?\nIf we manage to surpass the base funding goal, all additional funds raised will feed directly back into the development of the game. I've got tons of ideas for ways to add more content, from new weapons and sub-items to entire new levels. We could do Mac and Linux platform ports or maybe even get a completely interactive Monster City!\nThe above animations will show how close we are to achieving initial funding and subsequent stretch goals. As the project gets closer to funding, I'll continually update this section. If we're lucky enough to get funded, I'll talk with backers about possible stretch goals. We'll decide together what content should be added and when!\nFinally...\nThanks so much for taking the time to check this project out. I can't wait to bring this game to life, and hope you can help me do it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nJesse has acted as project director on a number of successfully shipped projects, including the hit game \"Dropsy\" published by Devolver Digital.

We reimagined turntable technology that uses audiophile-grade materials and components. The result is a visually and mechanically sound way to experience vinyl music.\nFloating Record Vertical Turntable Prototype\nFloating Record Maple Prototype\nAt Gramovox our design philosophy is to reimagine vintage audio design with modern technology. In this spirit, we sought to reimagine the record player. We yearned for a visceral vinyl experience that showcased the record as both art and a medium to produce analog sound. The result is a high-performance turntable that plays your records vertically\u2014producing the illusion that it\u2019s floating.\nFloating Record Walnut Prototype\n\nWe designed the Floating Record for everyone from the first-time record listener to the seasoned vinyl enthusiast. You\u2019ll be spinning tunes out of the box in a matter of minutes. You don't need to set up your cartridge or purchase additional outboard gear such as phono pre-amps, amplifiers and speakers (although you have the option to). All of these are included in our integrated design.\nFloating Record Walnut Prototype\nDon\u2019t hide your vinyl. Show it off. The Floating Record allows you to showcase your vinyl while maintaining high-quality playback.\nFloating Record Maple Prototype\nTraditional record players take up a lot of space and require additional components such as pre-amps, amps, integrated receivers, speakers and all the necessary cables. However, the Floating Record\u2019s integrated design allows it to beautifully fit into most environments with ease.\nFloating Record Walnut Prototype\nFloating Record Maple Prototype\nWe\u2019ve engineered the Floating Record to flawlessly play your vinyl vertically and output full-range stereo sound. We deconstructed the elements of a premium turntable setup and reconstructed them in a manner that maintains their high-performance standards. \nFloating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)\nFloating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)\nFloating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)\nListen in 33 \u2153 or 45 RPM\nYou can easily switch between 33 \u2153 or 45 RPM by moving the silicon belt over the inner or outer groove of the middle gear. We include record clamps for both types of records.\nFloating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)\nYou can bypass the integrated speakers and use the Floating Record as a standalone Hi-Fi turntable for your own audio setup.\nRCA Line Out to External Speakers\nYou have the option of bypassing the internal amp and speakers and outputting an RIAA equalized line level signal from the built in phono-preamp via the \"Line Out\" RCA jacks. The switch is used to choose between Onboard and Line Out. The Onboard position activates the built-in phono stage--the 15 watt digital power amp and built-in speakers. The \u201cLine Out\u201d bypasses the internal amplifier and speakers, and takes the signal from our built-in phono-preamp to the \u201cLine Out\u201d RCA jacks. This allows the player to be used as a standalone Hi-Fi turntable. RCA out is a line level signal that is used to connect to an existing stereo system via the \u201cTape in\u201d or \u201cAux In\u201d inputs on your receiver, pre-amp or amp.\nFloating Record Maple Prototype\nFloating Record MDF w/ Walnut Veneer (Production Version)\nThe Floating Record comes with a dynamic, full-range audio system. We use two Tymphany 2\u201d neodymium speakers driven by a 15w per channel digital amplifier. The speaker cavities incorporate tuned bottom porting to offer superior bass response. We achieved the best possible sound without compromising aesthetics or performance.\nWe created a fully-adjustable, carbon-fiber tone-arm. This audiophile staple is perfectly balanced radially around its main pivot bearing axis. This allows it to be played in a vertical position and not flop to one side or the other.\n\nThe tracking force is (dynamically) applied by a spring as opposed to the usual counterweights found in horizontal record players in which the arm is (statically) balanced. Spring loaded tracking force is beneficial in regards to consistency of the force applied\u2014especially on warped records. Our tone-arms are factory-set at the optimal tracking force of ~2 grams.\nSince our tonearm is perfectly balanced radially around its main pivot bearing axis, it does not skew or favor one groove side over the other. Typically, the modulations in the groove can cause friction and this contributes to centripetal force acting on the arm and causing it to skate towards the center of the record. Our rigorous testing ensured no performance issues.\nThe Audio Technica AT95E is a warm sounding cartridge with a smooth high end, sweet mids and rich low end. The dual magnet cartridge comes with an elliptical diamond stylus. An elliptical stylus has many advantages over spherical styli. The elliptical stylus has two radii, the front radius being wider than the side radius. This allows the stylus to ride in the center of the groove, like the conical stylus, while the smaller side radius can more accurately track higher frequencies.\n\nCompared to the conical stylus, however, the elliptical stylus has a longer vertical contact area and a narrower front to back contact area within the record groove. The elliptical tip follows the groove modulations with more precision, providing improved frequency response, improved phase response, and lower distortion, specifically in the inner grooves of the record. \nWe've developed a robust cueing mechanism that allows you to effortlessly cue your records. This helps reduce the risk of scratching your records or damaging your stylus. Now you can cue up your favorite track with ease. \nHow Does It Work?\n1. Set your tone-arm\n2. Push cue lever\n3. Watch your stylus gracefully fall onto the record\nBelt-Driven Turntable on Walnut Prototype\n\nThe Floating Record uses a belt drive system with a silicone belt to help isolate motor vibrations from the platter. We choose a high quality A/C synchronous motor and custom-designed a high precision motor control circuit to ensure silent operation and consistent speed. This is mounted with rubber isolation bushings to help decouple it from the base. Our main platter spindle is made from stainless steel and runs in bronze bushing with a teflon bottom. The plinth is CNC-machined out of high mass acrylic to help reduce resonance. The platter is also CNC-machined acrylic to add mass and help reduce resonance. All this works together to help our turntable achieve smooth, consistent playback.\nThe Floating Record\u2019s base will be composed of a miter-folded MDF box finished with a genuine Maple or Walnut veneer. This method maintains our desired aesthetic, prevents warping and minimizes the waste factor. The finished product will look beautiful, sound great and maintain a high level of performance. Our construction method adheres to industry-tested best practices. Overall, our bases produce a rich aesthetic that beautifully complements your home or office.\nWe\u2019re using world-class wood, metal and electronics suppliers to produce parts that meet our high-tolerances. The most crucial part\u2014the final assembly\u2014is handled by highly-trained electro-mechanical assembly engineers in Chicago.

Check out the first six scenes today, and come back each Friday for a new sequence - each is a vote for Martin and Marco to become a comic and supports further volumes of the Dragon Lord Saga!"}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 12, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1253260624/martin-and-marco", "project_name": "Martin and Marco"}}, {"backer": "Daniel Johnson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "A new land has been discovered! As the ruler of your own tiny kingdom, this is your big chance to expand your territory and (more importantly) make some serious gold. But the rulers of the other nearby kingdoms have also learned of this new land, and they're gathering their troops for battle! Prepare for all-out war as you try to build bigger villages than your neighbors... no matter what it takes!\nVillages is a casual rummy-style card game with a competitive edge. The rules are simple--collect 3 or more cards of the same color and lay them down to build a village. Build bigger villages than everyone else to earn more gold!\nBut not everybody likes to play nice. If another player's village contains a card you'd like to have (or if you're just feeling mean!), you can fight them for it in a one-on-one duel. Each unit has its strengths and weaknesses, so a knowledge of each unit's unique abilities (and a little bit of luck) is crucial to winning the battle and taking home the prize.\nHow you decide to play is up to you, but one thing is clear: the only way to send your rivals packing is to be the first to earn 100 gold coins. Do you have what it takes to rule an empire?\nVillages supports 2 to 5 players and takes between 30 minutes and an hour to play.\n                                                                                                                                                           After playing a few hands of rummy with some friends one night, I got the idea to add a battle mechanic to make the game more interactive. The concept took off quickly from there, and it wasn't long until I had a completely new game on my hands.\nI released the first edition of Villages on The Game Crafter, an awesome print-on-demand site for board games and card game, back in November of 2011. It was a fun personal project and I didn't really expect to sell very many copies, but thought I'd take a chance and put it up for sale anyway.\nSince then, Villages has become one of the best-selling games on the site, and it was chosen as a Game Crafter staff pick in October of 2012. I've sold copies of Villages at two local conventions and I sold out both times. I've even been told by a grateful mother that my game was the only item on her son's Christmas wishlist after he played it at a birthday party. (That news gave me butterflies for a week.)\nJT, a founder of The Game Crafter, gave the game 5/5 stars and left this review:\nYou can read more reviews like this one at the Villages shop page on The Game Crafter.\nWorking on Villages has been a constant source of pleasant surprises and fun experiences. I still love playing it with the same group of friends who first helped me develop the idea. Honestly, I can't seem to get enough of it!\nAnd now, I want to run this Kickstarter campaign to share a new edition of the game with even more potential fans and give everyone a chance to try it out. I've taken everything I've learned about game design over the past few years and applied it to this brand new edition. It's more fair and more fun, and I think you'll enjoy it whether you've played a previous edition before or not.\nThanks for stopping by to check out Villages. I hope you like it as much as I do.\nWant to support Villages and get a copy of your own?

They are an optional component of Villages that adds a bit more luck and drama to each battle. Each time two units face off on the battlefield, each participating player rolls one of these dice and adds the value to their unit's power. These dice will be manufactured by Daft Concepts, who recently ran their own successful Daft Dice Kickstarter campaign.\nYou'll be able to choose black dice, red dice, or one of each. The numbers on the black dice are a bit safer (0-1-1-2-2-3), while the red dice have a wider range of results (0-0-1-1-3-4).\n+$5 shipping to Canada Builders (getting PnP files only)\n+$10 shipping to other International Builders (getting PnP files only)\nThese Kickstarter-exclusive Villages card sleeves will feature high-quality full color art on the back!

Upgrade to the Big Box with this add-on! See Update #19 for more information.\nNormally, the Big Box doesn't come with any of the individual Small Boxes inside of it, but this add-on will get you all of the Small Boxes for the base game and expansions! This add-on requires a Big Box first, meaning it's available to Wizards, Dragons, royalty, and Knights who also get the add-on directly above.\nSleeved cards won't fit in the Small Boxes, so be sure to remember this if you are also considering the Card Sleeves add-on!\n Each Archer bundle includes three (3) copies of Villages.\nEach Dragon bundle includes one (1) copy each of Villages, Distant Lands, Ghost Town, and the Holiday Pack, as well as a pair of Power Dice.\nThe base game is going to be ready earlier than the expansions, but shipping is very expensive, especially to countries outside the US. Because of this, if you order any expansions, your base game will be held until everything can go out in one package. But if you don't think you can wait that long, you can pay for the full price of the extra shipment and I will send you the base game (and Royalty Pack) as soon as it's ready, a full 2 months or so before the expansions are finished. If you did not order any expansions, you will get your game at the early date without the extra shipping costs. See Update #9 for more information.\nThe following items can be delivered early:\nVillages\nRoyalty Pack\nPower Dice\nCard Sleeves\nIf we go above and beyond our campaign goal, everyone who gets a copy of the game will also get some extra bonuses. These include the Super Villagers, special cards with extraordinary abilities. As more stretch goals are reached, more Super Villagers will join the fight. These cards may appear later as a paid mini-expansion for the rest of the world, but Kickstarter backers get them for free!\nThe King reward level also allows YOU to design your very own Super Villager and add him or her to every copy the game sent to backers as part of the Kickstarter campaign. Your card will take its place alongside any Super Villagers unlocked by these stretch goals!\nAnother type of stretch goal is Alternate Art. These are limited-edition upgrades to the card or packaging artwork, one piece at a time. Because each unit appears multiple times in the game, the Alternate Art will be used to replace duplicates.\nKickstarter Exclusive.\n Kickstarter Exclusive.\n Kickstarter Exclusive.\nCheck update #5 for more information.

Whaaat?!\nIf we hit this legendary stretch goal, I'll take 30 of the best cards created with the Cardsmith Kit, as voted on by the Villages community, and turn them into an official printed expansion! If you missed your chance to join the royalty during this campaign, why not try your hand at democracy? Even better, this expansion will come a few months after everyone's had a chance to become Villages experts, so you know it'll bring something fresh and polished to the table!\nThe final stretch goal. The goal to rule them all. Thank you for an amazing campaign, backers!\nFor those of you who have played Villages before, here's a detailed run-down on what's different about the new edition:\nImprovements were made to some of the unit sprites, the box art, and the backs of the cards. The new design of the card face also allows for longer names and more lines of ability text than before.\nTwo colors have been removed from the game: pink and brown. Having fewer colors means it's easier to build villages, it's more likely that another player will have a village you want to steal from, and cards like the Ace and Wizard become more exciting. All in all, it's just more fun.\nSome cards from the expansions are now part of the base game, including the Archer, Scout, Golem, Goblin, Merchant, Bunny, and Tavern. I felt that these cards added so much to the basic gameplay that I just couldn't leave them out of the core set. A few new cards will eventually fill the gaps they left behind.\nA few brand new units, the Joker and the Orc, have also found their way into the base game, while the Brute and Paladin have been removed.\nThe Breeder is now a Farmer. He does the same thing, though.\nMost units have had their base power or ability text tweaked to provide a wider range of power levels and simpler, more useful abilities.\nAttackers now win ties. But don't worry: the penalties for losing a battle are now a bit more lenient. If you attack someone and win, you now have to choose between sending the losing unit to the graveyard and stealing a card. If the defending player hired their defending unit, it will go to the graveyard anyway, but they can now guarantee that they will lose no more than 1 card during a battle by sending out a defending unit from their village. This helps weaker villages stay on the table longer and gives them a chance to turn the tide.\nThere are two special cards included with the game that help make the Hero and Goblin much easier to understand. The High Score and Low Score cards are handed out to the appropriate players at the end of each round, and the Hero and Goblin refer to the owners of these cards, rather than their score directly. This avoids the ambiguity around what it means to be in \"last place\" or what a player's \"total score\" is.\nThe game now includes a fancy full-color rule-book, full of diagrams and bullet points. There are also reference cards that outline the steps of a turn, the steps of battle, and how to score your villages at the end of the round.\nI have a few other game ideas in the works, not only for card games, but also for larger board games and even video games or mobile apps. I never quite know where my mind will take me next, but I know I'll definitely be working on something and sharing it with the world. I've never been happy doing otherwise.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter project and the first of my games to be printed in bulk quantities.

Playdek is excited to be partnering with one of the most legendary game designers, as well as you the fans, to bring out a refreshing, immersive new take on the tactics genre.    \nIn the hands of the veteran tactical RPG master himself, Unsung Story will re-imagine a classic game genre, as Yasumi Matsuno weaves together one of the complex and rich game worlds that he is known for, with inspiring class based tactics game play.\nHistory is written by winners, and tells the tales of heroes. But where there are winners, there are losers, and wars are not won by heroes alone. Behind the veil of history, there are countless stories that lie forgotten. Reliving these hidden tales is the concept behind the Unsung Story.\nUnsung Story: Tale of the Guardians presents an epic sweep of history through the eyes of the ones that make it, but are overlooked by the passing of time. It presents a fundamental twist on the hero\u2019s story, as it immerses gamers through the experiences of those lashed to the great wheel of history!\nThe Unsung Story timeline covers many chapters of the sprawling war-torn history of the fantasy world of Rasfalia. The central plot follows the struggles of heroes who fought in the Seventy-Seven Years War between great kingdoms and empires. \nThe story for each hero will constitute an episode, with each episode being comprised of many stages of game play. Each episode will depict a part of the Seventy Seven Years\u2019 War from the vantage point of various protagonists. Some episodes will span a single year, while others may take place over a decade or more!\nFilled with intrigue, warfare, betrayal, alliances and espionage, Unsung Story is a detailed and immersive game world that players will bring to life through their actions and decisions. It will tie you not only to the names that history remembers after the conflict has ended, but also with the characters behind these immortalized individuals. \nWithout these people, the unsung ones, the course of the history of Rasfalia would have taken a different turn. You will connect to these unsung heroes through your decisions and experiences, as you live these events through their eyes.\nFor more information about Unsung Story from Yasumi Matsuno, check out our Update #11 here:Detailed Design Insight from Yasumi Matsuno\nUnsung Story is an exciting turn-based, tactical war simulation RPG that plays across a great epoch, through individual story episodes. YOU, the player, research and explore the vast history of this conflict that nearly tore Rasfalia apart, by reliving past battles and political events. \nYour viewpoint into this series of intertwined history varies from battle to battle. In one fight, you may command a group of knights protecting a great empire, while in another scenario you may lead a group of revolutionary soldiers, made up of commoners, who are fighting to topple the same empire!\nBattles take place on a 3-D landscape, with an immersive player controlled camera, while episode and scene selection is made through a detailed 3-D world map. Units that you command are profession based, and within each profession are multiple classes. \nEach class within a profession has certain characteristics, and you can change classes within a profession to suit your tactical needs! The world is also rich with magical creatures that are not only foes on the battlefield, but under certain conditions can be commanded by you as well!\nThe character professions, replete with individual classes, provide you with deep game mechanics that you can mold to your individual play style, and adapt to the scenario at hand. You will build your front and backlines by combing these classes into various groups or parties, based on the needs of the battlefield.\nHere is a visual look into the game from a game play perspective. The battle system for Unsung Story is a turn based system that puts importance on speed for each units actions. Therefore, faster units will act on their turns first. The image below represents an example battle stage, as seen by the player, with the player\u2019s party in blue and the opposing force in red. All of the world stages will be richly modeled and detailed, with various terrains and elevations.\nInstead of a square tile system, Unsung Story will use triangular tiles, with units standing not at the center of tiles, but at the intersections. This gives units six possible directions of movement.  \nThis image below depicts different target choices for the player in this triangular based system. In this example, the Active unit has three options:\n1) Use attack \u201cX\u201d on the adjacent Enemy A\n2) Use attack \u201cY\u201d on Enemy B, two tiles away\n3) Use defense \u201cZ\u201d to aid the adjacent Ally C\nThe attack radius shown above is a radius of 2, in other words. A, B, and C are all within the acting unit's range. A and C are well within range, and B is at the edge of the range. The purpose of this system is to explore what more can be presented to the player, by way of multiple action choices, while having a consistent six possible direction choices available to them.\nThis is a concept of what the look and feel will be as you play through the game. It\u2019s not an in-game render but hopefully helps to convey some of the level of detail that we will put into the game.\nIn Unsung Story, classes are spread across three game play types that allow for unique party construction:\nWarrior types that are geared for attacking and defending \nMage types that use magic for attacking, healing and buffing \nMonster types that excel in the use of specialized attacks\nWith this perspective in mind, the system is then made up of five primary class types:\n\nThis is a class connection map that shows the options for leveling characters across class types and professions.\nThese are front line fighters that emphasize attack power. They fight with long swords, massive axes, spears, and maces, for example.\n\nThese are front line fighters that emphasize defense. They are equipped with a shields and other defensive equipment, and will protect their party from enemy attacks.\n\nThese are magic-users that wield offensive and support magic, including the ability to strengthen a party\u2019s attack abilities.\n\nThese are magic-users that wield defensive and healing magic, and can strengthen a party\u2019s defensive position.\n\nThese are characters that command mythical beasts and monsters. The tamed monsters can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes.\nAll of these class types have a Profession, which are a cultural/intellectual/craft alignment, and each profession has an affiliation bonus with another profession. \nA unit\u2019s primary class type and sub-class is determined by the type of weapon equipped, and by using various weapon types, a player\u2019s character can gain XP in any class level this way. Units will be able to freely switch between classes that align with certain professions, as each weapon will belong to one of the primary classes and any experience points earned will be applied to levels for that class.\nThese branches show various class types aligned to certain professions.\nFor example, equipping two different Defender weapons, the Knight\u2019s short sword or the Hoplite\u2019s short spear, will both earn experience points toward the Defender primary class level.\nWhat makes the sub-class different is that their special skills in battle will vary between subs. Though they will still have different character stats, they will have unique skills available to their sub-class type to use in battle. This is also key to class development because the skills a unit can learn when leveling up depend on its sub-class at the time.\nEssentially, the system allows you to shape a unit\u2019s development by choosing which sub-class it is, and in turn what skills it learns, thus giving each character its own identity.\nA Tamer Class putting a dragon under his control.\nThese four listed classes are the classes you will be able to choose from as your backer reward for all tiers that specify a Kickstarter Edition class:\nWar Mage: Profession \u2013 Clergy\nThe War Mage is a member of the battle caste of the Clergy. In addition to powerful magical arts, the War Mage can wield Short Swords, Daggers, and Slings, along with Grenade Weapons, and imbue them with enchantments.\nBallast Knight: Profession \u2013 Noble\nThe Ballast Knight is part of the Nobility, and heralds from the upper elite of society. This access to wealth allows them to bear costly yet powerful weapons and armor. Some of the weapons the Ballast Knight wields are the Great Sword, Short Sword, Axe, and for mounted knights, the Lance.\nPolearm Knight: Profession \u2013 Pioneer\nA Polearm Knight is the upper echelon of the rank and file, the commoners who make up the majority of the Rasfalian cultures. A fierce and heroic fighter, Polearm Knights are known to wield Pikes, Halberds, Scythes, and other pole weapons.\nAerolest: Profession \u2013 Estate\nThe Aerolest is a highly skilled, highly educated warrior, immersed in mathematics and the sciences. Known to design and develop their own secretive and extremely deadly ranged weapons, the Aerolest uses various types of Bows, Crossbows, and Scorpios.\nUnsung Story is the inspiration and creation of an incredibly talented set of veteran video game developers and content creators.

All developers are daredevils at heart BUT we do all we can to lessen the risk.

Believe it or not, developers wanting to add more is a major source of project creep, and that always stems from the best intentions: to bring the best game to the players. With the impassioned support of you, the players, we might indeed feel empowered to do better, add more, and continuing tinkering with an aspect until we feel it is \"just right\". It\u2019s a risk we\u2019re willing to take, though. We should also mention that the approval process for these platforms is outside of Playdek\u2019s control and might be subject to surprises.

Our Kickstarter campaign is over, but you can still pre-order yours on our website.\nTouchscreens are amazing, but when you just want to turn on your flashlight, take a quick photo or send your location, simple actions can become a bit of a hassle. \nWithout Pressy, if you just want to turn your flashlight ON you need to: \nWake your screen -> Unlock it -> Exit your current running app -> Search for the app you want to use ->  Launch it  ->  And finally, perform your desired Action.  \nThis \u201csimple\u201d process requires 5-7 different Actions and takes more than 8 seconds! Additionally, you must maintain eye contact with your screen throughout the entire process.\nDon't believe us? try and beat that time yourself!\nBut what if you want to perform an action quickly and without having to deal with or look at the device?\nPressy lets you perform any Action on your smartphone by using the most intuitive input \u2013 clicking a button \u2013 Saving you time and effort! Pressy is a tiny physical button that connects to your phone through the headphone jack.\nConnecting the Pressy Button with the free Pressy app lets you easily customize and use your favorite, everyday actions. For example, if you use your flashlight on regular basis, set a Click-combination the app for turning on your flashlight and start clicking the Button!\nGetting started using Pressy couldn\u2019t be any easier. Plug the Pressy Button to the headphone jack, download the free app, and you\u2019re good to go. Click the Pressy button and see your phone\u2019s flashlight turn on. Click it again and it turns off. As simple as that. \nPressy comes with 3 pre-set Actions, but once you get the hang of things you can customize clicking behavior and trigger dozens of different actions.\nQuality assurance is very important to us. Boaz is going to accompany the production process right from the start and we are going to test each button on several devices. We designed a device that tests the button mechanically and electronically to make sure each and every product is intact. We plan to begin production as soon as we reach our goal so we can deliver as soon as possible. With your help it can be in less than 4 months!\nPressy is in the News! Check out a few of the website Pressy was featured in:\nFor Beginners\nPressy comes with three awesome, out-of-the box default actions so you can immediately start having fun with it, even if you aren't a tech-geek like us! \n\u2022 One short Click to toggle your flashlight \n\u2022 One long Click to toggle your phone in and out of silent mode \n\u2022 Double-Click to snap a photo\n Just plug in Pressy, download the free app and start clicking!\nGot the hang of it? Let\u2019s start having even more fun! \nPressy is not just a one-trick-pony. The Pressy app allows you to select your favorite Actions and set different Click-combinations for each Action. \nHere are some examples: \nPressy also allows you to customize the settings of each Action.\nFor example, you can set Pressy to take a regular photo or to take a discreet photo (with your screen off and without sound or flash). \n How to Set an Action:\nThe new app design\n\nFor us Geeks, let\u2019s go crazy!\n If you are a developer, Pressy has 3 ways to create your very own Action: \n1. Develop an app or a service and utilize the Pressy button to launch it with your desired parameters.\n2. Initiate 3rd Party apps, like a specific task in Tasker or AutomateIt.\n3. Embed Pressy in your own app to perform your specific in-app actions (using Pressy\u2019s API \u2013 free for Kickstarter Backers!). For example, use the Pressy button as a game controller, PTT button or any other usage. \nFurther tips, instructions, Q&A, and social sharing of Actions will be available on www.PressyButton.com. \nHow Does it Work ?\nOnce you launch the Pressy app, you activate a background service. The service monitors the headset-jack into which the Pressy Button is plugged. The application is then activated only when the Pressy Button is clicked, therefore, it does not drain your battery. The application recognizes the specific input and preforms the desired Action. The Pressy app works on all Android devices, versions 2.3 and up. \nWhere do We Stand  \nAt the moment we have many working models and prototypes of the Pressy Button. All prototypes were made using 3D printing and CNC, and manually assembled by us. In order to take production to the next level, we have already contacted all the suppliers and manufacturers we need. We got the best price offers in order to make Pressy affordable for everyone. Production costs per item are relatively reasonable, but the molds and minimum order quantity make it really difficult to carry out with our own funds.\nHere is where you guys can truly help. All the money we raise will help us manufacture mass quantity of Pressy buttons and bring the application to the next level. Your help will bring Pressy to life within 4 months!\nThe 3D printed parts\nPrototype Lineup\n  The Pressy Story \nAs we said in the video, smartphones are really awesome! But, if you need to spend about 10 seconds and perform 5-7 actions in order to \u201csimply\u201d do something on your phone \u2026. Well, in the words of Seth Godin, \u201cIt\u2019s broken!\u201d \nThis is exactly how the Pressy project was born. We want to give you a new, simple and intuitive way to preform everyday actions on your smartphone with a quick and simple click of a button. \nOf course the pledges are important and we could not continue without them, but we also want to hear what you guys think about our product. Don\u2019t be shy! Feel free to contact us with any questions, comments or ideas you may have. We will be grateful for any feedback and will do our best to answer any message as soon as we can.\nUse Your Headset media button as Pressy!\nThe rewards\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\nDuring the last 4 months, we were working around the clock designing and building the prototypes, during this time we also contacted dozens of manufacturers, got pricing offers and more importantly, production plans. After choosing some of them each manufacturer was examined carefully by us, and we started discussing specific details including the molds and tooling costs, specifying materials, manufacturing schedules, assembly and packaging options... Now, we have everything we need to make Pressy a perfected product.  \n\n\nThanks for everything!\n\n Love, \n          The Pressy Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately the Pressy button is relatively simple.\nWe had two big challenges:\nThe first was to make the button small and fun to use. We've spent tons of hours in Boaz\u2019s workshop testing dozens of different prototypes, some were made by us and some were ordered from other manufacturers. Finally, we found the best one and started working on the manufacturing plan.\nThe second challenge was connecting the button inputs to the app. The protocol we are using is very simple but some of the actions we wanted to preform were hard to program.

They crash land on a weird planet and end up locked in a mysterious fortress called Armikrog. Then...the adventure begins!\nThe Game\nArmikrog is a point and click adventure game that features all of the characteristics of TenNapel's unmistakable style:\nQuirky and lovable characters\nUnique worlds\nA compelling story\nMind-bending puzzles\nGreat animation\nTons of clay!\nThe Music\nTerry S. Taylor -- the award winning composer of The Neverhood soundtrack, will be composing and performing an entirely new original soundtrack for the game. Hooray!!!\nArmikrog will be available DRM-free for PC (WINDOWS), MAC OSX and LINUX, and distributed though GOG.com, The Humble Store and several other digital distribution platforms. For those of you who prefer Steam, we are now on Steam Greenlight. Click the link below where you can vote YES for Armikrog and boost our popularity!\nArmikrog on Steam Greenlight\nMaking this game will be a labor of love, and a \"thank you\" to all Neverhood fans and adventure gamers.\nArmikrog is being developed by Pencil Test Studios, an independent game development company located in Lake Forest, CA. Along with Doug TenNapel, the team includes core members from The Neverhood, as well as puppet fabricators, sculptors, and animators that will help to create the stop-motion that makes this project so unique.\nArmikrog will also feature the voice talents of:\nThe Neverhood was conceived and created from the ground up over a 12 month period. Armikrog will be developed using the Unity engine for PC, MAC and LINUX in order to secure the goal of completing the project within one year. We'll also be using many of the same animation, modelling, sculpting, set building and clay & puppet fabrication methods we've used before\u2014keeping the overall game design scalable so that we can create a fun and exciting experience within our targeted funding goal, but still have the flexibility to expand, should the opportunity present itself.\nOf course, none of this happens without your support, which is why we are reaching out to you through Kickstarter. Why Kickstarter? Funny you should ask...\nKickstarter is our most direct link to you, the fans. This is your opportunity to express whether or not you'd like to see another clay and puppet, stop-motion adventure game. Armikrog is a unique and creative project that we would love to make for those of you who have, over the years, dreamed of the chance to immerse yourself in another world made of clay. We're here to offer you the opportunity to make this project a reality.\nWhile our funding goal is considerably less than The Neverhood cost to produce in 1997, it is still our biggest hurdle. But in light of what it will cost to create, the real question is this: Would you support and play this game for $25?\nIf enough of you support it, you will get this game.\nThe Armikrog game will be comparable in size and scope to The Neverhood. It's been noted that our initial funding goal is significantly less than the cost of the original Neverhood game--this is possible since we are now utilizing technology that was not available to us 15 years ago (Unity engine, post-production and editing software, etc) which will allow us to create this game more efficiently with a overall higher level of quality.\nIn addition to our more conventional game production pipeline, we are also utilizing many of the same stop motion techniques used in such feature films as Paranorman and Nightmare Before Christmas. A significant portion of our budget is allocated toward puppet fabrication and sculpting, set building, lights, cameras, and lots and lots of clay!\nStop motion animation is an art all of its own. Each puppet, set and prop is individually hand-crafted by artists, while each and every frame is painstakingly animated. This specialized process is what makes this game unique--and we feel the time and talent that it takes to bring a project like this to this to life is worth every penny.\n100% of the funds that are raised will go directly into the production of the game. To date, we\u2019ve invested over $100,000 into the preproduction, design, and development, and we can see how fun and amazing this project will be. We want to deliver an incredible experience to all of you who support us, and applying 100% of your contributions toward development is the only way this will happen.\nIllustration by Earthworm Jim poster artist, Mike Koelsch\nRewards fall into two basic categories: Digital Rewards that are distributed though Steam and/or comparable download venues, and Physical Rewards that will be distributed through the mail. Note that all physical rewards under $1000 have an additional shipping cost for supporters with addresses outside of the United States.\nRewards that are not dependent on the production of the actual game will be fulfilled before the date specified in the reward tiers. Since we can't predict the amount of rewards that will need to be fulfilled, all rewards have been given the same fulfillment date as the game's ship date (July 2014). Once the campaign has ended, we will notify you of the fulfillment dates for those rewards that will ship sooner.\nBoxed Edition in the big, old-school size (mockup - design not finalized)\nKickstarter Exclusive Armikrog T-Shirt ($200 tier and above)\nTommynaut stop-motion production puppet\nDigital Rewards\nPhysical Rewards\nArmikrog is already getting a lot of great press.

Having many of the original members of The Neverhood team is a tremendous asset, as we already have the experience of creating this type of game. All games face unforeseen challenges throughout the course of production, but we have yet to face a challenge that we couldn't overcome. We have already begun to detail the entire scope of the game before production begins, which will help to define and minimize risks--which is key to the successful development of any game.\n\nWe've already invested a substantial amount of time and money into preproduction, laying the groundwork for an amazing game and we hope that you are as excited as we are about this project.

You\u2019ll also be able to hear all the SFX samples, but we don\u2019t know how the bard does that.\nAchievements\nWe tend to like achievements because they change the way you play the game! This stretch goal will add a bevy of achievements to ALL VERSIONS of the game.  These aren\u2019t just going to be stock achievements; they will be creative and wonderful. Can you beat Shovel Knight without losing a life? Prove it!\nNew Game Plus\nStart the game over with your weapons and items fully upgraded. However\u2026 enemies are going to be tougher, resources more scarce, and new challenges may arise. With new game plus, it\u2019s like a whole new game! Kind of! +!\nPlayable Boss Knight\nPlay the full game as a member of the Order of No Quarter! If we meet this stretch goal, we\u2019ll hold a vote to see who it will be. Expect the game to play differently! For example, Propeller Knight could have the ability to hover for short distances, but would be a low health \u2018glass cannon\u2019 of sorts. Even the story and dialog will change a little bit to reflect the changes!\nLinux / Mac Versions\nWant to play Shovel Knight on your weirdo computer? Many folks have asked for Linux and Mac versions. We hope to support Mac and Linux either way, but this goal makes it happen for sure, and in a more timely fashion (hopefully in 2013!).\nGender Swap Mode!\nWe want Shovel Knight to be enjoyable by boys and girls of all ages, everywhere. With this mode, the main characters\u2019 genders will be swapped, giving us a chance to do it before the internet has a chance to. The story will also change a bit to reflect the changes. Can you defeat the Evil Enchanter?\nChallenge Mode\nAdds a comprehensive batch of challenge rooms  to Shovel Knight. In this mode, Shovel Knight will be tasked with a variety of mini-quests like \u201cdefeat all the enemies!\u201d or \u201creach the goal in time!\u201d. Expect things like pacifism challenges and other rules-benders\u2026 and expect some tough-as-nails challenges too!\n4 Player Battle Mode!*\nWe\u2019ve talked a ton about multiplayer for Shovel Knight. While full-on multiplayer is out of the scope of this project, we could totally do 4 player couch co-op battles! Imagine playing as Shovel Knight ( or any of the extra playable knights ) and duking it out in the arena! Several modes would be ideal:\n\u00b7         Cash collecting, where you fight for treasure that appears in the level. Knock your buddy to make gems fall out and collect them!\n\u00b7         Racing, where all players would have to make their way to the end of a stage\n\u00b7         Last man standing, where the only goal is to slash mercilessly\u2026 to the bitter end!\n*This is couch co-op only, not online. We hope to bring this feature to all platforms, but the 3DS isn\u2019t guaranteed because multiplayer is Wi-Fi only.\nPHYSICAL.ACTUAL.REAL.BOX.\nIf we reach this stretch goal, then we will make a physical box of the game, which will be mailed free to backers pledging at the $50 tier and above! Plus, ALL backers will receive the digital version, to print or view at your leisure. NOTE: This box art is only a mockup. We might have a surprise or two for the final box art! Johnny Vila, your prayers have been answered :P\n3rd Playable Boss Knight!\nCall this goal unoriginal, but we don\u2019t care. We\u2019re too excited to play as another boss knight! Let\u2019s get to this pledge level and have one more knight (who will be chosen by the community) make the cut! Rally! For the Order of No Quarter!\nAll Bosses Playable in Battle Mode!!\nIf we reach this goal, the entire Order of No Quarter (including the Enchantress herself!) will step into Battle Mode, for the ultimate battle royale. Wild new combat styles abound! Play as your under-appreciated favorite and beat up the more popular knights that got voted into the main campaign!\nShovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. It's a hot mashup of new and old that may remind you of Mega Man, Castlevania, or Dark Souls! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this valley with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and save his lost beloved. He wields a ShovelBlade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!\nBut, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost.\nIf you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, and real heart\u2026 Shovel Knight is for you! If you don\u2019t, then what? How could you not be into that stuff? Keep reading, you\u2019ll come around!\nEvery great game needs a great set of baddies, and Shovel Knight\u2019s are a doozy. Shovel Knight\u2019s Nemesis is The Enchantress, a mysterious and powerful conjurer. Her Order of No Quarter has swept over the land, stationed in locations Shovel Knight is sure to visit. In order to get to the Enchantress, he\u2019s gonna have to beat them all!\nWe love themed bosses and themed levels; this love is on full display in Shovel Knight! Each knight in the Order has been lovingly crafted to have a distinct look, theme, and personality. These epic boss battles are really going to shine! We already love our villainous bunch, so let us share them with you.\nThis is Polar Knight: the Sabretooth to Shovel Knight\u2019s Wolverine. He\u2019s guarding a stranded ship in the frozen south. Titanic and terrible, he is the largest and most brutish of the Order of No Quarter. Some time in the past, Shovel Knight and Polar Knight have crossed Shovels before...\n\u2022 Pros: Wields Snow Shovel, Doesn't feel cold but is quite considerate!\n\u2022 Cons: Annoying laugh ( it's like water torture )!\nAnd Propeller Knight! He commands the Enchantress' flying machine with the cocksure attitude of a sky pirate! With his Heli-Helmet, he can zoom short distances with ease. Shovel Knight encounters Propeller Knight on top of the aircraft as it zooms through the sky; earth fights against air in a true battle of elements!\n\u2022 Pros: Talented Fencer, Mechanical Heli-Helmet, Debonair!\n\u2022 Cons: Arrogance, Lightweight, Outrageous Accent!\nSometimes, the bomb is mightier than the sword. Deep in the recesses of his alchemical lab, Plague Knight perfects concoctions both poisonous and explosive. Toxin, disease, and death are his playgrounds. Even his comrades give Plague Knight a wide berth, because he spreads more than just the common cold. With an array of mysterious and magical bottles at his side, Plague Knight could be considered the black sheep of The Order of No Quarter.\nPros: Maniacal scientific mind, fearlessness bordering on recklessness\nCons: Physically weak, short stature, shy at parties\nMole Knight... the shovel may rule the confines of man-made gardens, but in the wild, the titan of tunneling is the mole! Mole Knight embraces this truth wholeheartedly. With his modified drop-forged armored claws, he mockingly tears through the earth with brute strength! Mole Knight calls the subterranean Lost City his home... an ancient abandoned metropolis. Shovel Knight must pass through the Lost City, but chances are slim he won\u2019t be challenged to see who is truly the master of digging.\nPros: Great eyesight, shrewd, high endurance\nCons: Obsessive personality, gets sweaty in armor\nTinker Knight! Some knights love rushing into the glory of battle, ready to crush the skulls of their enemies! Tinker Knight is not one of those knights. He does his fighting before the battle begins, laboring on diabolical devices that do his work for him. The wrench is the tool of his trade, doubling as an engineering device and a melee weapon. Some are quick to dismiss Tinker Knight\u2019s lethality... usually just before falling victim to one of his mechanical monstrosities!\nPros: Gregarious demeanor, hard worker\nCons: Rough hands, works long hours, always out to prove himself\nWe\u2019re going to be sharing more of the Order of No Quarter as the Kickstarter proceeds, so check in often!\nShovel Knight is rendered in a pumped-up 8-bit style. We are adhering to the NES color palette, but adding many modern touches. For example, We have tons of scrolling background layers, giving a real illusion of depth.\nOur pixel animation and attention to detail is top-notch. Every character, even minor foes like these wizards, have painstakingly crafted animations and personalities.\nDetailed, living backgrounds and animation! Big, beautiful pixels! Just look at the screens!! With Shovel Knight, we are developing a next-gen 8 bit game!\nLike all of our favorite games, Shovel Knight has been designed gameplay first! We are especially dedicated to precise control. Pixel-perfect hit boxes, toenail jumps, and mobility mastery are our obsession. That wonderfully elusive 'feel' of great control.\nWhen thinking of the initial concept, we started by saying \u201cwhat if we built a whole game around a downward sword thrust? It would be great to sink into dirt, attack foes by stabbing from above, and maybe even bounce on hard ground! Ok, digging as a major mechanic\u2026 how about it\u2019s a shovel instead of a sword? That way, we can have him use the flat blade of the spade to flip things over and slash!\u201d\nFrom that gameplay concept sprung all of the ideas for Shovel Knight. We've learned from games like Mother 3 that a game becomes much stronger when graphics, story and tone work together to unify the gameplay experience!\nGreat music is central to great games, so it\u2019s with incredible excitement that we can announce that Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman is composing the soundtrack for Shovel Knight! For those of you who don\u2019t know, Jake is one of the most talented audio guys in the game biz, contributing on games from Mighty Switch Force to Contra 4 to Shantae. His most recent work on Double Dragon Neon has garnered as much praise as the game itself!\nNugget love\nTrue to our sense of collaboration, our team likes to involve audio early and often in development. For Shovel Knight\u2019s music, we\u2019re taking an NES+ style approach, adding sound channels and detail for a fuller sound that\u2019s still authentic. In addition to the main theme highlighted in the trailer, check out the track written for Pridemoor Keep, the level we\u2019ll be debuting at PAX!\nIf you liked that, you should just go listen to everything on his website (virt.bandcamp.com) because it\u2019s amazing. And check out the Official Shovel Knight Soundtrack Album backer reward below! WE LOVE JAKE! \nYacht Club Games is an independent game developer started in 2011 by Sean Velasco and a crew from WayForward. We are a fun-loving bunch of gaming geniuses who have dedicated our lives to video games ever since we saw our first pixels. However, our serious and solemn goal is to make really awesome original games that fuse modern and retro sensibilities, and we have the pedigree to prove it! Our team is comprised of top talent that has worked on some amazing titles, including Contra 4, A Boy and His Blob, Thor: God of Thunder, Mighty Milky Way, BloodRayne Betrayal, and most recently, Double Dragon Neon.This is our maiden project as Yacht Club Games, which means we are determined to impress.\nSo what are we all about? We want to create fun and challenging gameplay. We want to both tug at your heartstrings and delight you with levity and charm. We want to make games that you play together with friends and family. Most of all, we want to give everyone the same collective types of game experiences that have defined our generation. It\u2019s such an exciting time to be a fan of games; the industry is experiencing a renaissance and creativity is flourishing. We are so, so excited to develop games that we love, in hopes that you love them too!\nShovel Knight is currently nearing the end of preproduction. This means that the game design has been written, the main character designs and story have been created, and we have a plan for moving forward. We have an early build of the game that proves out our game mechanics and technology; you can see some footage in the trailer and we'll also be at PAX East!\nHowever, many things are still up in the air. Enemies and objects need to be designed and drawn. Audio, Animation, and Backgrounds need to be crafted. Lastly, we need to polish everything to a mirror sheen. Basically, we have what you saw in the video. Now we need to make the whole game.\nSo, we think this is a great time in the process to involve the community. We have a skeleton to build on, but we want you to be the meat!\nVideo games are expensive and time-consuming to develop, so the usual way to get one made is to acquire funding from a publisher. We have had great partnerships with publishers in the past. However, working with a publisher has its drawbacks; you are beholden to them, and they are generally risk averse. We wanted to go to the community, because Kickstarter provides us a unique opportunity to interface directly with our fans and make a game where fun and quality are always the top priorities.\nWe believe in Shovel Knight. We know that the final game is going to be great. We\u2019re so sure of this that we quit our full time jobs to work on it. We\u2019ve poured a massive amount of time, money and effort into our labor of love, but it\u2019s not enough to finish the game. In order to make Shovel Knight a reality, we need you!\nWe have amazing rewards that we are as excited to give out as we are to make! Check \u2018em out below!\nThe Game!\nGet a digital PC copy ( PC, LINUX, MAC, STEAM ) of Shovel Knight, hot off the digital presses! Digital!\nAlso, ALL pledge levels $15 and above will be able to choose on which platform they want their stalwart blue hero!!!\nInstruction Booklet\nThe final Instruction book will have illustrations, not sketches!\nAh, the Instruction Booklet\u2026 the comfort food of books. We still have a few of our favorites, the pages worn and cramped with notes. Together with you, we can bring the lost art of instruction booklets back to the limelight! The Shovel Knight Instruction Booklet is full of important safety information, awesome character art, enemy lists, hints, and space for notes. We are taking the utmost care to make sure that these booklets are true to their predecessors, right down to the way they smell.\nWe want the kids of today to feel the excitement of reading the booklet in eager anticipation of the game\u2019s release, so we are going to send you the booklet FIRST, so you can read it and reread it, and go crazy with anticipation!\nShovel Knight Coffee Table Book\nThis is a Book of the Game! The goal is to make something fun and funny, an entertaining compendium of the whole Shovel Knight production. Design Discussions and sketches! Concept Art and Illustrations! Game Maps, pixel animation sequences, and work-in-progress versions of everything! As we develop Shovel Knight, we\u2019ll be chronicling the process and we want to put it all here on display. As a crazy indie startup, you know there is going to be a lot of juicy stuff!\nShovel Knight Official Soundtrack\nWe already told you how awesome Jake Kaufman's music is. Hopefully you are thinking that Shovel Knight is looking pretty awesome too. Well, now you can own the combined awesome with this pressing of the Official Shovel Knight Soundtrack! Laid delicately into a bejeweled case, this CD and accompanying liner notes will be adorned lovingly with customized art. This is what you want. It\u2019s what we want! It\u2019s what we all want!!\nOfficial Shovel Knight Dirt Signed by The Yacht Club\nThis is the best product photo ever, bwahaha!\nOwn a real piece of the Shovel Knight Saga! At this reward level, we will hand-sign and deliver a handsome, wax-sealed envelope filled with Official Shovel Knight Dirt. We have obtained dirt ( at no small expense, mind you! ) from each area of Shovel Knight\u2019s Kingdom; Gearwork Dirt from the base of the Clockwork Tower, Besmirched Dirt from the Village of Plague, and more! The dirt you receive will be chosen at random, but trust us when we say that all of the dirt is very special. Get it fast, because when it runs out, it\u2019s gone. We\u2019re not made out of dirt here!\nDesign Hangouts\nNow you can take part in our design process! We will be broadcasting on a private video channel available only to our beloved Kickstarter backers! You can be a fly on the wall and listen to us as we hash out the finer details of the design and work through problems, or you can jump in and tell us what to do! There is no guarantee we will listen, but many can attest to our receptiveness to ridiculous ideas. Budding game designers, armchair directors, and trolls can all have lots of fun!\nOriginal Concept Art / Game Design Card\nSuper Design Index Cards!\nThe Yacht Club loves index cards: we use them to quickly communicate ideas! Puzzle setups, boss patterns, and sketches of new enemies; they are hastily scribbled onto cards and passed around! It\u2019s completely awesome, and it also means that by the end of a project, we have a lot of really cool index cards lying around. We are going to send you an original one of these cards! You can specify if you want a design card or an art card. Maybe you\u2019ll get the very first sketch of an enemy that's in the final game!\nYour Likeness In the Game\nAppease your ego by having us painstakingly hand-craft a pixel version of you, which will appear somewhere in Shovel Knight. Send us a photo and we will recreate you in 8-bits and immortalize you forever\u2026 but where will you appear in the game? We know where we are going to put you, but it\u2019s a secret for now!\nSuperDeluxe Canvas Poster Signed by The Yacht Club\nThis is a really super high-quality 24x36 poster, signed by the team and sent to you. Suitable for framing ( you had better frame it! ), this poster will feature the classiest art we have by the end of the project.\nDirector For A Day!!\nAs Director for a day, you will get to design a major character, boss, midboss, or scenario. We\u2019ll take you through the whole process from conception to completion, helping massage your design into the game with probably hilarious results! Check out the details below! NOTE: ( Actual implementation time may be longer than one day )\nYacht Club Sleepover!\nCome to sunny Southern California ( or if you are already here, just drive over to us ) to meet and spend the day with the Yacht Club! We\u2019ll do a studio tour, get a fancy meal (or drive-through if you don\u2019t have a collared shirt, but you can order whatever you want and we'll get like a whole extra bag of hot sauce), and then go back and play games for as long as we can stay up! Maybe we could also wear our jammies and talk about who we have a crush on! Oh, or if you would rather not, that\u2019s ok too\u2026 we\u2019ll take our cues from you I guess.\nYacht Party with the Yacht Club\nIf there is anything the Yacht Club loves as much as making games, it\u2019s partying hard to celebrate a game launch. At this reward level, you will join us in SoCal with other Yacht Club superfriends on an hours-long voyage in celebration of Shovel Knight\u2019s release! All of this is going to be on a Real Yacht on the Real Ocean, which we will be renting for the occasion ( the yacht, not the ocean ).\nListen as we regale you with tales of the game dev trenches! Stumble about as you try to get your sea legs! Sing karaoke and be merry, because tonight, my friend, we are all superstars!\nDid I mention our special musical guest Jake \u201cVirt\u201d Kaufman, who is going to play live?\nIt\u2019s gonna be epic as hell. You should totally come.\nFollow us on Facebook! If you'd like to support us, liking and sharing us would be very appreciated!\nFollow us on Twitter! We always have something dumb to say!\nWatch our YouTubes! New videos and other excitement will be posted here.\nHelp us get on Steam! We need your votes!\nLastly, if you want to reach out to us for ANYTHING, hit us up at: kickstarter@yachtclubgames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking great video games is hard. Like, really hard! Art, design, and technology have to be blended seamlessly to create a cohesive experience. On top of that, it takes time to iterate and expand on ideas. There is a reason lots of awesome games take forever to come out!\n The biggest risk is that Shovel Knight would take longer than anticipated. If production were to go late, cash would be the biggest problem. If catastrophe truly struck, our backup plan would be to pool our remaining funds and partner with venture capitalist or publisher to get the game done. This game is our livelihood, so we will do whatever it takes!\n However, perish the thought of failure!

The Space is in Los Angeles, but everyone online will be able to participate in our talks, workshops, and exhibitions. All of our programs are open to anyone in the world.\nLA Game Space is a nonprofit center for videogame art, design, and research. It is a place for game innovation, education, and exhibition; where all of us can play and make and study and showcase games.\nOur galleries will host large-scale EXHIBITIONS, interactive installations, performances, and retrospectives that can only be achieved at a space like this. We will be sharing catalogs, exhibition documentation, and the conversations surrounding gallery events online for everyone's benefit.\nOur SPEAKER SERIES will feature new dialogues with both traditional and nontraditional game-makers. Our WORKSHOPS will introduce newcomers to the medium and explore new processes and perspectives with experienced creators. Events will be archived and available (for free) online. They will also be livestreamed, and a moderator at the Space will enable worldwide, remote participation.\nRESIDENCIES are the beating heart of the Space. The residents will be creators from diverse backgrounds working collaboratively to create experimental game projects. LA Game Space will provide residents with work space, exhibition opportunities, and feedback from an equally diverse group of bright minds. Our goal is to free residents from the limitations often presented by commercial game development.\nGAME RESEARCH LABS will enable live gameplay recordings including useful metadata such as button presses, pulse rate, face-tracking, and eye movement. These recordings will be made available online for researchers worldwide. The lab will also provide access to a wide variety of platforms and devices\u2014both historical and contemporary\u2014and support experimental hardware and interface projects.\nWe've been working on this project for over 3 years. Now, after thoughtful planning, building an amazing network of supporters, and finding the perfect location\u2014we need your help!\nWe are located in Los Angeles, but we're part of a global conversation, and we have structured the space and its activities so that everyone can take part in it. Remote participation will be offered for our live streaming workshops and presentations via an online moderator, and all events will be watchable online for free even long after they happen! We'll be posting everything we can online including documentation of exhibitions, the residency program, and the conversations surrounding them.\nIf you care about free information and open archives, you will love our initial research lab project to create an open-source video game experience archive. Since video games are an active medium, it is not enough to archive the games themselves. We will be recording video game playthroughs, along with useful metadata such as button presses, eye-tracking, and pulse-rate\u2014and then archiving this data online for anyone to access.\n\u201cWhen you contribute to this Kickstarter campaign, you are not only receiving great rewards\u2014you're providing essential funds for LA Game Space and you're creating a resource that will produce interesting, exciting games for years to come.\u201d \u2014David Surman, Pachinko Pictures\n\u201c\u2026help shape the future of the greatest art form forever\u2026\u201d \u2014Stick Skills\n\u201cIt\u2019s a project that could redefine the idea of what it means to be a game maker.\u201d \u2014Kill Screen\n\u201cIf people like this are so behind it, you know, it's probably worth getting behind.\u201d \u2014Kotaku\n\u201cHead along to the Kickstarter\u2026this is one of the important ones.\u201d \u2014Hookshot Inc.\nDANIEL REHN is a researcher and creator of media/electronic art including video games.

As you probably all know, the band is over. If you want some history/explanation feel free to send us an email or something.\n We played our last show on November 30th. And as was status quo for the band the past several years, the show was wrought with bad luck (or whatever you want to call it). A few days before the show our synth stopped working. The day before the show our vans transmission went out.\nThen at the show we learn that our vinyl was lost in the mail and UPS didn't know where it was. That was probably the biggest bummer, as - lets be honest- very few people buy our music at a record store or online anymore. We wanted to have it there for our die hard great friends/fans who wanted to support us. So the night ends, we say goodbye to friends and family, get paid, load out in a rush, and divide up the bands gear on the sidewalk and head for our respective homes. \n After paying out the local bands and slipping the bartender some extra cash we had around $2000. Our payout was necessary for us to send everyone their kickstarter rewards, as we had about $150 before the night of the show. So, I take the moneybook home and keep it secured in a safe place, and put the disappointment and bad vibes of the band ending, and what I thought were the final frustrations of that night out of my mind for quite awhile. \n When I counted the money I found about $350 (what we sold in merch for the night). The payout from the show was (and currently is) gone. I have turned my apartment upside down, and everyone has searched their cars and the gear. Nothing. We think someone swiped it while we were loading out, as something else was stolen that night from our supposedly secure green room area. \n So, here we are with a van that won't move, and about $350. I am trying to sort out how much a worn out passenger van with over 200,000 miles on it would be worth if I fix the transmission with personal money. My morale is really quite low. The band ended somewhat unexpectedly and I was hopeful that we could end on a positive note. Unfortunately it turned out to be more of the same. \n All this to say, we are still trying to sort out how to at least get the vinyl (they finally showed up over a month late) and whatever else we can to you all. I feel terrible that everyone has been waiting so patiently for so long, and now the band is broke (in more ways than one).\n\n Please let me know if you have any questions. I am hoping and praying the money turns up in some weird and miraculous way. Hey, Id be happy to look dumb and find it in a coat pocket at this point. \n\n Thanks for your time and support over the years.\n\n Jake"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Survey Reminder", "update_content": "Heres a cover for your MP3 players."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 5, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2092046065/healing-power", "project_name": "HEALING POWER"}}, {"backer": "Daniel Johnson", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Magicians started out as a classroom roleplaying game after-school activity at the academy I taught at a few years ago in Korea. I had just finished reading The Magicians, by Lev Grossman, and loved the idea of a person's unhappiness dissatisfaction with the world being the source of their magic. So I came up with the better part of the game, but for teaching English and for some kids I knew had trouble with bullying at school. The kids made up characters, chose their name and we came up with a high school together via world building. The core of the game was largely the same - I gave them points for telling me stories about their character's troubles in school and then they used those points to fight monsters and do cool stuff. \nI always wanted to make a version for Korean and other languages but I always ran into the roadblock of needing someone who was proficient in Korean to mentor, mediate or arbitrate the language learning - until I got a smartphone and started using it for dictation. I came up with the idea to use the dictation app to check for pronunciation and to determine success or failure as a resolution mechanic. The rest is a lot of playtesting, tons of hard work and all of my savings going into initial artwork and editing. \nI'm currently majoring in Korean Education (specifically teaching Korean to non-native speakers) and this roleplaying game is going to be the basis for my thesis. I'm working with industry veterans like Daniel Solis and Ryan Macklin precisely so I can do this game justice and so that you, the backer, know that quality is important to me and this project. This has been a labor of love of mine for a long time and with your help I can actually get it out there!\nIf you hunger for more information about Magicians, you can check out an email interview I did at Futile Position, at Game Knight Reviews or one over at RPG.org, where Rukiara got an article up about her thoughts on the playtest despite falling ill and a trip to the emergency room. In addition, Magicians was recently featured in the Korea Herald! There's another, really nice one up over at Cradle of Rabies now too!\nWant the core idea of Magicians explained to you in under 9 minutes? Check out the interview I did with Ryan Shelton at ROLL FOR NEWS.\nAn interview I did with the guys over at SHARK BONE is up! Here are the show notes I came up with in case you have some specific questions you want to hear answered.\nA few days ago I did an interview with the guys over at ED GAMER, which is a really cool podcast about using games in the classroom and for educational purposes. The guys had me on the other to talk about Magicians and the educational aspect of it. Have a listen! This is a great interview where we talk about the language aspect, the story card element and just how the game is organized and how a game is played.\nI recently did an interview with William, Rudy and Alex over at the MOM'S BASEMENT PODCAST and we talked about Magicians with more of a focus for game designers - about kickstarters, the role-playing and core mechanics behind the language and magic system. I guess we'd have to mark it off as explicit though I think the only swear in there was an exclamation about the amount of money the kickstarter has raised so far.\nJenn of the JENNISODES PODCAST recently had me on for an interview to talk about Magicians and it was a ton of fun. We covered a lot of material - it's one of the longer interviews but touches on pretty much all aspects of the game, the kickstarter, even a bit about RPG culture in Korea so if you're interested for something in-depth with a really fun, energetic host like Jenn be sure to check it out!\nI recently did another interview with Stephen of the POSTCARDS FROM THE DUNGEON PODCAST. It was a really great interview that covered a lot of things rpg gamers would ask questions about I think.\nThe guys at GEEKY & GENKI had me on the podcast a little bit ago and the episode dropped today! If you want to hear a bit about rpgs in Korea, maybe some info you didn't know about gangnam style and Korean culture and what the guys were thinking about for their card pack check it out! I also did a really quick interview recently with METAGAMERS ANONYMOUS which was a  ton of fun. The interview I did for GMS MAGAZINE is now up as well!\nMagicians is about having unlimited creativity without complexity. The only thing that restrains you and your character is your own knowledge of the language because the magic system in the game is a language. Doing away with the necessity of a teacher or even dice, all you need is your smartphone and a few hours a week to game with friends to have fun telling a great story and to learn a language along the way.\nMagicians will connect you to your character, motivate and push you to do more, learn more and make you feel like you're living out one of your favorite fantasy novels. People who love books like the Harry Potter series, the Earthsea books or The Magicians will have a great time using Magicians to tell coming of age stories about students of magic learning about power and responsibility, pride and humility, trying to grow up with the ability to remake the world at their fingertips. \nThe setting takes place in modern-day Seoul and adds Korean folklore, superstition and mythology into the mix to create a dense, unique fantasy setting. Long-standing superstitions in Korea like whistling at night drawing ghosts and snakes to you, or insects and mice stealing souls or turning into people by eating their fingernail clippings are woven into the setting. Nine-tailed foxes seduce the unsuspecting and prowl the night, dokkaebi roam the mountainside along with other mythological Korean creatures like the Bonghwang. Dragons live throughout the rivers and other magical creatures are hidden in plain sight. Characters learn magic, deal with high school and university life, and relearn everything they know about the world - secret magical orders that sew sesame seeds into the skin and practice blood art, strange dogs that have human faces lurk in the shadows, bartering souls back to their owners while those who have lost their own prey on the living.\nWhenever you want to cast a spell, you speak in Korean. There are three systems you can use but the assumption is that you have no knowledge in Korean whatsoever. \nProdigy System: Learn and combine 7 archetypal nouns and 6 verbs to create any kind of spell you can think of. \nApprentice System: Takes the training wheels off and makes it so that you have to come up with your own noun and verb to suit the situation and intent.\nMaster System: Has you speaking in full sentences using target grammar and vocabulary.\nIf you're just starting out you can play the game no problem by just learning how to pronounce 13 words. As you slowly build up your ability you can learn the Korean alphabet, build up vocabulary and then finally start learning how to speak in full sentences. \nThe Korean alphabet is one of the easiest to learn in the world, it was invented precisely so that it can be learned quickly and is completely phonetic. Here's a great little comic by Ryan Estrada, his trick to learning Korean in 15 minutes.\nCards in the game are tools for telling no-prep, fun, collaborative stories. Plot cards are whole adventures boiled down into 10 separate elements that are drawn every round by players to make a fun, interesting and unique adventure every time the cards are used. All players need to start a game is a set of cards and their characters! \nAll games require a system to determine success, failure or how the story progresses when there is conflict. Most games use dice to do this - how you roll affects how the story develops. In Magicians, no dice are required (though they can be used for some things); instead, all you need to do is speak the appropriate Korean words or phrase into your smartphone or computer and a free dictation app will tell you if you were correct or not and if you cast your spell properly. \nThere will be video lessons and free materials for you to watch and download that will help you with everything from pronunciation and the alphabet to more complex grammar patterns if find yourself really wanting to dig in. The PDFs will also have audio files built in so that when any Korean is clicked on an audio recording with proper pronunciation will play so you'll never have to wonder how something in the book is pronounced.\nDaniel Solis (Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple) will be doing the layout for the game.\nRyan Macklin (The Dresden Files, Leverage) is already hard at work editing the book and is doing both development and line editing.\nHaoran Zhang will be contributing most of the interior black and white artwork along with Theresa Simons and Jamie Lafond.\nThe book is going to be about 120 pages, will be softcover with a color cover and black and white interior. It will have original illustrations by Haoran Zhang, Jamie Lafond and Theresa Simons. All the artwork is already paid for and has been commissioned; development editing has been paid for and is nearing completion. This kickstarter is to cover the cost of design and layout, line editing, book printing and shipping.\n*UPDATE* Instead of a 120-page softcover, the book is going to be a 180-page hardcover. However, this means that the book will NOT be available in April and will have to be pushed about 10 weeks. \nThere will be an improved playtest document that can be used to play and provide feedback (if you are so inclined) upon the kickstarter's completion at the latest. The physical game I'm hoping to have in everyone's hands by March with the PDF being released as soon as any feedback is taken into consideration, editing is completed and Daniel works his magic.\nAt the student sketch level, you send us a picture of yourself in high school so that we can set you up with a custom character sheet with your high school self on it! I love the idea of being able to choose someone from this booklet for whenever players need a character to come to life in their game. We'll be putting out the booklet separately and free to all backers; that way whenever you play a game it will be like you're playing with other backers!\nAt the professor sketch level, you get to detail the classes you teach. This is one of the ways to limit the type or power of the spells that characters can cast when first starting a campaign. Without class rules, you are only limited by your creativity when casting spells (which may be what you want in your campaign) but adding the option of choosing which classes your character is taking imposes some boundaries on yourself so that you have to be both more creative and specialize in certain types of spells and magic which can make for a fun dynamic at the table.\nAt the professor level you also get to make up your own spell, name it, provide a cool description and I will handle putting in the mechanics and adding it to the book! \n*All these add-ons include shipping anywhere in the world*\nThe signed, numbered, stamped upgrade is the limited edition version of the book. Now that all the books will be hardcover, for helping out with the extra cost of production, shipping, I'm going to get a special stamp made which I'll use to stamp the book. I'll also personalize it by signing it and numbering it and I, of course, won't do this for any books sold after the kickstarter. To keep it fair for all backers and to make it easier on myself, the numbered books will be randomized!\nSecond, Third Book if you'd like to get a second or third book as a gift or to...fill up your bookshelf...I'll be able to provide them at a slight discount, I know it's not much but profit margins are going to be pretty small and more than three books will mean I won't be able to use small parcel shipping so 3 books is the limit, though you can still add in other stuff you may want.\nYour spell in the book is for people who would like to add some content in the book. With the drastic page count increase I'm going to need to commission more art and I'll have more space for more examples. For some spells I will replace or add any examples needed with your own spell and if we get a lot I'd love to make a section for spells you all come up with. You can use a first or last name incorporated in the spell and give me a description of it and I'll add in the Korean mechanics and work on the spell with you. For power levels think similar to Harry Potter - a really high-level spell will kill someone, really big spells are possible but require multiple participants. Send me a message and let me know what you're thinking and I'll work with you on it and I'll provide the mechanics so you just need to worry about something really cool! In particular spells that involve Illusions, Telekinesis, Dispelling, Healing, Precision, Buffing, Clairvoyance, Summoning, Controlling Time and Transformations have a high chance of being illustrated.\n*All of these add-ons can be added to any reward level you choose by clicking on the 'manage my pledge' button and manually raising the dollar amount by however much money is required for the add-on you would like. At the end of the kickstarter I'll send out a survey asking what extra add-ons you purchased for your reward level. Thanks everyone!*\nThe beads, coins and coin pouch can be viewed by scrolling down the page.\nAll T-shirts are from SHIROI NEKO's (white cat) T-shirt line. I will be buying and shipping them here in Korea. All of the shirts are really cool and inspired by vintage manga, retro tattoos, Mexican \"day-of-the-dead\" art as well as other culture aesthetics. Due to the process used when making them, no two shirts are alike and all of them are really good quality, designed in Japan and made in Thailand. As you can see, I will be offering them at a significant discount since I will be buying them from a Korean retailer and friend and then shipping them myself (click on the picture to see the American store). The shirts are only offered in medium and large sizes. \nIf you would like to add a T-Shirt to your pledge, please add $40 to your pledge (this includes shipping anywhere in the world)\nAll beads are made by Buddhist monks here in Korea. They are high quality and look great. On one side they have both Chinese and Korean writing that says \"health charm\" on it and, on the other, a Chinese zodiac symbol. Upon the completion of the kickstarter, a survey will be sent out in which you can specify which zodiac symbol you would like to have on your beads. These beads inspired a part of the setting as the beads allow access to the school for magic through the great gates of Seoul.\nIf you would like to add a set of beads to your pledge, please add $15 to your pledge (this includes shipping anywhere in the world)\nThe coins can be used for drama points in the game, whenever players earn them in certain scenes they can grab some and place them on their character sheet in the representative places. The coins are 19th century Korean coin replicas and are very cool, they've got some heft to them as well.\nIf you would like to add a set of 50 coins to your pledge, please add $20 to your pledge (this includes shipping anywhere in the world)\nThese are some cool, traditional silk pouches you can use for keeping you coins in if you like. I'm only going to be sending out the bigger ones that are about 18cm wide, 24cm tall and can hold well over 300 coins I think so you should be covered. They come in all kinds of colors: plum, dark plum, purple, light purple, orange, light orange, pink, light pink, green, light green, navy blue, sky blue, jade, a light yellowish green, yellow, light/dark brown, red, mustard, pearl grey. \nIf you would like to add a coin pouch to your pledge, please add $8 to your pledge (this includes shipping anywhere in the world)\nSince we couldn't properly demonstrate the mechanics behind casting spells in regards to using your smartphone to check pronunciation and to determine success or failure, here is a short video to show you what it's like!\nHere is an example of how to use the free dictation app, Dragon Dictation, for iOS in Magicians to determine if you cast a spell successfully or not. You don't have to write down the spell in Korean on your phone if you don't want to of course, you could always just write it down on some paper and if it matches, good! Also, the pdf will play back proper pronunciation of all Korean words in the book so even if you don't have a smartphone you could say your spell, click on the word in the pdf (or do so via google translate, naver, etc) and if it matches, good!\nThe guys over at the Mom's Basement Podcast sent me an Actual Play podcast of them playing a session of Magicians. There is some swearing in there, so be aware of that, and is only audio but it should be useful to see some of the mechanics in a game with different, more serious play compared to our video above and one not led or facilitated by me. You can check it out at the Magicians website complete with show notes.\nFor anyone that is supporting multiple kickstarter projects check down here every now and then to see if you're eligible for a free adventure made in collaboration with other project creators as an extra thank you!\nA Tragedy in Five Acts is a kickstarter project run by Matthew McFarland who has already seen a kickstarter through to a more than successful conclusion. The game is role-playing game in which 5 players work together to create a tragedy of Shakespearean proportions. If you're a backer of both Magicians and A Tragedy in Five Acts at a level that gets you the game, $10 or more, you will get an adventure in the form of a 10 card pack created by Matthew McFarland entitled \"Cloud-Capped Towers\", inspired by Shakespeare's The Tempest for free as a thank you for supporting kickstarters like ours!\nMotobushido is a kickstarter project run by Nathanael Cole that is about samurai, dueling and motorcycles - think Sons of Anarchy mixed with The Seven Samurai. All of those backers who happen to be backing Motobushido at the $25 level and up will be receiving a free card pack designed in collaboration with Nathanael. In addition, he's going to be giving Magician backers over there a new, exclusive path called the \uac70\ub798\uc790 or the Dealmaker! Pretty awesome! To top it off, the path is going to be illustrated by Rick Marks, who is doing the art for Motobushido and who illustrated the comic series \"The Words\" about a guy who learns words of power. Very fitting indeed!\nBase Raiders is an RPG designed by Ross Payton and is raiding the bases of now-gone superheroes and super-villains in a new type of dungeon crawl experience. For backers of Magicians at the $10 level and higher as well as those whoa re backing Base Raiders at the $15 level and up (which nets you a digital copy of the game) you will receive an exclusive card pack designed by Ross Payton himself in which the mansion of a missing and known-to-be-powerful sorcerer is discovered and a race to the mansion to see what treasures are secreted within ensues! You also get a PDF of three Korean-myth themed base raiders: a magician, a dragon in human form, and a kumiho (nine-tailed fox spirit). The team searches bases for a lost mystical treasure and can be allies or enemies in your Base Raiders RPG campaign!\n*UNLOCKED* Designed by the Shark Bone Podcast, a digital card pack in which people mysteriously start go missing.

The system will be a way to both add a totally new type of magic to your game, reinforce Chinese-derived vocabulary in Asian languages, and will be a great way to start learning Chinese. Available to all backers for free.\nMoney goes towards a website where I'll be able to host community content and make sure everyone can share their hacks and ideas with everyone else as well as a place to put up video tutorials and other content to help with language learning. The original idea I had to make a forum with the capability to play Magicians or any other RPG via play-by-post with the added functionality of voice support. Instead of just text and images, the ability to post and send voice snippets up to 3 minutes in length (though, most often much shorter of course) is something I want to have happen, unfortunately it's really expensive since no one has done it before.

There just aren\u2019t that many quality original RTS games coming out. If you love to play games like Total Annihilation your options are pretty limited. This is where Planetary Annihilation comes in. It is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be.\nA Solar System Is Your Playground \nExpand your empire to harness the resources of entire solar systems to create vast armies with which to annihilate enemy planets, destroy rival systems and win the Galactic War! \nPick Your Battles\nPlay a quick skirmish with a friend on a single planet map with a low unit cap or a 12+ hour game with 40 of your closest frenemies and thousands of units. You can also hone your skills against Planetary Annihilation\u2019s AI or team up with a friend against multiple AI\u2019s. \nAdvanced Command and Control\nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s order queuing interface allows you to control massive armies spread across multiple worlds with ease. Get strategic views of the action anywhere, anytime by zooming in and out of the war zone, and use split interfaces and multiple windows to keep an eye on multiple battlegrounds at once. \nProcedural Planet Creator\nCreate custom or randomized maps with our procedural planet creator. Like what you see? Save them and share them with the Planetary Annihilation community. \nStreaming Resource Economy \nUse resources to build mega projects. Assign swarms of construction units in realtime to manage your economy. Reclaim wreckage and terrain to quickly regroup after a battle. \nWar Machine \nPlanetary Annihilation\u2019s rendering engine is brought to you by the team that developed the rendering engines for Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander. Our engine will allow you to explore vast, new procedural worlds with diverse terrain and build on everything from small, airless rocks to huge earth-type planets. No two maps are exactly alike.\nClient-Server Networking Architecture\nOther than Total Annihilation, which was asynchronous, most Real-Time Strategy games use a synchronous networking model, which means that all the computers in a given game are held back by the slowest machine. The Planetary Annihilation engine uses a client-server model so that the \u201cheavy lifting\u201d can be done on a game server, freeing up gamers\u2019 machines to engage in bigger battles with more players!\nAdvanced Modding features\nCreate new units, gametypes, maps and planet archetypes.  Run your own servers with your own sets of units and game modes.\nUber Entertainment is an independent game studio founded in 2008 by a team of industry veterans who wanted to create high quality games in a small team environment. In 2010 we released our first title, the critically-acclaimed Monday Night Combat. In 2011 we brought MNC to Steam and in 2012 we released Super Monday Night Combat, which we continue to update weekly.\n(We all really really want to make this game for you.)\n(We each have a lot of experience in building and delivering.)\nFolks at Uber Entertainment have worked on games like Total Annihilation, Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander and Demigod. We are hugely passionate about Real-Time Strategy and can\u2019t wait to show you our vision for the future of the genre.\n(Steve and Jon are our leads. Design and dev are BFFs at Uber.)\nJon Mavor has worked in the game industry since 1993. As a longtime game engine technologist, Jon wrote the graphics engine for Total Annihilation and was the lead programmer on Supreme Commander. He has been the CTO of Uber Entertainment since its inception and is the creative lead for Planetary Annihilation.\nSteve Thompson got his start in 1997 at Cavedog Entertainment, where he worked on Total Annihilation. In 1999 he joined Gas Powered Games where he worked as an animator, director of cinematics, and art director for the Dungeon Siege and Supreme Commander franchises.  Steve joined Uber in 2008 and is the art director on Planetary Annihilation.\nFor more information on the dev team, please visit www.uberent.com.\nLet\u2019s face it, game publishers today want sequels in very restrictive genres. In many cases game publisher overhead makes small projects not interesting to them. \nThat\u2019s where you, the RTS fan, comes in. \n(We can only get it off the ground together.)\nIt\u2019s very unusual to put something like this in front of gamers this early in the process.  We are in a new era where you get to decide what we spend our time on.  Planetary Annihilation is meant to be a truly innovative spin on what RTS games can and should be. You as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.  \nPlease support us, tell your friends and participate in the discussion.

As the next step, they are planning to create a 110-second trailer with the funds raised hopefully through kickstarter, and the trailer will then be presented to potential investors and institutions for further fund raising to produce the entire film.\nBesides serving as a pilot/trailer for the feature film, the trailer is designed to be used as an awareness video for ongoing human rights abuse in North Korea.
