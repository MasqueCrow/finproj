[{"backer": "Tony Yates", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi everyone!\n\nI'm Alec Shaw, a Seattle based musician/producer currently fundraising for my fourth solo studio project, thank you for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter campaign. This is my first time asking people publicly to help me fund my album, so it's something that is a little scary for me. I've always put everything I have into the music I make, but due to COVID-19 I'm not able to pull it off alone.\n\n2020 started with my first featured plays on KEXP Seattle, a world famous independent radio station for new artists. This shot me to new heights in my career. Within a couple weeks I was flying to LA meeting with record labels, playing industry showcases, booking festivals I've always wanted to play, getting praise from artists I've loved for years, and had a slew of sold out shows opening for incredible artists. After 5 years of working hard, playing multiple shows a week, and self-producing my albums, it felt like I was finally getting my break.\n\nAs you know, in March of 2020 everything came crashing down with the pandemic. The music industry being hit the hardest of all, and none of my dreams had been realized... YET.\n\nI finished writing the last songs on my fourth album that April, called my producer friend Andy Park (Death Cab For Cutie, Noah Gunderson, Macklemore) and between the COVID induced panic attacks got to work setting the songs to tape. With a limited budget my plan was to play all the instruments myself, and for studio time using the money I had earned producing other artists that year. It didn't take long for what started as bunch of demo quality performances of me (playing instruments I didn't necessarily excel at) to become a collection of beautifully crafted songs with vivid arrangements.\nI had friends step up and contribute to help me create what I had imagined the songs to be, friends that believed in my vision and wanted to see it come to life even when it seemed impossible. These were drummers, guitarists, string players, choir directors, studio owners, and engineers, all people that make the music community what it is. I believe this contributed to making this project develop its purpose. These six songs are all my best work.\nPhoto By: Mark Alvis. Jon Berry (Violin) Alec Shaw, Katie Kuffel (Cello), Ed Brooks (Pedal steel) Recording \"I'll Just Let You Down\" for \"Quantity\" at studio Litho\nI didn't leave any song on that I was unsure of, and because of this I'm thinking of naming the project \"Quantity\" as a testament to the thing I had to let go of during this trying time. In the past I would get caught up thinking more is better. \u201cMore money, more songs, more instruments, more shows, larger audiences.\u201d\n\nDuring this season when the hustle was taken away (or put on pause), we had to play music together purely for the joy of it again. I forgot all about the quantity and all that was left was the soul. That's the thing that matters in music in the end. That's what people connect with and what I had to connect with to create this Album.\n\nI'm in the final push. As things will be opening up soon I need to be able to offer this to you, and I can't do it without you!\nHere are the things your contribution will go towards paying:\n\n- Studio Rental / Recording Engineer\n- Producer fees\n- Paying the Musicians\n- Post Production / Mixing and Mastering\n- Photos / Album Art & Design\n- Printing CDs & Vinyl\n- Promos\n- Kickstarter Fees / Shipping\n\nThank you so much for those who have supported me this far, and a big Thank You to all those who have just started. I can't wait to make music for you again and hopefully in person soon.\n\n Here is one of the songs that is featured on the album I was able to release already!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFunding my album through Kickstarter is taking a huge risk. I need to reach my goal or I won't receive any of the money. I know there are many people who have and will support me, but due to the size of my audience and that they are mostly younger I know that I will need all the help I can get to reach my goal. I also know that 2020 was a difficult year for more than just musicians. Anyone who was impacted, who lost a job, or couldn't work is still struggling now or still recovering making it a hard time to raise money in general. My hope is to see us all together in 2021 experiencing new music with our loved ones, and not feeling afraid.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "Get the EP before it's official release!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Download of the lossless master WAV files\nDigital artwork", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital EP Download + Exclusive Demos", "descp": "Includes the EP and exclusive raw demos of songs that won't be released publicly!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Download of the lossless master WAV files\nDigital artwork\nRaw demos of songs that didn't make it on this EP", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Signed CD + Digital Download", "descp": "Get the full EP, art, and demo download plus a signed CD and personal thank you letter for supporting me!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Download of the lossless master WAV files\nDigital artwork\nRaw demos of songs that didn't make it on this EP\nSigned CD\nPersonal thank you letter", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["11 backers", "Limited (89 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Signed Vinyl + Digital DL", "descp": "There's nothing like holding an LP in your hands, reading through the liner notes, looking at all the art.

It is time to take him to the NEXT LEVEL with his very own FEATURE HORROR/COMEDY \"ONYX THE FORTUITOUS AND THE TALISMAN OF SOULS.\" \nOnyx is the brainchild of writer and performer Andrew Bowser. Through an ongoing series of viral videos spanning nearly 9 years, Onyx has permeated every corner of pop culture. The character has amassed over 300 million views online and his content has been shared by numerous celebrities and referenced in multiple hit songs. \nAs a director, Bowser has helmed numerous independent films that have had premieres at SXSW, Seattle International, and Chattanooga Film Festival. He has worked with Legendary Pictures, Warner Bros. Games, Blizzard Entertainment, Funny or Die, Chrysler, and Marvel. He has also directed horror mainstays like Barbara Crampton, Bruce Campbell, and Adrienne Barbeau. \nThis film is the culmination of Bowser's abilities as a director and Onyx's potential as a resonating comedic character. \nTHE TALISMAN OF SOULS is a horror/comedy in the vein of 80's favorites like GREMLINS and FRIGHT NIGHT. It's a throwback to an era when horror movies were equal parts absurdity and humanity. \nPoster art by Lukas Ketner\nThe story follows fledgling Satanist Marcus J. Trillbury (Onyx) as he attends a once-in-a-lifetime ritual at his idol BARTOK THE GREAT'S dark mansion. Once there, Marcus meets a group of other worshippers. As the group is led by Bartok and his assistant Farrah in a series of rituals meant to \"better them,\" it becomes clear that their intentions are more nefarious. As his new friends are losing the battle to keep their souls, a question of great destiny looms over Onyx's head: is he doomed to be a nobody or is he the only one who can defeat Bartok and save his friends from damnation?\nInspiration for \"Talisman of Souls\"\nTHE VISION BEHIND THE FILM \n ---NEW \"FILM ONLY\" REWARDS! ---\nFULL REWARDS BREAKDOWN!\nCAMPAIGN PRODUCTION CREDITS : \nMAIN TITLE DESIGN BY JUSTIN CROWELL\nMAIN TITLE THEME BY ROB AMJARV\nMAIN TITLE SOUND DESIGN BY MIKE JAMES GALLAGHER\nTITLE HEADER ILLUSTRATIONS BY CHEY EPSEJO\nThrough his many years creating content in this industry, Bowser has amassed an amazingly talented team to surround him and Onyx on this project.\nDAN ADLERSTEIN/DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY\nDan is an LA based DP who works on a wide variety of projects in television, commercials, narrative, documentary, and digital content.\nHe has worked extensively in TV, shooting for HBO, CBS, Netflix, Amazon, HULU, AppleTV, and more.  His commercial work includes campaigns for Old Spice, Kahlua, Zappos, Fox Sports, as well as many other brands. His narrative work has been featured in festivals worldwide, including Sundance and Cannes.\nDan is an alumn of Wesleyan University where he majored in Film Studies, focusing mostly on film history and theory.  He went on to earn an MFA in Cinematography at the AFI Conservatory.\nDan is a member of IATSE Local 600 and on the Industry Experience Roster as a Director of Photography. He recently shot the Netflix show \"Aunty Donna's Big Ole' House of Fun\" and Bowser's short \"Little Willy.\"\nSTUDIO ADI/SPECIAL EFFECTS\nSTUDIO ADI is a group Academy Award winning creators of special characters and character effects. Calling upon a diverse range of talents and techniques, they create prosthetic make-ups, animatronic puppets, actor duplicates, and replica animals. With over twenty-five years of professional experience, they bring \"real\" character effects to the set to interact with actors, lighting, and practical atmosphere. Studio ADI prides themselves on working with the industry's leading CGI companies to find the right balance of digital and practical effects.  They continue to provide filmmakers with realistic and economical character effects that best serve the story and the production. Their credits include films such as IT, Godzilla VS. Kong, The Predator, and The Nun.\nMATT MAHAFFEY/COMPOSER\nMatt Mahaffey is a self-described quirky musician. After having niche success with a rock band, he found out - much like Mothersbaugh and Elfman - that his ideas fit better over the course of 11-75 minutes of picture than it did in a 3-minute pop song. The Shrek universe was his first job in film/tv and it was the gift that kept on giving.  He started a composer collective with his wife, creating scores for dozens of television shows over the last decade, including \"Rise of the Ninja Turtles.\"\nHe's worked with some of the biggest names in the industry, including doing 3 years on the road with Beck and writing and performing on his Grammy-award winning album Morning Phase. He also received Gold Sales Awards for Keith Urban\u2019s Fuse and Lupe Fiasco\u2019s Lasers, among others, and Platinum Sales Awards for Vitamin C and HelloGoodbye. Matt also scored \"Little Willy\" and Bowser grew up idolizing his work in the band Self.\nMIKE JAMES GALLAGHER/SOUND DESIGNER\nMike James Gallagher is a sound designer and re-recording mixer currently living and working in Los Angeles. As a sound designer he has worked for clients like Netflix, Hulu, Marvel, Lagavulin, Pro Sound Effects, Crypt TV, and Nerdist, among others. His work has also been featured in numerous festivals including Sundance and Edinburgh International. In 2018 he created the popular sound-oriented YouTube channel INDEPTH Sound Design (https://www.youtube.com/indepthsounddesign).\nMike met Bowser at Comic Con 10 years ago and they've been collaborating ever since on projects including Monster Machine, Worm, and Little Willy. He also enjoys writing about sound for picture, most recently writing the episode \"Storytelling with Cinematic Sound Design\" for the popular YouTube channel Film Riot. Some of his latest sound design work is featured in the Netflix series, Song Exploder, which was adapted from the acclaimed podcast of the same name.\nBOWSER'S DIRECTING REEL\nLITTLE WILLY (SHORT FILM)\nTHRILL ME!

Or rather, we were. We stopped performing in 2015, after 20-ish years of circling the globe kicking out the jams in tiny clubs and massive festivals and everything in between. Like Zamfir, the Master of the Pan Flute, we have \"enchanted millions\". Maybe YOU were one of these people!** \n**Or two of these people, if you are looking over the shoulder of a co-worker or spouse. \nOur debut album came out in 1995, first on a tiny Seattle label called Pop Llama, then some <action-packed> months later on COLUMBIA RECORDS. At some point early in the process, we did a sub-license <----(music business term!) with a small Spanish label for vinyl, and they made a few copies.  They continue to be battled over to this day. See below ......\nI'm being told there may have been a Dutch version as well? Maybe a bootleg? Who knows ANYHOOOOO there aren't very many out there is what I'm trying to tell you! \nYikes $185! Yikes BAD COVER!\n Great question!  \n1995 was a time when vinyl seemed like a format whose days were numbered. Because OMG COMPACT DISCS! We stayed very busy circling the globe and kicking out the jams and selling gajillions of these \"CDs.\" Here are some of the concepts we may have lost track of during this turbulent time:\nclean laundry\ntime zones\noccasionally eating salad \nreleasing our album on vinyl \nIt wasn't until years later when INTERNET let people talk to us that we found out we had made a huge mistake\nSo here we are, coming up on its 25th birthday....BOOM VINYL PUSA! \n\nThis is a celebratory FANCY-PANTS edition, white vinyl with green and bronze marbling. There's even a poster inside that you can take right down to your local tattoo shop and say \"please put this across my back!\"**\n**do not actually do this.\nWe are post-rock-band. While we remain friends and enjoy frequent lunches together, we have no label, no management, no infrastructure, no \"team\". That's OK though! We  don't need any of that stuff!*** Thanks to INTERNET and whatnot the music is out there for anyone who wants to hear it (that's my vague understanding of INTERNET.)\nAnd (this is important) we own most of our music, including this album! So involving a label again is kind of the opposite of what we want moving forward. Kickstarter gives us the chance to bring this directly to you, and (also important) figure out how many of you are interested in having one of these hot slabs of wax!  Also: not for nothing, but our research shows that people in general like and trust Kickstarter the most out of all the crowdfunding sites!\n***except the lunches.\n\nWhat kind of a question is that.....what CAN'T you get??\nFirst, the TECHY STUFF: \nBoth formats here are from when we remastered the album in 2005 with Vlado Meller (who is a big deal in the mastering game). It's a little bit shinier than the original, and we like it a lot. So much in fact, that we could find no legit excuse to remaster it again for vinyl.*****\n Everyone gets a link to the album as either WAV or 320k mp3 files. I don't know what that means, but I'm sure they will be higher quality than listening on a streaming service, or most regular mp3 files. So that's nice. \ntl;dr the digital stuff will sound better than what you have unless you have the 10 year anniversary edition in some form already.\nAND I believe we've already mentioned there is a HOT SLAB OF WAX involved! Please take this moment to admire it again! \n*****TURNS OUT the main reason one would want to re-master specifically for vinyl has something to do with the gain levels of stuff that was originally mastered for CD yadda yada I don't know I may have fallen asleep while I wrote this sentence anyway Vlado addressed that and it sounds great so let's relax with a martini poolside\n\n And here is a handsome shirt that we thought looked nice, and you won't find it anywhere else, so I mean it seems pretty important to get one now, right? Fun fact: After the campaign we will contact you to SELECT A SIZE and we will hound you constantly until you do. Eventually we will send some gym socks and a chia pet, and you will have no-one to blame, because you did not SELECT A SIZE on the friendly survey we sent you! \nS, M, L, XL! Sorry, limited sizes!\nAnd look here: a snappy enamel pin. This is a victory lap that can be worn out and about on a hat or lapel! In case you were wondering it is 1.5 inches a side. \n\n\nSTRAIGHT UP OUR NOSES\nKIDDING. The only thing that ever went up our noses were farts on a tour bus. \nBut yeah, us! There's all the normal things that need paying for...pressing, shrink wrapping, packing, mailing etc...there are many bites taken from the apple before the applesauce phase....\nI am using the \"apple\" metaphor because apples are often used to make \"pie\" and Kickstarter even suggests using a \"pie chart\" in this section, but I donut know how to make a \"pie chart\" even though I love pie. I love all desserts, did you even notice that I said \"donut\" instead of \"do not\"?\nWe're thinking of this as a fun way to get a thing into the world that we should have done years ago, while not having to do very much of the actual work ourselves. Instead we're hiring talented people to oversee production, fulfillment, art, and our fragile tempers. Everything is being made here in the USA by independent businesses. The HOT SLABS OF WAX are being pressed in Athens, GA by Kindercore, and inserted into jackets from LA's Stoughton Printing. The handsome shirts will be screened by Ruby Sue Graphics, likewise in Athens. \nHere is some info about our fulfillment partner:\nthey are called Fulfillment Merch, and they have a website.\nthey are very good at shipping vinyl.\nthey use vinyl-specific packaging made from recycled materials, which is nice.\npeople seem to like them! \nholy cow they are ALSO in Athens, GA....this must be some coincidence!\n\n\nSeriously, fam.....\nWe have been so lucky to be able to play music in your earholes and your hometowns and your cars for 20-ish years. YOU made it happen, and we have been humbled and honored by your continued interest and dare I say passion for our particular silly brand of rock and roll music. We hope this particular WAX piece of the big puzzle gives some of you more joy. You gotta love everybody...!\nXO PUSA", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRather than separating risks and challenges, let me talk a little about what I'm calling: GENERAL ANXIETIES.\n\nUGH shipping costs. I wish these were less! We've spent considerable energy making sure the numbers are correct territory by territory. There's some info on our fulfillment partner somewhere up there in the main story!\n\nTIMELINES: Everything should go smoothly and we'll be getting stuff into your actual hands by the middle of April (after this campaign runs for four weeks). We've got good people helping us in all aspects of production and fulfillment, so please oh please let it all go smoothly!\n\nALSO....we're not touring, because we're not touring, sorry!

My name is Harald Geisler. I am a typographer specialised in handwriting fonts. Here on Kickstarter I created fonts based on Albert Einstein's and Sigmund Freud's handwriting. Now, with approval of the King Estate in Atlanta, I would like to continue the series and create a font based on Martin Luther King jr.'s handwriting.\nWhat does Dr. King's handwriting look like?\nThe civil rights activist and minister's speeches and actions resonated around the world and continue to inspire generations today. We all know what his voice sounds like, but as a typographer I became curious: how did he prepare his speeches and organised his thoughts in writing, and what does Dr. King's handwriting look like?  \nOn your computer or smartphone fonts are the \u201csoftware\u201d that make text (letters, punctuation, numbers, etc.) appear on your screen: \nIn programmes like Word, Pages or Open Office you can choose different fonts to write in. Common fonts are Times, Arial, Helvetica and if this project is successful (fingers crossed): soon the Martin Luther King font.\nEverywhere you work with text, you can use the font. Here is an example of how to use handwriting fonts to create a paper: \nSupport this campaign and you can soon use Martin Luther King's handwriting with your projects: college papers \u2014 surprise your teacher with a paper about Martin Luther King in his handwriting, student assignments \u2014 surprise your students with a test \"handwritten\" by Dr. King, holiday-cards, invitations, hand-outs, a personal recipe book, tattoos, cover art for your new album,  email-art, titles for a video project, online-art or a cover for your book\u2026 \nHere you see the current state of the Martin Luther King font prototype:  \nThe font will work with your computer (PC, Mac, Linux) and phone or tablet (Android, iPhone, iPad). First time you install a font? Have a look at this Helpful Font Guide - PDF on how to use and install fonts \u2192here.\nWhat will the Martin Luther King font be based on? \nMy aim with these handwriting projects is to open a door to the content of an author through the aesthetic of handwriting and the general interest for typography and fonts, and with that to create awareness for the cultural activity of writing and to imagine a creative vision for the future of writing in the 21st and 22nd century.\nAs a typographer I search for meaningful ways to relate to writing. The available styles of typefaces are often copies or versions of another with little variation.  I believe that writing today needs new ways to relate and adequately express oneself. I hope that the Martin Luther King font will become a meaningful addition to your writing. \nPractically creating a handwriting font requires samples of every (lower- and uppercase) letter of the alphabet. I select a variety of manuscripts that are representative of the author's hand and are interesting and relevant to give an insight to the author's body of work and time. Like this here: \nDr. King's notes regarding Hegel's Philosophy (ca. 1952 / 1953). From the King Library and Archives, Atlanta.\nThe cards you see above are Dr. King's study notes about Hegel's philosophy while he studied at Boston University, they can be found in the King Library and Archives in Atlanta or the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University. While creating the font I will share with you background information about the manuscripts used in the creation, why they are important and where to find them.\nTo complete this art project, 27,059\u20ac are needed (find budget details below). The way Kickstarter works is that you can pledge for this project. In return for your peldge and to encourage you to support this project, I am offering you rewards. For example other handwriting fonts that I created here on Kickstarter or a poster, in return for your pledge. You can also make a donation if you just want to support this project, this can be done by pledging and choosing \"no reward\" or by simply pledging a bit more than your chosen reward tier. Donations are great, because I do not have to pay taxes on them. \nEither way: If this project does not reach its funding goal until the end of the campaign (25. October 2019), I will not be able to complete the Martin Luther King font and all pledges will automatically be transferred back to the backers.\nMy wish is that this project gets into the hands of as many interested people as possible. I do not want to exclude anyone for financial reasons, that is why I keep the entry reward as low as possible at 1 Euro. If you wish to support this project with more I have created some very interesting rewards below.\nThe \"Personal Typography Coach\" reward is very dear to me, because it is about more than sharing the font, it is about enabling you to use the font in the way you want to. \nThink of it as booking a session with your personal typography coach. There is something you like to do with the font, but you don\u2019t know yet how to do it. Harald will help you personally! May it be a leaflet, school paper, holiday card, instagram series or tattoo \u2014 First I will listen to what you are aiming to do and we talk about your project through a 30 minute Skype, phone or email conversation. From there I\u2019ll create a step-by-step tutorial based on your skill level (novices are welcome), software and device you use. I will improve the guide based on your feedback and share the tutorial with all backers.\nAll projects are welcome: you\u2019re working on a paper about Dr. King, a student assignment, you like to use the font in your Newsletter or email, create hand-outs, holiday-cards, a recipe book or album cover. This may be a general question like: how do I get the font on a t-shirt? or about fine tuning the drop shadow on the cover art for you latest album\u2026\n\u2014 All questions are welcome.\n\n50/100/150/200\u20ac @work commercial licence \u2022 Receive the Martin Luther King Font(50\u20ac) and additional Fonts(100/150/200\u20ac) to use at work in a commercial context (e.g. Design Studio, Advertising Agency, Newspaper, etc.) on PC, Mac, Linux, iPhone and iPad.\n\u20ac800 Presentation + Q&A // \u20ac1,500 Workshop with Harald Geisler \u2022 These rewards are for individuals, groups or universities and schools interested in typography, font making, crowdfunding, handwriting and everything that relates to this project or typography in general. A presentation will be with Q&A session about the project. The workshop will take either two or four days. Schedule, topic and details to be discussed. I will travel everywhere, but additionally you will have to cover traveling costs (flight, train and hotel) from Frankfurt, Germany. \nYour contribution will make the Martin Luther King font better and will go directly to everybody who receives the font. Your generous support will allow me to add one additional alphabet to the font \u2014 which makes its appearance more complex and one alphabet closer to the original.\nI can not thank you with a physically equivalent reward but you will be credited accordingly and feel free to pick from all the rewards above. \nYou have a question about the rewards \u2014 simply reach out to me through Kickstarter or my website. I am happy to help you. \nBelow you will find additional information to answer common questions about the project. If you have a question that is not answered below, feel free to contact me through Kickstarter or reach out in the comment-section of the project, I am happy to hear from you.\nOverview:\nThe ABC of how a \"handwriting\"-font is made.\nHow can a font look like beautiful handwriting? \nImprovising the @ sign\nInspiration - (History of the project) \nTimeline - When will the font be ready?\nBudgeting \u2022 How will the funding be used?\nKickstarter References\nPress\nTechnicalities: Font specifications \nCredits\nI  created multiple handwriting projects, for example the Sigmund Freud Typeface, based on Freud's handwriting, the Albert Einstein Font and Martin Luther Font. With each project I refine my process and everything I learn benefits the next project. Let me walk you through the basic steps of my process:\nA. Understanding Movement \u2014 Every writer has their own way of moving on paper, which can be described with characteristic angles. For example the angle at which one letter connects to the next \u2014 not all letters connect at the same angle, but there is an average. In the picture below the blue guides show the average \"connecting\"-angle of Dr. King's handwriting:\nB. Recreating Movement \u2014 For each letter I recreate the movement path that was used to draw the letter on paper. This movement-path uses the characteristic angles (i.e. connecting, ascending and descending angle) to describe the movement and is stored as a vector in the design software: \nC. Adding contrast to the letter \u2014 The movement-path is then modified to render the ink flow of the used writing tool. In this case a pen that creates thick down strokes and a slightly thinner upstroke. This digital form is then stored in the Font file, which is a rather technical process. If you wish to read more about it, I have written an in-depth article \u2192here.\nThe example above already shows characteristics of Dr. King's handwriting. Analysing how a writer makes the bow of an \u201cl\u201d or the slope of a \u201cg\u201d also affects ones own handwriting and has surprising side-effects. During past projects I found myself suddenly writing my grocery lists with Einsteinian (or Freudian) loops and hoops. \nHandwriting has a vivid character because one never writes the same letter twice. When I type the word 'look' in a regular font, the two 'o' look the same. \nIn the preparation of creating a handwriting font I look at all kind of documents, and mark certain letters that I find are typical for the writers' hand. In the example below you see a selection of lowercase \"d\" \u2014 notice how they are similar but also different in the beginning, middle and ending of a word: \nCapturing one version of each letter in the beginning, middle and end of a word is not enough: I create multiple versions of each letter that are stored in the font-file. The font is then programmed to exchange the different versions as you type. This way each word will appear different, depending on its position on the page. The more letter-sets I draw into the font, the closer it gets to  handwriting. I call this method polyalphabetic substitution. \nThe most complex font I made so far is the Albert Einstein Font. It holds five versions of each letter (Set 1-5) and different weights. Here you see comparisons of the font with original samples of Einstein writing \"Allgemeine Relativit\u00e4tstheorie\" (German for \"General Theory of Relativity\"):\nI mentioned that \"everything I learn benefits the next project\". One aspect I was not able to fully address in Freud nor the Einstein font, but is already implemented in the current state of the Mart Luther King font prototype. In handwriting a lowercase letter can look different in the beginning, middle or end of a word, which means this font should reflect that with additional lowercase letterforms (a in the beginning of a word, a in the middle, a at the end, b in the beginning, b\u2026 vs. just a, b, c, \u2026 ).  \nThis may sound like a small detail, but accordingly the Martin Luther King font will have triple the amount of lowercase - letters to be drawn per variation\u2026 a lot more work! But I am convinced the result will be worth the effort. The plan for the font is to add 3 variations per Letter (lower-case, uppercase, initial and final case too!). This is the minimum to bring the appearance of the font on the margin to handwriting. The more funding the campaign gets, the more variations per letter I can add to the final font \u2014 making the final result better for all backers!\nFor me it is important to not scan the image of letters, nor simply to trace them with an automated software. By focusing on movement and creating in this analog-digital way, I become familiar with the hand of a writer by re-writing characteristic letters. Learning the movement that a writer made to create a letter is essential to creating its digital counterpart. \nBecome familiar, study, reproduce and learn the original movement is essential when it comes to creating signs that were uncommon at Dr. King's time. For example one will hardly find an @ sign nor the letter combination www in his notes. After digitising all available letters, I use the collected knowledge about a writers movement to create a profund improvisation; for example the @-sign can be seen as the movement of a lowercase \"a\" connected with the bow of a parenthesis. \nThis is an excerpt of my creation process, \u2192here you can find an in-depth article about my process written in 2014.\nKickstarter campaigns have Stretch-goals, so that backers get animated to support the campaign further than its funding goal. This project is very dear to me and it is important for me to make it happen as I lay it out in this description. However this project is calculated on shoestring budget, in which many days and weeks that I already put in this project are not accounted. From past campaigns I know that the benefit of a higher funding is not that easy to calculate. For example in the rewards I say that if one person pledges 8500\u20ac I will add one more alphabet to the font. This means that I would have 8500\u20ac to spend solely on working on the font,  with little to none production of a physical good, handling, packaging by hand or shipping involved. The same amount coming from 100 or 1000 backers would involve additional accounting, shipping, handling, etc., which can easily add up to a huge amount of time and certainly production money.\nWith that in mind I ask myself: what would be a \"good\"stretch-goal for this project? What makes the font better for all backers? Answer: the more variations are stored in the font the closer it comes to actual handwriting. For each additional 15.000\u20ac I can add an additional alphabet in a comfortable and safe way \u2014 and I am offering something that I can fulfil.\nFirst I keep my fingers crossed, that the campaign reaches its goal \u2014 and then for every additional 15.000\u20ac I will add one more alphabet to the font, making it better for all backers of this project. \n2014 in the context of the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's visit to East Berlin (1964), I came upon a radio recording of a speech he gave in Marienkirche. I took a note of the introduction because of what he says about his name: \nPLAY\n\n\"I come to you not altogether as a stranger, for the name that I happen to have, is a name familiar to you, so familiar to Germany and so familiar to the world. And I am happy that my parents decided to name me after the great reformer.\"\nWhat influence is it on a person to grow up with a name linked to history? Is it a burden or is it an inspiration to carry a name? For Martin Luther King jr, I imagine this connection must have been a source of inspiration.\nWith the handwriting fonts project I am proposing a similar situation: What does it mean to write your thoughts and ideas with the \"hand\" of Dr. King, Luther, Einstein or Freud? Is the author lurking over your shoulder as you write or are you dictating, is the font a disguise or mask to hide behind, is it a role to switch into and to see and act as if you were, is it a challenging discussion on paper or an uplifting empowering writing together? I hope that these projects enrich your daily reading and writing experience and serve as a source of inspiration and a playful encounter with history.\nBack in 2014 listening to the radio feature, I wrote Martin Luther King (1929-1968) on a board in my studio. A friend saw it and suggested then that I should create a Martin Luther (1483-1546) font first. I launched a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2017, the 500th aniversary of the reformation. In the Luther project description you can read that I had planned to create the Dr. King font in 2018 commemorating the 50th anniversary of Dr. King's assassination. But Luther's half a millennia old handwriting occupied me longer than expected. After the campaign succeeded scholars from different fields (Historians, Palaeographers, Latin scholars) contributed freely to the documentation, expanding the work beyond what I had planned. These contributions gave the project new angles to the subject, which I value very much. I am curious to see how this project about Dr. King's handwriting will develop and invite you to contribute and join this journey. \n21 days after the campaign ends all Backers of the campaign will receive access to the current state of the font AND digital rewards. The final font will be available to all backers in February 2020. Before that all backers will receive updated versions of the font as I am working on it. You will be able to give feedback to the font as I am developing it, which will make the final font better. Physical rewards like Posters will be send out by February 2020.

Simply rotate the rings to open and close its captivating aperture mechanism. Iris will inspire you with every stroke of your pencil. \nIris is our second Kickstarter. We at Makers Cabinet are experts in drawing and writing implements and the designers of the H\u00f8vel pencil plane. \n\n At Makers Cabinet, we believe that drawing and writing tools should guide the path towards creativity rather than limit its potential. Instead of being a burdening generic tool the Iris is intuitive and unique. \nWe aim to inspire everybody that uses the Iris with a sense of satisfaction. Its mesmerising mechanism sparks delight in everyone that sees it open and close. We believe that the Iris helps rejuvenate the flow of creativity at moments of mental block. \nThe scalable Iris drawing tool.\n The concept of the Iris came from conversations with our Kickstarter Community. Our supporters said that circle drawing tools lacked innovation and were difficult to use. These tools were unreliable and short-lived. So, we set out to completely redesign the circle drawing tool.\nAs amateur photographers, we noticed that camera apertures were reliable mechanisms and were surprised that they had not yet been developed for other purposes. In response to this observation, we designed an instrument that brings the quality of the camera aperture to your desk.\nThe mechanism of the camera aperture has endured 200 years of photographic history. Owing to this resilience, the Iris is the perfect replacement to the inadequate rotary drawing compass. \n\nRotary compasses are:\nDifficult to hold\nUseless without a ruler\nRestricted to certain mark-making tools\nImmortalised by the holes in our pages\nIris is:\nEasy to use\nCompatible with any mark-making tool\nAn accurate measuring instrument\nSeamless on your page\n\n At Makers Cabinet, we strive to create objects with a guarantee of longevity and durability. Iris is the product of this ethos. \nIris is engineered using the most durable and effective materials. Its rings are machined from solid brass that patinas, improving with time and use. The leaves are resistant to ink and graphite as they are stamped from carefully selected stainless spring steel that retains its shape. The Iris houses twenty intricately designed leaves that enable you to create accurate circles with every stroke of your pencil.\nThe Iris is a reliable measuring instrument. In conversations with our users, we were inspired to add a scale along the side of the circle aperture. This allows you to effortlessly draw circles and measure diameters. The scale is marked with a high fidelity laser etching that denotes accuracy down to a millimetre. \nReminiscent of a camera\u2019s aperture enclosure, its scale is marked with a red dot. This allows you to read the diameter of your circle without the impediment of any other tool. Below the Iris\u2019 leaves sits a natural rubber footprint that seamlessly grips to your page. This means that all your focus can be on the circles you are drawing and not the instrument that you are using.\nEvery Iris purchased in the Kickstarter comes with a wooden base. \nOur first wooden base prototype was intended to simply support the Iris on your desk. However, at Makers Cabinet, we design every tool with the intention to be both beautiful and functional.  \nAccordingly, our updated base locates the centre-point of a circle. To achieve this, simply lay the Iris flat on your surface and place the base against the inside of the aperture. This added feature enables you to take your drawings to the next level. \n\nIn 2017 we launched our first Kickstarter for the H\u00f8vel pencil plane. H\u00f8vel is a completely redesigned pencil sharpener which planes your pencil to a perfectly crafted point reminiscent of woodblock planes.\nSince we launched the Kickstarter, the H\u00f8vel has won a Stationery Award, has been stocked in 20 stores worldwide and galvanised our business. Get a H\u00f8vel at a reduced rate by backing the Iris here today.\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe design is complete, with our initial prototypes completed and Iris is almost ready to go into production.

In the summer of 2013, armed with an idea, prototypes and a few supplier quotes we made a heart-felt appeal to this community right here, to fund our idea and help us create a new toy company.  Your trust and generosity, with some steadfast determination and relentless work on our part made for a successful mix.  \nIt has now been six years, eight campaigns and we can finally legitimately say that we made an impact in the design toy space continuum.  There has been press, we are present in stores in 46 countries but we still come back home, right here on Kickstarter where we first started.   \nTruly, accurately, we couldn\u2019t have done it without you.   \nAnd we\u2019re going to keep going:  we made a pledge that you will be the first to know when we have fresh ideas and new product.  Are you ready for the next one? \nOur 2018 Candycars campaign and post-campaign sales were met with unmitigated success; we fulfilled our campaign pledge in a record 45 days, and every single backer that supported us was able to proudly beam about a brand new toy - the result of a novel way of making toy cars:  combining a diecast base with a cute, simple painted wooden body.  They roll like the wind, have a solid heft and won\u2019t be around for 10,000 years like their plastic cousins.  We consider that a plus.  \nFor this next round, we\u2019ll crank up the cuteness and playability:  we picked lovable food trucks and other vans full of personality, added a beefed-up wheel design of our own, and came up with a few squishy toppers, for a new tactile sensation.   \n*drum roll* \nIf you don't like tacos, this truck is nacho type.\nOur taco truck was inspired by the trailblazing spirit of the very first food trucks. Designed with true SoCal vibes in mind, it has fun and fiesty coats of paint, some spanking orange wheels, and a terrific taco up top.\nDo-nut be alarmed. \nYou're supposed to be this amazed -- it's impossible to glaze over this beauty. Already a crowd favorite, our donut van made its instagram debut back in March and has been garnering drools ever since with that striking hot pink topper.\u202f \nNow\u2019s the time to seal the deal and make sure you get one reserved! \nNothing says NYC like a hot dog stand.\nAs New Yorkers, we must pay tribute to the hot dog \u2013 it's the quintessential New York street food. Our hot dog truck is a minimalist, design-focused, vehicular interpretation of the hot dog stand with a mustard-yellow top and a perfectly toasted base.  Don't worry, we skipped the dirty water.\nChicago-dog fanatics, get outta \u2018ere. \nSoft-serving up good looks.\nAs far as a symbol of simpler times and a carefree way to stuff sugar and calories in your childhood, you can\u2019t beat the ice cream truck.  We popped a melty top, added a bright pink base, sprinkled a pun, and voila! Iconic toy made. No ice cream truck jingle \u2013 you\u2019re welcome. \nWe don\u2019t know how to put this, but our news van is kind of a big deal. \nBrought to you by the broadcast division of Candylab Media, it possesses an inquisitive personality.  It will magically appear wherever your other Candycars get mixed up in news worthy happenings. On the practical side of things, the dish is real stamped steel, and may have some actual tiny radio reception abilities.\n\nGeared up and overflowing with cool.\nOur S.W.A.T. van stops crime in its tracks. Rolling around and chasing bad guys all while looking like an absolute stunner, our S.W.A.T. (Sweet Wheels And Tires) van gives the phrase \"action-packed\" a whole new meaning.\nGot (a) coin? They\u2019ll take good care of it.\nDon't be fooled by its small stature, our armored van is tough and hardy \u2013 the perfect guardian for all sorts of goodies. \n\nAnd that\u2019s the crew!  We created 7 distinct designs and personalities, each with a stunning box, sure to impress children (and adults) way too accustomed to disposable blister packaging.  Scope this out before we move on to the reward levels! \nThe specs on this new line are the same as you've come to expect from us: Well-made, custom parts, all wrapped in our environmentally friendly formula: solid European beech, water based paint and a durable diecast metal base.  It is all engineered in-house by a new generation of toy designers and product developers who all share a drive to make a better toy. \nWe agonized over the donut/ice cream /taco /hot dog designs and tooling so the resulting parts are friendly to a child\u2019s touch, squishy and soft, but hard enough to be used as a handle and rougher play.   \nEst. Delivery Sept 2019\nWant Multiple Rewards? This go-around we will  be working through Backerkit post-campaign. That being said, if you are interested in more than one reward please add the cost of the two rewards as well as shipping costs and pledge for that total. Then post-campaign you will enter Backerkit with a credit in which you can apply it to various rewards.

We know, it's really expensive for you international folks. We strictly charge what postage actually costs and pay for warehousing, shipping cartons, labeling and on from the general overhead remaining. That is what carriers charge these days. \nAll international shipments are subject to duties, taxes and clearing fees which you are responsible for paying - your pledges are without sales-tax or VAT. All Kickstarter rewards will be considered gifts, however, most countries will assess duties/taxes and in certain countries the carrier will pre-pay the duties and taxes and bill you later. If you refuse delivery, your package will be abandoned. Once abandoned, we can\u2019t ship another package to you or issue a refund. Filling out your shipping address correctly is very important. A wrong address and package sent back will incur shipping charges back to USA on our account. A wrong address and package sent back will incur shipping charges back to USA on our account. If your parcel sits unclaimed and / or you have not answered our increasingly alarmed emails, there is a chance it will be sent back, or abandoned at destination.

Thanks to you we\u2019re funded and Brooklyn is getting a new arcade bar! We can\u2019t wait to have all of you at Wonderville!\nNow the fun stuff! If we clear our goal by an additional $15,000 ($85,000 total), we\u2019ll celebrate by building a two-player PICO-8 arcade machine. It will be hand-made and painted by a local artist!\nFor those not familiar with it, PICO-8 is a fantasy, retro console in the style of the Commodore 64. It\u2019s a lot of fun to make small games in, and a lot of our community has done just that! With this arcade we\u2019ll be able to rotate what\u2019s on display, showcasing different locally-made PICO-8 games in all of their 128x128 glory! \nIf we clear our goal by $30,00 ($100,000 total), we'll be redoing the backyard to make it look amazing. Secret Project Robot has a great outdoor space, and with a little love we can get it (and the cabana!) looking better than ever!\nWonderville will be a brand new arcade, event space and bar in Brooklyn specializing in independent video games, created by a growing and vibrant community of game developers in New York City and beyond. \nWe're not talking about retro arcade games from the 80s and 90s or just arcade versions of mobile games; these games are brand new, unique and ridiculously original experiences created by designers and artists today. Ever played games using only LED strips? Or door stops? Or juicers? At Wonderville you will! \nUp to this point, these games have only shown up at festivals and short-term pop-ups as physical installations meant to be played by a group of people in a public space, and then they disappear. But no more! Wonderville will house independent games as a permanent home for these modern treasures. The space will also host tournaments, playtest nights, board games, comedy, live music and rotating art installations and exhibits.\nWe have an amazing opportunity to inherit one of our favorite spaces, and transform it into a new celebration of independent games and interactive art, but we need your support to make it happen. Join us, and help make this venture a reality, and you can also receive amazing Kickstarter exclusive games, art and handmade arcade cabinets from independent game developers and artists!\nWe've got a lot of great game developers on board who are volunteering to make an exclusive game for this campaign! And we're combining it all to create:\nAt $20 ($15 for the limited EARLY BIRD), you'll get new games from some of the most innovative video game developers working today! A slew of devs are donating a brand new, exclusive game for the WONDERBUNDLE! This is an exclusive collection that you'll only find as part of this Kickstarter and nowhere else! \nYou'll get 10+ new games by:\n BumbleBear Games (Killer Queen)\n Ramiro Corbetta (Hokra/Sports Friends)\n snowhydra games (Zarvot)\n Robert Yang + Eddie Cameron (Radiator 2 & Queer Space)\n Catt Small  (Breakup Squad)\n Stephen Clark (Witch Ball)\n Fernando Ramallo (PANORAMICAL)\n Nick Fortugno (Diner Dash)\n Ayla Myers (Just One Boss)\n Ramsey Nasser (Dialog 3-D)\n Andy Wallace (PARTICLE MACE)\n Nick Santaniello (VOLLEYGON)\n Paolo Pedercini/Molleindustria (Every Day the Same Dream)\nMany of these games are being made especially for this event and none of them have been released anywhere else! These game makers have agreed to have these games be completely exclusive to this backer reward for one year after delivery (some time before September), so this is your chance to play them anytime soon!\n\nFor the past few years, we've been selling DBA Arcade Snackpack volumes filled with assorted games from the developers in our collective. For $40, you'll get the Wonderbundle, as well as both Snackpacks, with modern classics such as PARTICLE MACE, VOLLEYGON, Slam City Oracles, POWERBOAT Italia '88 and more! That's 20+ games and art from DBA Arcade to you!\n\nFor $45 you'll get an exclusive T-shirt ONLY available through the Kickstarter campaign. There are three designs by artists Marlowe Dobbe, Preston Spurlock, and Tim Fite. These will be available in all sizes and in both straight and fitted cuts! Pledge three times to score all three Kickstarter exclusive designs! Then come visit us at Wonderville in your shirt and prepare for lots and lots of high fives and nods of admiration.\n\nPin your indie arcade pride on your chest (or backpack, hat or your dog's collar) with a set of four premium custom designed limited edition enamel pins featuring Wonderville and other arcade designs. For $60 you'll get both games bundles, plus this set of exclusive Wonderville enamel pins designed by Chris Hernandez. Dreamboxx and Videofreak will use glitter enamel for their reflective and shiny bits, and Dreamboxxx will also be rainbow plated metal. These are limited edition, and will only be available through the Kickstarter campaign!\n\n\n\nAlt.Ctrl Workshop hosted by Death By Audio Arcade and Brooklyn Research\nOn the weekends at Wonderville, we plan to host classes and workshops taught by game design instructors, fabricators, and designers from the community in Brooklyn and beyond. Pledge to one of our workshop tiers and you can choose to learn about game design in Unity, physical computing with Arduino, modular synthesizer design and/or animations in Processing. A laptop is the only required material for the workshops, no need to have any existing knowledge to take part, we'll get you all set! \nIf you select one of these tiers, we'll coordinate to host the class on a date that works best for all students. If you cannot attend for some reason, we will give you a voucher for a future Wonderville class.\nFor our top tiers, we'll send you a custom-made bartop arcade cabinet or a full size arcade cabinet that includes all of the games in our collection: PARTICLE MACE, VOLLEYGON, KungFu Kickball, Slam City Oracles, Nothing Good Can Come of This, Powerboat Italia '88, F\u00fatbol Forever and Crystal Brawl. \nWe've built over 25 custom cabinets and we're confident these will be the best yet! The marquee and side art will be custom-painted by an artist from New York City - each one will be unique - and we can ship via freight anywhere in the lower 48 states. \nThrough our five years on the road, Death By Audio Arcade has been showcased at many venues and festivals. Here's a small sampling of the press we've received during that time:\n\nKotaku: Meet The Guy Making Arcade Cabinets For Indie Games\nWall Street Journal: Nostalgic for the Atari-Era Arcade? Millennial Gamers Are Reinventing It\nGothamist : Step Into the Dreamhouse, Where DIY Arcade Games Meet Queer Culture\nBedford+Bowery : An Indie Game Arcade Has Opened at Elsewhere\nThe Fader: Meet Mark Kleback, The Technologist Bringing Old-School Arcade Games Into The Future\nWonderville, the brainchild of Mark Kleback, was born out of his work as a creative technologist and founder of Death By Audio Arcade.\nDeath By Audio Arcade is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization in New York City, founded in 2013 in the back of the punk warehouse, Death By Audio, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. In addition to a music venue, Death By Audio was a loft space occupied by Mark and 12 other artists, musicians and DIY-enthusiasts. With access to a wood shop, Mark built his first arcade cabinet and started reaching out to local game developers to find games for his handmade arcade builds. Since independent musicians had dedicated spaces to showcase their art, why not indie game devs? \nWonderville builds on the foundation of Death By Audio Arcade, which collaborates with game developers and teaches them how to cut and paint wood, solder electronics and assemble physical installations for video games. Most game designers are used to making games to be played at home on a computer, but by showing games in public spaces, these designers also learn how to make great social arcade games. \nWe also host talks and panels and invite local artists to showcase games at public events. Since 2013, we've built over 20 custom arcade cabinets and we've been featured at the Smithsonian American Art Museum, MAGFest, World Maker Faire New York, South By Southwest, PlayNYC and Low-Level Festival. We've been a transformative organization for people looking to learn more about doing hands-on projects in an increasingly digital world.\nDeath By Audio Arcade at Elsewhere\nWhen Death By Audio closed in 2014, Death By Audio Arcade was left homeless and shifted focus to partnerships with other local New York venues for months at a time. Over the past five years, we've had residencies at Elsewhere, Superchief Gallery,  Babycastles, Caveat, Our Wicked Lady, Flattopps, Flux Factory, Silent Barn, Dreamhouse, H0L0, Brooklyn Research, Flowers For All Occasions, and Secret Project Robot.\nStephanie Gross is co-founder of Wonderville and has a decades long history of helping artists and organizations become non-profits and leverage their talents to achieve their dreams. As a NY city employee, Stephanie is a valuable resource for former residents of the DIY underground art world looking to navigate the bureaucracy of licenses, permits, and city departments. \nNew Year's Eve 2010\nSteph and Mark met at a show in 2010 at Death By Audio, one of her first clients. They're now engaged to be married later this year! \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc8d\u2728\n In late 2018, Rachel Nelson and Erik Zajaceskowski, the owners of Secret Project Robot, approached Mark and Stephanie about taking over their space. Secret Project Robot has been an artist-run venue in New York City for over fifteen years, hosting art installations, performance art, live music and community meetings. The opportunity was too good to be true. Not only would this space provide a home for the nomadic Death By Audio Arcade collection, but it would be a hub for the entire New York City indie game community. Not to mention it's 100% legal with a bar and liquor license!\n With your pledge, we'll have the funds to buy the business, with all of the necessary permits, licenses, inventory, and machinery. There are eight years remaining on the lease, and with your help, we'll be able to start with enough capital to run for the first 6-12 months. \nPaper Gardens Festival at Secret Project Robot\nAnd Wonderville isn't just for DBAA games, we have plans to collaborate with our friends in New York (and eventually the world)! While we spent time as nomads, we met a lot of like-minded developers: we've done collaborative events with Babycastles and The Sheep's Meow and continue to discuss setting up a rotating gallery space. We've shown work by Bumblebear and Videogamo and many many more. We plan to have a Killer Queen Machine, a Black Emperor machine, and a Line Wobbler. We'll work with the NYU Game Center and host playtest nights and panel discussions. On the weekends, we will host workshops based around game design, electronics, and fabrication. \nAllen Riley of Death By Audio Arcade showing video game art at Superchief Gallery\n\nWe want to make sure Wonderville is a home for everyone doing or interested in indie arcade work! \nWe'll also host live music! Secret Project Robot has an amazing stage and sound system that we plan to keep: DJs, musicians, bands, comedy shows, and other events are all on deck! We want to create a community space that bridges the gap between the games community and the wider New York arts and music community.\nWith your help, we can make all of this happen, buckle up and join us! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe rent is too damn high! It's really hard to keep a venue open in New York City. We've already been pushed out of one underground space due to rising rents, and this time we want to make sure we have enough of a savings to get it off the ground. We have a solid business plan vetted by Stephanie\u2019s non-profit background and informed by both Mark and Steph's years of living and working in music venues. We've also got many people volunteering their time to help with the success of Wonderville, but your contribution goes a long way!\n\nDeath by Audio Arcade will continue to operate as a 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization inside of Wonderville.

After the insanity of 2018, wherein we collaborated with over a dozen venues, art spaces, and like-minded indie game groups, we knew we needed to find a permanent space of our own.

To the best of your knowledge, information and belief this material will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.\nThere's none more black!\nBlack 3.0 is a super special acrylic paint. We have spent nearly 2 years tweaking its formulation to create a black that absorbs between 98 and 99% of visible light! Quite simply we've created the blackest black acrylic paint.\nBlack 3.0 brush applied to sculpture\nLast November we shared a beta batch of Black 3.0 with 1000 artists around the world for feedback and thoughts. We've now taken that information and reformulated it to be the best black we could possibly make. \nAll the photos and video content on this page are created with the final formulation of Black 3.0 from the UK factory that are producing it for us, we are excited to be playing with it and feel like it's perfect!\nWe need your help so that we can pay the paint factory to produce their minimum order quantity of our recipe so we can share our creation with everyone!\n The science behind the Black!\nWe wanted a super-flat, ultra-matte black that absorbed almost all visible light. To achieve that we went right back to the basics of paint making. The problem with existing black pigments is they are all slightly reflective (carbon is the most common and if you think of coal or charcoal you'll know it has a shine to it), so we created a whole new pigment in the lab and we call it 'Black Magick', it is born matte! This means that the mattifiers we used in Black 2.0, which added a tiny grey tint, are no longer needed making a way blacker looking paint! We've also managed to formulate a new acrylic polymer to hold the pigment, it's special because it has more available bonds than any other acrylic polymer being used in paints. This means it can cling onto way more pigment, leading to a really dense pigment load and a depth of colour not previously possible. We have sourced some brand new nano-mattifiers which we have added, these flatten out the last bits of stray light without compromising colour. \nUnedited comparison with other well known black paints\nWe have benchmarked Black 3.0 against 45 existing black paints, this photo demonstrates a small section of those, being the most commonly available black paints in the UK. We also sent beta versions of Black 3.0 to 1000 artists around the world, they filled in a questionnaire and 93% of them preferred it to our Black 2.0 (previously the worlds flattest mattest black). \nIt's super easy to use.\nOther super blacks are complicated to use and extremely expensive. Most require heat, science labs and specialist training to apply. We wanted to make a super affordable, easy to use paint that was familiar to artists so they could concentrate on expressing themselves. \nWe think that sharing your colours with others is nice! When Stuart heard that Kapoor was the only artist that could use the blackest black he felt sad but also a bit bad that he'd been making awesome colours and only using them in his own work. So he started sharing his colour creations on the internet with other artists. \nThe holy grail of paints is the ultimate zero-point black. We've been on a mission to create exactly that for a long while because we want all artists to be able to express themselves with awesome materials. The limits of your creations should be your imagination not how rich or successful you are. \nWe are a small team of artists and paint makers based in a studio in Dorset on the south coast of England. We are headed up by British artist Stuart Semple who has been making his own colours for nearly 20 years. \nWe've created and shared tens of thousands of the artiest art materials with artists all over the world including LIT (the world's glowiest glow pigment). PINK (the pinkest pink), Gold (the goldest gold), Black 2.0 (the mattest flattest black paint), Dazzle (the glitteriest plant based glitters) and many more creations. \nYou can see what we make and learn all about us on our website:\nculturehustle.com\nNo matter what reward you choose you will get at least one bottle of Black 3.0 but your support means so much to us we wanted to thank you properly. Stuart and his team have been busy over the last few weeks designing the rewardiest rewards to thank you properly! These will only ever be available to kickstarter backers!

Some of you have been with us for the past 5 years, 7 product launches and we cannot, would not, should not be here without you.  I know we say that a lot but we really do mean it.  We are immensely grateful \u2014 as designers, as product developers, as believers in a more fun and creative world \u2014 and we sure plan to keep going as long as you guys keep loving the things we make.\nFor the first time, we are launching a more mass-oriented, retail-ready product, but of course with Candylab DNA (it's better that way).  And you get to watch and see how this gets made!  This story is a little different than our usual, but still leads to the cool, innovative toys that you've come to expect from us. \nYou know we do, and you do too. That's why we think you'll be glad to hear the seed of this idea:  Diecast little cars are a staple of every kid's bedroom and toy chest, making frequent appearances on adult shelves, toy collection and as fun office decor too.  What bugs us is that like any successful, long-running product, they've become commoditized. \nToday you can buy tiny 2-inch long diecast toy cars for a buck at virtually any gas station.  Of course, it's not the price that bugs us the most, it's the simple fact that the joy that comes with matchbox cars is gone. Those little guys are so often tossed around and forgotten, the magic disappears.  This mass invasion is a far cry from the 1950's when they were carefully crafted, and came in a box resembling a box of matches. Don't even get us started on plastic \"diecast-style\" cars. \n...is to provide a bit of an antidote to that while still doing what we do best:  wooden toy cars.  So we set out to design a \"Wooden Diecast\" car.  It sounds really simple but we banged our heads about for 2 years to be able to do this \u2014  make a cute, cartoonishly-proportioned wooden body with fun, splashy colors on a custom-designed diecast base. Screw it all together carefully, give it an adorable name and sell it for single digit dollars in the spirit of matchbox cars.  Then we made more of them.  And now we're releasing it into the wild!\nBut here we are, and here they are! Countless hours, work, prototypes, scale studies, engineering, and color studies, we have the finished products in hand \u2014 beech wood body, alloy diecast base, custom engineered wood screw, metallic foil paint accents and the coolest packaging we could come up with. \nNow, for the good part.\nWe came up with the best combo packs we could imagine, and it's pretty straightforward. There are 6 designs total, and we packed them in some common sense combinations.  All are at affordable price points, because no one is against affordable, but great. \nAlso, for the first time ever, Candylab announces... immediate fulfillment! Unlike our previous campaigns, every detail about these little guys have been finalized and ready to go which means they will begin the fulfillment process as soon as the campaign ends. And that means they're guaranteed to arrive in time for the holidays.\nWe're so sure of ourselves this time, we even made a giant red banner:\n(For those of you who are waiting on your Beasts, fret not \u2014 they'll be there sooner than you think.)\n ** Please note, the Dream Come True reward is limited to our existing body styles and cabins.

They're all contributors to Stories for Ways & Means, a whimsical illustrated collection of short stories by some of our greatest living songwriters. \nThe literary value of songwriting, for those who still had any doubts, was validated when a recent Nobel Prize in Literature went neither to a poet or a novelist, but to Bob Dylan. This long overdue recognition of the literary contributions of songwriters coincided with the publication of a book celebrating original children's stories written by musicians. In a stroke of serendipity, the release of Stories for Ways & Means couldn\u2019t have been timelier.\nIt all started when Jeff Antebi (founder of Waxploitation Records) found himself wondering, \"What kind of children's story would Devendra Banhart write if he was asked to write one?\" \"What would a story look like if it was written by Nick Cave, and illustrated by Anthony Lister?\" Or \"What would a story by Frank Black sound like if it was narrated by Danny Devito?\" And so he set out to answer these questions. \nIn the near-decade that followed, Jeff turned these \"why-nots\" into Stories for Ways & Means, a book of grown-up children\u2019s stories by some of this era\u2019s most compelling storytellers from the worlds of music and contemporary art\u2014with proceeds benefitting NGOs and nonprofit organizations advancing children\u2019s literacy worldwide (including Room to Read, Pencils of Promise, 826 National, and War Child.)    \nSFWAM exhibition at the acclaimed Corey Helford Gallery in Los Angeles\nThe book includes collaborations with Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Frank Black, Devendra Banhart, Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, Laura Marling, Kathleen Hanna, Gary Numan, Jim James (of My Morning Jacket), Manuel \u201cGuajiro\u201d Mirabal (of Buena Vista Social Club), Will Oldham, Alison Mosshart (of The Kills), Anna Von Hausswolff, Satomi Matsuzaki (of Deerhoof), Elliphant, Alec Empire, Amadou Bagayoko (of Amadou & Mariam), Del the Funky Homosapien, Matthew Dear, Micachu, Song Yuzhe, Ernest Ranglin, Eugene Hutz (of Gogol Bordello), Gibby Haynes (of Butthole Surfers), Jason Lytle, Sera Cahoone and Spencer Krug (of Moonface) ...as well as painters/illustrators like James Jean, Anthony Lister, Dan Baldwin, Ronzo, Kai & Sunny, Alessia Iannetti, Asha Zero, Candice Tripp, Carlin Diaz, Cinta Vidal, Clare Rojas, Daniel Munoz \"SAN\", Dave Kinsey, David Bray, Heisuke Kitazawa or PCP, Herakut, Joe Coleman, Kirsty Whiten, Lidia de Pedro, Loa Hjalmtysdottir, Maria Rivans, Sage Vaughn, SEPE, Swoon, Will Barras and more. \nWhile creating the project, we made sure to record many of the writers narrating their own stories.  We also brought in special guests to narrate such as Andre Royo (Actor: \"The Wire\", \"Empire\"), Channy Leaneagh (of Poli\u00e7a), Danny Devito, D.R.A.M., Ken Nordine (Handpicked by Tom Waits - American voice-over artist, best known for his series of Word Jazz albums), King Krule, Kumail Nanjiani (Actor: \"Silicon Valley\", \"The Big Sick\"), Lauren Lapkus (Actress: \"Orange is the New Black\", \"Crashing\"), Lauren Mayberry (of CHVRCHES), Lizzo, Madeline Follin (of Cults), Nick Offerman (Actor: \"Parks and Rec\"), Orvan Sm\u00e1rason (of M\u00fam ), Phil LaMarr (Actor:  \"Mad TV\", \"Futurama\"), Sarah Jones (Tony Award-winning Broadway Actress), Vivian Bang (Actress: \"Memoirs of a Geisha\"), and Zach Galifianakis.\nHardcover Edition\nThe book was a smash success and received praise from Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, Bill\u00adboard, Juxtapoz, Noisey, Okayplayer, The Talk\u00adhouse, DIY, Paste, Pigeons and Planes, Conse\u00adquence of Sound, and more.

Nobody was more curious and open-minded about California than Huell Howser. During his time with KCET, he produced over a thousand episodes of his various shows.\nHuell loved California!\nHe loved the big vistas, the hidden gems, the off-beat people who always turned out to have a story you didn't expect. And that's why California loved him.\nHuell Howser takes in a performance of the song, \"La Noche Est\u00e1 Serena,\" at the Lummis House in Highland Park.\nMany of the programs haven't been seen in years.\nHuell's old tapes won't last forever, they're sitting in his archive waiting to be digitally converted for broadcast and streaming. A lot of the early episodes still need closed captions and many need to be re-captioned to new standards. Each streaming platform requires its own file formats. For example, the process of making Huell available on Amazon is different than the process for KCET's Roku channel.\nHuell visits William Gore Sr. and his wife, Lena Gore at the Cobbler Factory in Pasadena.\nYou can be a part of Huell\u2019s legacy by actively participating in the preservation of his show. \nThis is where you come in. You can engage directly with this program you love. Huell fans have been clamoring for more episodes to be broadcast on KCET. You\u2019ve been asking us to make more episodes available for streaming. We heard you and created a Kickstarter campaign to do exactly that.\nAn original Betacam cassette of an early Visiting episode.\nJoin forces with KCET to make these classic programs available for everyone to see.\nWe want to broadcast and stream more rare and vintage episodes of Visiting with Huell Howser. What better way to celebrate 25 years of adventures? With the funds raised here, our team will digitize and re-caption these old tapes for broadcast on KCET and for streaming on multiple platforms like Amazon, Roku and Apple TV.\nWe\u2019ve hand-picked the best early and rare episodes of Visiting from Huell's archives.\nThe next step is to pull the master tapes from the archives and get them into our new system at KCET. From there, our engineers and video coordinators can convert the episodes into the proper formats for each streaming platform so you can watch Huell where you watch your other favorite shows.\nCongratulations, Huell fans - you did it! Thanks to you, there will be more Huell Howser in the world.\n\"Huell loved to be around people. He taught me the art of storytelling, and that made me a better cameraman.\"\n      - Luis Fuerte\nHuell Howser in a field of California Poppies.\n\"If, like me, you arrived in LA in the middle of Huell's long career, there are so many episodes you never got a chance to see, but need to see. Also, frankly, young Huell is drop-dead gorgeous.\"\n      - John Rabe, 89.3-KPCC\nHuell Howser and Luis Fuerte on location.\n\"If you have a good story, it doesn\u2019t have to be overproduced. I want our stories to reveal the wonders of the human spirit and the richness of life in California, including its history, people, culture and natural wonders.\"\n      - Huell Howser\nHuell with Vahan, Ara and Khechig Manoogian in 1990.\n  Huell fans unite and check out our rewards!\nThe images below are illustrations, the rewards are created and shipped once the campaign reaches its goal.\nPledge $5 or more: We've Made a New Friend\nThank you for joining forces to make more Huell episodes available for all to see.\nPledge $15 or more: Excitin'\nStay cool with this \"I'm a Huell Fan!\" personal fan made from recycled plastic.\nPledge $25 or more: Amazing!\nShow everyone you're a part of Huell's legacy with this enamel pin with a bright nickel finish.

Keep supporting us, and more crazy cool things will keep happening.\nOur first stretch goal was to reach $150,000 allowing us to have new art made so the game can include all unique, non-repeating game board tiles and use spot UV on the flames on the burninated side to increase the effect of burnination (we didn't know what it meant either, it makes a part of the art shinier than the others. cool!). \nArt and assets so NOT final it hurts!\nOur second stretch goal was to reach $250,000. See that \"Stack Em To The Heavens\" gif back up the page?

Strong Bad will be continuing his Skills of an Artist series by drawing one of your suggestions in the comment section of the campaign in an upcoming video. \nOh man! Look! Here is that video we just mentioned a sentence or two ago! You can watch it now! Thanks to backer Chris O'Connor for the suggestion!\nWe're adding some game upgrades! We're upgrading the cards to be linen cards so they're easy to shuffle and feel luxurious right out of the box. In addition to that, we're adding some spot UV to the flames of the game box itself, giving your box the ultimate effect of burnination. \nFor our fifth stretch goal, we'll be bringing you an all new Six-Sadded, Die video but in the meantime, grab the file (innie or outie) to 3D print your own Six-Sadded, Die! Help us get to 12,000 backers so we can do it! \nArt not final!\nWe decided to give you a surprise gift when we hit 12,000 backers!

Do awesome stuff in real life, help Trogdor burninate this cottage and we'll do dumb stuff in return!\nIn our game, before you can use an action to burninate a cottage, you must burninate all the surrounding terrain tiles as well as the tile the cottage is on. In such fashion, help Trogdor burninate everything by fulfilling all the dumb demands on the terrain tiles and cottage itself! Once you\u2019ve done them all, you will be rewarded by a live stream of Matt playing Strong Bad\u2019s Cool Game For Attractive People and performing all the voices LIVE until he gets tired of it, or his throat gives out!\nSubmit your achievements to Maya at maya@homestarrunner.com. When you submit pictures and content to us, know that we may post your picture in an update to show your awesomeness! You can track what achievements have been reached on this board which will be just below the stretch goal section of our campaign.\nUPDATE: We gave you the video of 25 people yelling 'Trogdor!' (though we'd still like to see that) since today (Aug 11, '18) is the 10th anniversary of the release of SBCG4AP and since the campaign's almost over. SO, On Sunday Aug 12th at 6pm EST, Matt is gonna do a Kickstarter Live while playing the game and performing the voices like we already said a couple paragraphs ago! Tune in and chat and comment and watch as the wheels come off!!\nMatt and Mattsets NOT Final.\nArt and assets NOT final. But in the ballpark. The meeply ballpark.\nWe're going to make a whole set of meeples of the 12 main Homestar Runner characters. Use them in this board game, or drop em into whatever other tabletop experience you want!

With his help, the game became playable, perhaps even... enjoyable!\nCourtroom sketches of Pat and James.\nWhile James playtested and iterated all over the place, Chris Schweizer got busy working on art for the game and our pal Rick Van Velsor (who sculpted the Homestar and Cheat Commandos figurines) began sculpting designs for the vinyl miniatures (available in the Burninator level and above). \nRick Van Velsor takes our janky 3D Tinkercad prototype and molds it into pure majesty!\nNow, the game is ready to be produced and played by burnination enthusiasts everywhere.\nFor updates outside of Kickstarter, like our Facebook page and follow us on Twitter.

Again.  \nWe are compulsive designers, product developers and parents (well, some of us) that have not quite let go of the inner kid.  We design, engineer, and manufacture toy cars that are absolutely loved by children and would sit nicely on a shelf too. And quite a few people say it, because we have been doing this for some years now:  we make culturally cheeky toys for contemporary humans, and everyone gets to play!   \nWe were born right here on Kickstarter, and since they say practice makes perfect, we kept practicing and practicing. Toy biz is a tough biz, in fact, but having an early supporter base in you, our loyal backers, always reassured us and gave us confidence in our design chops. \n...we have a real treat for you. We have been working on a radical new type of body and whole new approach to our builds, a difficult trick in woodworking.  But we persisted and the result is pushing the boundaries of woodworking and craftsmanship. And we teamed up with our friend Joey Ruiter, a Design Superhero for an extra spicy look.  He rocks.  \nWe give you:\nWith a strong nod to the peak of mid 60's automotive design when slabs reigned supreme, we created 4 new designs.  \nA direct channelling of Joey Ruiter's own White Beast, an iconic mid century luxury sedan turned into a monster sleeper with a swapped engine and bagged suspension. Smooth, abstract and stunning. We didn't stop here: we 3D scanned our friend and made him into a superhero action figure, so he can tell the entire story.\n The mirror image of the White beast. We'd say the evil twin, but really which one is it? With black matte body paint and whitewall tires, the Sheep sports a lowriding body and silky smooth presence.\n\nThis one ain't a beast name, but she's fast and silky smooth. Two-tone paint fenders, white letter tires, and an attitude of barely restrained aggressivity.\n\nA decidedly more laid back vehicular spirit, this is a new, slick take on our now famous Woodies. It has a precise veneer job with real microwood, a magnetic surfboard included and it's the first Candylab car to have covered rear wheel fenders.\nThey all come in a custom designed, tight fitting box, same width and length for proper stacking with your other Candylab Collectibles. We will outdo ourselves:  Silver foiled, black matte board packaging. \nFor the true collectors, we now offer a solid American Walnut wood base as an optional upgrade.  Each beast has 2 pieces of Neodymium rare earth magnets, which will snap to the 2 magnets embedded in the wood base, securing the car to it.  \nA true Renaissance designer, Joey's work spans automotive, nautical, furniture, graphic and product design. He is the rare designer that takes the time to build and fabricate his ideas: futuristic dune buggies, boxy snowmobiles, bikes, furniture for world-class companies and much more.  His moving, road-worthy kinetic sculptures are admired worldwide in the car community and featured in tons of publications.  His no-nonsense take on form and function is an alternate and inspiring view in the design world. That's why we love his work so much. And he has great hair too!\n   In other words, he is a Design Superhero and we want to celebrate that - so we made him into an action figure!\nCombining Rewards: If you'd like to pledge more than one item, please identify shipping costs for each, and 1) add it all up then 2) Type in the corresponding amount in the pledge field.

Women make 20+% less than men for doing the exact same job and are significantly underrepresented in political office - women of color are even further underrepresented and under paid. My story follows Sabrina, a fourth grader who runs for student council to get equal sized cookies for all of her classmates. It also speaks to the importance of equality and diversity. Please support this campaign, in any way you are able, so I can spread Sabrina's story!\nBackground\nOver the years, I\u2019ve been incredibly lucky to work with women who have held political office and fight for equity, so I decided to write a children's book inspired by them. It\u2019s about a 4th grader named Sabrina who sees inequity, and runs for office to put an end to it. I\u2019ve always loved children's books and their ability to teach lessons and promote life skills in a simple but powerful way, and I want this book to not only teach about equality and why it's important to have more women in office, but to also show a diverse cast of characters.\nThis story ties together the ideas of gender equity (specifically gender wage equity) and the need for more women (and specifically women of color) to have a voice as representatives in political office, all while teaching the terms and concepts that are a big part of any election. Hopefully, it\u2019ll inspire little girls to someday get involved in politics - or even run for office themselves!\nA fun glossary of terms in the beginning allows children to learn new words and see how they\u2019re used throughout the book. (Each term is specially highlighted in the text).\nLet's look at some statistics that need to change!:\nWomen make up over 50% of the U.S. population, yet they are significantly underrepresented both in politics and boardrooms. Currently, women hold 106 (19.8%) of the 535 seats in U.S. Congress, 22 (22%) of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate and 84 (19.3%) of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives. Only 70 women hold statewide elective executive offices across the country out of 312, that\u2019s 22.4%. All these numbers are even lower for women of color, who make up only 7.1% of all members of Congress. \nDid you know that only 4.6% of all of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women? Women also on average take home less pay than men in the same jobs. In Seattle, where I\u2019m from, women make about 73% of what men earn in the same positions (nationally it\u2019s about 79%). For women of color, the numbers are even lower. \nThis needs to change! And there are a lot of different ways to contribute to this change, but the earlier we start to educate people on these issues, the greater the chance we have to make a big impact. I think children\u2019s books are a fun way to teach lessons, instill values, and bring up topics to discuss with little readers. \nSabrina's Story: \nSabrina is starting the fourth grade with her two best friends, Elliott and Lainey. After noticing that boys get bigger chocolate chip cookies than girls during snack time, Sabrina decides to run for a student council seat in order to fight for an equal share. She embarks on an election campaign and works with groups such as the Art Student Association and the Milk Drinkers Union to spread her message and gain support. \nSabrina gets endorsements, Elliott takes a voter poll, and Lainey hosts a fundraiser while her opponent Oliver attempts to sway voters with the promise of a class pet. Sabrina shows that girls and boys complete the same classwork, play the same games at recess and should have the same size snacks!\nFollow her on the campaign trail! \nIllustrator: \nCharlotte Tang, a woman-of-color illustrator will bring this diverse cast of characters to life! Charlotte worked hard on developing these characters and has done amazing, adorable initial illustrations. I cannot wait to see the rest!\nRewards:\nRewards for giving to this project range from a thank you and a unique postcard of a scene from the story, to the printed book itself! Super special limited rewards include 1ft diameter chocolate chip cookie pillows, and the chance to get a character drawn into the story just for you!  \nMore delicious rewards include ice cream and cookie parties provided by Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream and Hello Robin Cookies! \nsee special edition cookie pillows below!  \nCost Breakdown:\nMost of the funding raised will go towards paying the illustrator. The story is already written and has been edited, but it needs to be brought to life! I worked with an illustrator on the character explorations and some initial draft pages, but there is a lot more that needs to be done! There will be about 35 pages of illustrated scenes, plus a cover, glossary, binding and back. This will be over 100 hours of work and I want to compensate the artist fairly for her work bringing this awesome project to life. Also, how cool that something like this can help provide a job for a young woman illustrator!\nFunding will go towards kickstarter and payment processing fees. \nFunding will go to getting the books printed. \nAnything raised over the amount needed for development will be donated to She Should Run, an amazing nonprofit organization dedicated to getting 250,000 women across the country running for elected office by 2030! They provide the information, the tools, community and the support to help women run for elected office.

We are humbled beyond words at your support. Since we still have a week to go and many great rewards to offer we are setting two new goals and incentives:\nIf we reach $35,000, Mike Musburger will curate a vintage drum kit for the studio. Mike is a dear friend of ours and has drummed for the likes of the Posies, Fastbacks, Love Battery, the Supersuckers and countless others. He\u2019s also an ace drum tech and of course a drum collector! He\u2019s one of our go-to people when we need the best sounding drums.\nMike Musburger - drummer extraordinaire!\nIf we reach $40,000 we will purchase for the studio a Mellotron 4000D. The mellotron was a mythical creature invented in late sixties. It played samples of real instruments from a tape bank. You\u2019ve heard it as the flutes on and strings on many famous recordings like Strawberry Fields Forever or Stairway to Heaven. The Mellotron 4000D is a modern version of the instrument which includes all of the original mellotron instrument recordings and a keyboard that\u2019s custom built to play like the original instruments. It\u2019s been very well received in the recording and live world and would get tons of use at the studio.\nMellotron 4000D\n Johnny Sangster & Andrew Smith founded Crackle & Pop! Studio 10 years ago as a creative space to make affordable recordings. The room quickly became a magnet for artists & gear & music and the trajectory of the studio has exceeded our wildest dreams. \nJohnny Sangster @ Crackle & Pop!\nThis last year two major events happened that have catapulted us head first into a studio expansion. Conrad Uno, of famed Egg Studios decided to retire and in an inspired moment, gave to us his Otari MTR90 2\" multitrack and a Studer B67 1/2\" mixdown deck. He also made us the caretakers of his Spectra Sonics recording console originally built for Stax Records in Memphis. Right around that same time our landlord at Crackle & Pop! informed us that the space directly below us would vacate this year. The space is twice the size of our current room with luxurious ceiling height. \nWe are asking for your help  to sound proof and build out the downstairs space to house our new control room, recording booth and beautiful live room. We are incredibly honored by Conrad Uno's generosity and are super excited to take on this amazing opportunity.\nCrackle & Pop! began in 2006 when Johnny & Andy cajoled each other into starting an overdubbing room. We found a quirky 500sq ft space in a multi-use building above a coffee roaster in the heart of industrial Ballard, in Seattle WA. Since then the studio has contributed to projects by Mudhoney, Maggie Bjorklund, Mark Lanegan, Earth, Jesse Sykes, Ken Stringfellow & Jon Auer, Cobirds Unite & countless others. We are proud to have become the home of many local producers & engineers. We've created the \"Live @ Crackle & Pop!\" video series supporting artists we love and taken on countless creative projects.\n Throughout the years we've looked at ways to possibly expand our footprint & capabilities but real estate in Seattle - as everyone knows - is crazy. Until now, nothing has looked quite compelling enough to tear us away from our awesome location in Ballard. \n2017 saw the closing of Egg Studios; a beloved, low-key room that was run by Conrad Uno of PopLlama Records. Egg was the home of the Posies, Young Fresh Fellows, Presidents of the United States of America, Fastbacks, Mudhoney and many more. \nJohnny & Conrad met in 1983 when Conrad recorded and released a cassette of Johnny's band the Sharing Patrol. Johnny left Seattle the next year to pursue the Sharing Patrol from Copenhagen Denmark and Egg & PopLlama continued to grow. Conrad had become friends with Paul Scoles of Ironwood Studio, and one day at a Mariners game Paul decided that Uno should have the recording console that he was storing in boxes in his attic.\nThat was the Spectra Sonics recording console that Paul had purchased from Stax Studio. It had been built for Stax in 1969 and was installed in their B studio. Conrad brought the board back to life and it became the heart of Egg Studio, contributing to the sound of hundreds of classic northwest records. \nThe Spectra being refurbished in Johnny's home.\nIn 1997 Johnny moved back to Seattle and asked Conrad if he needed someone to help out at the studio while he was at the ballpark. The Posies were about to begin recording their \"breakup album\" & Conrad put Johnny behind the board. Conrad continued to encourage Johnny to be at the studio, in fact telling anyone who called to record with Johnny. Thus began a many year stint as the Egg \"house engineer\" and really the beginning of Johnny's producer career.\nWhen Conrad and his wife Emily decided to retire, Conrad couldn't bring himself to sell off the studio gear. Instead he decided to give it away to his friends and to the engineers who had worked at Egg; Kurt Bloch & Johnny Sangster. Conrad became very excited with the thought of his gear living on in Johnny's recording space. Crackle & Pop! has now become the proud owner of an Otari MTR90 2\" 16/24 track deck, a Studer B67 1/4\" mixdown deck and we have worked out a deal with Conrad to be the caretakers of the wonderful & historic Spectra Sonics Stax Console. \nOne of our two new tape decks.\nThe unit directly below our current location is a 1000 sq ft industrial space.  It has 12 ft ceilings in the half below us and 21 ft ceilings in the other half. For those that have been to the current Crackle & Pop! it will have a very similar feel with the addition of a full band / high ceilinged / tracking space. And there will be NO STAIRS to climb with your heavy gear!\nSuite 1B\nThe new studio will consist of:\nControl Room : Dimensions - 20'L x 16'W x 11'H, housing both the Harrison Console & Spectrasonics Console, the Otari & Studer decks, our Protools rig and extensive outboard gear.\nRecording Booth: Dimension - 15'L x 12'W x 11'H, housing an upright piano and our vintage amp collection. \nLive Room: Dimensions - 18'L x 23'W x 20'H, housing our Hammond A100, Wurlitzer Piano, Guitar collection & Your Band!\nEntrance / Kitchenette: 5.5'W x 15'L x 10'H, hang your coat, make your coffee here. \n\"Friends\" / \"Gap\"\nThe studio construction will be double sheet rock, double walls throughout to decouple us from the the outside world. There will be sight lines through from control room to tracking room. We intend to maintain the vibe that everyone loves so about our current space. Keeping the day rate affordable is at the top of our priorities and that is why this we are counting on you to make this Kickstarter a success. We will offer the room at a very affordable $300 a day.\nEngineer Rachel Field recording the Tripwires\nOur construction guru is Brian Burnside, local rock n roller and all around great guy. We have a great community of builders and friends who are all chipping in to make it happen. Still the buildout cost is estimated at 40k.\nWe\u2019ve been saving our hard earned dollars and are already part of the way there. We know that the community around what we do is very strong and that together, we will make this happen. We\u2019ve got a lot to offer in return so please take a look. We are so excited to make this dream a reality.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been in the recording business for 22 some years and have seen the changes in the industry. Our own studio has grown organically and with very little debt. We are quite realistic about what it takes to keep a tracking room open in a place like Seattle.\n\nWe are not afraid of working hard and we our confident in our track record and our community. This is a terrifyingly exciting prospect and we are confident that it can and will succeed.\n\nAs we mentioned above, real estate in Seattle is rather daunting in these times. We have a 10+ year relationship with our landlord here in our building and he fully supports us and our artistic endeavors.

We are inventors. We designed two very successful products (Int\u00f9iti Creative Cards and Fabula Storytelling Cards). And this time we decided to work on a solution for efficiently speaking in public.\nYou can place Cicero on walls, tables, floors or any other available surface, with the help of adhesive putty or tape. Each card is like a box to fill, so you can just arm yourself with post-its and a pen, and start working your speech!\nYou can place it on every available surface\n\nCOMPOSITION\nIn each deck you'll find:\n7 GROUNDWORK cards; \n5 MAIN POINTS DEVELOPMENT cards; \n14 STRUCTURE cards: \na booklet with instructions.\nThe composition of Cicero\n\nTHE GROUNDWORK CARDS\nThe GROUNDWORK cards are the white cards in your deck and they help you organise the basic elements of your speech.\nThey give you the right questions, for example:\nWho's the audience? \nWhat are their expectations? \nHow much time do you have? \nWhat's the goal of your speech? \nPlace the GROUNDWORK cards and build the context of your speech, sticking around them notes, images and whatever comes to your mind!\nThe 7 Groundwork Cards\n\n\nDEVELOPING THE MAIN POINTS\nThe Main Points are the cores of your speech. This is the most crucial phase: imagine it as a sort of brainstorming. Start asking yourself: \"What do I want to say? What are the most essential topics? So... which are the main points of my speech?\".\nEach Main Point is composed of:\na Key Sentence \u2013 This is the concept you want to communicate (e.g. \"My product is very useful\", \"The groom will be a loyal husband\", \"This company has a glorious history\");\nFacts to support the sentence \u2013 To say something is not enough: you should always provide proofs and facts to confirm your Key Sentence (e.g. if you are selling a product, you can describe the reason why it's useful; if you are saying the groom is loyal, you would tell some anecdotes about it);\na Transition to the next Main Point \u2013 It never sounds right to jump from one topic to another. Sometimes the right phrase is enough (e.g. \"I told you about our product, now I wanna tell you something about the creation process\", or \"Well, now you know about the groom, but what about the bride?\").\nAfter defining your Main Points, you need to decide which is the most effective way to connect them. It could be using a chronological order, or an analytical one (first describe the product, then the benefits, then the team behind it), or the Problem/Solution strategy. That's what you'll be able to define with the card Pattern. \nThe 5 Main Points Development Cards\n\nBUILDING YOUR SPEECH\nWith the Structure Cards (the black cards in the deck) you can consider all the elements of your speech and start writing your first draft.\nWe followed a very effective structure that can be adapted successfully to any kind of speech:\nLure \u2013 In the first part of your speech you should say something to grab the audience attention (The Hook) and to explain them why they should trust you in what you are saying (The Credibility Statement);\nIntroduce \u2013 Now it's the moment to start promising something to your audience, to underline a problem they didn't consider yet but that you are going to solve;\nMain Points \u2013 Here you can use the Main Points you developed with the red cards!\nConclusion \u2013 At the end of the speech, you'll make sure to recap all the important information and to create a call to action in the audience.\nYou will be able to control every detail: Figures of Speech, Actions, Gestures, the Tone of the Voice, and the Slides you are gonna project (if needed).\nThe 14 Structure Cards\n\nIT WORKS WITH ANY KIND OF SPEECH\nWe tested Cicero and the structure is perfectly flexible:\n\nMAKING OF\nThe development took almost a year. For the first 3 months we studied the theory of Public Speaking in order to synthesise a practical and easy-to-use structure. Then we worked on the actual product to create a delightful experience. At last, we tested Cicero with around 20 users and the results were extraordinary!\nThe very first prototype of Cicero\n\nREWARDS\n \nTHE TEAM\nThe minds behind Cicero\nAndrea Binasco and Matteo di Pascale are true creative souls. Andrea is an expert teacher and Matteo is a designer, author of Int\u00f9iti Creative Cards. Together they designed Fabula, a framework for Storytelling.\nMarco Venturini is a Public Speaking expert and a Communication Consultant. Author of several books on Communication Skills, he is columnist for important newspaper.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we did with our previous project Fabula, we set the goal at the minimum possible because we want to see it realised and we want people to use Cicero. \n\nWe are ready for all circumstances. We know very well how to produce card decks (see http://www.intuiti.it and https://fabuladeck.com/), and as every entrepreneurs we have our own history of production and shipping issues and we are now able to handle them better than ever.\n\nSo trust us: we are going to make you satisfied as much as you want!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "DIGITAL Pack", "descp": "Get the do-it-yourself version and print Cicero wherever you want!

These new designs aim to bring space exploration to the next generation of enthusiasts and be awesome while doing so.\nPoster #1: Voyager Screen Print\nWith this year\u2019s eclipse and Cassini\u2019s last transmission, there has been a lot of wonderful public interest in space. My love of space started at 12 years old when I first picked up a copy of Cosmos. We hope to capture the curiosity of our audience and cultivate a lifelong love of science and art\u2013like Carl Sagan did for me.\nWe have been lucky to have built a studio of all things space.\nSpace Exploration Related Designs by Chop Shop 2010-17\nWe\u2019ve taken the three most popular robotic space missions from our original Spacecraft Series\u2013Voyager (shown at top), Cassini, and The Mars Rovers\u2013and have illustrated them for the young and young at heart. These missions brought us so much incredible knowledge: the first image of Earth and our moon, the discovery of volcanoes on Io, Titan revealed as an Earth-like planet with lakes and rain of methane, and discovering a long complex history of water on Mars\u2014and that\u2019s only the beginning!\nThe Planetary Society\nThe Official Planetary Society Store\nWe are also proud to announce that as of a few days ago, this project has been officially adopted by The Planetary Society. This means that these three posters will join their growing catalog of products sold at chopshopstore.com/planetarysociety where a portion of the profits will go to help to fund their ongoing mission: To empower the world's citizens to advance the cause of space science and exploration.\nWe want to create a fun poster series that not only showcases these stellar bodies, but ALSO celebrates the amazing missions that opened up these worlds.\nPoster #2: Cassini Screen Print\n  Poster #3: Mars Rovers Screen Print\nAbove is poster #2 for Cassini followed by Mars Rovers featuring the full family of Mars rovers: Curiosity (front), Opportunity (back), Sojourner (right) and shown in landing mode Spirit (left) and the next member of the family Mars 2020 (top right).\nThis project is the first collaboration with my brother, James Romer, who is a extraordinary character illustrator (images below). His imagination had no bounds and he imbues such fun and fantastical life into the inanimate. Jim knows, as the Roman poet Horace once noted, \u201cIt\u2019s good to be silly at the right moment\u201d. See more of his drawings, sketches and musings on his Arrrggghhh Blog.\nWork by James Romer (Arrrggghhh Ink)\nTHE DETAILS\nWe are proposing a series of posters based on three kid favorites\u2014Mars the red Planet, Jupiter the giant, or Saturn, the coolest looking\u2014but, we also want to celebrate the amazing spacecraft programs that brought so many more fascinating bodies in our solar system to light.\nVoyager: Cool Discoveries\nWhile many lament the downgrading of Pluto from planet to dwarf-planet \u2014 many have never even heard of the many moons that are just as fascinating as any planet and some are bigger than Mercury! With bold design and colorful characters, we want to not only include these cool bodies, but highlight some of the even cooler attributes of these moons! Active volcanos on Io! Cracks from the underground oceans of Europa! The Great Dark Spot on Neptune and active Geysers on its moon Triton!\nWe also plan on including an informative key to all the fun facts and discoveries represented in each design!\nEach 18\" x 24\" poster will be screen-printed in three colors by the same shop that beautifully executed our original poster series (see below). But, the fun doesn\u2019t stop when the lights go out! The screen printed posters have a glow-in-the-dark layer that shows each robotic spacecraft as it flows through the Milky Way as humanity\u2019s first interstellar probe. Note: the 12\"x16\" archival digital prints will not include glow.\n  We will finish the campaign in time to deliver for the holidays! We hope to ultimately make them available on our website, but if you back this project, the three poster series are available at a special price that won\u2019t be available on chopshopstore.com.\nPrinting Information\nScreen printing is an age old method that involves a manually pressing a single ink color on to the paper through a highly detailed stencil affixed to a mesh. Each poster goes through this process four times (once for each color, including the glow) and hand-produced by an actual human being well-versed in the technique. For more about the process, please take a look at this explainer web site at MoMA. Click \u201center\u201d and then choose \u201cScreenprinting\u201d in the nav. Then hit, \u201cPress Arrow to Start\u201d to watch the process or you can try and actually grab the tools and simulate the process to better understand. I was lucky to design and program that MoMA site  around 2003 when we were better known as The Chopping Block. \nAn Archival Digital Gicl\u00e9e print is a high quality print that is made-to-order here in our studio. These prints are produced with archival inks on archival papers and have an expected display life of about 60-100 years.\nFor more information about the fantastic studio responsible for the actual screen printing, check out Vahalla Studio in Kansas City. They have a great portfolio which include many high profile designers and clients like Phish, Wilco, Sony Pictures, Cirque Du Soleil, and more.\nThe Other Rewards\nTHE ORIGINAL ROBOTIC SPACECRAFT POSTERS were crowd-funded in 2014 and included Voyager, Cassini, Curiosity, Sputnik, Mars Exploration, and the special edition LightSail for The Planetary Society. The next series was funded in 2015 and included New Horizons, Rosetta, and Galileo. Finally, last year we funded another series that featured crewed space missions including Apollo 11, The International Space Station, and Vostok 1. All of these designs are still available for purchase on chopshopstore.com/space except for Voyager and Sputnik which are currently sold out in the screen print version but are still available as Glic\u00e9e prints.\nNEW VOYAGER REPRINTS\nThe original blue version of our Voyager screen print has been sold out since 2016. As a part of this new campaign, we are finally offering a new edition with updated design and all new Jupiter-based colors.\nVOYAGER TEE\nOur Voyager tee comes in all sizes from Men\u2019s SML-3X, Women's SML-2X, and Kid's XS-XL.\nGRAND TOUR STICKER SET\nThis 12 sticker set measures 6\"x 6\" and includes Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and their amazing moons Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Enceladus, Titan, Triton, and the Voyager Spacecraft. \nFull Collection of Space Mission Stickers\n3\"x3\" vinyl stickers which are ideal for either indoor or outdoor use. Set includes all 12 missions featured in both our Historic Robotic Spacecraft Series and our Giant Leaps in Space Series.\nBobby\u2019s Biggest Bubble (A Kickstarter funded picture book!)\nJames Romer\u2019s first published storybook. A whimsical tale about a little boy who wins a million gumballs which begins an unbelievable day of fun and adventure and has an appropriately cosmic ending! No spoilers!\nThe Manual and a user\nMike Mongo\u2019s Astronaut Instruction Manual\nThe Astronaut Instruction Manual is an actual working astronaut instruction manual. It is created to let today\u2019s space-loving young students who want to live, work, and play in space know that they genuinely do have that opportunity. The book was also recently optioned by Legendary Entertainment and is in early pre-production for a television series adaptation.\nThanks \nAs always, a special thanks to The Planetary Society who supported my earlier projects and have since become an official partner of Chop Shop Store. More importantly, they help shape space policy and fight for the continued exploration of space. You might also be familiar with their CEO, Bill Nye.

See 'Add-ons' below.\nAbout this project\nFollowing on the heels of the first Hobo Coins project, I'm super-thrilled to offer the next series of four all-new designs based on iconic US Coins.\nWhat are Hobo Coins?\nThroughout time, people have modified coins by hand-carving or engraving their own designs into existing coins. But this form of folk art really took off during the Great Depression. Those that were out of work or down on their luck took to modifying coins by engraving their own designs into them. They would use pocket knives or even filed down nails to carve beautiful designs that were as varied as the artists themselves. This art form evolved over time to often portray skeletons or skulls, incorporating elements from the coins as part of the final works of art. They would almost always keep the lettering on the coins.\nThe Hobo Coins project brings back this largely forgotten piece of American history. These coins are being minted by the oldest continuously operated private mint in the U.S and are SOLID. They each weigh about the same as 5 US. quarters, and are a little larger than the size of a US Dollar coins (these coins are 39 mm). Die-struck with over 100 tons of pressure in solid metal alloys and featuring antique finishes.\nPlease note that Hobo Coins are not actual US currency or modified US currency coins, they are die-struck new coins at different sizes, weights, and (clearly), different art than actual US coins.\nHelp revive a piece of history you can carry!\nThe Designs\nEach coin was crafted and designed by me using some of the most iconic coins as their base:\n\u2018The Davey Jones Locker\u2019 - 1919 S Wheat Penny \nThe original wheat penny designed by Victor D. Brenner made its debut in 1909. My rendition reimagines the coin with a nautical theme underscoring the dangers that lurk below. Aged with an antique silver-finish the coins will have a \u2018smooth\u2019 edge like the original (not \u2018reeded\u2019). As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin.\nThe Davey Jones Locker - 1919 S Wheat Penny\n \u2018The John Henry\u2019 - 1871 20 Dollar Coin\nFolk hero John Henry immortalized in metal. Around 1870 or '71, John Henry raced a steam-powered hammer on the C&O train line and won! He did, tragically, die soon after from exhaustion, but his spirit of determination lives on this Hobo Coin! Aged with an antique silver-finish and as with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original 20 Dollar coin.\nThe John Henry - 1871 Twenty Dollar Coin\n\u2018The Good Doctor\u2019 - 1937 Buffalo Nickel \nMy take on the classic \u2018Plague Doctor\u2019 updated with an industrial age motif and featuring a fearsome rat (the source of the plague and its spread) guarding its prize. This is no mere Templeton! Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin. This coin will have a smooth edge like the Buffalo nickel (smooth edge).\nThe Good Doctor - 1937 Buffalo Nickel\n\u2018The Aviator\u2019 - 1942 Mercury Dime\nMy latest take on the classic Mercury dime, featuring one bad ass pilot on the front, and a Catch-22 inspired Mitchell B-29 on the back\u2014which is, incidentally, the source of my website\u2019s name Dead on Paper. Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 10 gauge coin. This coin will have a \u2018reeded\u2019 edge like the original Mercury dime.\n  The Aviator - 1942 Mercury Dime\nThe \u2018Hobo Coin / Davey Jones Locker\u2019 Limited Edition Print \nTo complement the coins, I\u2019ve designed this print which is inspired by the Davey Jones Locker coin. Each print is 18\u201d x 24\u201d, signed, and numbered.\nLimited Edition Hobo Coins Print - Signed and Numbered - click to view higher resolution at deadonpaper.com\n  Add-ons \nAll Add-ons are immediately available (including Solid Silver coins this time).

And who is J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs? And why is his name always in quotes? And for nonbelievers, why has this strangely compelling parody religion, this long-running postmodern joke, caught the attention of such pop culture icons as Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, Jon Stewart, David Letterman, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), David Byrne, Robert Crumb, Richard Linklater, Alex Cox, Ken Kesey, Frank Zappa, Jonathan Demme, and Devo\u2019s Mark Mothersbaugh? And is it true that Tori Amos is also one of \"Bob\"\u2019s chosen?  \n\"Bob\" and the Church have caught the attention of many\u2013 include David Byrne, Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens), Tori Amos, Stephen Colbert, Robert Crumb, Mark Mothersbaugh and DEVO, Matt Groening, Margaret Moser, Rachel Maddow, Nick Offerman, and more.\nARE WE CONTROLLED BY SECRET FORCES? ARE ALIEN MONSTERS BRINGING A STARTLING NEW WORLD? DO PEOPLE THINK YOU\u2019RE STRANGE? DO YOU? \nThe Church of the SubGenius: The Early Years\n\u201cWe tied together every occult, superstitious fringe belief you could think of\u2026it was so much fun!\u201d\n\u2013 Ivan Stang, co-founder\nBorn into the suburban world of the 1950s, future founders of the Church of the SubGenius Reverend Ivan Stang (Douglass St. Clair Smith) and Dr. Philo Drummond (Steve Wilcox) come of age during the 1960s and 70s \u2013 a time of unprecedented social and political tumult. They experience the rise of a deafening consumer culture, the tarnishing of the \"American Dream,\" the violence of the Vietnam War abroad, and the Kennedy assassinations and conspiracies that follow. \nAs youths they revel in the delights of stable families, monster movies, Science Fiction, super-8 moviemaking, dinosaur figures, comic books, and Rock 'n' Roll. As they grow older they witness the emergence of televangelism, the Jonestown Massacre, punk culture, and Reaganomics.\nDespite both growing up in Texas, it was not until the mid 70s that Stang and Drummond meet and quickly forge a friendship over a shared love of comic books, Captain Beefheart, and UFO paperbacks. One not so particular eve in 1977, while bemoaning their lack of conventional \u201csuccess\u201d for two such intelligent, well read chaps, Stang remarks, \u201cWell, we\u2019re not exactly geniuses.\u201d To which Drummond replies, \u201cyeah, we\u2019re sub-geniuses.\u201d \nAnd in that moment the Church of the SubGenius is born. It is not long after that J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs reveals himself as the Church's iconic prophet and foremost patron of ineffable Slack. In fact, Stang and Drummond will later come to the realization that \"Bob\" has been planting evidence of his presence for them for the past twenty years!!!\nTHE SUBGENIUS DIASPORA\n\u201cThere was that moment of realizing that this thing goes further than I ever imagined.\u201d\n\u2013 Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman)\nIn late 1979 Stang and Drummond, with the help of their wives, brainstorm what would become perhaps the single most significant marketing effort made at the inception of the Church of the SubGenius \u2013 the writing, design, printing, and distribution of Pamphlet #1. The doctrine of the Church quickly spreads, and the word of \u201cBob\u201d and the teachings of JHVH-1 teach \u201ctime control\u201d as a way to wrest \u201cSlack\u201d from the \u2018Pinks\u2019 and \u2018Normals.\u2019 The Church, it seems, has struck a nerve amidst the deadening consumer culture, the evisceration of basic social services, and the worship of wealth that occurred during the Reagan/Thatcher years.\nL: An early years Devival | R: The Three Wise Guys \u2013 Ivan Stang, Dr.X and Philo Drummond \u2013 pose with a Model X Humanoid (1979)\nAs \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s pamphlet continues to travel the world, the emergent punk publishing scene and new wave comic writers seize on the humor and cultural critique of the Church's doctrine. In San Francisco it is fished out of a trashcan by cartoonist and artist Paul Mavrides, igniting a SubGenius cell that gives the movement some of its most enduring art and performances through LIES (Paul Mavrides), Dr. Howland Owl (Hal Robins), Puzzling Evidence (Doug Wellman), Janor Hypercleats and Pope Sternodox. \n\"Bob\" captures the zetigeist of the day. Cartoonist Robert Crumb reprints Pamphlet #1 in the first issue of his comic Weirdo. A few years later Simon and Schuster publishes The Book of the SubGenius.  Acclaimed film director and SubGenius Alex Cox channels Church mythology in Repo Man as the glowing, alien-owned Chevy Malibu soars high above Los Angeles with Otto (Emilio Estevez) and Miller (Tracy Walke) inside, their faces shining with Slack as Bud (Harry Dean Stanton) watches from below. \nDr. Howl and Puzzling Evidence conduct legendary \u201cDevivals,\u201d radio shows (More than an Hour, Less than a Show), and introduce the word of \"Bob\" to Burning Man. The Stark Fist of Removal newsletter, The Hour of Slack podcast, an MTV special, and countless cassette tapes, posters, comics, videos, websites, and Facebook groups perpetuate the word of \"Bob.\" \nBy the turn of the century, publications as powerful as TIME Magazine begin to get the SubGenius joke when \u201cBob\u201d is voted \u2018Fraud of the Century\u201d by readers of its online poll. In the late 90\u2019s and early 2000\u2019s, the \u201cFree Party\u201d constituents of Brighton in Great Britain voted \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs as an M.P. to the House of Commons three times.\nToday, \u201cBob\u201d\u2019s hucksterism and the wisdom of JHVH-1 is apparent in all fifty states and a multitude of countries across the globe!\nPLAY\n\nAnother early SubGenius of Texas, David Boone (late husband of Slacking Towards Bethlehem director Sandy K. Boone), documents the rise of the SubGenius in his 1980 film, Invasion of the Aluminum People, which is lauded by Academy Award winning director Jonathan Demme. This is one of the first known recorded instances of the transmission of SLACK.\nGIVE TO THIS KICKSTARTER NOW AND ACHIEVE SALVATION \u2013 OR TRIPLE YOUR MONEY BACK!!!!!!\nOnly with your support can our intrepid group of award-winning filmmakers dare to make this film. By giving us your hard earned cash, we can make this dream a reality, and breach all Earthly human, political, and cultural barriers with the searing nonhuman truth of the Word of \"Bob,\" J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs, that LIVING GOD WHO WALKS THIS PLANET EARTH IN HUCKSTER'S SHOES. \nTo date, we\u2019ve travelled over 8,000 miles and interviewed 15 SubGenius in four cities, sharing the so-called \"reality\" that SubGenii are forced to share with humans. We\u2019ve only just begun to uncover many of the SubGenius\u2019 most guarded secrets. The SubGenii are finally willing to go public and tell the TRUTH. \nThis is YOUR chance to get in on the ground floor of a huge, globally important cult. You will then attract all the $$$, pleasure spacecraft, and SHEER POWER OVER OTHERS that go with high-ranking support of the Church and this documentary! \nBut most important, you can smite your enemies, achieve TIME CONTROL and attain SLACK.\nREMEMBERING SAINT MARGARET\nSince we began production on our film, a beloved avatar of the early SubGenius tribe, Margaret Moser, passed away on August 25 of this year. One of the nation\u2019s top music journalists and music scene nurturers, Reverend Reverend Doctor Doctor Archdoctor Saint Margaret Moser even had a photo of J.R. \u201cBob\u201d Dobbs on her Austin Chronicle business card. She said it helped her connect with her interview subjects, many of whom were already members of the Church themselves.\nPLAY\n\nIn her interview with us, she spoke about the pleasure, \u201cthe great release, to have all this nutty stuff in your head and find like minded people to express it with.\u201d But most notably she sang a song written by her own hand, \"Oh, Life's a Bowl of Cherries with \"Bob\" Dobbs.\" Saint Moser's life epitomized the way that membership in the Church accelerated the discovery of true friendships, experimentations, creative collisions, and rebellion through art, music, and comedy against dehumanization in any form.\nWHY THIS FILM? \nWhy not this film? Pull the wool over your own eyes and help us make a movie! The Church of the SubGenius is the underground movement that has galvanized the imaginative, the artistic, the nerdy, even the deranged \u2013 to examine the simmering dystopia in their culture, and do absolutely nothing about it... except, maybe, poke fun at it all. The Church of the SubGenius is taking over the universe. The sooner you learn about it, the better off you\u2019ll be. \nPLAY\n\nNow more than ever we feel that the story of the Church of the SubGenius needs to be told. There's a core of ideas within the SubGenius ethos \u2013 of fighting oppression with humor, community and creativity, of using absurdity as a nonviolent weapon, giving time, permission and priority to expression, creation, and zaniness with friends \u2013  that we think has great value we believe these ideas are necessary in today's world and that our film about the SubGenius is the perfect way to invoke them.\nAmongst all the spaceships, frop, pipes, eye-bludgeoning graphics, bulldada, yeti ancestors, (and yes, \u2018macho spoutings\u2019), we hope you will fund this film so you can join our merry band of pranksters on the culture-jam of the century! It\u2019s going to be a lot of fun!!!\nNo stranger to hiding in plain sight \u2013 \"Bob\" is everywhere, IF you know to look for him!\nSo please, give to our film, get our cool merch, show up at screenings, and talk to us in every way possible. We will have our third nostril open at all times.\nAnd remember, as one famous SubGenius said, \u201csince the main message is \u2018think for yourself,\u2019 the last thing you should be doing is believing all we\u2019re telling you. We make it up as we go along.\u201d\nIvan Stang hosts the 999 Club (1981)\nWHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?\nWith this funding, we can complete the remaining interviews, edit the film, animate key sequences, and all other post-production work necessary to bring this ridiculous story to the masses.\nA behind the scenes look at our film production.

Paul Mavrides is one of the originators and sustainers of the SubGenius aesthetic, and he is also a major artist whose work shows at Fine Art galleries and whose graphic design is sought after by companies like Apple. Writing about Paul for a recent show at the Steven Wolfe Fine Arts Gallery in San Francisco, art critic Mark Van Proyers said that SubGenius output is a key influence \"on much of the art production of the 1990s... and the mythomaniacal clip-art orgies that Mavrides concocted for several of the highly entertaining \u201cSubGenious\u201d books still seem to sustain a spot-on freshness\u2026.\"\nNEW REWARDS GENEROUSLY DONATED BY LOUIS BLACK, FROM HIS PERSONAL COLLECTION\nLouis Black is the co-founder of the Austin Chronicle and co-founder of the South By Southwest Music Festival and Conference (SXSW).\nANNOUNCING NEW REWARDS FROM COMIC BOOK ARTIST CULLY HAMNER.

Born on Kickstarter, this is our 6th campaign, and we are now back, faithful to our roots:  Our latest creations will ONLY be available here, on Kickstarter, for this Holiday Season, reserving a special thank you and exclusivity to our backers, who helped us grow to where we are today.  \nHere are our latest creations, and may they spark your imagination. Go play!\n    The Outlaws are 1920's-inspired, vintage wooden cars. We took cues from a mix of Art Deco modernism and the daredevil, rough and oily car culture of those years. In our era of clean, immediate digital entertainment, we want to bring some of these stories back, blending keen design, old-fashioned playtime and some storytelling.\nOur exclusive launch will feature five models total, and each has its own story and inspiration behind it. \n   This is inspired by the iconic American Truck - a newly mechanized workhorse during the late 20's and 30's.   This truck powered small businesses, construction and rebuilding projects, rumrunning, dustbowl migrations and post recession rebuild. It's ingrained in the pioneering spirit and hardships of that era, and we say it deserves a place in pop culture. The toy itself has a yellow and black herringbone pattern on the front radiator, a long bed to haul other toys, and a magnet \"hitch\" making sure the towed cars stay in place. \n  Our slickest, lowest riding racer. Stanced, bright blue, and decorated with a Carnival-inspired pattern, it flaunts a superstition-defying race no. 13. This is our flashiest car, with stories to tell. \n    A yellow-and red pill of a lowriding roadster, bearing the 250(mg) race number. Our first ever open-top car, sure to stand out in a toy collection.\n   A black matte coat of paint, a single red light arm placed sideways, and a scribbling of the precinct numbers on its roof: this is the epitome of the churning and drama of bringing law and order to those hard years. The toy carries the visual cues of an adventurous, free wheeling era: it stands for order, fierce car chases and keeping the lid on the bad guys. The car has a cute graphic on its belly, with tally marks that one assumes stand for the vanquished baddies.\n  This an homage to the fierce female race car drivers of the era. Maude Odell, Elinor Blevins, Kay Petre and many more others.  Their racers were sturdy, lifted, and off-roadish and we aimed to capture that look and stance with this toy. It has a spare tire, a positive (inward) suspension camber and a giant race number on its radiator.\nSo thats's what we've been sweating over all year folks!\n[Update]: The good Folks at CBS This Morning just gave us some sweet national TV thumbs up. They totally nailed what we are all about. Here they are visiting us at home and telling the world about it.  Million thanks to everyone there!\nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/videos/toymakers-retro-cars-attract-both-adults-and-kids/#\n    At our Brooklyn Navy Yard workspace\n  Important details:\nShipping these rewards will be via either UPS or Priority US mail as appropriate, for all US-based backers. A couple of important points, especially if you are an international backer:\n- If your parcel sits unclaimed and / or you have not answered our increasingly alarmed emails, there is a chance it will be sent back, or abandoned at destination. We would not be able to resend your reward nor refund you in such a situation.\n- We can offer no refunds. If your set arrives damaged or somehow defective, we will replace it.\n- International backers will likely be charged customs fees or sales tax - even both at the same time! It's infrequently enforced, depending on each destination country and we really can't help this nor control it, but remember that essentially you are acquiring these items with no VAT or sales tax.\n But where are we with this process?\nWe started production a little while back to ensure our December delivery, but we need your help to make sure we can hit the MOQ counts our suppliers have to meet.\nThis is where you come in: with your backing, we can make sure that we have a home for these beauties, and for our end of the deal, we will ensure exclusivity: this Holiday Season, no one else will have access to these outside this campaign!\nSo for a truly special gift this Holiday season, hop on our bandwagon.\nThank you from all of us!", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Outlaw sticker pack", "descp": "The rebelest stickers one can get these days.

The first drawing will be comprised of all those  who pledged from the beginning of the campaign through August 31 and the second will consist of all pledgers from September 1 through the end of the campaign. See the band's Facebook pages for a video from Exene talking about this.\n**********************************************************************\nX! Live in Latin America! 40th Anniversary Celebration Continues!  \nWe want to release the first ever, all original X line up (Billy Zoom, DJ Bonebrake, John Doe, Exene Cervenka) LIVE X ALBUM! While there are other live recordings, this is the first and only one we are producing and releasing on our own.\nHere\u2019s the story\u2026 In November of 2011, X was fortunate to be touring Latin America as the opening band for Pearl Jam\u2019s South America Tour. What a life-changing and mind-altering experience it was! Our first show was in Sao Paulo, Brazil. We had no idea what the crowds would think of us, and we were really surprised when we started playing that first show.\nPJ\u2019s devoted fans were so welcoming and enthusiastic! We were playing stadiums, and sometimes it felt like a club. The early punk days in Los Angeles (and really, all the scenes in the U.S.) were about intensity as much as music. No barriers between band and people in the crowd. It was wild!  \nAnd on Thanksgiving, in Mexico City, playing and singing Los Angeles, while earthquakes rattled the Foro Sol Stadium stage, it felt that same way. We had that \u201cthis is crazy, this is only going to happen once so remember it and enjoy it\u201d feeling.\nX - Los Angeles 1981\n  X live in Brazil 2011\nWhile we toured in South America, Costa Rica, and Mexico, another fortunate thing happened. Pearl Jam\u2019s sound engineer recorded all our shows, and gave us these incredible, professional recordings to use.\nBut we didn\u2019t know what to do with the recordings! We didn\u2019t want to give them to a record label, or license the songs, we didn\u2019t even know if we could. We were apprehensive the songs would just disappear into somebody\u2019s pocket and never be heard from again. (We\u2019ve had a few bad experiences\u2026)   \nOne day a friend suggested we release the tracks via Kickstarter. We just needed someone great and amazing to mix the songs\u2026.  \nWe asked Rob Schnapf (Beck, Fidlar, Booker T., Elliot Smith) if he would produce, engineer and mix these for us. When he said yes, we decided to give this a go. Best case scenario!  \nWe came up with a long list of prizes and rewards for your patronage, should you be so kind as to donate to our project. There is something for everyone! X has always been a do-it-ourselves kind of band, as you will see by our rewards. We still love the hand-made, the paste-up, and the songbooks. Plus, you will get the first ever, all original member, X! LIVE RECORDING!   This is the ONLY place you can get it, as the album will be exclusive to this campaign and won't be available outside of that.\nX at the Roxy in LA by Rick Nyburg 2017\nThank you for staying with us the last 40 years! And thank you for funding our project. If we surpass our goal (which includes mixing & engineering, making & manufacturing rewards, and shipping & handling) we will use the money to keep our 2 vans running and keep ourselves touring. Maybe even get some matching outfits tailor-made\u2026. Gotta come up with something special for the 41st year.   \nTHANKS!!!  \nX\n*****TRACKS ON THE ALBUM LIKELY WILL INCLUDE*****\nYour Phone's Off The Hook  \nWhite Girl  \nHungry Wolf\nSugarlight  \nIt's Who You Know  \nDevil Doll  \nJohny Hit & Run Pauline  \nLos Angeles\nBlue Spark\nWe're Desperate  \nNausea  \nOnce Over Twice  \nThe World's A Mess  \nBecause I Do\nSoul Kitchen\nThe album will also likely include additional tracks but we won't know for sure until the mixing is completed.\n*****HIGHLIGHTED REWARD PACKAGES*****\nYou can see along the right hand side all the great reward packages we have available in detail. We wanted to highlight a few of them here as well, in order to draw your attention to the truly unique nature of this campaign. Many of these packages touch on other aspects of the band's creative lives and offer a different insight into who X really is.\n- Exene Art Postcards. This is a great way to get your hands on Exene's visual art. You'll get a set of  photographs of her work embodied on high quality postcards, with information about the work on the reverse side.\n- John's Book Club. You get a copy of a book picked out for you by John, with a message as to why he finds the book significant, what it means to him, etc. \n- Disposable Camera Tour Photos.  Ever wanted to see what life is really like on tour with X, behind the scenes? Now you can. You'll get the undeveloped disposable camera full of X tour photos. Each one of these packages will be totally unique, with pictures never to be used or seen in any other context.\n- Handwritten Lyric Sheets. Both John and Exene are offering this package, whereby they'll hand write the lyrics to an X song of your choice. Of course, this will also double as an artistic piece for the pledger, as the particular expression and style will be something only that band member could do.\n- Guided Tour of Grammy Museum. On October 13, the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles will open an exhibition dedicated to X.  Pledgers for this package will get treated to a personalized tour of the exhibition by Exene and DJ. You can ask any of those burning questions to which you've been dying to know the answer, as well as get an insight into the band and its history available nowhere else.\n- X and/or John and Exene Live. Ever had a notion that you wanted to see X or John and Exene in their acoustic duo performing for you and your friends? That's now a possibility.  Both of these packages require a lot of planning and discussion, so if you're interested you'll want to reach out via Kickstarter message and get the discussion rolling, but this is now possible!\nThese are just a few of the great packages we have available for pledgers.  We encourage you to look through them in detail, ask whatever questions you may have and we'll be happy to answer them. You can send questions via Kickstarter Message if you already have a Kickstarter account or XKickstarter@gmail.com.\nOne final note...often times in campaigns, people wish to pledge for more than one package.  Kickstarter limits you to one package per account, but if you have your eye on more than one, please contact us and we'll be happy to specify price and what you'll need to do in making your pledge.

Techniques like matte paintings and rear projections would make \u201eSlice of Life\u201c even more atmospheric and visually appealing, so it was always our wish to include them in our movie. If we reach this goal, that wish would become a reality! Plus, we would build even more more miniatures and that means a bigger, more vibrant cityscape!\n Our first stretch goal would enrich the visual appeal of the movie, and this one would add more drama and tension to its story. It is a scene that demands a brand new set, made from scratch, but it would be well worth it because that scene would give more gravitas to our main character and the struggle he has with himself, his nemesis and this damn city he's stuck in!\n\nEven though \u201eSlice of Life\u201c premiere will be held in Zagreb, Croatia, we always wanted to have another, international one. And what better place to do it than the center of film industry: Los Angeles. Not to mention that our movie is set in the streets and on the platforms of that same, albeit futuristic LA, so it would be kind of poetic! \u201eSlice of Life\u201c on the big screen, in-depth and detailed film-makers show and tell and a chance to hang out with you guys (and a couple of cold ones)... yap, that would be a dream come through!\n       When we started working on \u201cSlice of Life\u201d, we wanted to make an original movie set in a rather familiar world, and the biggest influence for us was clearly \u201cBlade Runner\u201d, as Ridley Scott, Jordan Cronenweth, and other movie legends envisioned it back in 1982.\nWet, foggy, and gritty streets of futuristic Los Angeles were a perfect place for our story, but we didn\u2019t want to just copy/paste it and shoot a replica\u2026 We wanted to pay our tribute to \u201cBlade Runner\u201d in terms of aesthetics, and at the same time make \u201cSlice of Life\u201d something more than a mere fan-film or a sequel, with an unique storyline that doesn\u2019t rely on anything seen in the \u201cBlade Runner\u201d universe.\nThat being said, \u201cSlice of Life\u201d is a tasteful homage to the masterpiece that inspired us on so many levels and we are honored if anyone can put our little movie in the same sentence as one of the greatest cinematic accomplishments of our time, but that is where the connections between these two movies end and our paths diverge. \nThe duration of the short film will be approximately 20 minutes.\n    Follow Slice Of Life on: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram\n  It is just another damp, rainy, and foggy night on the streets of the futuristic Los Angeles. Beneath the flashy neon signs and heavy traffic, scum of this megalopolis tries to make a living and hopefully survive to see another day.\nCriminals, junkies, prostitutes, punks\u2026 and one lonesome drug dealer in the middle of it all, fed up with this ever expanding city and lowlife parasites that inhabit it. He may be well on his way to leave it all behind, but fate has made other plans and his whole world will come crumbling down when a dirty cop with an agenda of his own enters his life.\n  A big part of that 70s and 80s Sci-Fi allure comes from the use of practical special effects. Visionaries of that era relied on miniatures and models, animatronics, matte paintings, and other techniques for creation of those lavish imaginary worlds. Even today, 30 or 40 years later, the charm and depth of their work remains unparalleled. We are not against CGI and other modern era tools (we use it heavily in our commercial work), but in order to pay a worthy homage to our predecessors, we wanted to make \u201cSlice of Life\u201d as authentic as we could.\nSo, everything you see in our trailer and will see in the completed movie is made the \u201cold-school\u201d way.\nWe learned to build miniatures, light them properly, learned how to create practical effects, so that we could film everything in camera like people did back in the 80s. We filmed on real sets that we built from scratch for \u201cSlice of Life\u201d. All of the miniatures and real-sized sets were created from cheap materials, junk, computer parts, and lots of imagination.\nBuilding the \"car set\":\nOld Citro\u00ebn BX 1986 bought for the production\n    Finished car interior\n Building the miniature car for exterior scenes:\nMiniature car model\n    We have spent the last three years in a garage, taking every spare moment of our time and all of our skill, dedicating it to bringing \u201cSlice of Life\u201d to\u2026 well, life.\nOur core team consists of only three people, and with some help of our friends and family, we carried this project on our backs for as long as we could, but we realized that, in order to finish our movie in the way we envisioned it, we need the help from our fans and the wider community. As a platform best suited for our needs, we chose Kickstarter to present this movie, connect us with our audience, and give you a chance to be an essential part in the creation of \u201cSlice of Life\u201d.\nFilming the miniature city\n  Filming the car interior\n    We need you guys to help us finish the movie. A big part of the movie is shot, but we have an extensive miniature shoot ahead of us and a complicated post-production process.\nFor the miniature shoot we need better equipment like new lenses and additional lighting, and a professional motion control system (because everything will be shot in passes*).\n*Shooting in passes - a complicated and slow process of shooting the same shot multiple times in different lighting conditions, the same way it was done in the 80's.\nThere\u2019s also lots of additional miniature building which is very time consuming so we need to put our daily commercial work on hold.\nUnpainted building made from junk / Finished miniature building\nThe cherry on top will be the soundtrack. Vangelis is infiltrated in our minds and souls, so we have a pretty big mountain to climb. Help us, and together we\u2019ll put our \u201cSlice of Life\u201d flag on top of it!\n  First and foremost, you get our deepest gratitude, not just for helping us financially, but for believing in us and our project. We want to thank you for your support and trust, and give you something to remember \"Slice of Life\" as one of your fondest memories in the years to come.\nThat being said, we prepared lots of cool \u201cSlice of Life\u201d props, T-shirts, special \u201cSlice of Life\u201d collectors\u2019 boxes and a beautiful movie soundtrack, exclusively pressed on vinyl. Of course, there will be one more thing - this finished short film called \u201cSlice of Life\u201d, which you will be able to enjoy for a very long time in the years to come.\n    Limited edition police badge, cast from the production molds\n    This cute spaceship is looking for a new home!\n  With less than 2 weeks to go, we\u2019ve decided to stir things up a bit and offer you something really special: two new awesome and unique rewards!\nIt\u2019s the one that our character drives throughout the whole movie and basically is a character of its own. This is not just a screen used model or fun looking prop that would look nice on your shelf, it is a true piece of craftsmanship, and a piece of our film\u2019s history.\nWe\u2019ll create a unique 15-second retro sci-fi commercial for your business, that will be featured in \u201cSlice of Life\u201d as one of the commercials projected on those huge building screens for 5 seconds. And now the best part, you\u2019ll get full copyright for the 15-second commercial to use it in real life promotion for your company! Show the ad to the world on your web site, social media, YouTube, TV etc.!\n You like our reward tiers and want to contribute, but feel like you\u2019re missing out on something?

We\u2019ll send you a survey after the end of the Kickstarter campaign regarding the add-ons you chose.\nAfter we have launched our trailer, we had great luck to be picked up by many esteemed international publications like \u201cThe Verge\u201d, \u201cio9 Gizmodo\u201d, \u201cHuffington Post\u201d and movie fan sites like \u201cJo Blo\u201d.\nWe appreciate all the help that we have managed to get so far.

We want to make \u201cSlice of Life\u201d an unforgettable experience for fans of the genre and also for those who don\u2019t really know that much about it, and to pay a truly worthy tribute to the classics that kept inspiring us for so many years.\n\nWe hope that we are not alone in this and that you share our love and admiration of those classics (and movies in general), and we welcome you to join us on our adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "** Exclusive Featurette **", "descp": "Wanna learn about the magic of miniatures?

We love playing cards, but we couldn\u2019t really find anything that was quite suited for our minimalist way of traveling. When you travel as much as we do, you don\u2019t want to carry anything extra around. Every item makes a difference. We\u2019re big fans of improvement, and decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers. The making of the Air Deck has taken us through several countries, and we\u2019ve met many wonderful people along the way. Now we have the prototype ready and we\u2019re proud of the result. Meet our new travel companion, the Air Deck. The world's first truly travel optimized playing cards!\nThe Air Deck team\nKey Features:\n52 Playing Cards + 2 jokers\nWaterproof and washable\nPremium printing with a protective matte varnish\nMade from extra durable premium PVC\nSlightly textured back, smooth front \nSturdy deluxe matte tuck box \nPlaying card size : 3.43 x 1.26 inches (87 x 32mm)\nPerks:\nFree world-wide shipping\nFree PDF \u201cCard games from around the world\u201d\nOption to buy the Air Deck in white color\nHere's a mock-up of how the Air Deck will look in red color.\n  With the Air Deck with you can play everywhere anytime. It fits easily on small surfaces, such as a plane tray table.\n  Regular paper playing cards tear, stain, bend and break easily, but we've designed the Air Deck to be extremely durable.\nQuality\nWhile we wanted a compact and light deck, we didn't want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world\u2019s manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high end plastic materials. The materials were taken through  scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally we ended up with a premium \u2018casino quality\u2019 PVC that has all the properties we want.\nThe cards have a premium feel to them.\n  The Air Deck is designed to be brought anywhere. It takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket.\nThe Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and it\u2019s totally waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of.\nThe cards are 100% waterproof, so you can even use them in the pool or the bathtub.\n  The cards are washable. Liquids and dust rinse off easily.\n  The Air Deck is a surefire convesation starter.\nHandling\nIn the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals, to help us find the optimal material and design. The end result a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on the back, while the front is plain. This provides excellent handling and a good grip.\nThe Air Deck shuffles easily\n  Our goal was to make the Air Deck both visually interesting and simple to read.\nDesign\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to create a fitting minimalist design for the Air Deck. For us, it was key that the cards are uncluttered, symmetrical and easy to read. We also wanted to create something fun and \u2018out-of-the- ordinary\u2019. The Air Deck\u2019s unique design will no doubt act as a conversation starter on your travels. The deck consists of 52 playing cards + 2 jokers and measures 87mm X 32mm. Despite the smaller footprint we\u2019ve retained all the features of standard decks. The length ensures that it handles much like a full size deck, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands.\nJack, queen, king and ace of hearts.\n  The Air Deck comes with a solid tuck box. It's laminated for extra protection and features spot UV printing.\n For this campaign we\u2019re offering the cards in two different colors; black and white.\nThe Air Deck in black color\n  The Air Deck in white color.\n  The Air Deck in red color\nWe hope that you are as excited about the Air Deck as we are. Support our project, and give yourself, or someone you care about, the perfect playing cards for traveling.\nAdd a nice view to your game.\n  The Air Deck is incredibly strong and flexible.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe do not anticipate any major challenges to this project, and we promise to stay transparent and update you every step of the way. \n\nMuch of the work is already done. The design phase of the cards is finalized and we\u2019ve made the prototype you see in the video. We\u2019ve had personal meetings with the manufacturer and agreed on all details, and we've gotten several quotes for fulfillment and shipping from reliable partners.

The common card deck is right-handed. So it goes. Over the years, there have been left-handed decks, but not a single one has celebrated the many famous lefties of the world. A missed opportunity in our book. With the Sinister Deck, we set out to bring lefties and righties alike a deck that's unique, a little bit educational, and plenty of good fun.\nWhat makes our deck special?\nContains 54 custom, hand-illustrated cards by Michael White\n18 \"face cards\" featuring famous Left-Handed people (16 Ace-Jack + 2 Jokers)\nEach suit is a different theme: Hearts are Musicians, Spades are Historical Figures, Clubs are Politicians, and Diamonds are Film/TV Personalities\nOur deck is \"Left-handed\": Card Indicators are on the opposite sides so you can fan the cards \"left-handed\"\nSpecial Details: We added a few subtle touches to the designs that die-hard fans will notice.  We also retained traditional deck details like the \"suicidal king\" and \"one eyed jacks\". \nUPDATE:\nGUEST ARTIST: We have brought on the insanely talented (and left-handed) Danny Beck to draw a bonus card that will be included in the deck. Check out his art if you don't already know him and give that feller a follow. We're super excited to see what he comes up with.\nSTRETCH GOAL: $25k unlocks 20 additional lefties featured on the 6-10 number cards in monochrome \nBONUS: All Rewards above $100 get a free deck of cards.  \nAll Reward levels will have the chance to add on extra items via BackerClub\nCard Illustrations\nJoan of Arc prototype as one of the number cards for our stretch goal\nThe Lefties\nWhen we started this project, we had no idea how hard it would be to narrow down the ranks of left-handed visionaries to 18 people.

Thanks to all of you who helped us reach our stretch goal of $100,000 to support the conservation of puppets in the Museum\u2019s Jim Henson Collection.  \nFor the remainder of our Kickstarter campaign, we invite you to help support the production of the two interactive experiences in The Jim Henson Exhibition as we strive for a second and final stretch goal of $125,000. These interactive experiences are key ingredients in the exhibition, and with additional funding, we can build them as imagined. They demonstrate two of Henson\u2019s most significant innovations: puppetry for the television screen and puppet character design.  \n\u201cPerform a Puppet on Screen\u201d gives visitors an opportunity to experience first-hand what it is like to watch themselves perform a puppet on a television monitor. When they\u2019re finished, they will be able to email a video of their performance to themselves. \nThe \u201cDesign an Anything Muppet Character\u201d experience begins with a short video featuring Henson puppet-builder Rollie Krewson demonstrating how she designs \u201cAnything Muppet\u201d characters for Sesame Street. Visitors will be able to select facial features and accessories for an \u201cAnything Muppet\u201d form, and see what their character looks like on screen.  \nThese two interactive experiences will allow visitors to get creative and discover their inner character designer and puppeteer!\nStretch Goal: $100,000 to restore more puppets!\nWe are so grateful for the outpouring of support from the community of Jim Henson fans! Your generosity has enabled us to meet our goal of $40,000 to preserve and install the puppets in The Jim Henson Exhibition in just two days!\nWe hope you will continue to support us and help us spread the word about this campaign, as we extend our efforts to preserve Jim\u2019s legacy: we are setting a new goal of $100,000, which will help us restore more puppets in the Museum\u2019s Jim Henson collection. The Jim Henson Exhibition at MoMI and its traveling version, The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited, will feature many of Jim\u2019s unique puppets, but there are many more \u201cwaiting in the wings\u201d for their turn! As The Jim Henson Exhibition is a permanent exhibition at the Museum, the puppets in the original installation will rotate off at times for routine conservation, and it is imperative that other puppets be ready to take their place!\nThe Museum\u2019s Jim Henson collection includes puppets from all of Jim\u2019s work for film and television. To name just a few: \nKermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Rowlf, Beaker, Gonzo, Zoot, the Swedish Chef, the Koozebanians, and Camilla from The Muppet Show; \nBig Bird, Elmo, Count von Count, Grover, Cookie Monster, Prairie Dawn, Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street; \nJunior Gorg, Doozers, and all the Fraggles from Fraggle Rock; \nJen, Kira, Aughra, Pod people and a Skeksis and Mystic from The Dark Crystal; \nRare puppets from Jim\u2019s television commercials and other early work in the 1950s and 1960s, including Yorick from Sam and Friends, the LaChoy Dragon, Wilkins and Wontkins, Sir Linit, Taminella Grinderfall, the \u201cJava\u201d puppets, and the Tastee Freeze Boss; \nPuppets from Emmet Otter\u2019s Jugband Christmas, The Muppet Musicians of Bremen, Faffner Hall, and much more! \nWe cannot thank you enough for your overwhelming support. We are thrilled to be working with you all to preserve this unique and important collection for generations to come.\nWith a generous gift of hundreds of puppets and artifacts from the Henson family, Museum of the Moving Image in New York City plans to open a brand new, permanent exhibition dedicated to the work of legendary puppeteer and director Jim Henson. Over the course of a singular career, Henson created stories and characters for television and film that have delighted and inspired generations of fans around the world \u2014 from the glamorous Miss Piggy and the gentle Grover, to the mystical creatures of The Dark Crystal. The Jim Henson Exhibition will share the full story of Henson\u2019s unique talent, and the deeply collaborative creative process behind his work.\nWhat will the exhibition include?\nThe exhibition will feature more than 40 original puppets \u2014 including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Elmo, Cookie Monster, the Fraggles, and a Skeksis from The Dark Crystal \u2014 as well as puppet prototypes, original character sketches, rare behind-the-scenes footage and photographs, and interactive puppetry design and performance experiences.\nSections of the exhibition will be devoted to:\nHenson\u2019s early work for television and film in the 1950s and 60s, in which his unbridled imagination, wit, and capacity for creative innovation were clearly established \nSesame Street, where his remarkably expressive puppets have delighted children for generations \nThe Muppet Show and Muppet feature films, which have had an indelible impact on popular culture \nand the imaginary worlds of Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth\nPreserving the puppets for future generations\nThe Jim Henson Collection at Museum of the Moving Image includes approximately 175 historic puppets, such as Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Big Bird, Ernie, Bert, Elmo, the Fraggles, Jen and Kira from The Dark Crystal, and many, many more. The restoration of this important collection is an ongoing collaboration between the Museum and Jim Henson\u2019s Creature Shop, with input from fine art conservators. The Museum is honored to be working with the designers and builders at the legendary Creature Shop to restore and preserve the puppets for future generations.\nAbout the traveling exhibition\nThe Museum is excited to launch a traveling version of the exhibition, The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited, which will tour around the country and the world! The tour kicks off at Seattle\u2019s Museum of Pop Culture on May 20, 2017. We are thrilled that the flagship and traveling versions of the exhibition will reach such a large, diverse audience.\nAbout the screenings and public programs \nThe Museum is already a busy hub of Henson-related activity and programming: we host monthly screenings of Henson\u2019s work that draw a large, enthusiastic audience, and we have piloted an engaging slate of education and family programs related to the exhibition, which will serve school groups and families all year long.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nThe lasting, universal appeal of Henson\u2019s work is unprecedented. People of all ages continue to be delighted and inspired by Jim Henson\u2019s stories and characters. We\u2019re excited to use Kickstarter to connect with Henson fans around the world, and bring this global community together to support a permanent exhibition honoring his creative legacy.\nWhat will your contributions support? \nThe City of New York awarded the Museum a generous grant that has enabled us to build the gallery in which this important and inspiring exhibition will be housed. Construction of the gallery space is complete and plans for the exhibition have been finalized.\n\nBut we need your support to bring the rest of this incredible exhibition to life, in time for the 2017 school year. Your pledges will help us complete the important work of restoring the puppets in the Museum\u2019s Henson Collection and fabricating and installing the display cases for the puppets and other artifacts. \nYour contributions will ensure that hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world will be inspired by the creative process behind Jim Henson\u2019s work, and be able to get up close and personal with such beloved puppet characters as Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Elmo, Big Bird, the Fraggles, and many more.\nRewards\nVideo credits  \nVideo production by Slam!

They were popular on the indie rock circuit and paved the way for artists like Sufjan Stevens and Mumford & Sons, making well-respected music that didn't shy away from themes of faith. The band\u2019s sales and notoriety increased steadily throughout the early 2000s. But in 2006 Dave entered a time of deep personal introspection and began peeling back the layers of his beliefs. Initially he thought the process would lead him closer to the Christian God he believed in. Instead, HIS FAITH BEGAN TO COMPLETELY UNRAVEL, leading to the breakup of his band, a massive bout of writer\u2019s block, and a drinking problem. The onset of this dark season was publicly punctuated with a Washington Post article titled \u201cHallelujah Palooza\u201d where Dave was described as having \u201calready blown through a gallon jug of water mixed with Vodka\u201d at the strictly dry Cornerstone Christian Music Festival. \nThe mixture of NEWFOUND MEANINGLESSNESS AND ALCOHOL was a dangerous combination as he torched relationships, alienated his audience, and found himself unable to write new music. In losing his band. Dave lost his sole means of providing for his family of four. To maintain their bottom line, he was forced to strip down his touring method. Without a stage or even amplification, he began playing secondary and tertiary markets, performing literally in people\u2019s living rooms. He toured the country, driving alone for weeks at a time. In that solitude he WRESTLED WITH ALL HIS IDEAS ABOUT GOD, and finally left the Christian faith.\nIn the years since, Dave has been reconstructing his worldview from the ground up. Trying to figure out WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED? And what does it mean for his work, his family, and society as a whole. And since we believe these are some of the most important questions one can ask, WE DECIDED TO MAKE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT IT.\n  THE FILM\nWe\u2019ve been following Dave for two years. Riding in the van across the country, shooting in living rooms and rock clubs and having deep talks with Dave and the people who cross his path. And it has been a beautiful and fascinating journey. From the release of his 2016 album BLANCO through the creation and release of CARE (launching simultaneously with the Kickstarter.) we've been there for the ups and downs of Dave's life on the road as a working class musician. What we have is a stunning film about ART, FAITH, AND THE COURAGE TO BREAK RANKS IN SEARCH OF TRUTH. The footage we've captured, along with Dave\u2019s 20 year body of work give the audience a front row seat to the heartbreakingly intimate process of a man losing his faith, his worldview, and slogging eyes open through the stages of grief.\nTHIS IS A FILM FOR OUR TIMES. While the subject is a musician, this is not a tour documentary, a fan film, or a music doc in the traditional sense. It is instead an exploration of modern American spirituality viewed through the lens of an EXTRAORDINARY ARTIST GRAPPLING WITH HIS PERSONAL FAITH. And now is the perfect time for a film dealing with these questions. When we as a nation are struggling with our very identity, defining what is real, and what matters to us going forward. CHRISTIANITY IS AT THE CRUX OF THE DIVIDE IN AMERICA and Dave is one of the rare voices who is able to speak to both sides. His critically acclaimed record \u201cCurse Your Branches\u201d, was called his \u201cbreak up record with God\u201d by the biggest music journalists, but also somehow found its way onto the list of the Top Ten albums of the year by the massively influential, Christianity Today. Dave's living room shows, featuring no holds barred Q&A sessions, give us an incredibly rare look into the earnest discussions about faith and politics happening in small cities across the country. \nWe are making this film without an agenda beyond exploring the fascinating story of one man's wrestling with his beliefs. IT'S NOT A TAKEDOWN PIECE meant to insult people of faith, NOR A FLUFF PIECE meant to prop up easy orthodoxies. The tone will match Dave's humble, thoughtful, yet challenging style as it explores the journey from faithfulness to unbelief. We'll dig into all the doubt in-between without an axe to grind. We're interested in the COMPLICATED BEAUTY OF ALL THE GRAYS OF LIFE at a time when black and white answers feel fleeting.\n  Thus far we've worked on a shoestring, with the generous support of Fork Films, Barsuk Records and few key individuals who know this film is something really special. But now it\u2019s time for us to lock ourselves in a room and turn all this incredible footage into a film.  \nWE ARE LOOKING TO RAISE 75K (at least!). This is the bare minimum amount necessary to get us to a festival cut of the film with editing, composing, mixing, color correcting, and any additional photography we discover we need in the process. If we exceed our goal we will have more freedom and time to achieve the best version of this film. We will also be able to invest in the crucial marketing and PR necessary to get the word out.\nWe've partnered with Palaceworks, & Scraplabs to create some amazing exclusive perks for you. We're incredibly grateful for their involvement. We think you'll be excited about what they've come up with. Thanks also to Ryan Russell for the use of some of his images.\nLastly, YOU are essential to this process. As fans of Dave Bazan you know all the ways he and his music have impacted your life. We\u2019re looking to amplify his message exponentially, and we can\u2019t do that without your support. Please SPREAD THE WORD far and wide and follow us on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. You can also sign up for our official mailing list at bazanfilm.com\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out to us with any questions.

See 'Add-ons' below.\n Select 24K Gold Plated coins now available! See 'Add-ons' below.\nWhat are Hobo Coins?\nThroughout time, people have modified coins by hand-carving or engraving their own designs into existing coins. But this form of folk art really took off during the Great Depression. Those that were out of work or down on their luck took to modifying coins by engraving their own designs into them. They would use pocket knives or even filed down nails to carve beautiful designs that were as varied as the artists themselves. Often, these coins would portray skeletons or skulls, incorporating elements from the coins as part of their final works of art. They would almost always keep the lettering on the coins.\nThe Hobo Coins project brings back this largely forgotten piece of American history. These coins are being minted by the oldest continuously operated private mint in the U.S. and are SOLID. They each weigh about the same as 5 US. quarters, and are a little larger than the size of a US Dollar coins (these coins are 39 mm). Die-struck with over 100 tons of pressure in solid metal alloys and featuring antique finishes. Please note that Hobo Coins are not actual US currency or modified US currency coins, they are die-struck new coins at different sizes, weights, and (clearly), different art than actual US coins.\nHelp revive a piece of history you can carry!\nThe Designs\nEach coin was crafted and designed by me using some of the most iconic coins as their base:\nThe \u2018R.I.P.\u2019 - 1922 Peace Dollar\nArguably the most beautiful coin ever produced, the U.S. Peace Dollar was originally produced to commemorate the peace that followed World War One. My rendition features a skull portrait (keeping the radiant crown) on the front (obverse), and two skeletal hands breaking a rifle on the back (reverse). Interesting to note that the \u2018broken rifle\u2019 was abstracted into the Peace Symbol we know today. Rest in Peace! Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. Also, this coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original Peace Dollar.\nThe 'R.I.P. Dollar - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Bad Mojo\u2019 - 1936 Buffalo Nickel\nMy take on the classic Buffalo Nickel hobo coin (popular because it was a \u2018soft\u2019 coin to carve), features a skeleton Chief with a no-nonsense attitude on the front, and an intricately carved buffalo skeleton on the back. Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'flat' edge like the original Buffalo Nickel.\nThe 'Bad Mojo' - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Walking Reaper\u2019 - 1936 Walking Liberty Half Dollar\nScares the sh*t outta me\u2014and that\u2019s a good thing! Based on what is considered one the most beautiful coins of all time, the Walking Liberty Half Dollar. Front side (obverse) features a grim reaper you never want to meet, and the back of the coin shows a Poe-esque scene with a raven. Nevermore! Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original Walking Liberty Half Dollar.\nThe 'Walking Reaper' - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Old Hobo\u2019 - 1891 Morgan Dollar\nEven hobos like a drink! The front face (obverse) of the coin features a hobo skeleton enjoying a pint. The back side (reverse) shows a skeleton hobo chilling in a box car with his loyal dog companion. Aged with an antique silver-finish. As with all the coins, this is a 39mm die-struck, hefty 12 gauge coin. This coin will have a 'reeded' edge like the original Morgan Dollar.\nThe 'Old Hobo' - actual coin finish may vary.\nThe \u2018Hobo Coin / Hobo Signs\u2019 Limited Edition Print\nTo compliment the coins, I\u2019ve designed this print which features a hobo walking through a shanty town along railroad tracks carrying a gunny sack, and is emblazoned with 'Liberty' at the top. Each print is 18\u201d x 24\u201d, signed, and numbered.\n'Liberty' - inspired by coin typography and hobo coin art, each 18\" x 24\" print will be signed and numbered.\nAdd-ons\nAdditional coins or posters can be added to any base pledge as needed. Simply click on \u2018Manage My Pledge\u2019 and manually increase your pledge amount by the following:\nCoins - add $14 (in the US), 15$ (international) to your pledge amount per additional coin, feel free to add as many as you would like.

Her groundbreaking look, attitude, and performance were all years ahead of their time and continue to influence everyone from Quentin Tarantino and Rob Zombie to John Waters and Dita Von Teese. \nStill, Tura's screen life was nothing compared to her real life. As a child, Tura was imprisoned at Japanese American WWII internment camp Manzanar. As a pre-teen, she was the victim of a brutal, racially-motivated gang rape. But instead of letting those early tragedies destroy her, Tura flipped it around, reinventing herself into a world famous burlesque dancer, Asian American cinema hero, and most importantly, the living definition of female self-empowerment.\nFeaturing incredible new interviews with John Waters, Dita Von Teese & more, and narrated by Margaret Cho, TURA! will be a fascinating, thrilling white-knuckle ride through the life and career of one of the most infamous \u201cbad girls\u201d in cinema history. TURA! also serves to finally place Tura Satana alongside Bruce Lee in the pantheon of the most influential Asian American performers the world has ever known.\nThe production of this film was Tura Satana\u2019s deathbed wish. Help her, and us, make it a reality. TURA! -- Just do it!\n(This film is the AUTHORIZED DOCUMENTARY Tura Satana personally initiated prior to her death, being produced by her estate and closest friends).\nSEE THE NEW INDIEWIRE ARTICLE HERE!\nDespite her underground popularity and huge internet presence, Tura\u2019s accomplishments and vast influence remain largely unrecognized. Tura fought long and hard for gains that others have since reaped the benefits from. It\u2019s time to set the story straight! Tura didn\u2019t just \u2018open the door\u2019 for modern Hollywood\u2019s dominant leading ladies, she literally kicked that hole through the wall, blazing the path for others to follow. She deserves acknowledgement for that, and this film \u2013 created by those who knew and worked with her \u2013 gives her the respect and recognition she is long overdue. Tura\u2019s \u201cIf I can do this, anyone can\u201d attitude has inspired countless people in the past, and can now go on to inspire even more!\nOnce the film is completed (we estimate a year or less), we will use all of the means at our disposal to find the best possible release and distribution for the film. That includes screening at key festivals, distributor screenings, and inclusion at international film markets. We are very confident that the film will find wide release platforms, so all of our work will be shared with the world.\nTURA!

(It's Tura, we'll pick something amazing!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a film like this (independent documentary) has risks, many of which have already been taken on by the filmmakers. We've invested more than three years of time and our own money to get this off the ground. If this film were not finished & released, it would be both a financial blow and a loss of the time and effort spent by the crew and our amazing interview subjects. But this is something we believe in very strongly, so were willing to take on the risk in the interest of getting Tura's story told.\n \nHowever, the risk in not completing this film goes beyond financial... \n\nWe\u2019ve already captured moving, indepth, sometimes hilarious interviews- \n\nJOHN WATERS recalling his discovery of TURA, and being so excited he brought DIVINE with him to the next show\u2026 DENNIS BUSCH on working with Tura and RUSS MEYER in the Mojave Desert on Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!... TED V. MIKELS discussing his decades of Tura\u2026 the impact DITA VON TEESE felt when seeing Tura for the first time, and more. \n\nMany of these deeply personal memories and feelings have NEVER BEEN REVEALED BEFORE; gleams of personality and cinema history that will FALL AWAY, FORGOTTEN unless this film reaches its goal. Losing these touching, informative moments and breaking our final promise to Tura is the biggest risk of all, and something we can't let happen!\n\nThe Challenge\n\nThe depth and breadth of Tura Satana's life experiences could fill ten films. Tura \u201cbrings a lot to the table.\u201d The challenge here is not so much production delays (as this is a documentary), but rather choosing which of the many the impactful, meaningful events go into the film. No easy task! We're not just \"glossing over\" Tura's looks and career; her real life was much more harrowing than any movie script could be.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "GO, BABY, GO!", "descp": "Show your support for Tura by helping to make her life\u2019s dream become a reality!

The film is complete and has enjoyed a successful festival run since its world premiere at the 2016 SXSW Film Festival. Though we cleared the music and footage rights to allow us to screen at festivals, we now need to clear those rights to allow for a worldwide release. With your support this can happen and we will be able to make the film available to music and movie fans around the world. In the process you will help to tell the incredible stories of these three remarkable men, preserve an important part of history and maybe, just maybe, help to get Hubert Sumlin elected to the Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame. \n I have always been a huge music fan. As a kid it was Jimi Hendrix, The Beatles, The Stones, Led Zeppelin, The Doors, The Who and The Band. One of my favorite records was The Rolling Stones, \"Love You Live.\" I particularly loved the song \u201cMannish Boy.\u201d After seeing The Last Waltz for the first time and watching this guy named Muddy Waters (with a bushy haired Bob Margolin) perform that Rolling Stones song, my lifelong love and appreciation for the blues was born. In 2008 I was fortunate to meet and work with Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin and Willie \u201cBig Eyes\u201d Smith. After hearing their first hand accounts of life growing up in the Delta and experiences as sidemen for the legendary Muddy Waters and larger-than-life Howlin' Wolf, I knew I had to make a film that honored these men and the great legacies that they were a part of. My initial thought was to shoot a Last Waltz-style concert film, pairing these great blues musicians with all the rock and blues stars that covered, and in many cases made famous, the great blues-rock songs I grew up loving. But, the fates had other plans and what resulted after seven years is Sidemen: Long Road To Glory. I believe the film we made far surpasses my initial vision. My hope is that the film we created is worthy of these incredible musicians, the band leaders they played with and the great legacies they left behind. I believe that we have and I thank you for being a part of it. \nScott Rosenbaum - Director \n  Pinetop Perkins, Hubert Sumlin and Willie \"Big Eyes\" Smith by: Jerome Brunet and Sandro Miller\n  Pinetop, Willie and Hubert were some of our last direct links to the origins of Delta and Chicago blues. As sidemen to the great Muddy Waters and Holwin' Wolf they were a part of some of the most recognizable and influential blues recordings of all time. The influence and cultural impact of these men and the legacies that they are a part of is incalculable. \nGet the Sidemen: Long Road To Glory button made specifically for the Kickstarter campaign and featuring the neon title design by artist Conrad Kochek\n    Get your Sidemen: Long Road To Glory T-shirt with the movie's official poster featuring Jerome Brunet's image of Pinetop Perkins.\n  Show your support for Hubert Sumlin's induction to the R&R Hall of Fame.

With a successful campaign we will move quickly to complete the clearance process, partner with a distributor and release the film. We want to be as clear as possible, this will take some time and may delay the shipment of the DVD.

He's a well-meaning genie, blissfully ignorant of his own power or purpose. Nothing can disturb his placid demeanor.\nIn my day-to-day art practice, it's fairly typical for me to exhaust myself with over-planning, sacrificing too much of the 'joy of making' in the name of attention to detail. So Rainpuppy began as an exercise in letting go - in between more 'professional' art undertakings, I would do a loose comic page here and there in a sketchbook specifically designated for the purpose. The idea was to return to my roots and draw something the way I would when I was a kid - wholly improvised, with absolutely no preparatory sketching or corrections. So the whole comic was made by putting ink straight to paper, not knowing what was going to happen in the next panel. The resulting action proceeds with the kind of absurd role-playing game logic you'd find in Adventure Time. It's a lyrical, meandering stream-of-consciousness, and hopefully also a soothing tonic to current events.\n\nYou may also detect faint notes of Moomin, Mushi-Shi, Studio Ghibli films (especially My Neighbor Totoro and The Secret World of Arrietty), and I guess also Winnie the Pooh?\nThe book will be 5 x 7-1/8\", 40 pages. The contents are divided in 4 vignettes, each comprised of 9 comic pages and 1 full-page painting. You can check out one of the four parts in the link at the top of this page!\nPrinting will be done on a risograph - a kind of duplicator manufactured in Japan. You can think of risographs as something like automatic screen printers that look a lot like photocopiers. The machines force eco-friendly soy ink from color drums through automatically-generated stencils. Risographs have become popular in alternative comics as an affordable way to achieve pretty colors in a small-sized print run. Part of the appeal also comes from the slight misregistration that can occur with multiple impressions. These 'beautiful imperfections' assure no two prints are exactly the same. Because the soy inks are translucent, they can be printed on top of each other to yield new colors. The art in Rainpuppy is designed to use three risograph ink colors (dark blue, fluorescent pink, and yellow), achieving a faux-CYMK color gamut that I expect to be reminiscent of the comic strips you'd find in the Sunday funny pages.\nThe books will be printed on super nice speckly paper, sustainably-milled by French Paper Co! Their paper has a pleasing tactility, as well as great chemistry with risograph ink, yielding bright matte colors. All matte everything. I wanted to make something that looks and feels rustic and natural, because I think that will resonate with the imagery in the comic. I think if a project consumes paper, it should feel deluxe and not disposable!\nThe content is all-ages. It wasn't really made for kids, but it's kid-friendly, and could make a great gift! The visual language of the book is pretty unsophisticated, and could hopefully even encourage kids to think \"I could do that,\" and draw their own comics.\nFor what it's worth, these books will be a hand-numbered limited edition! I do intend to fully meet demand though, so it's not meant to imply rarity or that this will necessarily be the only way to access the material forever - I just believe in moving on from a project once it's done, so there will never be another luxurious artist-produced print edition like this.\n- The Rainpuppy Tee: Screen printed on American Apparel Fine Jersey Crewneck T-Shirts (Red), available in XS-3XL. Youth sizes are available as well! Please note that youth tees may end up being Gildan instead of American Apparel. You'll be able to choose your size on a survey sent out after the fundraiser. If you are interested in pledging for multiple shirts, please message me.\n  - PDFs: All backers will receive a download link to a digital version of the full comic.\n- Process Post: I'm going to make a post summarizing my process for making the art for Rainpuppy, including information about the tools I used!\n- $1900: Free stickers for everyone who pledges toward the 2nd pledge level and above. Stickers will be die-cut, meaning puppy-shaped, not a lame rectangle!\n- $2700: Screen printed dust jackets for all the physical books. I'm really hoping we can get here, because it will really be the cherry on top, making the book feel like a more complete object.\nNote: cover art will be printed in differing colors by risograph if the $2700 stretch goal is not met.\n   (Website, Twitter)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the artwork is done and I've successfully fulfilled two Kickstarter campaigns before, so there aren't many foreseeable hurdles.

Psychological decision making in your dialogues with other characters.\nAnd a heavy emphasis on an RPG-like narrative with branching outcomes.\nYou will explore the jungles and rivers of Vietnam in first person perspective.  You join a crew of \u201crock and rollers with one foot in their grave\u201d.\nIt\u2019s like Fallout: New Vegas on acid in the middle of the Vietnam War.\nYour ultimate mission is to assassinate Colonel Kurtz, a rogue American officer who is accused of forming a private army and operating \"totally beyond the pale of any acceptable human conduct.\u201d\nCombat is often your last resort; the wise soldier will avoid the ever-looming enemy at all costs.\nMaintaining resources and relationships is key to your survival and your success.\nYou will play Captain Willard.\nAnd you have a mission, but between receiving your mission in the hotel room and meeting Colonel Kurtz, how you journey upriver on PBR Streetgang is up to you.\nYou will engage in dialog, like in most roleplaying games, but you are a Special Forces operative, so your dialog will be like Captain Willard's dialog.\nYou aren't chatty, you get to the point, but you are friendly and charming when you want to be. You are alienated.  You are entertaining alternate points-of-view about the war and the world.\nBut you are also an assassin.\nAn assassin doesn't fire their weapon unless they have to.\nSo you will creep through the jungle.\nYou will engage in what everyone calls \"stealth gameplay.\" Your sneaking will be based on both your personal skill and your character skills (which will be built out by you as you gain experience during your journey up the river).\nWhy character skill?\nBecause this is an RPG. You are building your version of Captain Willard, not ours and not necessarily the movie's.\nYour skills will affect your dialogues, what dialogue choices you have, and will open up different avenues of approach to the characters in the world.\nCharacter Skills for you personally will have their greatest impact on two things: 1) how you interact with the characters you meet; 2) how you navigate the jungle.\nHow stealthily or combat-intensive is your approach?\nWhy personal skill? And what do we mean?\nWe do not mean twitch gameplay. This is a game about survival, horror and stealth.  You're a member of the special forces.\nWhat we do mean is:\nHow do you tactically and strategically approach the game as a Player. Paying attention to details in the environment including the lighting like in the Thief series.\nAnd why do we care?\nBecause this is a psychological horror game where the narrative gameplay and your interactions with the other characters drives the story; but we have the confidence to leave the steering wheel in your hands. Let you drive.\nIt might be our mission, but it's sure as hell your boat.\nSo first we ask for your support here:\nhttps://apocalypsenow.com/\nWhich will be both a long running ongoing crowdfunding campaign to raise $5,900,000 but also a site where we will provide entertainment throughout the course of development.\n  PLAY\n\n    A cross-disciplinary team of AAA game developers, motion picture professionals and Interactive creatives are coming together to create a truly unique experience.\nErebus LLC is a special-purpose LLC setup specifically to make the game with American Zoetrope.\nThe name is from the actual name of the Patrol Boat Riverine commonly known by it\u2019s codename PBR Streetgang. You see \u201cErebus\u201d painted on the back of the boat.\nRob Auten, Lawrence Liberty, Montgomery Markland, Kevin McCann, and a dozen other non-public members of the team came together to build the initial prototype. Liberty, Markland and McCann have all built entire game studios and game teams.\n\nBetween the core group they've probably got over 50+ credits? Josh Sawyer is a design consultant thanks to him and Feargus (and best wishes for Pillars of Eternity 2!).\nThere\u2019s a lot of long-experienced practical game development experience here. And we\u2019re happy to answer any questions about anything related to the team or the company. In the comments!\nFor the first time, fans can experience this psychedelic vision of Vietnam as originally presented by legendary filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola. \nIn order to maintain the creative freedom and integrity that this daring and intense tale demands, the project is being financed outside the traditional video game publishing system.\nWe want the support of backers like you to make this vision a reality.\n    Apocalypse Now depicts the horror and spectacle of the Vietnam War through the character of Captain Benjamin Willard, an American tasked with the assassination of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. \nThe game is an interactive recreation of Willard\u2019s journey, as seen through a survival horror lens in which players with limited resources face unspeakable terrors.\nBy choosing how to react to these situations, each player molds a unique version of Willard within the loose confines of the film story. You are Willard and your actions will determine his fate.\nYour mission begins in Saigon, where Willard is holed up in a dingy hotel. Audio and visual distortion evoke Willard\u2019s emotions and past experiences. The game provides you subjective access to a character who is already nearly insane.\nUnlike a traditional RPG, the emphasis is not choosing dialogue, but rather actions and postures. Combat draws from survival horror to emphasize combat avoidance and stealth. This is not Call of Duty in Vietnam.\nYou will quickly learn that the gun-blazing solo war machine of other shooters would not have lasted long in the real Vietnam. Instead you will find rewards for proceeding cautiously and managing limited resources with care. Willard is your responsibility; make him an adept soldier and you will command respect in the jungle.\nBrutalism and hubris will bring about severe repercussions affecting your relationship with those around you, especially the crew of the PBR Streetgang (aka the Erebus). Your actions can endanger or empower them and will affect how they view you and their willingness to aid you.\nThere is also a war of resources. Food, water, first aid supplies, anti-malaria medicine, drugs, ammo, weapons, mission information, and gasoline are all vital to your and Willard\u2019s success. While in U.S.-controlled territory, you can find resources through exploration, interactions with allied forces, completing side missions, scavenging from hostiles, and supply drops.\nOnce the Erebus crosses under the Do Lung Bridge, the reigns of control are sheared away. American influence is replaced by something more primal, all ending in Kurtz.\nThe world of Apocalypse Now is full of compelling, disturbing, and potentially useful characters. You will recognize many of them from the film, but we\u2019ll be adding new ones in collaboration with our partners at American Zoetrope. Our goal is to immerse you in a tale of drama, magic, and horror.\n                         Francis Ford Coppola is the creative and prolific force behind American Graffiti, The Godfather series, The Conversation, Bram Stoker's Dracula and his most ambitious film, Apocalypse Now (1979), a Vietnam War epic that was inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (1899). Released in 1979, the acclaimed motion picture won the Golden Palm Award at the Cannes Film Festival, and two Academy Awards.\nRob Auten has served as a lead writer on video game franchises like Gears of War and Battlefield, as an experience designer for Disney, and as a creative director on several forthcoming VR projects. As an entrepreneur, he is working to create an operating system for immersive experiences with the team at Hexagram.io.\nLawrence Liberty has held executive roles at studios and publishers in the Southern California games industry, and has shipped over 70 million units that have generated nearly 4 billion dollars of gross revenue. Titles for which he held an executive producer, studio director or senior producer role include Fallout: New Vegas, DC Universe Online, many Dungeons & Dragons titles, and was Senior Producer for the North American release of The Witcher (from publisher Atari). He is also a master project lead when it comes to developing or extending game engines and technology. On the personal front, he loves both pen and paper and computer RPGs. He\u2019s spent more hours playing The Witcher 3 than any other man on the face of the Planet Earth.\nMontgomery Markland obtained his Bachelor of Science in Film at the University of Texas \u2013 Austin. On the interactive side, Markland designed, produced or directed video games for Atari, Sega, THQ, Ubisoft, Obsidian Entertainment, Killspace Entertainment and inXile entertainment. His work includes being a producer on two of the most successful crowdfunding titles of all time: Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, a designer and producer on Aliens: Crucible, and work in various capacities from assistant producer to CCO on titles ranging from Neverwinter Nights 2: Storm of Zehir to Rocksmith. He helped tabletop PNP setting Synthicide convert an unsuccessful Kickstarter project to a crowdfunding success. He is widely regarded as the go-to expert for entertainment crowdfunding. He's designed toys for Spinmasters, real-time facial replacement technology, and consulted on innumerable entertainment and social media projects. On the live-action side, Montgomery studied acting at The Beverly Hills Playhouse and directed his first feature film Malibu Road in 2014-2015 slated for a theatrical & VOD run in 2017.\nJosh Sawyer is the Design Director at Obsidian Entertainment and is providing external counsel to the team in a special advisory capacity in the area of gameplay design and crowdfunding.\nCarmine Coppola collaborated to create an extraordinary, dense, textural electronic and symphonic soundscape using state-of-the-art synths that veers from psychedelic to operatic. And we are very lucky to be able to use this amazing music in the video game adaptation.\n      American Zoetrope is a privately run American film studio, centered in San Francisco and founded by Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas. Opened on December 12, 1969, American Zoetrope was an early adopter of digital filmmaking, including some of the earliest uses of HDTV.

Let's see if we can get another $2k to pay for a 2-table spot! \nSeriously, how amazing would it be to get Girl Scouts San Diego to San Diego Comic-Con? It's right here in our hometown! The girls will get a chance to join the amazing party that is Comic-Con downtown every year, and we can sell t-shirts, pillows, stickers and other cool swag and spread the word about the game!\nComic-Con 2017 here we come!\n  MORE STRETCH GOALS:\nBasically every $500 we go over gets another troop a set of 10 2-hour sessions, or another laptop for us to share! \n*\nWe know we can do A LOT with the goal we have already reached and are just so thrilled to get started. There are over 19,000 Girl Scouts in the San Diego / Imperial Valley area. We have until Sunday, 2/26 at 5:58PM PST... so it's not too late - tell your friends they can still get a curriculum pack, t-shirt, stickers, shout-out, character, or level! \n*\nGIANT SQUISHY MARSHMALLOW HUGS to the entire tech community for the outpouring of support!!!\n*\n*\n*\nSTEAM curriculum:\nYou may be wondering, \"Why marshmallows?\" and our answer would have to be, \"Because they make it easy to be creative and learn how to program!\" We provide the initial idea for the core group of characters and the game platforms - and then just let our scouts just take these and run with them. The idea of a bunch of marshmallows hanging out with chocolate, graham crackers and other friends makes it fun and easy for participants of any age to engage and come up with stories and scenarios for the characters, and in the process, learn the math and science of programming:\nHow to make the characters jump convincingly? Physics programming, i.e. emulating inertia, friction.\nWhat would happen if a marshmallow grabbed onto a balloon? Gameplay scripting, vectors, and loops.\nHow to generate new obstacles in the level? Procedural level design, coordinate geometry.\nHow to create timers and scoring?  Delta time, conditionals, collision detection.\nWhat do people like most about the game? Data analytics to determine player retention and drop-off rates to improve the game.\nAnd much more!\nMarshmallow Math T-Shirt: the formula for the parabola that maps the trajectory of a jump!\nWe will also be teaching design:\nGraphic design\nCharacter design\nSprite creation / sprite sheets\nStoryboarding\nGame level design\nAudio design and editing\nVideo editing\n Rewards\nWe're super-excited about our rewards - the scouts will help design and create them! Now that we've reached our 160th backer, we are celebrating with a brand-new reward - Marshmallow Run DIY Starter Pack #1! \nMarshmallow DIY Starter Pack #1: Join the fun and code your own level!\n We want to share Marshmallow Run with coding students everywhere. This pack comes with a full set of PNG sprites, backgrounds, and obstacles, and lesson plans for your class, or if you want to just try coding a level at home:\nOther benefits:\nEstablish a positive digital footprint: Participating scouts and troops will be credited on the game platforms they contribute to, and we will also help scouts involved with the javascript and mobile development of the game to establish git accounts to collaborate on our game repository. It's more important than ever these days to have a positive digital footprint for college and the job market - this is a great way to establish a reputation for being a creator and developer - not just a consumer!\nBadges! Scouts who participate will also receive Design Code Build's special-edition STEAM badges.\nCool guest speakers We will also be inviting great guest speakers to come talk to the scouts - special friends of Design Code Build who are experts in the fields of game design, coding, and filmmaking.\nAnd it would be so cool if... Our dream come true would be to bring a group of our Girl Scouts to Apple WWDC this June. We are going to apply! The first year we went to WWDC, in 2008, there were 2000+ developers in attendance, and only 12 of them were female. Things have definitely improved since then, but they could be better still.\nWho are we?\nDesign Code Build is a STEAM academy founded in San Diego, by principals with extensive experience creating award-winning apps, websites, videos, and digital museum experiences. We are also parents and teachers, and enjoy teaching and making things with kids - our next generation of digital visionaries. We are an official community partner of San Diego Girl Scouts.\nThe plan:\nPROJECT MANAGEMENT\nEveryone will learn to code in Scratch. Troops can also decide on a second focus - whether they would like to support the project further via design, project management, porting and more advanced coding, or marketing. Once troops have decided, we will set up our curricula for each troop and schedule group meetings. Each track will teach a set of software unique to each focus, such as Adobe Photoshop for the design track, Encore and Basecamp for project management, Flurry and Google Analytics for the marketing track, etc.\nPORTING AND LAUNCHING Since Scratch is Flash-based, Marshmallow Run will not be available to iOS phones and non-Flash-enabled web browsers if it remains only on the Scratch site. For our game to reach the widest possible audience, we will port the game to JavaScript once we have completed and launched the Scratch game. Scratch is basically a custom JavaScript library wrapped in Flash - when combined with HTML5 and CSS, JavaScript is the \u201csecret sauce\u201d behind the interactivity of many online games across the web. Older scouts such as juniors, cadettes and seniors who are interested can attend our JavaScript sessions and learn how the variables in Scratch translate to JavaScript, and begin the process of porting the game to the Web. This JavaScript phase will provide a strong codebase from which we can begin porting the game to the mobile platforms, iOS and Android, using Unity or Cocos2D. Scouts will also become familiar with the XCode and Android Studio authoring environments.\nMARKETING With nearly 500,000 games in the iTunes App Store alone, there is a lot to know to successfully market a game. Scouts will help create and set up Girl Scouts San Diego's first Apple iTunesconnect and Google Play accounts, and learn how to write enticing game descriptions, create game screenshots and preview videos, and track metrics from these portals. In addition, some troop teams will help set up a website for the web version of the game, and learn about web hosting and server administration, as well as setting up browser-based metrics layers such as Google Analytics and Flurry. Still other troop teams will learn how to craft press releases to submit to gaming and tech blogs, and social media gaming sites for reviews. There will also be fun and enriching workshops built around fulfilling the Rewards. Troops can choose whether they want to help provide spin-off Scratch games built to supporters\u2019 wishes; learn 3D-printing technology to print and distribute characters from the game; design and print t-shirts, postcards, stickers, or posters; design plush toys to be created by hand or submitted for production in a limited factory run, and more!\nFunding\nAll funds will be used to support the development of the game and provide in-depth STEAM instruction to Girl Scouts San Diego:\nA set of computers to bring to area troops.  \nA meeting space\nCreating and maintaining Apple Developer and Google Play accounts for Girl Scouts San Diego and getting XCode and Android Studio onto enough computers to be able to host development classes.\nWeb hosting for the web version of the game\nStipend for enough teachers for the program so that participating girls will get hands-on instruction and be able to build and launch the game according to schedule.\nProviding as much instructional time as possible to any Girl Scout San Diego troops who would like to participate.\nMaterials to support the Rewards program.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEveryone we've talked to about this idea is as excited about it as we are. We have, however, recognized that there are some important issues to address:\n\nPARTICIPATION FOR ALL\n\nOne of the main reasons why we are excited about this project is that it offers the possibility of teaching girls the various roles involved in a collaborative project and the process of creating a game. Designers, coders, writers/game designers, project managers, marketers. All are critical to the process. Scouts can decide which role they want to take on, and will come away with the confidence that they have contributed meaningfully to this fun project.\n\nLASTING IMPACT\n\nHow much lasting impact will our lessons have? To be sure our program has the greatest impact, reliable access to computers, and enough dedicated hours by teaching staff is essential. We have ready, willing and able volunteers, but we also want to have the principals be able to pour their time and hearts into this for the amount of time that it takes - we are anticipating anywhere from 9 to 12 months. Our team and pair-coding approach will help make this a memorable experience for all our participants, socially and pedagogically.\n\nACCESS\n\nIt may seem like computers are everywhere these days, but from our experience teaching, we realize that there are still many kids in the upper grades of elementary school and even middle school and high school who do not have regular access to a computer, or internet. We would like for this project to level the playing field - and for us to be able bring our programs to scouts and schools when and where they need support.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "A Big Marshmallow Run Thank You", "descp": "At this level, we will add your name to the scrolling credits in the scratch versions of our game!

I\u2019m David Pogue: former New York Times tech columnist, current tech critic at Yahoo Finance, and author of 104 tech books (including the Pogue\u2019s Basics and Missing Manual series).\nI'm also a dad, a pianist, a magician, and a life-long learner. In addition, I\u2019ve hosted more than a dozen programs for NOVA, the longest-running science program on American TV.\nAlong the way, I've gotten the chance to visit incredible places, meet brilliant people, and see amazing science in action. Best of all, I've been able to share it with you!\nBringing science to the public isn\u2019t always glamorous...\n...but it is always important, and that's why it's been NOVA's mission for over 40 years.\nIf we can bring out the excitement, the fun, and even the humor in science, we can make it more accessible to everyone. And that's critical to keeping science as part of our national conversation.\nStarting today, we have a chance to continue that mission together.\nJoin me on NOVA's next adventure as we explore the secret world of molecules\u2014for a new project called Beyond the Elements! \nTogether, we can bring our discoveries to life with a brand-new television special, rich educational materials, and a cutting-edge VR experience. And we can send it to every public high school in the United States\u2026 for free. Ready to get started?\nOf COURSE WE DO! Making science more accessible to everyone isn't just a good idea, it's essential to our very survival. Scientific knowledge is what lets us\u2026\n(Not to mention such science-enabled inventions as smartphones, emoji, and Snapchat.)\nThat's why, frankly, we should be worried when we hear statistics like these: \n (These are real facts! Sources: 1, 2, 3, 4)\nHow is this happening?! If science is so essential to a safe, prosperous future, why don't more Americans understand even the most basic scientific concepts? \nThere are many reasons, but one of them is that science is often inaccessible to the public. To non-experts, science can appear too abstract, intimidating, or unrelatable to feel essential. Many people never get the chance to see science the way science lovers see it: as an incredible key that can unlock the secrets of the universe. \nIf we want to live in a world that values science, we need to make sure more people can understand and love science. We need more people to experience the wonder of science, and not see it as \"too hard\" or \"just for experts.\" In short, we need to make science for all. And that\u2019s where NOVA comes in.\nFor over 40 years, NOVA has been at the forefront of making science more accessible to the public. Since 1973, PBS has aired more than 750 NOVA programs, which have helped millions of people understand and appreciate the importance of scientific thought and discovery. This work hasn't gone unnoticed: NOVA has won countless awards, including numerous EMMY\u00ae, Peabody and duPont-Columbia Awards.\nOf course, even more important than the awards are the results. Every year, people tell me, and NOVA, about the impact the show has had on their lives. In fact, I've met more than a few scientists who chose their careers because they watched NOVA, and even more kids who tell me that NOVA is the reason they want to become scientists.\nNOVA is also an indispensable resource for thousands of science teachers. Across the country, classrooms rely not just on NOVA programming, but on the free learning materials that NOVA creates to help teachers bring science to life. See for yourself: \nAnd NOVA isn't just for students and teachers. It's essential viewing for learners of all ages. When it comes to reach, not many shows can compare to NOVA. Tens of millions of Americans have watched NOVA over the years. In fact...\nThat\u2019s more than 50 million people. So let's recap:\nWe know we need more people to understand and love science.\nWe know that NOVA has been helping people discover science for over 40 years.\nWe know there's still a lot of work left to do. \nAnd that's where you come in.\nOur Kickstarter campaign has four potential goals. The more we raise, the more we'll be able to accomplish.  \nOur first goal is to fund an exciting new NOVA TV special called Beyond the Elements, hosted by me, David Pogue. It\u2019s a follow-up to Hunting the Elements, one of the most popular NOVA specials ever; you can read more about that further down the page. \nLike all NOVA shows, this two-hour TV special will air on all PBS stations. It will also be available online\u2014free to the public, thanks to \"viewers (and backers!) like you.\" \nBeyond the Elements tells a great story. There are only about 90 naturally occurring elements in the universe\u2014but they can combine in over 100 million ways to make up everything we know\u2014everything we\u2019ve ever encountered, from the air we breathe to the ketchup we put on our burgers. In this special, I\u2019ll travel the world on a quest to unlock the secrets of molecules, both human-made and natural, from poisons to peppers and everything inbetween. \nIf you want more details, you can read about\u2026\nWhy we chose Beyond the Elements for this crowdfunding campaign\nWhat Beyond the Elements will cover (further down the page!)\n \nOnce we\u2019ve passed $1 million, we\u2019ll be on a race for our second goal: To fund the production of free teaching resources that educators need to make Beyond the Elements more useful in their classrooms. \nThey\u2019ll include lesson plans, interactive videos, and even virtual field trips, in which NOVA will stream a live video feed directly into classrooms from exciting on-site locations. Students will get a chance to follow along in real time and ask questions to experts. \nAnd, like all NOVA educational materials, all of these materials will be available on the web for free to any teacher or student who wants them.\n \nThen, once we\u2019ve passed our second goal, we\u2019ll be on the road to meeting our third goal\u2014a special resource that NOVA\u2019s never offered before.\nNOVA's digital team already makes all kinds of great interactive materials; its free Elements iPad app has been downloaded nearly 3 million times. But if we reach our third goal, we can take Beyond the Elements where no NOVA special has gone before\u2026 into virtual reality.\nWhile Beyond the Elements will be great as a TV special, think how much cooler it'll be if you can then shrink down and go inside the mind-blowing world of molecules, to see everything up close! VR is still an emerging technology, but it has exciting implications for education. With your help, NOVA can pioneer new ways to make science for all in this new format.\nFinally, once we pass $2.25 million, we\u2019ll begin working to bring NOVA\u2014and Beyond the Elements\u2014to as many American students as possible. Beyond the Elements will be free on TV and, for a limited time, on the web\u2014but not all public high schools can stream online video in their classrooms. \nWe want to make sure teachers can depend on Beyond the Elements to be available whenever they need it. That's why our final goal is to make both Hunting the Elements and Beyond the Elements available on DVD or Blu-Ray, for free, to every public high school in the United States\u2014almost 26,000 schools.\n Together, we can make an incredible new special, bring it to life with classroom materials and a VR experience, and make sure that it's available to every high-school student in America. If we do, we'll have helped NOVA make the world of molecules both more exciting to all viewers, and more available to millions of students and teachers. \n If we want to make science for all, that's a pretty good start.  \nWe spent a long time thinking about this. \nNOVA covers a huge variety of science topics. Maybe you get most excited about outer space. Or chemistry, math, engineering, nature, or archaeology. No matter which topic excites you, chances are that there's a NOVA episode about it. \nHere are a few reasons we settled on Beyond the Elements for this campaign:\nIt's a follow-up to one of NOVA's most watched, most popular specials. \nIt makes some of science's most basic concepts enjoyable for all ages.\nWe've been wanting to make it for years. \nHunting the Elements fans have been asking us to make it. \nWe knew it would take some real funding to make it a reality, and...\nWe've received support from The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to get us started! \nNow, if we work together, we can finally make it happen.\nSeveral years ago, I hit the road with the NOVA team to discover the secrets behind our universe\u2019s building blocks: the elements of the periodic table. \nHunting the Elements aired in 2012, and was an instant hit: Over 10 million people have seen it to date, and nearly 3 million people have downloaded the accompanying app. You can watch it right now on the NOVA website, so you\u2019ll get an idea of our style of scientific storytelling. \nTeachers frequently write NOVA to say thank you, explaining how valuable it is in their classrooms. We\u2019re often told how students have been inspired by it. For example, I got to meet 10-year-old Eva from Oklahoma, who was so inspired by the show that she memorized the entire periodic table. Or 10-year-old Henry from Massachusetts, who has watched Hunting the Elements over 100 times:\nPLAY\n\nIf we\u2019re going to help more people fall in love with science, that\u2019s exactly the kind of inspiration we need!\nWith Beyond the Elements, we want to take that winning formula and run with it. \nThis time we\u2019ll take a look at how all those elements form molecules and make up everything we\u2019ve ever encountered! Water is a molecule, caffeine is a molecule, and you are made of molecules. Molecules occur naturally, and some can also be crafted by humans. They can help or hurt, and we intend to tell their stories. \nOur goal is for Hunting the Elements and Beyond the Elements to work together. We hope that they\u2019ll provide an exciting, comprehensive introduction to chemistry that can catalyze a reaction in curious minds of all ages.\nIf you've read this far, I hope it\u2019s because you agree that we need to make science for everyone. Our future depends on it. \nBut that doesn\u2019t mean that you won\u2019t get more immediate gratification for supporting this project. (After all, PBS has been giving away mugs and tote bags to its supporters since long before Kickstarter was invented.) \nSome of you will be excited to get official NOVA rewards, and others would prefer that we spend everything we raise on helping more schools. \n That's why we have two kinds of rewards: \nYou can get PERSONAL REWARDS, including exclusive NOVA Kickstarter gear, such as T-shirts, mugs, tote bags, and even custom lab books, or you can pledge for EDUCATOR REWARDS, and we'll direct your pledge to helping the teacher(s) and school(s) of your choice. You'll find descriptions of all of the available rewards on the right side of this page, but if you're wondering what's included at each pledge level, this should help:\nIf you want more details, check out the FAQ for answers to questions like:\nHow do I tell you which rewards I want?\nWhen do the rewards ship?\nWhat format of digital download will I get?\nWe know that $1 million is a lot of money (let alone $2.25 million!). So we want to be very clear about why we're asking for this much money, and how we'll use it. \nThe first thing you should know is that Beyond the Elements has already received a significant grant from The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation toward the goals of this Kickstarter campaign. We\u2019re grateful for their enthusiasm and support. \nBut even with the generous support of the Sloan Foundation, NOVA still needs to raise the amounts listed here to do everything we've described. \nThat's because, as in every Kickstarter campaign, we'll have to pay certain fees to Kickstarter and the credit-card companies. We'll also have to cover the cost of making and packing all of the rewards you're getting. (T-shirts don\u2019t grow on trees, you know.) \nSo for each dollar we raise on Kickstarter, here's how our expenses break down: \n   I, David Pogue, am not the real force behind NOVA; I'm just the lucky slob who gets to host some of its specials! Here are the real brains of the operation, who will be joining us on this adventure:\nPaula S. Apsell is the Senior Executive Producer and Director of the WGBH Science Unit. She is a recipient of the Bradford Washburn Award, the Carl Sagan Award, the American Institute of Physics Andrew Gemant Award, and the Planetary Society\u2019s Cosmos Award, among many others.\nFAVORITE ELEMENT: Gold has two qualities that you might not think go together. It glitters and it\u2019s got substance. In that way, it\u2019s just like NOVA\u2013both entertaining and educational\u2014the gold standard of science programming!\nChris Schmidt is NOVA\u2019s Senior Producer and the Executive Producer for Beyond the Elements. He was Executive Producer, Writer, and Director on many other David Pogue films, including the Making Stuff series and Hunting the Elements.\nFAVORITE ELEMENT: At the moment, silicon (Si) is my favorite element because I find it to be sadly tragic. It\u2019s right below carbon on the periodic table, and it so wants to be able to do all the things carbon can do. But its bonds aren\u2019t quite as strong or flexible and it can\u2019t keep up with carbon\u2019s social life, moving easily between the air, the water and the earth. Still, it\u2019s got a great work ethic and it does its best. And even though we may never find alien life based on silicon, good old number 14 has given us plenty to be grateful for, like glass and computers! Thanks, silicon!\nPamela Rosenstein manages the development of multipart series and specials for NOVA and the WGBH Science Unit. She supervises the development pipeline of projects for foundation and government funding, overseeing concept development, fundraising strategies, proposal development, and stewardship of strategic partnerships.\nFAVORITE ELEMENT: Helium, because I find it amazing that something produced naturally through radioactive decay can make you squeak. But don\u2019t inhale too much; it is a finite resource, after all. \nTim De Chant is NOVA's senior digital editor and the founding editor of NOVA Next, NOVA's digital magazine. He is also in charge of NOVA's social media strategy. \nFAVORITE ELEMENT: Carbon is my favorite element because it can tell us an incredible amount about the natural world. In tree rings, carbon isotope ratios can also tell us if the conditions in which the tree is growing have changed over its lifetime!  \nRalph Bouquet is the Education and Outreach Manager at NOVA. Ralph helps make NOVA a valuable resource for educators through the production of digital resources like videos and web games, professional development opportunities, and collaboration with STEM education organizations. \nFAVORITE ELEMENT: Calcium, because it helps me rationalize my love for cheese.\nAllison Eck is NOVA\u2019s primary social media editor\u2014the voice of NOVA on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. She also writes for NOVA Next. She alternates between keeping her finger on the pulse of science news and interacting with our smart viewers and readers (i.e., YOU!). \nFAVORITE ELEMENT: Bismuth, because its crystals grow in a staircase-shaped formation that reminds me of an M.C.

This deck was designed by Dario Genuardi and myself with more than ONE year in the making. We are deeply in love with skateboarding and art. As a young magician who loves performing and spreading love, this skateboard deck is the quintessence of my life\u2019s goal. We\u2019ve put every possible detail of the deck into consideration and the outcome is a perfect combination of craftsmanship and art.\nMy intentions of creating this deck is to spread the positivity and inspiration I\u2019ve been lucky to receive from meeting new people in all areas of life but especially my friends in the skateboarding community and their beliefs of never surrendering to adversity and maintaining a positive outlook on life. I hope for anyone that receives this deck they\u2019ll be inspired to go against the rushed, exhausting lifestyle many adopt today and live a happy, relaxing life to do what they\u2019re passionate about and what they love.\n     Our vision is for it to suit the use of everyone from professional Magicians to Cardists to someone who has an appreciation for art. In order to accomplish our goals, we\u2019ve changed our designs of the back 20 times to reach perfection. The sky blue finish of the deck is to relay an easygoing attitude to the holder. Tiny designs that pay homage to skate culture and pop culture can be seen throughout the back of the cards with the screwdrivers and skulls that many skateboarders love. We\u2019ll leave it up to you guys to find more details for yourselves.\n    As a magician & Cardist I strongly believe that other than the design, quality & handling are the most important things for a deck. The Skateboard Playing Card is printed on the Finest quality card stock the United States Playing Card Company has to offer. The legendary Air Cushion Finish is also added to provide the smoothest experience of spreads, fans, and shuffles\n    Our court cards are based on people we\u2019ve met in real life. Their stories and their philosophies deeply influenced us and we wanted to share it with you guys. We\u2019ve taken their individualities and incorporated into the design of the court cards. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time personalizing the court cards in order to make them more humanized and realistic. We hope you\u2019ll be able to take away something from their relaxed and carefree lifestyle and just keep searching for the happiness in your life. Work Hard, Play Hard.\n                 Graffiti Jack; Mechanic Jack; Guitarist Jack; Rock & Roll Jack\n        Red wine loving Queen; Selfie Queen; Deep down romantic queen; Gopro Queen\nCarpenter King; Wacky gloves collector King; 3 year no shaving king, Photographer King\n    The Ace of Spades design is made up of half of the top and bottom of a skateboard. Eat, Sleep, Skate is the slogan of many skaters and the ultimate spirit of skateboarding.\nThe joker features a classic skater look embodying a laid back attitude that many people know and love. We want to create a unique joker that\u2019s an icon to the skate culture to spread our message of being care free and happy.\n     The box of the deck is designed to be as visually attractive as any art piece. The vibrant colors hints at the messages we want to spread. It perfectly exhibits the theme of the Skateboard Deck\n    We sincerely appreciate any amount or form of support from you and we want to give a little bonus as a token of gratitude for your support. We collaborated with 8 of the most talented people in the magic and cardistry community to bring you 4 card flourishes and 4 magic tricks that will blow your mind.

Thanks to everyone who has generously donated to the film. This was the bare minimum we needed to pull this off. Our new stretch goal is $25,000 -- this will allow us to attain things such as footage rights, additional b-roll, professional sound mix, dialogue cleanup.\n There's been a lot of discussion on the \"lack of female cinematographers\" and as a young female cinematographer, I wanted to respond. I attended UCLA's graduate school for cinematography and when graduation was approaching, I still only knew of a few women who were shooting big shows. I wanted to know more about how they got to where they were. \nThis feature documentary started out as my very ambitious UCLA thesis project that turned into a larger undertaking when I realized how many women there were to talk to -- and there are still so many beyond who is in the film. That's the point I've decided to make. \n\nThere are so many incredible women shooting, and I am so excited to have been able to put their stories in one piece: Women of Light.\n\nIn the media, we hear so much about how few women there are in the film industry:\nVARIETY   INDIEWIRE   THE NEW YORK TIMES   DEADLINE  \nTHE LA TIMES   THE TELEGRAPH\n\nIt's time we honor women in film. It's time to honor the women in cinematography, around the world, and inspire those of the future.\nJoin us in this movement -- whether you're filmmaker, a cinematographer, a lover of movies, a lover of art, a lover of stories. \nWe're ready to finish this film -- but we can't move forward without funds. Your contribution will help us with many things we need to complete it. Below is a breakdown of where the funds will go. Everything helps.\n Julia Swain // Director + Cinematographer Julia is a cinematographer who holds an MFA in Cinematography from the prestigious UCLA School of Theater, Film & Television. During her graduate study, Julia shot countless narrative films, including the feature Killing Animals by James Franco, was awarded multiple awards such as the Women in Film Foundation / Loreen Arbus Fellowship in Cinematography and shot the winning Sprite Films ad, which earned nationwide distribution on a multitude of platforms. The See You Soon (Michael Brun) music video Julia shot made MTV\u2019s #1 top new video summer of 2015. She has had other work air on networks such as VH1, ESPN, and Adult Swim. Julia has served as DP and 2nd Unit DP on multiple features, and continues to shoot on a variety of formats, consistently seeking to create compelling visuals for every story and brand.\nChelsi Johnston // Producer + Editor\nChelsi is a filmmaker from Honolulu, HI currently working towards an MFA in Directing/Production at UCLA\u2019s School of Theater, Film, and Television. After receiving her BA from Santa Clara University in Communication/Film, she worked on the production team for projections such as Godzilla (2015) and Hawaii Five-0. Most recently, she received the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Grant to work in post-production on The Invitation.\nAnnie Pace // Producer\nAnnie is currently getting her MFA in Directing at the UCLA School of Theater, Film & Television. She just completed her film Broken Pines lensed by Julia Swain, and the two are traveling to the Brazilian Amazon to shoot her next film. Before moving to Los Angeles, Annie previously worked on anthropological films in both Brazil and Mexico, and directed the music video entitled All For One for the Bluegrass/Hip-hop band Gangstagrass.\n\nTeodora Totoiu // Cinematographer\nTeodora is a Romanian-American Director of Photography based in Los Angeles, California.

Kangol is the world\u2019s most famous headwear brand and it\u2019s been worn by some of the world\u2019s most famous celebrities like Brad Pitt, Bill Murray, Eminem, Samuel L. Jackson, Gwen Stefani, Kid Rock, Madonna, Miley Cyrus, and others.  \nKangol is a brand that was born in Britain and grew up on the streets of New York and now we\u2019d like your help to bring another icon to the states and move as much as possible of the Kangol 504\u2019s manufacturing stateside with the Bollman Hat Company. \nWe\u2019re looking for your help us bring the historic machinery that has been used to make the Kangol 504 and other styles since the start of Kangol to the states and create new American jobs. \nBollman Hat Company is America's oldest hat maker.\nThe Bollman Hat Company is the oldest hat maker in America dating back to 1868. We are employee-owned and pay our employee-owners a living wage. In 2001, Bollman Hat Company acquired the global license to design, produce, and distribute Kangol headwear. By the time Bollman Hat Company had acquired the license, the decision had already been made by the previous ownership to move all the manufacturing to a factory in China which was created in the mid-1990s to stay competitive. The factory in China was purchased in 2006 by a Chinese hat maker who has now decided to exit due to rising labor costs in Southern China. Since acquiring the Kangol license, Bollman Hat Company made several Kangol straw, wool felt, and fur felt styles in their factory in Pennsylvania, but until now, did not make knitted and blocked hats which are the most iconic Kangol styles. \nThe 1932 staff of Bollman Hat Company.\nAbout The Kangol\u00ae 504\nThe Wool 504 is the iconic, original Kangol\u00ae Cap. First introduced in 1954, the 504 cap gets its name from the block number that it is made on. The 100% seamless wool cap is the ultimate cap for comfort and style and now for the first time ever Made In The USA.\nWhy Do We Need These Machines?\nOver the years there has been attempts to duplicate the machines unsuccessfully.  As our Design Director, Nic Harris, likes to point out this is very similar to the denim selvage machines that jean manufacturers replaced in the 80's.  The result was less of a quality product than what was produced with the older, slower machines.  We're not interested in faster machines that make an inferior product.  We want to keep the quality that has built Kangol and that our customers love.  \nThe manufacturing of the 504 requires special machinery which was built specifically for Kangol in the 1930\u2019s and 40\u2019s to create the knit of the 504. These are the same machines we are looking for your help to move today. These special machines were each customized to knit, link, tease, shear, and block the Kangol 504 style. Other styles will follow with sufficient funding. \nOne of the ten machines already brought to the US.\nWe have already moved 10 of the machines over to the U.S. and made the necessary electrical conversions for the equipment to work in the U.S., but there are another 70 machines yet to move. Altogether, the cost to move it will be over $650,000. Bollman Hat Company has invested more than $350,000 and in addition we\u2019ve already secured $60,000 from the Department of Community & Economic Development\u2019s Pennsylvania First Program grant, $82,000 in Job Creation Tax Credits, and $18,450 in Workforce and Economic Development Network of Pennsylvania helping to fund the skills training needed for our employee owners. The cost of making the Kangol product in the U.S. is estimated to be more than twice the cost of making it in China, but we eliminate the transportation costs to North America, achieve faster customer turnaround, and control our innovation. \nWhy Do We Want To Bring These Machines To America?\nAmerica became a world leader because of its manufacturing strength and the middle class built by this strength. Over the past 50 years America has lost its title of the world manufacturing leader with many of the jobs going overseas to China, India, and Bangladesh. That doesn\u2019t mean that great products can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be made here and Bollman Hat Company is a testament to that. Aside from being America\u2019s oldest hat maker and nearly 150 years old, Bollman Hat Company is also the founding member of American Made Matters, a community of US Makers with a focus on bringing attention to the importance of making and buying American products. Bollman Hat Company and American Made Matters believe that if it can be made here, it should be made here! The beloved Kangol 504 is the next piece in that puzzle.\nPLAY\n\nBringing the 504 and other Kangol styles' production to America will create dozens of new jobs for American workers while maintaining the current workforce and that can make a big impact.\nA Rewarding Campaign.\nWe've worked hard to come up with some great rewards for backers so not only do you get to feel good about where your money is going but you'll be able to show off your support too.  We've also created bundles so you can get almost any combination of rewards you'd like.\nSome of our rewards include:\nWe\u2019d like your help in strengthening America again and bringing jobs back to the U.S. Your help will be greatly appreciated and reinforce the tide of change to bring back Made In The U.S.A.\nSpecial thanks go to our friends Samuel L.

It's now available on Blu-ray and DVD.\nWith your help, I'll next be overseeing a full 4K restoration of the classic B-Movie \"The Atomic Brain\", also known as \"Monstrosity\", from the original 35mm camera negative.\nIn the process, we'll compile supplemental material about the circumstances of the film's creation, and create a documentary about its director, Joseph V. Mascelli, ASC, one of the most influential yet unknown cinematographers in film history.\nAbout The Director:\nA highly active member of the American Society of Cinematographers in his day, Mascelli learned his craft at a time when camera crew from the silent era were not only still alive, but still working: his collaborator on the second edition ASC Manual had shot 1914's The Perils of Pauline.\nMascelli himself began as a cinematographer in the Armed Forces, and would shoot countless miles of newsreel and training footage before moving into TV and Film. Due to the ephemeral and anonymous nature of much of his work, a true survey of his credits has never been made.\nHe would become best known for condensing the collective knowledge of his field into one concise, informative book, 1965's The 5 C's of Cinematography, that is still used to teach students the visual vocabulary of film. Mascelli's book makes the case for the democratization of film teaching, urges readers to push the boundaries of the rules (the sixth \"C\", he writes, is \"Cheating\") and fosters the easy discussion of what was once very specialized, even unspoken knowledge. It's still in print today, and could be considered his most enduring contribution to filmmaking.\nOur documentary will help paint a picture of Mascelli and the era in which he was working, an uneasy time when Corman and Cleopatra coexisted, a transitional decade that would give way to the \"New Hollywood\" of the 1970's. As one of the old guard looking to teach the new, how did Mascelli's educational work persist through the decades? In looking to the past, we might even find some good advice for the future.\nASC Manual: Second Edition, 1966\nAbout \"The Atomic Brain\":\nPromotional Still\nA year and change before The 5 C's of Cinematography was completed, Mascelli's name was conspicuously absent from the poster of Monstrosity. This B-Movie tells the story of Hetty March, a rich, somewhat vampiric old woman who conspires with a scientist to transfer her brain into a younger body through atomic fission. March employs three women in her mansion while she decides which one to kill and replace. Soon, a rejected candidate's brain is swapped with a cat's, causing her to eat a mouse and climb onto the roof.\nThroughout, two other failed experiments, a zombie woman and a Moreau-esque dog man, loom nearby as if refugees from another movie. The situation deteriorates until the mansion, as well as March's plans, are obliterated in a bright atomic blast.\nOriginal Poster\nMonstrosity, in fact, had been directed by Mascelli in 1958 until funding abruptly fell through. Hastily finished by its producers in 1963, sleazily advertised (see above), re-titled The Atomic Brain on dreary-looking 16mm prints, rarely presented in its intended widescreen aspect ratio, destined to land on Mystery Science Theater 3000, the film was never given much attention. Yet, despite all obstacles, Mascelli's original footage is directed and shot with a professionalism and a keen visual sense that stands out from the reshoots. Even in his one foiled attempt at directing a feature film, he proved that the principles he'd write about in \"The 5 C's\" did not discriminate based on budget.\nMonstrosity, AKA The Atomic Brain would be Mascelli's only directorial credit, and an incomplete one at that. But now, the original 35mm camera negative has been recovered, and with it comes a razor-sharp black and white image for both cult movie fans and students of cinematography to enjoy for the first time.\nPublic Domain Version\n4K Sample Scan, Full Aperture\nThe film's public domain status has long made it a staple of bargain bin DVDs, sourced from muddy VHS transfers that drop many low-key scenes into total darkness. It also has discouraged major distributors, who would never be able to fully own the results, from investing in a proper video transfer for the film. We, the public that own it, now have an opportunity to restore The Atomic Brain in full 4K resolution, and make this once-obscure \"Monstrosity\" available in a condition far better than it's ever been seen.\nIf we don't make it happen, no one will.\nHow Can I Help?\nDonate! Every dollar we raise will create a better restoration and a better documentary.\nSpread the word! Your words are important to us. If you can't donate, but still want to see The Atomic Brain brought back to life, make sure everyone- your friends, your family, and your social network- knows about this project and our goals. Share a link to this page with your endorsement on Facebook or Twitter. Not only will you help us restore the film, you'll encourage others to give the film the re-evaluation it needs.\nWhat Your Donation Will Cover\nSuccessful fundraising will support the following:\nFor the Restoration:\nScanning of the Original Camera Negative and Fine Grain Positive on a top-of-the-line archival film scanner into the DPX format in 4K resolution.\nDigitization of all audio from the Original Track Negative into 48khz uncompressed WAV Files.\nProfessional image restoration on PFClean and DRS\u2122 NOVA suites to correct countless occurrences of dirt, tears, irregularities and scratches in the film.\nRestoration and re-engineering of the soundtrack by an audio professional using iZotope, Protools, and other specialized hardware.\nHard drives and RAID for data capture, transportation, editing and backups. Working in 4k resolution means many terabytes of data and doubles of everything for backup.\nProfessional grading in a calibrated color correction suite. Even black and white films need this to ensure a consistent, accurate image across all video and theatrical formats\nLong term digital storage and migration of the restored film on LTO tape or equivalent.\nThe creation of a 4K DCP to allow modern digital projection. A must if we are to exhibit the film.\nThe creation of Blu-ray, DVD and UHD home video masters, ensuring that backers get the best possible quality in their choice of format.\nFor the Documentary:\nOffset the cost of travel and lodging in creating the documentary.\nHard drives and camera memory cards for data capture, transportation, editing and backups.\nThe employment of crew during filming and postproduction.\nRental of lighting, grip and sound equipment for interviews.\nLegal Fees to ensure rights and clearances relating to people, organizations and publications are all honored in the making of the restoration and documentary.\nIf We Exceed Our Goal\nOur initial goal of $16,000 is the minimum to ensure that the restoration of the film is finished and incentives are delivered. Donations well beyond that amount will allow for a dramatic increase in quality.\nMany more hours of cleanup on the film, for a truly flawless sound and image.\nMore personnel employed for image and sound restoration.\nAccess to better post-production tools and more extensive quality control.\nA stronger budget for the documentary, enabling further travel, interviews, and equipment rental.\nExtra crew hired on location and in postproduction during the creation of the documentary.\nProfessionally replicated dual layer Blu-ray discs with added, open-matte version of The Atomic Brain.\nA new 35mm theatrical print, struck from the negative, for preservation and exhibition.\nExclusive DVD, Blu-ray & UHD\nWe're self-distributing this film for the duration of the project. This means several things:\nA quicker turnaround. Backers, no matter where they are, need not wait for contract negotiations, retail scheduling, or press releases before they can receive their copies of the film.\nVersatility. We can deliver the film to some backers in a 4K resolution file, suitable for viewing on UHD Televisions and monitors, before distributors have put a reliable 4K system into practice. We have the freedom to change this delivery method if new distribution standards arrive before we're done.\nBacker Exclusives. As of now, there are no plans to distribute \"The Atomic Brain\" on physical media beyond this campaign. Whether this changes or not depends on demand- which, for such a niche title, is never a given. Backers could be the only ones with access to physical copies.\nTransparency. I'll be in the loop at every step, and so will you. No non-disclosable information, and no need to get your information from another source.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur last film restoration, of \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\", saw a substantial number of risks and challenges realized. At the center was a prolonged attack on the film's long standing public domain status from two outside parties. A great deal of time and effort was required to address that threat, but nearly every one of our backers stuck with us throughout. Their patience was rewarded with the best home video package possible and, I hope, the knowledge that their trust was well placed.\n\nThe restoration of The Atomic Brain begins with us in a far more advantageous position. With the recovery of the original 35mm camera negatives, as well as recent advancements in technology, the 4K restoration of this title can be completed faster and at less expense than was possible only a few years ago. \n\nWe are also going into our project with substantial copyright research strengthening the film's public domain status, and an intellectual property lawyer employed for the duration of the project. We are prepared, then, for any legal challenge, and this will also help us keep the entire restoration process transparent.\n\nBoth for the confidence of new backers and as a reward for repeat backers, I am placing a personal guarantee on the timely delivery of all media incentives. Should we meet our fundraising goal, incentives will be sent to backers between their original ETA of October 2016 and no later than December 31st of 2016. If this deadline is missed, then refunds on backer levels of $50 or greater (minus the Kickstarter / Paypal fees) will come from my own pocket.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "\"Hamlet\" Download and \"Monstrosity\" Discs Available!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Digital Downloads Begin, All Packages Out", "update_content": "Hi All,\nJust a quick note- a link to the digital version of Monstrosity will arrive in your inbox this week, with many of you likely seeing links already.\nThe personalized link will enable you to view and download at resolutions up to UHD through Vimeo Pro, as well as save the title on your Vimeo account for easy access.

To streamline this process, we are highlighting below the important ones, such as shipping discounts and add-ons that became available. \nUpdate#7, 5/13/2015: Added a new reward level, the Rare Bird #2\nUpdate #2, 4/11/2015: Announcing a stretch goal, and open design call for surfboard design.\nUpdate #3, 4/18/2015: Announced reduced shipping for multiple rewards selection\n___________________________________________________________________________\nWe're back on Kickstarter, where it all started. One and a half years ago you, our backers, supported our vision to make the most awesome wood car toys out there and willed Candylab Toys into existence. \nWe continue to nurture an idea and the conviction that children\u2019s toys can be awesome and enjoyed by all age groups. We took our love of classic cars, woodworking and mid-century nostalgia and made a big fat sandwich of engineering, design, manufacturing logistics, branding and some common sense retail strategy. The resulting mash-up struck a chord with a bunch of folks presumably fed up with piles of plastic toys and who appreciated a clean, simple and durable wooden design object backed by a strong aesthetic \u2013 vintage cars and throwback toys. The Kickstarter campaign we launched to materialize our designs went on to prove that other people also liked solid wood toy cars inspired by mid-century design and American muscle cars painted in bright colors with smooth rolling rubber tires. Who knew - but we were happy to see a lot of appreciation from folks across the world, and thumbs up from outlets big and small.\n The success of the campaign kicked our start-up into high gear. We scrapped our original plans to make a few hundred by ourselves, dusted off our initially far-fetched dream of placing a real factory order and the rest was history. Numerous late nights later, the last car was sent to our backers, stamped, checked, and packed. \nAnd we\u2019re now finally ready with our follow-up act. And as before, without your help none of these new designs will come to life, at least not in the near future. We\u2019ve learned a ton of lessons since our last campaign, smoothed out production and logistics and we\u2019re eager to put all this experience to work.\nWe have a whole lot of excitement lined up: no less than 5 new completely distinct styles! It\u2019s ambitious, but we\u2019ve been thinking hard about creating a real universe here, so this time will be about adding vehicle types. \n The last campaign hinted at a tow truck which got a tons of thumbs up. Check. But how about a classic wagon \u2013 wood paneled, or an iconic taxi? Check and check. Next, we wanted to try something fresh in a new design language, so a roundy camper trailer to go with a wood paneled angular wagon seemed like a good idea. And since it all started with the quintessential racer, we\u2019re staying close to our tradition: a new racer in powder blue is on its way. \n We\u2019re going to share with you our process and plans through the campaign updates, so we can keep the wordy part to a minimum. Let\u2019s move on to the eye candy please.\n  Here she is folks. Took us a looong time, and many a sweaty brows to do this. And we're not talking about designing, refining, designing some more, prototyping etc. We're talking about committing to a manufacturing approach, which is no small feat. US-made, numbered and signed, here she is.\nShown alongside its older cousin from the previous campaign\n Our pledge to you here and now: get this old girl and you'll have a collector item; we will not produce this particular combination of shapes and colors ever again, Kickstarter-only forever. You'll have a unique, limited edition collector item - it goes in the Vault after this Kickstarter campaign. Disclaimer: We may slightly, infinitesimally tweak the design during production - or as a result of your feedback. And we started late on this one , so we may ship in October. We have custom tooling to make, jigs to design and a painting rig to build. Please bear with us.  \nMaterial: Solid Beech Wood, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. Black ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 7.2\"L x 2.8\"W x 1.95\"H (18.3cm L x 7.3cm W x 5cm H) Weight: 9oz / 255g\nNo surprises here - we've unveiled it in our last campaign, but this is a complex one: 5 different wood parts, numerous wood cuts, tight tolerances, new wheels and tires to develop. We\u2019re hoping you\u2019ll enjoy the playtime: towing another toy car with a rubber band-equipped tow truck makes for hours of imaginative play. Lastly, before you ask: all new production runs of our previous models (except Police and Firechief) will come with the towing pin on their bellies and so will the three new ones in this campaign. Tow away to your heart\u2019s content.\nPLAY\n\nMaterial: Solid Beech Wood, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. White ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 6.8\"L x 3.8\"W x 2.95\"H (17.3cm L x 9.6cm W x 7.5cm H) Weight: 11oz / 310g (without packaging)\nAffectionately dubbed \u201cCandycab\u201d, this is a typical late 60\u2019s slab sedan. No cityscape or street play scene is complete without it. Also our lowest cost champ, we\u2019d hope for this to become a staple of any playset. Tiny luggage not included.\n Material: Solid Beech Wood, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. White ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 7.2\"L x 2.8\"W x 1.95\"H (18.3cm L x 7.3cm W x 5cm H) Weight: 9oz / 255g\nPLAY\n\nThe missing color in our lineup, this represents a refinement of the lessons learned so far. Black rims, the fastback roofline, and the powder blue / orange livery make it pretty striking. With belly towpin and black front grille, we think it will challenge the GT10 for supremacy and popularity.\nMaterial: Solid Beech Wood, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. Black ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 7.2\"L x 2.8\"W x 1.95\"H (18.3cm L x 7.3cm W x 5cm H) Weight: 9oz / 255g\nWe've had this one on the boards for a long time, but only now have we mastered its complexity. Aside from the tricky woodwork required to cut the taillights, it has a magnetic tow hitch under its belly. Then we added a roof magnet: the obvious way to snap a surfboard, which also gets a magnet in it. One surfboard included in this reward. \n All the embedded magnets are installed from the inside of the car, before assembling the cabin - there is no chance of them becoming loose. \n As an added bonus, it has actual walnut microveneer applied to its sides.  Nothing but the best, real stuff for our toys. Now go on and reenact that cross country surf trip.\nMaterial: Solid Beech Wood, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. White ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 7.2\"L x 2.8\"W x 1.95\"H (18.3cm L x 7.3cm W x 5cm H) Weight: 9.5oz / 270g\nThis particular object took some serious brain cycles in our lab. It needs to be lightweight, it has a completely different design language and represents our bet on bridging different looks in our growing garage. Perfectly rounding it off, or engineering the hitch are not the easiest thing we did either. A handful, but boy, are we happy. \nPLAY\n\nMaterial: Wood body, water based paint and clear polyurethane coat. White ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. Dimensions: 6\"L x 3\"W x 2.75\"H (15.24cm L x 7.6cm W x 7cm H) \n Sturdy, simple, durable, and fast.  Now that opens up the kind of playtime that's in danger of getting lost these days.  Use your imagination, fill in the blanks, and enjoy some reenactments that get the kiddos interested in an era long gone. And maybe they learn a thing or two about big block engines, weight distribution and rear drive axles. \nPLAY\n\nIt's a straightforward formula: take solid block of beech, cut block of beech, paint it, add wheels. We use real solid wood, real metal pins, and real rubber tires. No compromises. \nWho said they don't make'em like they used to?  \nBut the devil is in the details as they say:  smart color decisions, carefully engineered tooling to achieve the correct cuts at just the right angle and proportions, a painstakingly slow and manual painting process, and final assembly and installation of our custom designed wheels, pins and rubber tires.  A 2-ton press is responsible for fitting the pins, each an individual axle by itself.  All this is the culmination of almost 2 years of development, design, prototyping and preproduction testing. We're proud of our toys and ready to get them in your hands. \nEssentially all of the above, broken down on the right, and further explained below. If you still have questions, don't fret;  if you'd like specific iterations and multiples, or combinations not available in the rewards tier, you have the option to fine tune your pledge after the campaign ends during  the survey process. See more detailed explanations in the FAQ section or drop us a line. \nAll shipping costs are additional and vary according to pledge level and destination. Amount will be charged at checkout.  There are 4 shipping tiers: domestic USA shipping, Canada, EU, and rest of the world.  Customs fees or local sales taxes may, and will sometimes apply.  Check our FAQ for info. \nEvery single car coming out of this campaign will will bear a Kickstarter-only stamp, cementing your backer bragging rights.  \nSpecially packaged Towie and Blu74.  The two retail boxes are wrapped with a custom printed sleeve marking the Kickstarter-only availability of this awesome set.  Includes a set of 4 spare tires, standard 20mm size. \n Inseparable items, these.  Included:  Woodie, Camper, and two surfboards. \nA nice slider gift box for this perfect pair.  It includes two surfboards and a spare set of two tires. Box is sealed with a green Kickstarter sticker to prove the visionary backer chops to amazed friends and family. \nAll the cars and the reward bundles in this campaign, each set handsigned and with a nice big Kickstarter stamp. Total and ultimate bragging rights, plus a notch down from future retail pricing. Includes the Candycab, Blu74, Towie, Woodie, the Camper, a set of extra tires and two surfboards!\n*Palm Tree not included\n If none of the above speak strongly to you, you can still get a little reminder of our values to hang on your (ferrous) fridge.  We are packing a set of 3 cute mini surfboards, each with a magnet inside to go on the Woodie, your fridge, or any other magnetic or ferrous your heart desires.  Made from real wood, water painted and appropriately shaped. Final design and colors may be slightly tweaked from the depiction below. \nSo there you have it folks, this is our new lineup. We\u2019ve spent the last year working to develop sales, keeping production on track and designing new toys.  All of this takes hard work and funding.  And what makes sense to us is that we keep designing and building toys, and we keep our ear close to the ground, within the community who understood us, took a chance on us and ultimately propelled us into existence.  We promise to keep going if you want us to. \n If you believe in what we\u2019re doing here, please lend a hand to turn these into reality and keep us moving forward \u2013 help fund this project. \nFrom all of us here at Candylab toys, we thank you!

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHaving successfully completed fulfillment for our previous campaign, we've learned quite a few things. We hit up against two bottlenecks - fulfillment logistics and quality control- and we took steps to address both. On the production side the flow is now well established, having put our supplier through their paces, and our white-gloved (literally, not metaphorically) quality inspection team has been inspecting each and every car in our subsequent orders. Wheels, pins, tires and packaging stock production are now just an email away. The Woodie and Blu are already pre-produced in enough quantities, and are similar enough to styles we've made enough of to give us assurance that there won't be any surprises there. \n\nThe fulfillment is fully buttoned up now. We hired a local warehouse provider in Pennsylvania in September of last year - unfortunately after the painful effort of the first campaign- and they have been great to work with. They are in charge of our current fledgling wholesale operation and it's been smooth sailing. Least of our worries. \n\nThat being said, we can still encounter headwinds in unexpected places. The Camper employs a novel approach for us and while we've prototyped it and confidently established that it can be produced, there can always be unexpected setbacks. Global shipping also has a way of delivering surprises (see what I did there), from port of entry strikes to customs delays. \n\nNo one wants to spend the next half year struggling with fulfillment and you get Update #168 still explaining delays.

And that's not even to mention the Icelandic glossary, and pronunciation guide!\nIf I can print a bigger run, I can sell the whole thing for a much more reasonable price!\nThere are backer rewards for a wide range of donation levels, such as a pdf of the book, a physical copy, a signed and sketched in book, and even a custom illustration or comic on a subject of your choice, if you\u2019re willing to pitch in the big bucks!\nThank you so much for checking out my kickstarter, and for any support you can provide.\n1. Some nice things cool people have said about my comic\n\u201cLonnie Mann carefully parses out the wonders and pitfalls of Icelandic tourism with charming personality and enthusiastic artwork. The result is a lovely and entertaining read; his love of the trip is infectious, and his voice is adorable.\u201d\n\u2014Lucy Knisley, Creator of Age of License, Relish, and French Milk\n\u201cA terrific comic travelogue... It made me feel as if I actually visited a place I\u2019ve never been to, one I now want to \u201creturn\u201d to soon. Fantastic colors, too.\u201d\n\u2014Brian K.

Art Prints Pack\nThe two art prints which come in the art prints pack are each lovely 11x17 prints, and look like this:\n3. Those original watercolors\nAt the $200 backer reward level, you'll receive an original watecolor piece. What are those? The latter part of the book is a collection of watercolors and related stories about my second trip to Iceland. There are a bunch of them, so they range from people, to landscapes, to interior shots, etc. Backers at this level will receive a survey to choose their preferred categories, and will receive a randomly chosen piece of the type they selected. They vary in size and are sent as-is, so framing and mounting options are up to you once you receive it.\n4. Animation\nSpecial thanks to Ryan Gatts for animating the video above.

Let's talk stretch goals.\nAt $3,500 (reached!): Everyone receiving a physical reward ($20+) will also receive a set of 3 bookmarks. Here are the designs:\nAt $4,000 (reached!): Everyone receiving physical rewards will get another 3 bookmarks, for a total of 6! Here are the designs:\nAt $5,000 (reached!): The book covers will be printed with fancy spot gloss! This means parts of the design will be shiny and smooth, adding a small bit of dimensionality, and extra texture.\nAt $6,000: If, by some cosmic miracle, we reach $6k by the end of the campaign - less than 24 hours from the time of this update - I will create a new short comic (about 5-10 pages, probably) about my recent 3rd trip to Iceland for Design March in Reykjav\u00edk.

We\u2019re best known for our albums 3 Feet High and Rising, De La Soul Is Dead, Stakes Is High and many others. Some of our hit singles include \"Me Myself and I,\" \"Saturdays\" and \"Feel Good Inc.\" a collaboration with Gorillaz.\nWe\u2019ve collaborated with everyone from Chaka Khan to Common to even NASA: In 2004, our song \"Potholes in My Lawn,\" became one of the first rap records to be beamed from another planet by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity. Now we are here to collaborate with YOU, humanoid, on the most exciting project we\u2019ve ever done.\nFor the last decade, we've been independent artists, free of a record label interfering in our creative process. This will be our first De La Soul studio album in eleven years. We\u2019re excited and ready to create. It's been essential that we find ways to fund, record and release new music. Typically the fans have been the ones who support and appreciate our vision, so using Kickstarter and giving our fans the opportunity to be a part of the process just feels right. We see Kickstarter as a home for creative minds and a wonderful platform; where people who believe, respect and see the vision, can support an idea and make it a reality.\nTrue to our Hip-Hop roots, we make music without limits. This new album will incorporate elements of Jazz, Funk, Rock, Country Western and anything else we're feeling in the moment. To us, music is the influence of sounds, sounds in all vibrations and sizes, telling a story or pointing a direction. Some of these sounds we call samples, samples we use to make songs.\nS-950 & SP 1200 Samplers\nSampling is basically copying a piece of sound, from one recording, and reusing it to create a new recording. It is how De La has always made music. The sampler is our instrument, but people who copy, and in this case \"sample,\" have also been considered thieves and unoriginal. So, unfortunately a huge part of our career has also been spent fighting off the \u201csample police.\u201d\nEnough of those battles! For the new album, we needed a completely new approach, something Hip-Hop hasn\u2019t done before. So, here it is: For the first time, we're going to sample ourselves.\nVox Studios, Los Angeles, CA\nOver the last three years, we've collaborated with some of LA's finest studio musicians and recorded them in free-styled, unrehearsed, jam sessions. They played everything from banjo to upright bass, sometimes up to a dozen musicians at once; simply allowing sounds to integrate. We did 90% of these recordings in one of LA's most classic studios, Vox. We chose Vox because we wanted our recordings to have that creamy analog warm mixing board sound that the old records our parent\u2019s once played had. With over 200 hours of sounds, and vibes, equal to about 250 to 300 full-length vinyl LPs, it's time that we get to the work.\nHere\u2019s the interesting part. We are now in the process of going back to that 200+ hours of music, listening, enjoying and discovering those special moments where, musically, something magical happens, where interesting sounds and layers were forgotten, where new sounds can be sampled, looped, chopped, filtered and arranged, freely, without the intrusive presence of publishing politics and the infamous \u201csample police.\u201d What we've done is created our own crates of records; album upon albums to mine and sample from. In our world, what we\u2019ve created is freedom, freedom to make the art you believe in without having to compromise your vision. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always wanted most, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always believed in, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve fought for, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this Kickstarter with you.\nWe have a fantastic cast of artist we're collaborating with. So far Damon Albarn (of Blur/Gorillaz), 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, and David Byrne (of Talking Heads) have blessed us with their talents; and we\u2019ll have more announcements of collabs to come, right here on Kickstarter.\nClockwise: Damon Albarn, 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, David Bryne\nWe\u2019re crowdfunding it to help pay for recording, mixing, marketing, and everything else. Your support will keep us in the studio, help us continue to sample and manipulate the music we\u2019ve recorded, will help us get additional production work done; and will help us design, package, market, and distribute the album. The whole thing. We literally cannot do it without you.\nSo now, for the goodies\u2026 For your support we\u2019d like to offer you some cool rewards. Let\u2019s start with our Kickstarter only, 1GB De La Soul thumb drives uploaded with the new album. We have a limited amount of our 2015, out of stock De La Dunks by NIKE, autographed by us, for you. How about a De La Dinner Date?

His early stage name \u201cTrugoy\u201d is an inversion of his favorite food, yogurt.\nVincent Mason was born in Brooklyn, New York.

Check out these exclusive new opportunities.\nWhat Amazing Press! We've Been Featured In:\nWhat is Back in Time?\nPut simply, it's the ultimate documentary related to the Back to the Future trilogy. It's a film that digs deep into what these movies have meant to our culture. It's not a simple \u201cmaking of\u201d documentary, but rather one which explores the incredible, lasting resonance of the trilogy through the eyes of cast members and crew of the films, as well as some of the ultimate fans of the trilogy.\nPlus, the DeLorean Time Machine itself, of course.\nIt's a film that we think was begging to be made, so we did. All signs point to that being a great idea. After all, at this year's Academy Awards there were multiple references made to Back to the Future. 2015 marks the 30th anniversary of Back to the Future, and it's also the year Marty, Doc, and Jennifer visited in Back to the Future II.\nDidn't you do this before? It sounds familiar.\nYes! You may have seen or backed our previous Kickstarter campaign back in the summer of 2013. We were fortunate enough to enjoy widespread support from over 600 Back to the Future fans, and we've used the money raised during that campaign to fund filming the majority of the film.\nAnd on that note, we want to make sure we're very clear: every single pledge from the original campaign is still on track for delivery later this year, as promised. Nothing about this second campaign changes the original rewards, so if you're a backer already: THANK YOU, and you'll be receiving fulfillment this fall.\nWait, if you're already funded, what's this campaign for?\nBack in Time originated as this little idea after doing a customized \u201cflashback\u201d film for a client. Originally we were going to focus on a single, iconic part of the trilogy: the Time Machine. But as sometimes happens with an idea that has found its moment, Back in Time has grown in scope as we've progressed through production.\nThings we originally considered unlikely, or even impossible, have been captured by our crew as we've crisscrossed the country, and the world. If you'd told us that Michael J. Fox or Robert Zemeckis would have been willing to, let alone incredibly enthusiastic about, sitting down to talk about what the trilogy has meant across three decades, we'd have thought you were as looney as most of Hill Valley considered Doc Brown.\nBut we have those interviews in the can, and that's not all. Not by a long stretch. Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Bob Gale, Dean Cundey, Kevin Pike, and so many more cast and crew have lent their time to our efforts to chronicle the impact of the films. Plus some of the most amazing fans any movies have ever been blessed with, including Time Machine experts like Joe Walser; the Hendersons, who are responsible for bringing us hoverboards by 2015; and the Hollers, whose support for the Michael J. Fox foundation brings new perspective to what dedication a fandom can spawn.\nSo as much as we've carefully expended the money we collected during our previous campaign (and money from other, more traditional sources\u2014including our own pockets when we needed to) the sheer scale of the film as it stands today is far beyond our original dreams.\nThe side effect of our amazing good fortune is that we've exhausted the funds from the original campaign, while there are a number of things we can still use funding for in advance of the premiere this fall.\nBut this isn't just an opportunity for us, of course. This Kickstarter campaign offers new backers the chance to pledge for their perks, and allows returning backers to add to their previous commitments. We've also got some limited perks that are new to this campaign, and are offering up one last chance for you to get involved\u2014really involved\u2014with Back in Time before we release it into the wild.\nIn the end, this is a film which is for the fans of the films to salute the incredible, lasting impact they've had.\nA large number of the cast and crew of the trilogy, plus a bunch of people who have found themselves caught up by the films and had their lives changed profoundly as a result. But maybe you'd like to take a gander at these partial lists?\nRobert Zemeckis, Michael J. Fox, Bob Gale, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Dean Cundey, Alan Silvestri, Claudia Wells, James Tolkan, Donald Fullilove, Jeffrey Weissman, Kevin Pike, Michael Scheffe, and Andrew Probert are some of the trilogy's cast and crew we've interviewed.\nMJF Foundation fundraisers Terry and Oliver Holler, restorationist Joe Walser, collectors Bill & Patrick Shea, webmaster Stephen Clark, author and historian Rob Klein, hoverboard entrepreneurs Jill & Greg Henderson, Secret Cinema director Fabien Rigall, author Rich Handley, Superfan and Community creator Dan Harmon, and our own co-executive producer and The Goldbergs creator Adam F. Goldberg, are some of the fans who have taken the time to speak with us about how the Back to the Future trilogy has affected them.\nAnd have we mentioned that we have the DeLorean Time Machine on film? We have a few of them, actually. (Plus Marty's truck. And the clock tower. And so much other stuff.)\nAs you can see in our list of rewards, we've compiled quite an extensive list of unique rewards for those who choose to donate to this film.

He has interviewed and worked alongside personalities from all corners of the industry\u2014star athletes, team owners, pundits, analysts, and more. In addition to this heavy focus on documentary filmmaking, Jason has an extensive background in directing commercials for a wide range of companies. Jason\u2019s passion for the medium can be traced way Back in Time, to when he made a line-by-line tape recording of a certain iconic film. He\u2019s the original driving force behind this film project, and his commitment to the integrity of the documentary\u2019s material is second to none.\nLouis Krubich \u2014 Executive Producer\nA production company veteran with a long resume headlined by an extensive stint at MTV Networks, Louis leveraged his extensive knowledge of the industry into success as one of the principals at Hoboken-based Malka Media Group, a 2011 startup. His production work at MMG routinely brings him into contact with diverse clientele. Louis has worked with star clients including Adam Sandler, Michael Cera, Cameron Diaz, and Tom Cruise; as well as with major brands, corporations, charities and educational entities such as Ray-Ban, ESPN, the Embrace Kids Foundation, and New York University. Louis\u2019s Viacom past includes work creating impactful promotional content for major film releases\u2014an experience he intends to rely on to ensure the release of Back in Time is everything it can be.\nLee Leshen \u2014 Producer\nLee got his start in the industry doing finance and marketing work at Miramax Films and The Weinstein Company. Having cut his teeth with these major players, he founded Patchwork Media in the mid-00\u2019s. A facilitator at heart, Lee brings a vast array of experience in developing mutually beneficial arrangements to the table. His company\u2019s focus on finding ways for branded entertainment and media outlets to benefit from forging partnerships (and admittedly massive BttF fanboy status) paved the way for Lee signing on with Patchwork Media to serve as a production company for Back in Time. A problem-solver with an unconventional outlook, Lee\u2019s input has proven invaluable to the project ever since, and his marketing experience is about to be put to seriously good use.\nAdam F. Goldberg \u2014 Co-Executive Producer\nAdam is a producer/writer best known for his television work. He created and ran the hijinks-heavy Breaking In for two seasons on Fox, then followed up with The Goldbergs, the critically-acclaimed comedy not-so-loosely based on his own experiences growing up which once had an amusing, if less-than-clean, working title. With the series set to enter its third season in 2015, Adam is busy working non-stop on multiple new projects, including Back in Time. Adam\u2019s extensive resume includes screenplay credits for Fanboys, The Jetsons, Aliens in the Attic, The Muppet Wizard of Oz, and How to Train Your Dragon, as well as the upcoming films Flat Stanley and The Berenstain Bears. In addition to being the force behind two comedy series success stories, Adam has written for many other TV shows, including Community, Aliens in America, and Voltron Force\nGregory Lassik \u2014 Cinematographer\nGregory is the owner/operator of two production companies: Spark + Boom, and Endless Wave Studios. He brings extensive experience with documentary and commercial filming to the project, along with an incredible heart. Gregory\u2019s attention to always doing the right thing locks right in with his desire to, well, blow things up. His vision is influenced by this purity of purpose and he thrives on creating modern, electric cinema. His dedication to capturing the essence of the cultural phenomenon that BttF has become is expressed through what\u2019s at the center of the Back in Time project: the raw footage we shoot.\nThe Rest of Our Team\nAs the scope of this project has grown, so has our team.  To see a full list of our crew visit our website here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFortunately we've managed to complete the vast majority of filming on the documentary already. Barring some kind of \u201cAct of God\u201d we're going to premiere Back in Time as planned this fall in Los Angeles\u2014during the 30th anniversary celebrations for Back to the Future known as We're Going Back. \n\nThe biggest risk of not making our campaign goal is that we'll be unable to screen Back in Time at as many film festivals as we'd like to, and that will mean less people get to see and hear about what we've put together. Failure to fund might also have a slight impact on how much better the final film could be, but considering what we have now vastly exceeds our wildest dreams for what this project was ever going to turn into, that's nowhere near a disaster. At this point we're adding little pieces to something already amazing, not working to get something presentable.\n\nIf we do end up failing to fund, we'll still be aggressively pursuing other avenues for trying to get together the funding to improve on what we have and to get more exposure. But to be honest, we believe in our film, we believe in the fans of the back to the Future trilogy, and we believe that a movie born of the passion we all share can't help but attract enough attention to succeed.\n\nLong story short: pledging has pretty much near zero downside. Back in Time is set to be a phenomenal documentary which really gets to the heart of the immense cultural significance of the trilogy, and it will be ready for backers to enjoy in October of 2015.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Full Video of the Shea's BTTF Collection Livestream!", "update_content": "That's right, the wait is almost over!

If you\u2019re not pleased with the result, you can simply click refresh and see a new design for your tweet.\nEvery design is based on the monospace grid system that adapts to fit different tweets.\nEach top level design comes in a wide variety of combinations of color, typefaces and graphics.\nWe want every print to be unique. Any given tweet can only be purchased once for every design combination. This means it's not possible for anyone else to own the same print as you, ensuring complete originality. At launch we will feature 15 different artists with 50 original designs and over 5000 possible design outcomes. And that\u2019s just the beginning!\nPeter and Louise discussing designs.\nTo celebrate the Kickstarter campaign, our Art Director Albin Holmqvist has made a one-of-a-kind, limited-edition print design for Kickstarter backers only. This is a \"once in a life print\" opportunity!\nThree of the many possible outcomes of our Kickstarter exclusive design\nDeveloping the site we have been focusing on three main principles. The first: to allow for a wide variety of design implementations. We don\u2019t want artists to be limited by the system, but rather make a system that can scale and adapt to their vision. We believe this is the only way to create something that has a real artistic value, rather than a computer-generated feel.\nSecond, we ensure that each design combination looks its best by linking certain fonts, colors and images together. This requires a close collaboration between the artist and the developer in constructing a specific framework around each design.\nSome very early wireframes of the print presentation page.\nThird, it has to be simple to find that perfect tweet from the 500 million tweets added each day. To solve this problem we are developing our own ranking system that takes both content and visual value into consideration to find something personal that looks great on your wall.\nOnce created, each print is presented in an environment matching the design\nSome of the lines of code responsible for it all.\nQuality is everything. We take great pride in the quality of our work. All of our prints are high quality gicl\u00e9e and the 300 gr/m2 untreated natural paper stock has a lovely tactile feel and works beautifully either framed or unframed. We inspect and hand-emboss every print that leaves our shop. We provide handwritten signatures from the artist, pack all the prints in silk paper and use a sturdy cardboard tube to ensure a safe delivery worldwide. All in all, we treat your art with the respect it deserves.\nEvery print is numbered in our endless number series\nWe've put together a list of nice rewards for all our awesome backers. Each and every contribution is extremely appreciated! \n       Uniqueness - of your words and of the prints - is at the heart of Onehundredforty. So when it comes to frames, we didn't want to go with an off-the-shelf solution. That\u2019s why we teamed up with Well Made, a great frame maker and fellow Kickstarter offspring.\n\nThe folks at Well Made have created STiiCKs, a really smart framing solution, sourced and made in the U.S. It consists of two wooden bars that hold your print in place through strong magnets. STiiCKs are available in oak, walnut, black or white (images show \u201coak\u201d), so you can pick the set that fits your home the best.\nBack Onehundredforty and get a tote bag with this awesome tweet from Kat Dennings.\nWe\u2019re a friendly group of creatives from Stockholm, Sweden, who got tired of seeing the same mass-produced art prints and posters cluttering the walls of homes and public spaces. So we decided to do something about it.\nAt our agency we have a tradition where we make personal prints for those who move on to new adventures as something to remember us by.\nWe truly miss both Arnaud and Elin, but look at their awesome prints!\nA year ago we started thinking, what if we could recreate that experience for people everywhere? What if we could make art prints that not only look beautiful from a far, have a personal and \u201creadable\u201d story to tell when you get up close? Two years later, we are proud to present Onehundredforty.\nBy day we work as a creative agency to make smart campaigns and projects for brands around the world. By night we dream of being free artists - without briefs, budgets or conference calls. We\u2019re an agile, dynamic group of designers, programmers, film-makers, strategists, PR-people, animators and project managers that have the skills and know-how to turn this idea into reality.\nWe want Onehundredforty to become more than just our private design playground. So we\u2019ve built an open system to allow contributions from artists, designers, font factories and photographers from all over the world. Our in-house staff curate the collection to ensure consistent design integrity. Together we aim to make this a living organism, a constantly evolving gallery of designs and memorable words.\nSome artists currently working with us:\nMichael Smith\nRedouane Oumahi\nHigino Rodriguez\nAdriana Bellet\nMalika Favre\nCecilia Schr\u00f6der\nMiki Stefanoski\nMaria Gr\u00f6nlund\nAnna Sundvall\nSatsuki Shibuya\nMagdalena Czarnecki\nPaula Maso\nCecilia B\u00f6rjesson\nGema Navarro\nThis is an art experiment. We don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to end. It\u2019s not going to be the new Facebook (we\u2019re pretty sure). So designers will probably have to wait awhile before quitting their day jobs. Our payment system ensures fair compensation to all contributors to Onehundredforty. We also have a whole section on the site celebrating the designers and font factories we collaborate with. This is truly a collective effort.\nWe want Onehundredforty to be affordable. Our fixed price of $55 per print covers the artist\u2019s fee, all production costs, packaging and international shipping!\nWe\u2019ve come a long way, but we need your help. Help us spread the word, get artists on board and expand our printing studio (right now we print on one printer in the corner of our office). So please pledge - and don\u2019t forget to share the project with your friends, family and Twitter acquaintances!\n         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBelow are some of the challenges we\u2019re facing. We\u2019ve listed them to help give you better understanding of what your pledge money will be used for (we promise it\u2019s not too technical).\n\n1. Development of the algorithm\nThe development of the algorithm that creates the prints based on your tweet is up and running. However, we are still adding functionality and new designs to the site that may require adjustments and/or modifications to the system. In other words, lots of additional working hours for our developers.\n\n2. Timely shipping of the Kickstarter prints\nWe\u2019re currently managing all the printing and shipping in-house. Thus, resources for printing and packaging are limited. If we receive a tremendous amount of demand, we\u2019ll engage an external print service of comparable quality to ensure timely delivery.\n\n3. Implementation of new designs\nEvery new design needs to be manually implemented into our system in order to ensure scalability. This takes some time and not all submitted designs will work. This can affect the number of available designs upon launch of Onehundredforty. However, we are refining our briefing document for designers and working closely with them to make sure that all designs can be submitted successfully.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "All backers invited!", "update_content": "Hello early number backers,\nby 5pm CET tomorrow Wednesday we will email you your invitational codes.

This wonderful, deluxe version of the game will include the spectacular new characters developed for the very special version of the game played in Indianapolis at the Gen Con 2014 charity event.\nThe very special version of the game played at Gen Con 2014\nThe very special game map is the carpet in the top reward\nAnd Now, Some Notes From the Accountants on the Components\nEverything about this version of the game is designed to be impressive. \nThe multi-level board will be over ten square feet in size, featuring artwork by Jared Blando.\nThere will be more cards than you can shake a handcrafted artisan stick at. There will be components galore, to punch and explore! Imagine yourself punching out five or perhaps six sheets of the finest die-cut chipboard. Imagine seeing all of your favorite Dunshire characters rendered in 2d.   \nOne might say, \u201ccollect all 17,\u201d but here they are, all in one box. Take a second to think about each of them, who they are, and what they mean for you: Wizard, Maverick, Arbiter, Corporal, Warriors, Dragon, Alchemist, Provost, Denier, Shaman, Abbott, Brinksman, Farmer, Duchess, Mountebank, Minstrel, and Tradesman. We are showing art from Aaron J. Riley and others as we proceed.  \nThe Arbiter\nThe Arbiter has what you\u2019d call a alpha/type A personality. She likes to make a lot of decisions for people, but as she knows a lot of law stuff, and gets paid to do these things, it only makes sense. She\u2019s told me that she has very good taste and has a real understanding for what is best in every situation. Her six powers allow her to find the best way to take advantage of any situation, within the boundaries of the law of course, as is expected of any civil servant.\nThe Warrior\n In many ways The Warrior reminds me of my father. Strong, bold, always carrying a sword. He never wore boots like that, or a tunic. In fact, I can\u2019t remember him ever wearing a shirt. The warrior has six impressive powers, one of which is actually called \u201cImpressive.\u201d It will not surprise you to know that he likes to assert himself whenever possible. He also always has to have the last word in any argument, and will throw out all your collectable figurines without asking.\nThe Brinksman\nOne would expect that with a name like The Brinksman that he\u2019d want to push everything to the limit, but if you think that, you\u2019d be wrong. He wants to push it past the limit. How far past the limit? Not that far, but far enough that you know it. How would you know it? Because he\u2019d tell you, and then he\u2019d tell you again. And then he\u2019d laugh, and then he\u2019d laugh again just to make sure that the laugh was his. And then he\u2019d tell you about it.\nThe Abbot & The Shaman\nI\u2019m not going to say that The Abbot is lazy, I\u2019ll just say that he appreciates what he has been given. Everything is just fine for the Abbot and would prefer to keep it that way.\nThe Shaman walks the line between the light and the dark of the cone of decision. Sheathed or unsheathed, he sees the value of both. Some might think his methods are a little woo woo, but the results are all we really care about right? I mean no one really believes in astral projection, except my aunt Saffron. She believes in just about anything. \nThe Duchess & The Dragonman\nThe Duchess really appreciates all the ways in which you can help her out. She would really appreciate it if you could cover her bill and then find somewhere else to be. I was in a diner the other day, closed my eyes and wished three times that I was the Duchess, but everyone was still staring at me and the bill still sat there untouched. Luckily I get cash back if I charge it which is totally like being the Duchess.\nThe Dragonman is just outright a badass. He can fly. He can kick major booty on the board and against Doom points. So what if he has a compulsion? I mean who doesn\u2019t like to horde gold at the expense of any significant movement? I mean I work 12 hours a day just to get some cabbage, I ain\u2019t going nowhere. Of course, it will all be worth it once they move me from lead intern to assistant file clerk.\nThe Denier & The Maverick\nThe Denier: Sometimes I like to imagine myself as a The Denier. Only instead of destroying gems so that other characters cannot get them, I feel that I am destroying the gems from within\u2019 myself and then I come to screaming, covered in sweat and the contents of my juice box. \nThe Maverick: This lady is her own dawg. She isn\u2019t bound by any rules, because that\u2019s how she rolls. More accurately, she is actually bound by all the rules unless she gets the right dice, to \u2026 uh \u2026 not be bound by the rules, you know, how she rolls.\nEach character has a Character Sheet with all their absurd variety of powers, and to top it off we\u2019re providing you with three of each so that multiple players can enjoy an infinite combination of character power combos (please note that this is hyperbole, but trust us, it\u2019s a big number). You will have hero tokens and civilization tokens to impress your friends and relatives. \n A mountain of coins will be included, such that if they were real coins, you would be very rich. In addition, the game will be packed with gems. Real plastic gems, so real that if they were any more real they would be worth more than the price of the game, so plastic it is. Imagine large ones and small ones in 3 colors: red, yellow, and blue. \nDunshire is a dangerous place and with danger there is conflict. The Front of Traganaro piece shows where a never-ending combat roils, as the battle line is pushed back and forth across the land. \n The dice! One must roll dice to see how many dice need to be rolled. You will see 4 sets of dice that include both six sided dice and mindboggling 8 sided dice. These 8 siders are like no others, and will be provided in two colors. Seriously, it\u2019s gonna be great. \n But, of course, it\u2019s all about the cones. Sure, there are some games that have cones, but then there is THIS game. Wrap your head around 48 Cones of Dunshire cones in 4 different colors, Red, Green, Yellow, AND Blue. And who can forget the Start Player Cone? Is it the most important cone in the game? You have to play to find out. Then there is the big one, The Cone of Decision, AKA The Dark Cone. This one is a monster. I mean this thing is a gigantic piece of wood. Please do not use it as a weapon. This giant cone can only be controlled by the Cone Sheath, which slides on snugly. \nThen there is the box! Oh what a box this is going to be. How else are you going to hold a game this big without a container that won\u2019t fall apart under its own weight? It is a \u201cbox\u201d like you\u2019ve never seen before. In the coming weeks, we will show you exactly what that means! \nIn addition, we have a spectacular additional component set to add to the game. You can include special hero and civilization tokens. But really, if you were wowed by the concept of a 2D version, wait until you see these characters as fully formed miniatures in metallic three dimensions (and by that I mean with your eyes in real life). These will come with their own special base for gameplay and will be painted to look brassy and \u201cold fashioned.\u201d \nThis is expensive, but this is a one-time opportunity to own a legendary game in an edition that people will talk about and desire for years. Nothing else will bring The Architect\u2019s vision to life, as this game will!

I want to pay homage to that history and create a deck of playing cards with art inspired by the tarot. \nIn some countries, traditional tarot cards aren't used just for divination, they're actually used for games the way we commonly use regular playing cards. Likewise, today's standard playing cards are used by some for divination\u2014known as cartomancy. The two card systems started out as the same thing and are still inextricably linked. This deck is the first I'm aware of that takes that simple fact as the inspiration for its design.\nThe Art, Suits, Symbolism, and the Rider-Waite\nThe art for this deck is heavily influenced by the 1910 Rider-Waite-Smith tarot deck\u2014its pretty much the standard for tarot cards used for divination. Though the style of my art is very different from Pamela Smith's art, the themes and intent will be very much in the spirit of her artwork with a healthy dose of my own intent and interpretation. \nArcana is first-and-foremost a playing card deck. Wherever possible I've pulled inspiration from the RWS Tarot, the Tarot of Marseilles, and the Sola Busca Tarot. That includes the royals, the suits, and the symbolism. That said, combining the two has meant a few tradeoffs.\nArcana isn't intended to be a full tarot deck. Playing cards printed through USPCC are 56 card decks (main cards plus 2 jokers, and 2 extra cards) while the tarot uses 78 cards. As a playing card deck, I'll be designing 56 cards, which means I have to limit the Major Arcana to 4 cards (replacing the two jokers and the 2 extra cards). The four cards I've chosen to include are The Tower, The Lovers, The Fool, and Death. I've consulted with a lot of tarot readers on this and they more or less agree that these cards are of importance to any reading and make sense to include. Additionally, these cards will not include the Page/Knave cards.\nCorrelating the suits was also a little dicey as there is at least a little healthy debate about which playing card suit goes with which tarot suit. I opted to go with what seemed like the most common concensus. Spades, Clubs, Hearts and Diamonds are paired up in this deck with Swords, Wands, Cups, and Pentacles respectively.\nAlso, just a note about my art. I take inspiration from all over\u2014art history, found images, my own sketches and photographs. I combine all of it to create something new. I create the final art by combining art from scratchboard and images I draw on my tablet. It's all hand drawn, and I'm meticulous about making sure the final imagery works at the relatively small scale of playing cards.\nThe Cards\nI hope you can tell from this artwork how much passion and dedication I have for the project. Each card takes many, many hours to draw, and I've been working on it for about a year. For me, the art is what custom playing cards are all about. If you backed one of my past projects, you know how detailed and unique my work is. It's a great pleasure to bring you these cards which I think takes my art to a whole new level. Please note that all images are just comps and subject to change.\nCard back light\nCard back dark\nJack of Clubs/Wands - light\nKing of Spades/Swords - light version\nJack of Spades/Swords light version\nAce of Hearts/Cups - dark version\nQueen of Hearts/Cups dark\n10 of Hearts/Cups dark\nAce of Spades/Swords light\nAce of Spades/Swords dark\n7 of Spades/Swords dark\nQueen of Diamonds/Pentacles\n5 of Clubs/Wands dark\nThe Tower - one of the 4 major arcana cards in this deck\nThe Lovers\nDeath\nJack of Hearts/Cups light\nKing of Hearts/Cups light\nKing of Diamonds/Pentacles - light\nMany of the other royals are in various stages of completion. My goal is to have all the artwork finalized by the end of the funding period. That's a tall order, so it's possible completing the art might stretch a bit past the funding period. I'll definitely be posting more card images as I create them, so be sure to check back and feel free to offer suggestions.\nThe Box\nAs you can tell, there will be 2 versions of Arcana, one light and the other dark. Here are some images of the box:\nText translates roughly to 'As above, so below'\nThe Prints\nNOTE: Prints can now be included as add-ons for $50/ ($58 Int.)\nAs with my past projects, I'm making prints available of of each royal design, the card back, box front, and the aces. My process is to create plates from the original card art. I ink the plates, then run them through my press on museum-grade artist paper:\nInking the printing plate\nLining it up on press\nThe finished hand-pulled print\nAn example of the detail in the prints\nThe finished print, signed and numbered. Please note that print rewards will not include the easel or board.\nI think there's something really rare and special about the artistry of hand-pulling editions. I'm thrilled to offer these gallery worthy prints for about the same as what others offer mass-produced silk screened prints or even less than Giclee prints (which are nice, but really they're just ink-jet prints with a fancy name). These hand-pulled prints are a unique chance to own a limited edition work of art.\nAll prints will be 12\" x 16\" on Stonehenge paper, with hand-torn deckled edges\u2014I personally tear down the paper myself to size. All prints will be 1 color, signed and numbered editions.\nPrints can be added on to your pledge for $50/($58 Int.)\nAdd Ons\nAdding any of the add on items below is pretty simple:\nFirst, choose a reward tier\nSecond, click on the \"Manage my pledge\" button, and add the amount of the add-on. \nThat's pretty much it. After the funding period, You'll be able to specify versions, sizes, etc.If you're an international backer, be sure to add the shipping amount if an add on has additional shipping costs (specified below).\nHardbound Illustrated Book - $28/$36 (Int.)SHIPS  DECEMBER 2015\nThis 6\" x 9\" black linen hardbound book with dust jacket will be illustrated with full page art for every major card (every card that has an illustration) and gives you a chance to learn more about what I wanted to accomplish with each illustration. It also will serve as a primer for those newer to tarot on how to read each card. It will contain approximately 150 \u2013 200 pages. \nPlease note that this is only a comp image and final art and layout is subject to change\nComp image of an interior layout. Minor cards (2s-10s) will likely be ganged 2-up on a page, all major illustrations will be full page art.\nMAJOR ARCANA Expansion Deck - $20/$25 (Int.)\nDeck with both light and dark versions of the Major Arcana tarot cards. This deck is for folks who want a complete tarot set and is in addition to the light and dark main cards. \nPLEASE NOTE THIS DECK WILL NOT SHIP UNTIL DECEMBER 2015\nMajor Arcana Expansion Deck\nTarot 2-piece Boxes - $5 each, int. shipping included\nShips December 2015\nDark version 2-part box (please note that no cards are included with the box and the design is subject to change\nLight version 2-part box (please note that no cards are included with the box and the design is subject to change\nAs promised, these premium finished boxes are being made available to you more-or-less at cost. These are 2mm thick cardboard boxes that will come in dark and light versions, will have metallic foil and spot UV varnish. These are 2-part boxes, meaning the top fits over the bottom and encloses the cards within. I did my best to mock these up, but please note the comps are for the general idea only and do not show the final design or premium finishes. These boxes are intended for folks who want to separate light and dark cards from the expansion deck and keep full tarot sets together.\nBlack Walnut and White Oak Inlay Wooden Tarot Box with Arcana Medallion - $45 / $55 Int.\nShips December 2015\nPlease note: The medallion in this image was comped, the box is a real prototype. Wooden box does not include cards.\nPlease note: Wooden box does not include cards.\nThis box is STUNNING in person, I hope the images do it justice! The white oak inlay really sets off the black walnut which has an at times reddish cast to it. This is sized to perfectly contain one full Tarot set (not included). This box can be used to protect and store complete tarot sets when used with the expansion deck. It features a swing hinge top piece that opens up to reveal the cards within. And, of course, it is topped off with an inset Arcana Silver-Finish Medallion.\n30\" x 30\" Black Silk Tarot Reading Cloth with Metallic Silver Imprint - $22 / $26 Int.\nSilk Tarot Reading Cloth. Please note design is subject to change slightly before being produced. Does not include wall or moulding, but shadows are included free of charge.\n I've found an amazing source for 100% silk tarot cloths. These beauties will be screen printed with metallic silver ink. They'll make an amazing setting for tarot readings!\nExtra decks - $11/$13(Int.)\nNo Extra deck limits, add on as many as you'd like.\nT-Shirts - $22/$32(Int.)\nPremium 4.2 oz. Available in S-XL (after the funding period you'll be able to select which version and size you'd like).\nArcana tree of life t-shirt\nArcana rota fortunae t-shirt\nArcana Uncut Sheets - $50/$75(Int.)\nUncut sheets are taken off the press as they're printed at the USPCC. They show every card in the deck, front and back. Each sheet will be signed and there is no limit to the number you may add-on. Each sheet is approximately 22\" x 26.5\"\nArcana Uncut sheets - dark and light versions\nAntique Silver Finish Coins\u2014$12, shipping included for domestic and international\nThese are the same heavy-duty, 10 gauge, half-dollar sized coins I had minted for my past projects, this time with an antique silver finish. They're a great weight (about the same as 5 quarters), super detailed and have a gorgeous finish. Other coins are molded, these are minted and that's a difference you can see and feel in the detail. Nothing beats a 100 tons of pressure making every detail pop. \nAntique finish coins - this is just a comp image and art is subject to change\nSolid Silver Proof Arcana Coin\u2014$55 (shipping included for domestic and international)\nOne troy ounce of .999 pure silver coin - note that this is just a mockup.\nOne of the advantages of having coins minted (as opposed to molded, don't get me started\u2026) is that I can mint them in solid precious metals. For the first time, I'm proud to offer a SOLID silver version of the Arcana coin. This coin isn't silver plated, it is one troy ounce of solid .999 pure silver. These are \"proof coins\" and will have with a mirror finish. Below is a comp (since they aren't minted yet), but should give you an idea of what it will look like and how it differs from the regular antique silver-finish coin (which is a great genuine metal minted coin, but is not solid silver, it's a brass alloy coin with a finish applied).\nPlease note that because of the nature of this reward, outside the US it is strictly \"buy at your own risk\". We will under no circumstances issue replacement coins if your postal carrier loses it, misplaces it, or you otherwise do not receive it. We lose tracking ability when most international shipments fly out through Chicago, but our responsibility for packages ends when ship to you in good faith. We've experienced some fraud in the past, and this type reward opens us up to a LOT of risk, so we are also limiting orders to 5 per backer. Also, within the US these coins will be sent separately from other rewards and the USPS will request your signature for you to receive the coins.\n It's hard to comp up the coins to show exactly what they look like, but here's a picture from a past project showing the detail when coins are minted:\nActual minted coins\n Stretch Goals\n50K - Iridescent pearl paper stock for tucks\u2014REACHED!\n55K - Designs/printing inside tucks\u2014REACHED!\n60K - Embossing + foil(s) on tucks\u2014REACHED!!\n65K - Major Arcana expansion deck\u2014REACHED!!!\n75K - Free print for EVERY PRINT BACKER\u2014REACHED!!!\n100K - Free gift for EVERY BACKER (over $11)\u2014REACHED!!! \n120K - The Illustrated Guide to Arcana hardbound book released. \u2014REACHED!!!\n150K stretch goal - LE deck sleeve for every every deck, Gilded Edition released\u2014REACHED!!! What? Yes!\nThis last stretch goal requires a little explanation. I want to do something very special that doesn\u2019t require backers to add anything on\u2014a true thank you from me to you for getting the project to this point. So if we reach this goal, I\u2019ll include a signed and numbered sleeve for every deck that won\u2019t interfere with you being able to open the cards up and use them. This will only be for backers\u2014only the KS decks will come with the LE sleeve. This will make every deck in the project extra valuable, since only KS backers will ever have them.\nThe Gilded Edition release will be a set of all three decks with a special leather bound book box I\u2019ll be hand binding myself (book binding is a one of my passions as you might have been able to tell from all the pictures with the cast-iron book press in this project). The decks will have edges gilded with palladium leaf. Palladium leaf is more expensive than silver leaf and has one major advantage. Palladium leaf does not tarnish, or oxidize, and maintains it\u2019s finish under the harshest of conditions. It\u2019s so stable in fact, that it\u2019s used for gilding in conditions where it will be exposed to outdoor elements. Personally I think it\u2019s more beautiful too, it has a slightly warmer tone than silver leaf. There will only be 25 (changed - now 45, also, will include everything at the $500 level too) of these very rare and special sets made available. Because these decks will be EXTREMELY labor intensive to produce, they will be a new reward tier and will cost $500. I know that sounds like a lot of money, and it is, but others sell genuinely gilded decks (not fake gilding using cheap foils) for upwards of $125 a piece. Hand gilding decks is an EXTREMELY labor intensive process requiring sanding multiple times at progressively finer grits, buffing to a glass-like finish, sizing the edges to receive the metal leaf, and then carefully applying the leaf. Truly these will be the ultimate collector\u2019s item. If we reach the 150K mark, I\u2019ll release the timing details of the Gilded Edition tier in advance (see Update) so everyone has a fair shot if interested in them. They will be first-come, first-serve.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third project so I feel like I've got a lot of experience.

Here on the other side of the Hollywood sign, they\u2019re not pretending to have love scenes--they\u2019re doing it for real. The creators of Pretty Filthy spent months visiting porn sets and interviewing the real people of porn. What we learned changed our lives\u2014and now we want to change yours. This labor of love (and sex) has been years in the making\u2014YOUR support will help bring this bold new musical to the stage!\nA SHOWBIZ MUSICAL ABOUT PORN?\nThe story of Pretty Filthy began several years ago. Members of our company, The Civilians, found themselves talking about some of their favorite musicals\u2014Gypsy, Cabaret, A Chorus Line. What do these classics have in common? They\u2019re shows about performers\u2014 lives on the other side of the bright lights. We asked ourselves: \u201cWell, what type of entertainer has yet to have their own major musical?\u201d The obvious answer was the \u201cadult\u201d entertainer. The porn star on the other side of your screen. \nBut the hard question was\u2014what would it take for us to do this right? We didn\u2019t want to just write about our pre-conceived ideas. So we left New York for the Valley, and over several months we interviewed hundreds of porn professionals. We visited sets, visited porn stars at home, ate sushi with porn stars. We listened. We learned. And the extraordinary people we met proved our hunch was right\u2014porn is the next big show-biz musical. In a sense, porn is a mirror of our society (and a mirror that shows everything from the sublime to the totally trashy). But most importantly, these characters need to be heard on stage. (And they need to sing.)\nA TRUE LABOR OF LOVE.\nThe show\u2019s creative team, composer Michael Friedman (Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson, Fortress of Solitude), writer Bess Wohl (American Hero), and director Steve Cosson (Mr. Burns, a post-electric play), have been crafting this musical for the past several years. Taking inspiration from the extensive research, the writing team developed the script. Along the way, we tried out songs and material in front of small audiences, much of which you can listen to on The Civilians podcast here.  (For quick reference: episodes 49, 50, 51, 52, 54, 55, 56, 58, 65)\nThe Civilians are thrilled to be producing the culmination of all these efforts with the premiere production of Pretty Filthy. The show will be presented in a beautiful hundred-year-old Broadway style theater in New York City\u2019s historic Lower East Side. We\u2019ve put together a cast featuring some of the brightest stars of musical theater, and a dream design team of Broadway visionaries. We are primed to launch, but we are doing this ourselves without the support of a larger institutional theater. And that makes this campaign all the more critical to our ability to fully realize the potential of Pretty Filthy.\nComposer Michael Friedman and Writer Bess Wohl\nWE CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOU.\nThis is by far the most ambitious project The Civilians has undertaken to date. We are producing on a bigger scale than ever before, and taking this risk because we believe so completely in Pretty Filthy. By supporting this project, you are an integral part of this brilliant team. Every contribution, no matter the amount, is vitally important and will go directly towards supporting this non-profit production. Your help also enables us to host a series of discussions with several leading adult entertainers such as the legendary Nina Hartley. We invite you to take this leap with us and boldly go where no major musical has ever gone before.\nResearch in the valley\nTHE PERKS\nTo thank you for joining us on this Pretty Filthy journey, we\u2019ve put together some exclusive awards\u2014benefits and experiences that are only available through this Kickstarter campaign. You can help bring the legendary Nina Hartley to New York, and join her for a pre-show dinner, a backstage tour, and you\u2019ll sit next to her during the show! Other rewards are one-on-one script development sessions with writer Bess Wohl and composer Michael Friedman. A special, behind-the-scenes download of photos and excerpts from our investigation.

This way you can carry your books or bags and talk on the phone while carrying your coffee around.\nGoat mug is 100% leak proof so don't worry about getting coffee stains on your jeans. It s also safe for your health because it is BPA FREE.\nSince you are on-the-go kind of person, we made your life easier by making the Goat\u00b4s lid so user friendly, you can easily open and close it with only one hand.\n Here's a look inside the Goat mug.

For Radiotopia - and all of radio - to be the best it can be, we need to find even more people who are not currently on our radar.\nSo we have a big idea. At $600,000, Radiotopia will create a pilot development fund to find new, talented producers and hosts. We will specifically seek out new voices to pilot programs that tackle subjects not well covered in traditional public media.\nQuality will always be our first criteria. I believe diversity of people and perspectives is the key component to quality that\u2019s too often neglected in media.\nWe are interested in producers who pilot their own program, as well as contribute stories to existing Radiotopia shows.\nBringing in new voices and broadening the audience are critical steps in remaking public radio. Our collective of shows is already proving that incredible talent exists in unexpected places, and that we have a knack for finding it.\nIf you believe in this mission, kick in another buck or two, or just spread the word.\n***The Hover 20,000 Backer Challenge***\nWe did it!

Look what we did together!\n\"[A] kind of Justice League for smart documentarians and sound artists.\"\n--Bill McKibben\nThis is Radiotopia. I'm Roman Mars.\nRadiotopia became a reality in November 2013, when I called on the backers of the last 99% Invisible campaign to fund \"a new kind of public radio.\" Radio full of the most compelling stories imaginable, made by a group of talented creators combining their energies to grow their audiences and thrive. \nPeople - probably many of you - rallied beyond our wildest dreams. It was an awe-inspiring moment, the realization that the heart of a radio fan can grow to make room for many deserving shows. Together with PRX, we\u2019ve taken that love, trust, and money to bring together a collective of the best storytelling shows on the planet.\n99% Invisible\nFugitive Waves\nLove + Radio\nRadio Diaries\nStrangers\nTheory of Everything\nThe Truth\nThese shows make you laugh, cry, cringe, remember, reflect, strive, despair, relax... everything. \nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, as members of Radiotopia, they are reimagining radio from broadcast to digital, and the life of a creator from starving to sustainable. Radiotopia is bringing a listener-first, creator-driven ethos to public radio.\nIn just a few months, we have built a true collective of indie producers who share editorial, business, and emotional resources. It\u2019s not just an amazing group of podcasts, it\u2019s an amazing group of people. And we\u2019re getting somewhere:\nThe Radiotopia Network has increased downloads by 165% since our launch nine months ago.\nTwo shows have more than quadrupled their audience.\n99% Invisible, which had the biggest audience to begin with, has grown by 135%.\nThe dream is alive, but our work here is far from done. \nTo take it to the next level, we need you. Podcasts need about 50,000 downloads per episode for some measure of financial sustainability. Radiotopia wants our existing shows to blow through that number. That takes more gear, more staff, more travel, more branding and promotion. Our shows are not just two people chatting in front of microphone (not that there's anything wrong with that - I love a lot of those shows); they are skillfully crafted, sound-rich productions. That commitment to craft requires a lot of time and resources.\nYour Kickstarter pledge will support all the shows in Radiotopia and ensure that all of us will continue to produce our best work.\nWe also want to invite more shows into Radiotopia. A win-win-win for us, for deserving creators, and for you, our fans and listeners. Your support will make that happen.\n The Rewards\nRadiotopia Ringtones\nAll the shows in Radiotopia are contributing to a set of awesome and awesomely weird ringtones/alert tones.

For those of you unfamiliar with that campaign, we successfully funded an illustrated map populated with the locations of 136 of the most popular sci-fi and fantasy events to ever take place in the Altered States of America.\nImage Altered States, our first Kickstarted campaign\nAfter delving deep into the world of fantasy and fiction we are now setting our sights much higher\u2026 deep space exploration. Having already launched our own line of space-themed t-shirts including Beyond Earth, Above Earth and You are the Sun \u2014 we are happy to have confirm that real robot themed designs seem to be just as popular as fictional robot designs.\n50+ YEARS OF ROBOTIC SPACE PROBES\nWith the recently completed airing of the new Cosmos series, a new high-tech rover on Mars, Europeans landing on a comet in November and New Horizons on it\u2019s way to Pluto in 2015 \u2014 the public is excited again about deep space exploration. Additionally, the age of the internet has made data from various past missions easily accessible to the masses. From all corners of the globe, amateur imagers are re-working old data sets with the power of modern computing and generating new looks at faraway places without ever having to leave the ground.\nEach of these missions represent the best of what human intellect can achieve and can also provide a nostalgic sense of pride. To many, Voyager was a big part living through the '80s with it\u2019s tour of the outer solar system and Carl Sagan\u2019s original Cosmos series. In the \u201990s Galileo treated us to a thrilling tour of Jupiter and it\u2019s exotic moons. Then Y2K served up Cassini at Saturn and two particularly robust rovers on Mars with two out of the three operating to this day. \nWe have noticed over the last few years, that there have been some beautiful poster series by various designers covering themes such as Earth science, manned space missions, the planets and astronomy. However, designs that focused specifically on any particular robotic planetary missions seemed to be almost non-existent. When you do find something \u2014 the designs are generally data-driven. The likes of which might be expected gracing the walls of a high school science lab, but not hanging prominently in one\u2019s own living room. Well we want to change that and here is how we propose doing it.\nTHE PROJECT\nWe are proposing a series of posters based on three different historic robotic spacecraft programs. Each poster will be screen-printed in a minimum of three colors by Vahalla Studios who beautifully executed our previously mentioned Kickstarter project from last year.\nHow were the missions selected? First, we wanted to find out what missions are favorites among an audience that is passionate about space exploration. So on October 19th, The Planetary Society completed a simple poll on their website. The poll put to users what their three favorite robotic spacecraft missions were from Sputnik to Curiosity. This poll ran it\u2019s course for two weeks and we now have the results which have determined what missions will be the subjects of the full series.\nPoster #1: The Voyager Program (2nd below)\nPoster #2: Cassini / Huygens (1st below)\nPoster #3: Mars Science Lab (seen at top)\nPoster #2: Cassini / Huygens\nPoster #1: Voyager\nAs of this date, all three posters are complete. Originally we established the look and design approach we were proposing for the whole series by designing a poster for the Voyager missions which we knew would wind up being in the top three of the survey results. We later added Cassini\u2019s design on October 21, and then Curiosity on October 31.\nPROJECT PHASES\nPHASE 1 We consider this campaign to have four phases. Phase 1 ran for two weeks and polled for the most popular missions according to planetary.com users.\n\nPHASE 2 We published the poll results and announced the three missions that will comprise the series.\n\nPHASE 3All three design options are made public.\nPHASE 4Is where we are now. Hoping to reach the stretch goals.\nOTHER REWARDS\nMEMBERSHIP TO THE PLANETARY SOCIETY\nThe Planetary Society was founded in 1980 by by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman. The group is an advocate for funding and for missions of exploration from within NASA. In it\u2019s many years it has been responsible for some well-known initiatives such as SETI, making rover-based exploration the standard for ongoing Mars missions and was instrumental in getting Pluto to be the first target of NASA\u2019s New Horizons type missions. We are offering on several reward levels an opportunity for backers to also become Members of The Planetary Society at a special rate of 50% the usual cost (normally $36, but available to backers for only $18).

These will be made available in styles for Men and Women and screen-printed on American Apparel brand t-shirts.

The missions are also loosely arranged according to their some of their most notable destinations. The design includes some of the earliest missions such as the Soviet Union\u2019s Venera 7 which was the first probe to soft-land on the surface of another planet to one of the newest members of the Martian community of surface dwellers, Curiosity.

That's what this project will be; the pilot episode of what we hope will become a series you see on TV in the near future.\nEach episode of SERIALBOXTV will focus on one artist with segments that interweave and intertwine in a way that has a multiplying effect, with the whole becoming greater than the sum of its parts.\nSEGMENTS (A BREAKDOWN):\n Some visual examples of the segments of SERIALBOXTV\nONE-TAKES (CINEMATIC/STUDIO-BASED) - The studio based one-takes are the bread and butter of SerialBoxTV. Shot completely live using the highest quality audio gear that you\u2019d find in a recording studio, but with the production equipment you\u2019d find on a movie set, the studio based one-takes aim to occupy a space at the intersection between the energy of a live show, the sound quality of a record, and the look of a movie.\nEverything you see and hear in a studio based one-take is 100% live, absolutely as it was played, without any punch-ins or pickups. The tiny imperfections present in any live performance are not something to be removed or glossed over, but rather become the very things that make for a beautiful, unexpected performance.\nA frame from The Lone Bellow's studio based one-take\n IN-DEPTH INTERVIEW - The interview is the hallmark of the SerialBox take on an artist. This isn\u2019t a \u201cwhat\u2019s your favorite color?\u201d type of interview. Rather, it\u2019s one that aims to dig deep into the foundational elements of why an artist creates the music that they put out. It isn\u2019t a perfect facade, but an honest conversation about the very profound challenges of what it means to bare your soul in an effort to connect with listeners across the country and across the world. It\u2019s a conversation about writing, about storytelling, about the big \u201cwhy\u201d elements that drive any artist. The paradox of the interview is that, the more vulnerable, the more honest the conversation, the more the audience will connect with the artist on a fundamental level.\nThe interview is the yin to the studio session\u2019s yang. An audience likely has some working knowledge of the artists featured on the show, be it live concerts, music videos, or records. But the SERIALBOXTV interview will be the mortar which sets the audience\u2019s growing appreciation and connection with the band.\nA frame from JOHNNYSWIM's interview\n ONE-TAKES (SINGLE-CAMERA / ON LOCATION) - If the studio one-takes are about fidelity of image and fidelity of sound, the on-location one-takes are about creating an impression, a tone. They are about exploring how the layers of a song, a band, are revealed by performing these songs in places not normally associated with playing music.\nAn alleyway, a mountain top, a campfire. The \u201cwhere\u201d provides a unique perspective on the \u201cwhy.\u201d\nAdditionally, the broken down nature of these performances serve to further lower the wall between artist and audience. The viewer gets to experience these songs as if they were actually there with the artists while they perform them.\nA frame from NEEDTOBREATHE's single-camera one-take\nDAY-IN-THE-LIFE DOCUMENTARY - Sometimes the small moments, the in-between moments are the ones that tend to be the most revealing. The final minutes before an artist takes the stage. The down time wandering around an unfamiliar town. The moment alone, right after a show, before meeting the fans. These are the small things that give a glimpse into the peculiarities, the difficulties, and the rewards of a life spent playing music. These are the moments that say something about a band, about a sound, and about life behind the scenes.\nThe documentary segments are the unguarded and ultimately transportive moments that allow the audience to truly step into the shoes of the bands they love.\nA frame from David Ramirez's \"Any Given Tour Stop\" doc\nFEATURED ARTIST: NOAH GUNDERSEN:\nNoah and Abby Gundersen\n We've chosen Noah Gundersen as the artist we'll feature in the first SERIALBOXTV pilotepisode. Noah is an incredibly talented singer-songwriter and his SerialBox Presents session was the most viewed session we've ever made. We felt that he would be a perfect fit for this longer form project. We know we have more to accomplish with Noah and are excited to explore his music in this format.\nOne of the challenges of any SerialBox session is communicating the process and what it is that we're looking to accomplish with the artists. Many bands today do multiple performance video projects, sessions, and takeaway style videos. Creating a successful video with us is very different than creating a successful video with other productions and requires a shift in thinking, oftentimes. The beauty of working with Noah in this form is that being that he is a SerialBox Presents alum, he's very familiar with our method of production.\n Noah Gundersen - \"Cigarettes\" (SerialBox Presents, S2)\nPRODUCTION:\nWe have already scheduled the studio based one-takes and interviews for 11/14/14, and pending the successful funding of this campaign, will accompany Noah on the road for both the on-location one-takes as well as the day-in-the-life documentary.\nBehind the scenes of a SerialBox session\nKEY CREW AND COLLABORATORS:\nOver the last couple of years of making SerialBox Presents sessions, we've developed a short hand among our key crew and collaborators, all of whom will be involved in the production of our first SERIALBOXTV episode, including the following:\nNumerous other regular key crew, too many to count, will be involved in the pre, production, and post of this episode. SerialBox is a family and we're looking forward to creating together for this format. \nREWARDS:\nWe have a handful of rewards for contributing to this campaign, primarily centered around getting the music into your hands. We'll be pressing a limited run of vinyl that will include the studio audio from both Noah's SerialBox Presents session as well as the upcoming SerialBoxTV episode. We're very excited to be able to offer this limited edition as a thank you for contributing. \nMock up of the vinyl\nPhotography has been an important component of any SerialBox project and SERIALBOXTV will be no different. As a special thank you for contributing to this project, we'll be offering a limited run of polaroid diptychs of portraits and images we shoot during production. Obviously each polaroid will be the only one in existence and will be shot with a Polaroid 600SE (which shoots 3.25\"x4.25\" prints). \nBen Rector polaroid portraits\nAndy Davis polaroid portraits\nIn addition, we're planning a few events surrounding the release of the pilot episode. Primarily, a Houston premiere party that, in addition to the full episode, will include a live Q&A between Ryan and Noah, as well as a Noah playing a handful of songs, acoustically. It will be an evening you won't want to miss. \nFinally, we're making a few spaces available for those that may be interested in attending the studio session in November. It's an incredibly special way of experiencing the music and will be a memory you won't soon forget. Hang with us as we build sets, light, set up cameras, and our multicam system. Sit back and enjoy a view that very few people will get to see. We'll wrap the session and head to dinner together and then go to Noah's concert in Houston that evening. If you're interested in the filmmaking, or the audio, or simply the music, we'd be honored to have you on set with us.\nA THANK YOU FROM THE SERIALBOX TEAM:\nWe couldn't be more excited about the future of SERIALBOXTV and that you've decided to come along on this journey with us. We look forward to bringing you performances, documentary, and interviews with your favorites artists in a way that you haven't really seen before. By pledging to this campaign, you're joining the SBOX family as we partner together to bring something beautiful into the world. We really believe that this is the beginning of something very special.\nTHANKS!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur highest priorities in this project are as follows:\n\n1. Delivering a high quality, broadcast ready episode of SerialBoxTV\n2. Delivering said episode on time and within budget\n3. Delivering the stated rewards in a timely manner \n4. Exceeding the expectations of our backers. \n\nWe believe that we're set up to achieve these goals for the following reasons:\n\n1. This isn't a hypothetical idea, it's one that in some capacity, we've been working on the components of, for years.\n2. We've created over 25 sessions worth of content, including a series of longform livestreams earlier this year. Our pre, production, and post workflows have been refined and we are routinely hired to create content of this nature for some of the biggest brands on the planet (with the requisite deadlines/expectations to match).\n3. Those of us involved in SerialBox are full time filmmakers, designers, engineers, and photographers whose primary work consists of creating and delivering client work in a timely manner. We wouldn't get hired if we didn't do what we say we will do. We will bring the same mentality to this project, conveying information honestly and realistically. We're also limiting the number (and kinds) of rewards to further streamline the delivery process. \n4. If you've seen any of our previous work, I hope that we don't need to dive too deeply into this one. Exceeding expectations, creating something memorable, and helping you connect with music that you love? That's what we aim to do, every single time.

The parklet will be 8 feet wide and 30 feet long and provide bar seating, benches, planters, and space for tables and chairs. You can view plans and updates online.\nOur parklet is unique in that it is placed in a street that will be half closed to traffic for the next seven years during the construction of our light rail station. As a result, our parklet is wider than most and benefits from a pedestrian-zone perimeter for better safety. Arriving at the same time as our parklet will be a new bike share station immediately adjacent for a synergy of bike and pedestrian activity.\nThe Seattle Department of Transportation selected our neighborhood to participate in their pilot parklet program this year and we recently were awarded partial funding for the parklet from the Seattle Department of Neighborhoods. We need to match this $8,000 grant with volunteer hours and community funding to the estimated amount of an additional $6,000.\nThe surrounding merchants are working together to make this a lively place in the sun to enjoy a coffee, ice cream, or lunch. Please show your support by visiting these businesses: The Ugly Mug, Cedars, Flowers, H\u00e4agen-Dazs, Samir's Mediterranean Grill and Kai's Bistro.\nWhy Here & Why Now?\nWith a projected open space deficit of over five acres, the University District desperately needs public open space. The parklet is an experiment to see how our neighborhood takes advantage of and supports open space, and will inform the dialog surrounding how best to develop the U District for much greater density. The City is exploring an up zone to heights up to 340 feet in our urban core to reflect the catalyst of light rail.\nThe participating, adjacent merchants are already feeling the impacts of the seven-year construction activity at the future light rail station. It is our hope that the parklet, and adjacent bike share station, will bring more customers to their restaurants to offset their loss in business and help them survive.\nWide Support\nIn addition to the generous support of the City of Seattle, we have wide support of the adjacent merchants, nearby residents, commuters, students, visitors, and urbanists. We received the endorsement of the U District Partnership (combining the Chamber of Commerce, University of Washington, and Business Improvement District). Our permit for construction is under review by the Seattle Department of Planning & Development. Now we ask for your support for the final stretch to making this a reality.\nGive What You Can!\nPlease consider contributing whatever you can afford so we can reach our target by the fast-approaching deadline. Check out the several rewards we have to encourage your participation and share our campaign with your friends. Most importantly, come visit the parklet often once built and demonstrate how much public open space can make a difference to our neighborhood.\nOur Team\nWe have been very active over the past year in advocating, designing, organizing, and fundraising for the success of our parklet project with booths at the U District Streetfair, Neighborhood Night Out, U District Farmers Markets, and on Park(ing) Day.

We are committed to finding new ways to help the film-loving community discover vibrant and inspirational films.\n  \u2022 Education:  The staff of expert cinephiles and video geeks at Scarecrow has always been at the ready to answer questions, make recommendations and guide movie lovers of all stripes into uncharted film territories. We love nothing more than the feeling of introducing people to films that are perfect for them. Our staff members have watched thousands of movies and are always pleased to share their knowledge and insight.\nThe Scarecrow Screening Room is also a great tool for education. Acting as an incubator for cinematic exploration we have invited the public to enjoy a diverse range of films both shallow and deep, from crowd-pleasers like the summer blockbuster hits from 1984 to obscure Hong Kong musicals from the 1960s. We also provide many films to local schools and film programs. We have already begun laying the groundwork for some new and dynamic ways of using the collection to broaden folks\u2019 understanding of film history, or as a tool for just learning about life. Stay tuned for more details on these plans.\n\u201cScarecrow Video is a stunning jewel in our local cinematic crown. It\u2019s an unbelievably fantastic resource for filmmakers and film lovers alike, and our city is beyond lucky to have it.\u201d -- Lynn Shelton, director of Humpday and Your Sister's Sister\n  \u2022 Community:   Without a dedicated community of film lovers, there is no Scarecrow. In addition to renting from our massive catalog of titles, filmmakers and festivals are often invited to curate their own sections within the store. Our Screening Room is an excellent community space which provides a venue for new and emerging filmmakers to show their work, or for local film clubs to meet. Nurturing the film and media arts community \u2013 both near and far - is yet another way that we excel at bringing people together with film.\n\u201cI live exactly 2,341 miles from Scarecrow Video, yet I refuse to imagine a world without it. It\u2019s an actual, bona-fide miracle that Scarecrow is here to bring so much to the world. As a society raised in the rich glow of the big and small screen, it\u2019s both our duty and our privilege to celebrate it, support it, and defend it.\u201d -- Zack Carlson, author of Destroy All Movies!!!: The Complete Guide to Punks on Film\nSo, what\u2019s changing?\nIt\u2019s easy to get caught up in the heady notion that this unparalleled collection will remain intact and available. However, it\u2019s important to not lose sight of some exciting and vital changes that are afoot:\n  \u2022 More ways to love Scarecrow\u2026including memberships! Rental discounts, special deals, and early entrance into our blowout sales are just a few of the perks members of Scarecrow can expect. Memberships will become available in the fall (pending the success of our Kickstarter). Check out the Kickstarter rewards for a few special opportunities to obtain a founding Scarecrow membership.\n  \u2022 More ways to get to know Scarecrow\u2026 including volunteering! That\u2019s right, the curtain will be drawn back and the inner-workings revealed to those few and dedicated people who are willing to give some spare time as volunteers. This is a great opportunity to support the local film community and help Scarecrow continue to offer the great service for which we are known.\n  \u2022 More going on at Scarecrow\u2026 In the last year The Screening Room has hosted DVD release parties, interactive press screenings, book signings, local film previews, shadow puppet shows, and presentations by Seattle art legend Larry Reid, Troma film founder Lloyd Kaufman, and Oscar winning film editor Thelma Schoomaker. With something going on every night of the week, one can also find free movie screenings, weekly trivia nights, fan meet-ups, and film club nights. But this is just the beginning. It is just laying the foundation for The Screening Room to reach its full potential with more events with local filmmakers, more collaborative, cross-purpose events, more guest visitors/speakers, and even more innovative ways to use the space that haven\u2019t even been dreamed of yet.\n  \u2022 More learning to do at Scarecrow\u2026 With education as one of the cornerstones of our mission, we are constantly looking for ways to engage younger generations, expand the cinematic experiences of all generations, and create ways in which we can place our love of older films into a broader context of social and cultural history. Whether that means working with teachers to help with their film curricula, or providing insightful introductions to screenings, we are constantly seeking out new and interesting ways to share our knowledge and love of film with the public.\nWhere are our Kickstarter donations going?\nAs a new start-up, we need to raise enough money to open the doors in October and secure our ability to continue operations as we find our non-profit stride. The money you donate will go directly toward start-up and transition expenses, beginning operating expenses and cash flow to allow us to continue to expand the library and begin implementing some of the changes elaborated above.\nMost importantly, your generous donation is not life support for a dying dream\u2026 it is an investment in the future of physical media in film history.\nScarecrow Video never has been a museum piece and with your help never will be. It is a shared vision, it is living organism, which needs your love and support in order to thrive.\nDonate now to ensure the future of physical media, and share in the dream of uniting people with film!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nClosing a for-profit business and opening a non-profit one requires paying attention to A LOT of details.

Mauger was born in England and emigrated to New York in 1855. He started a business importing metal goods. Around 1870 he also began importing playing cards from the Chas. Goodall & Son company from England. The Goodall Company began making special decks with a unique Ace of Spades for their American decks. By 1873 Mauger started to manufacture his own brand of playing cards to supplement his supply and he altogether dropped Goodall in 1876 due to high import duties.\nHis deck printed in 1876, The Centennial Exposition Deck is thought to be the first deck to commemorate a fair. They were made in conjunction with the world's fair in Philadelphia. The deck also commemorates the 100 year anniversary of the signing of the declaration of independence. \nThe cards had several unique details that set them apart from other american decks of the day. They were slightly larger measuring 90mm x 62mm as opposed to the standard poker size. \nIndices were just beginning to be used. Andrew Dougherty had a patent in 1876 for his Triplicates and The New York Consolidated company had a patent the same year for their Squeezers. Mauger wanted to use Indices on his cards so he opted to put them in all 4 corners making them Quadruplicates. He went a step further and like many popular European decks made the pips 4 colors with Black Spades, Red Hearts, Yellow Diamonds, and Blue Clubs. Almost sounds like a lucky charms commercial. \nThe decorative ace of spades has the dates 1776 & 1876 commemorating the 100 year anniversary of the signing of Declaration of Independence. It also has the latin words \"NUNQUAM RETRORSUM\"; translation: \"No Revoke\" or \"Never Retreat\"\nThere will be 5 versions of this deck, They are listed in greater detail as you scroll down the page. \nUSPCC Standard (Blue Back)\nUSPCC Limited (1,000) (Blue Back)\nMauger Replica (Red Back)\nMauger Limited (1,000) (Red Back)\nMauger Original Release Limited (500) (Red Back)\nUSPCC STANDARD EDITION\nPrinted by USPCC with a Linoid Finish\nStandard poker size\nCustom Replica Stamp Seal (Sticker) \n56 Cards, 1 Original Joker, 1 Double Back/2 Gaff Cards\nUSPCC LIMITED EDITION\n Printed on the interior of the limited USPCC deck is a sketch from page 194 of the catalog from the World's fair from 1876.

Fox enlisted as a lieutenant in the Eighth New York Infantry when the civil war broke out. He eventually earned the rank of major and was involved at the First Battle of Bull Run.

In 1984 Harley Davidson replaced their chains with belt drives, too. Why? Chains require lubrication, they rust, and are susceptible to the weather. Belt drives are more durable, more quiet, and cleaner.\nLightweight Aluminum Frame - Unlike conventional steel frames, Priority is made from strong, lightweight aluminum to make it easy to carry the bike up and down stairs. The aluminum is also rust-proof, making Priority perfect if you live near the beach or somewhere with rain or snow.\nSuper Comfy Saddle - Riding should be enjoyable, so your seat should never make you feel sore. Our saddle has two layers of foam to make sure you're always comfortable.\nUpright Seating Position \u2013 Sore backs can be a byproduct of biking, but not with Priority. Our bikes are designed for upright seating to ensure you feel as good after the ride as you did before. \nTheft Deterrent - We know you\u2019ll fall in love with Priority, and we want to do anything we can to keep our bikes with their proud owners. By using bolts instead of quick releases, Priority makes it more difficult for thieves to disassemble parts. You'll still have to lock up your bike, but bolts are a precaution Priority has taken to make theft more difficult.\nPuncture Resistant Tires - It\u2019s the little details that make riding Priority easy. We're not saying you'll never get a flat, but those thorns and glass have to work a lot harder to ruin your ride.\nEasy to Assemble - Once your bike arrives, nothing stands between you and the open roads except a simple four-step, five minute assembly process that requires no previous technical bike knowledge.\nEverything You Need - Priority Bicycles are designed to get you on the road quickly and easily. When you purchase a bike, everything you need is included, from a tire pump and assembly tools, to a kickstand to a water bottle cage.\nWe know you're busy. That\u2019s why we've reimagined the bicycle through innovative design and unparalleled engineering and created a bike for recreational riders that is easy to assemble, easy to ride, and requires no regular maintenance. You will not find a more high quality bicycle at a lower price point than Priority.\nOur founder, Dave Weiner, started Priority because he was frustrated with bicycles on the market. There has been so much innovation in the industry, but all to the benefit to professional riders. Dave wanted to change the game for the recreational cyclist.\nGrowing up in the bicycle industry before starting a career in computer software, Dave dreamed of returning to the industry and making it easier for the everyday person to own and operate a bicycle.\nAs Dave says, \u201cLife\u2019s too short to ride a bad bicycle.\u201d\nOur goal is to bring joy to the journey. Our unique features and technology have been carefully engineered to ensure your Priority bicycle is ready to get you wherever you need to be as smoothly, efficiently, and stylishly as possible.\nPriority Bicycle Features and Benefits:\nGears and Brakes\nMost bicycles under $500 come with 1 gear or 7+ gears. For most people, this is either not enough options, or way too many. We make it easy by providing three gears; while most of the day you'll be in gear two, you can gain speed in gear three, or taking it easy and go up hills in gear one. Our internally geared hub can also go thousands of miles with no maintenance, as opposed to traditional derailleurs, which need maintenance every year.\nRemember a foot brake from when you were a kid? You probably would slam back on the foot brake to try and make skid marks. Fast forward to today and the foot brake in our three speed hub is very advanced, bringing you to a quick and safe stop. Pedal forward to go and backwards to stop, our bicycle is easy, safe and reliable. \nOur Development Process\nWe truly wanted to rethink cycling for the recreational rider, so we started with a blank slate and studied each component to figure out how to make a more simple, more reliable, and maintenance-free bicycle while still maintaining an affordable price.\nWe developed dozens of frame drawings and geometry configurations to make sure everything would be comfortable, beautiful, and functional.\nOur first prototype proved to be extremely durable, but aesthetically didn't have the look we wanted. We partnered with designers to create the perfect color palette, and met with 17 different contract manufacturers to find the perfect home to build our Priority Bicycles.\nAfter tireless effort, we're proud to say Priority Bicycles are the best product on the market for the recreational rider. Not only do they look great. Not only do they ride great. They're affordable.\nWant To See The Bikes In Person?\nPriority has samples ready to ride. If you're in NYC, come by our workshop and take our bikes for a test ride - we're on Hudson Street in TriBeCa, and we love visitors.

This journalistic crime story starts with a John Doe killing and drags Bucky down into a world of political intrigue, a wi-fi enabled grotto, and a station locker full of a story bigger than he thinks he's tackling.\nThe issue is already 100% finished and ready to deliver.\nDEER EDITOR #1 cover by Sami Kivela\nIf you dig CHINATOWN, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, or TIGER LAWYER then this gonzo pulp fu anthropomorphic slice of crime and words is absolutely a must for you. This issue works well as a one-shot story, but there is also room to build many more stories with this fantastic character, and I will get to them in time (the next one is already scripted). You can keep up with the campaign, and general title updates, over at DEER EDITOR HQ: deereditor.tumblr.com/\nThe book has been created using tablet pages - which are landscape in orientation and thus optimised for tablet, and other screen, viewing. An example is shown below.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nUNLOCKED - $1250 - PITCH PROCESS - get a free download of a pitch I did for A LOVE SUPREME, a book about a Doctor Strange type hero who is defeated in battle but uses the power of love to save her consciousness and insert it into the mind of her boyfriend with him. Then, four months later, they break up, and she's still stuck in there.\nThis download is aimed at those process junkie types who wonder how to assemble and structure a pitch. Which can be hard when you can't find many to look at, so here will be the whole thing.\nUNLOCKED - $1500 - COMIXTRIBE SAMPLERS - I wrote short stories for the OXYMORON and SCAMthology shorts at ComixTribe and you can get handy DRM-free PDF downloads of both stories, one with Daniel J Logan art, the other with Adam Masterman art.\n$2000 - GET LOVESICK - a while back I got to place a 5 page comic short into the back of an Image comic. The short was LOVESICK - with Daniel J Logan art, Jordie Bellaire colours, and Ed Brisson letters - and it ran in the back of GRIM LEAPER #2 by Aluisio Santos and Kurtis J Wiebe. It's a nasty short many wouldn't have seen before, so I'm dropping it here as a bobbing lure of a DRM-free PDF download.\n$2500 - ANTLER PROSE - if we hit this goal, I'll add a short prose story to the BROADSHEET PDF (yes, I write prose, too, I've even been published by Crime Factory). I'll be sure to make the short nasty twisted fun.\n$3000 - CURRICULUM #1 - I've been busy squirrelling away at a new property called CURRICULUM, along with my writer's room of Dan Hill, Ben Rosenthal, Grant McLaughlin, and Danny Djeljosevic the Destroyer, and artists like Sami Kivela, Daniel J Logan, Elsa Charretier, Bryan Coyle, and more. It's a tablet page sci fi periodical about an intergalactic class that ends up lost on the other side of the universe and must find their way back. The first issue is written by me, illustrated by Sami Kivela, coloured by Marissa Louise, and lettered by Nic J. Shaw. If we hit $3k I'll give it out as a DRM-free PDF download - which means you'll get the first issue well before the title actually launches.\nTHANK YOU DOWNLOADS\nAll backers will see updates pointing to 'Thank You Downloads' as we hit funding milestones.\n25% = CAPTAIN HUMAN THE ROBOT - ALL AGES EDIT - UNLOCKED\n50% = THE MANY HAROLD HOLTS OF SPACE AND TIME - UNLOCKED\n75% = CAPTAIN HUMAN THE ROBOT - AFTER HOURS EDIT - UNLOCKED\nDEER EDITOR tablet page example by Sami Kivela\nWHY DIGITAL? IS PRINT DYING?\nI have gone for a 'digital only' experience on this Kickstarter mostly because I am Australian and postage to the rest of the world (which is all inconveniently across water from me) is terribly expensive. As such, I didn't want to offer the single issue of this book at an insane two-digit price. I wouldn't buy a one-shot for $20 so I don't particularly feel like offering one at that price.\nTo also combat the no print issue, I've priced the basic level PDF of just the story at $1 - which I hope is fair and lures you in. I know I always hammer on about people pricing their campaigns out of existence so I thought I'd put my money where my mouth is and practise what I preach.\nKICKSTARTING A FINISHED BOOK?\nWe could have run this campaign a while back, and got paid upfront, but then left you guys hanging with a wait. Instead, we made this comic, and now it's a gamble as to whether Sami gets paid but we think you'll all come through.\nI love a campaign that is a guarantee to deliver, and I like less of a wait, so I wanted to bring to the table the things I like. So the book is finished and is totally ready for you.\nNEWSPAPER SUBSCRIPTION LEVELS\n$1 - TABLOID PDF\nThe story in a DRM-free PDF. Nothing extra, no distractions, just the whole story at an entry level price ready to read on your tablets.\n~48 pages, + credits and chapter pages\nThis level might be my death because if everyone only chooses here I'll need 1000 backers to make my goal. But I'm a firm digital reader who loves the $1 price point. So, here we are.\n$3 - BROADSHEET PDF \nThe story, with back matter, sketches, pin ups, and script, in a DRM-free PDF.\n~115 pages, + other extras as we unearth them before September :)\nThis is the deluxe package, this is the sort of PDF I'd lose my mind for. Process junkies, those wanting a peek behind the curtain, this is your place to be. I also think this price is fair but a gamble to get us across the line.\nInside you will find the entire story, plus some back matter written by me, then some sketches and thumbnails by Sami, as well as some pin ups of Bucky (by Iain Laurie, Joe Mulvey, and others), some designed prints by me, at least one ink sketch by me, as well as the full script of this issue. You can see some examples of these things at the bottom of the page.\n$7 - WEEKEND PDFs\nThat's right, TWO PDFs. One is the BROADSHEET PDF, and the other is the RKL SCRIPT PDF, feat. scripts of MANY of my other projects.\nThe extra PDF will contain scripts to:\nHEADSPACE #1-3 -- FATHERHOOD -- THE MANY HAROLD HOLTS OF SPACE AND TIME -- LOVESICK -- SURVIVOR -- My shorts for the OXYMORON + SCAMthology books from ComixTribe -- FULL MOON HEIST #1, the full first issue of an as yet unmade miniseries -- JONBOT V MARTHA, the guest one-shot strip I wrote for the SICBA award winning Colin Bell and Neil Slorance's webcomic -- LITTLE MAN IN THE BIG HOUSE #1, a short story about a prison for supervillains that is in the works -- YELLOW, a short story I have coming soon -- CAPTAIN HUMAN THE ROBOT, both the All Ages Edit and the After Hours edit -- CURRICULUM #1, a forthcoming sci fi tablet periodical -- and a few other projects, and whatever else I can find floating about that isn't terribly embarrassing. It'll be worth easily over 200 pages.\nI love reading comic scripts, they certainly help hone my own writing, so I hope some process junkies out there really dig on this beast of a package.\n$10 - TALKING PIN UPS\nSelect one of the pin ups by our amazing guest artists and I'll write a word balloon/thought bubble/caption and have it pro lettered and JPEGed to your inbox. Comes with BROADSHEET PDF + RKL SCRIPT PDF.\nYou can choose from Iain Laurie, Joe Mulvey, Robert Carey, Peggy Von Burkleo, Frank Candiloro and others to be announced as the campaign rolls on. I will then write something ghastly and superfantastic to be lettered onto the pin up by Nic J Shaw and we'll send this one of a kind digital keepsake straight to you.\nThe pin ups are 'cropped' for view now (viewable at the bottom of the page) but as the campaign rolls on the full pin ups will be disclosed in 'Backers Only' updates, so at least make sure you're in for the Tabloid to see the whole goodness.\n$15 - PAGE 3 PIN UPS - limited to 5\nSelect 1 of 5 ink sketches of Bucky by Ryan K Lindsay. Comes with BROADSHEET PDF + RKL SCRIPT PDF.\nI'm no illustrator but I promise to really put my all into these inked sketches on A4 paper. Plus, y'know, due to the scarcity of me ever trying to draw something, these artifacts are sure to be worth millions on the wild west of the bitcoin market. Check out an example of the goods at the bottom of the page.\nYou can choose from sketches of Bucky: reading an iPad, reading a newspaper, eating cereal, drinking coffee, and writing a story.\n$20 - RADIO DRAMA\nRyan will record the entire issue as a 'radio drama,' with audio files sent to you. Comes with BROADSHEET PDF + RKL SCRIPT PDF.\nDear lord, I've been wanting to do this for years. Now, take into account, this won't be some slick production, but man alive is it going to be fun to do. I just hope I have the voice to carry such an activity. The SFX from my mouth might seem suspect at first but I'm certain they'll win you over. For me, this is the heart of this campaign. If you're looking to really support with your money and get something rad in return, here it is. Enjoy.\nTo listen to a sample of what the radio drama will be like, check this video here:\n$50 - TYPE PLATE EDITION - limited to 2\nA copy of the DE #1 script, from a typewriter, with stains and red pen annotations through it by Ryan. Comes with BROADSHEET PDF + RKL SCRIPT PDF + RADIO DRAMA.\nBack in the day, before screenplays were easily downloadable for free, I remember looking at screenplays in certain stores and they were seriously just these slabs of paper out of someone's typewriter. And man did they look boss. Then screenplays were collected into books, and now they're ubiquitous online, but here I want to bring back that leather satchel vibe. I'm going to hand type these, then annotate with red pen while having a few late night coffees/wines/rums, I might even wrap them in a ribbon, and then I'll send off to you.\n$60 - EDITORIAL ASSIST - limited to 3\nA full issue script analysis by Ryan K Lindsay, with a one hour Skype rundown post-game. Comes with BROADSHEET PDF + RKL SCRIPT PDF + RADIO DRAMA.\nI'm no Computer Who Wore Tennis Shoes but I have some mind for comic writing. I also know how important it is to get another set of eyes on your writing so I'm happy to help out, make some notes on a full issue script of 24 pages max, and chat them through with you. I also have a lovely bearded face for Skype, so, y'know, that alone might be worth it.\n$120 - Mulvey Centrefold - limited to 1\nBuy the original art for Mulvey's Bucky pin up. Comes with the BROADSHEET PDF + RKL SCRIPT PDF + RADIO DRAMA.\nJoe Mulvey is a talented man, and nice on the eyes to boot. He's the artist/writer on SCAM at ComixTribe and he's provided this killer one of a kind Bucky pin up that he'll personally ship to your door (so Mulvey DNA may inadvertantly be included within the parcel/under the stamp) so you'd be crazy not to hop on this. I'll even put the pin up RIGHT HERE so you can see the insanity.\n$1200 - The RKL eXperience - limited to 2\nFor $1200, I will travel to your comic store (Aussie stores only) in January and work the counter all day, then drink at your store all night with a class selection of punters (I'll even provide bottles of Stones) while delivering a workshop on making and breaking into comics. I'll talk about writing structure, finding artists, completing projects, the time I punched a swarm of bees, and my favourite books right now.\nI'll also provide the store with 50 copies of a special print run of DEER EDITOR, a one-of-a-kind ink sketch BY ME of Bucky at their store, and if anyone can provide a bbq then I'll cook bacon and egg burgers for breakfast at the most convenient location the next morning.\nTHANK YOU + STRETCH GOALS\nOh, you better believe there'll be thank you + stretch goals.\nAs we hit quarterly milestones throughout the campaign, I plan on unleashing some fun process stuff + instantly downloadable content on the backers (short comics, previous pitch packages, etc).\nIf we surpass our goal then they'll also continue to rock out at $1,250, $1,500, $2k, $2,500, + $3k. There'll be unseen stories, scripts, and some pitch treatments.\nMEET THE CREATORS\nSami Kivela - Illustrator Supreme\nSami is an art monster from Finland who has been busy illustrating the upcoming REALM WAR and HIT LIST at Zenescope, as well as DARK LIES, DARKER TRUTHS at Markosia, THE HEAP and ZEROIDS from Moonstone Books and LORDI comics from Arktinen Banaani. Furthermore his works have been published by Ape Entertainment, Egmont, Otava, Heske Horror etc. He has also self- published a number of comics.\nRyan K Lindsay - Lowly Writer\nRyan is an Australian writer who currently writes the critically acclaimed HEADSPACE at Monkeybrain Comics with Eric Zawadzki + Sebastian Piriz/Marissa Louise on art, his FATHERHOOD one-shot was one of the top selling ComiXology Submit titles, and he once sold out to write a MY LITTLE PONY RAINBOW DASH one-shot. You most recently saw his writing in the CMYK Magenta anthology issue from Vertigo with a short story graced with Tommy Lee Edwards art.\nNic J Shaw - Nice Guy Letterer\nNic is an Australian letterer who currently slaps the balloons and captions on the DOC UNKNOWN books by Ryan Cody + Fabian Rangel Jr, 12 REASONS TO DIE at Black Mask, and plenty of other goodness. He is also an accomplished writer with the series of ACTION JOHNSON shorts to his name (completely funded by Kickstarter) and plenty more coming down the pike.\nDan Hill - Editorial Overlord\nDan is a wicked smart story guy. He understands plot machines, and character presentation, and I make him my first reader on just about everything. He's also a great writer with some short material available online and more great stuff coming down the line.\nMONEY BREAKDOWN\nMost of the money raised will be going to Sami Kivela. He's an amazing artist and I want to get him more than he is worth. I have paid him 'some' for this book but I want to see him making it rain on some space yacht moored off one of the party moons of Jupiter.\nWhat crumbs are left I will use to kick Nic J Shaw a small bonus for being a handsome guy and fantastic letterer (though I've already paid him his paltry sum for the issue's work as he subsists on unicorn dreams and 'good vibes'), as well as Christopher Kosek who has helped with a lot of the design in this project, and Dan Hill for his time and support, and then maybe also pocket some myself and periodically feed my kids.\nThere are no print costs involved with the pixels on this project. The pixels are working for free.\nTHREE PAGE PREVIEW\nHere is a peek at the first three pages of the project. Hopefully it whets your whistle.\nDEER EDITOR - Page 1\nDEER EDITOR - Page 2\nDEER EDITOR - Page 3\nPin Up Samples - whole pin ups not shown for obvious reasons (you cheeky freeloading thieves:)\nJoe Mulvey Pin Up\nIain Laurie Pin Up\nRobert Carey Pin Up\nPeggy Von Burkleo Pin Up\nFrank Candiloro Pin up\n---\nDesign Prints by Ryan K Lindsay - to be included in the Broadsheet PDF\n ---\nPAGE 3 PIN UP - Ryan K Lindsay Ink Sketch Sample\n DEER EDITOR is 100% (C) Sami Kivela + Ryan K Lindsay.

So there is no problem with getting the issue out.\nAs for the other rewards, the only stickler will be the radio drama. Now, the issue isn't it being created, I WILL do that. The issue is with its quality (I'm a writer, not some hammy voice talent), but that'll be your problem.\nEverything else should be apples.\nAnd I guess the last risk is that people will realise I am heavily just ripping off Ryan Ferrier's TIGER LAWYER. It's true, I am. Well, let's say, heavily influenced by. It's a concept homage. I know the tone is different. And the quality level is way different - one is much better.

It's not just the amazing designs on playing cards we find that drives our passion but the time, attention, and quality of the playing cards themselves.  Not many canvases out there involve a team of nineteen plus people to produce, extremely expensive machinery, proprietary methods/materials, and have such a rich history.  \nWhen getting a deck of cards, you get the whole package (beautifully design cards and a well-crafted medium) and we feel that is extremely unique.  Playing cards are a fantastic way to express an artistic idea through an affordable, tangible, and usable medium - something complicated and dynamic yet so compact that it all fits in the palm of your hand.  \nThat in itself we think is just brilliant.\nUse the below Chart Cards to determine what playing card is assigned to your birth month and day. Locate the date of your birthday along the top of the pie-shaped columns and then located your birth month along the side. Use the color key to determine your Playing Card suite.\n                                          Since many are gifting art prints and decks to others and sending them their playing card assigned to their birthday, take a look at the greeting cards you can add to your pledge.  \n VIDEO:  Special Thanks to Mi Ka for the music \"Understanding Each Other\"\nhear more @ https://soundcloud.com/mikamusic-1", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are risks and challenges with every project that can occur outside of our control no matter how much planning we do.

We all get into our lives, careers, children, dogs, cats, hamsters, gold fish, ant farm and get self-centered in our own bubble. This film shows the dynamic between mother and son, the loneliness a mother can feel when she loses touch with her family and the extent she'll go to getting it back. Most people at one time or another have not taken a call from their mother even when they have the means to do so. This film and message addresses why this could happen as it drives deeper into the parent/child relationship.\nIN GOD WE TRUST deals with the estranged yet comedic relationship between a lonely widow, Sandralyn, and her son, Ronny, a talent-less actor, who no longer has time for his mother. Unfortunately too often, parents and children lose touch, but Sandralyn isn't giving up on her son no matter how much he ignores her. After many failed attempts to get Ronny's attention, Sandralyn invites two drifters over to her house for dinner, forcing Ronny's hand. During the visit, the strangers catch light of a valuable family heirloom and Ronny begins to sense they might not be as innocent as they appear. As the night unfolds and the days follow we learn, true colors rise to the surface, trusting God's plan is imperative, and a mother's resolve is nothing to take lightly!\nWRITER / DIRECTOR\nKevin Haskin\nKevin is award-winning writer-director.

Playing drums in church as a teenager, and growing up in a family heavily influenced by music, gave Josh his exposure to music as a young boy. Josh then found his way and heart to the guitar as a senior in High School. \"I will always remember my childhood watching my Dad play bass and creating music with his brothers. A typical weekend I would just spend watching them hash out musical arrangements. I was so awestruck, as a kid, to see them create and have so much fun. My dad\u2019s brother Jeff was a huge musical influence in my life. His passing of cancer ignited a huge passion for me to play guitar because he encouraged me as a young kid to pursue music and God. I found myself learning the guitar and song writing towards the end of my High School years, and once I picked up the guitar I began song writing from that point and I haven't stopped\".\n\nAlthough Josh began his journey in the church, he soon found the band mates of Method Echo, which brought immediate mainstream attention on the West Coast and abroad. Given the opportunity to share the stage with artist's such as Lifehouse, Chris Daughtry, Abandon Kansas, Grits and more, gave Josh a very diverse experience in the music scene. Now as Josh embarks on his solo path, the passion for God, music, and the opportunity to reach people has intensified. Josh already has been featured on 103.9 The Fish as a breakout artist, and has recently shared the stage with Brandon Heath, For King and Country, Plumb, and The Afters. Josh also leads worship on weekends at various churches on the West Coast as part of his ministry in music. \"I feel that music must have a mission and my mission is to spread a message that is full of love, hope, and strength.\u201d\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JoshFalconMusic\nCheck out our last movie, \"I Was Broken\"\nCatch a glimpse of what we did and how we did it! http://iwasbroken.com/\nPLAY\n\nI WAS BROKEN is an edgy faith-based drama about two brothers torn apart by a family tragedy. Jesse, a homeless-ex-convict with a hardened heart, walks the streets bearing the guilt of a life changing decision he made years ago, and his brother Wayne, a widower with strong faith, struggling with the memories of the life he once had. After a spiritual encounter spooks Jesse, he shows up at Wayne\u2019s home. Together, they\u2019re forced to deal with the lingering pain of the past, while trying to repair their relationship with God and each other. home. Together, they\u2019re forced to deal with the lingering pain of the past, while trying to repair their relationship with God and each other.\nA LITTLE INSIGHT ABOUT THE FILM\nI WAS BROKEN is a film that was made for the mere passion of filmmaking. In a way, it's a love letter to God, thanking him for the gifts and blessings he's bestowed upon me and the rest of the cast and crew. Both my wife, Jo Haskin, and I, will be forever humbled by the work that each and every person involved in this film has blessed us with, and forever thankful for God's undoubted presence throughout the production process and beyond.\nWHY THIS MOVIE?\nReligion, faith, and day-to-day life isn't easy for anyone, regardless of whether or not you're Saved, Agnostic, Atheist or other\u2026 Jo and I both felt it was time for a film that had God as a focal point, but was reflective of real characters, pure and flawed in their actions, living with the true consequences of bad decisions, living in this reality, this world, with and without faith.\nAs a first time feature director, it was important to me to exhume as much honesty as humanly possible, pulling as much truth as I could from the character's actions, not sugar coating the life of a believer and belittling the life of someone living in extreme doubt of their faith. I do not believe that people are saved and then BOOM! life is amazing and everything is great from there on out. I believe when people are saved, that it's the beginning of a beautiful, profound, and everlasting relationship, one that should be constantly worked on, one that is filled with doubt, happiness, glory, struggle, depression, prayer, more prayer, sadness, humility, bad decision making, good decision making, perfection and sin. I believe this relationship is a lot like a marriage of sorts, where communication with the one you love leads you to success in this world, within your heart, and most importantly, with God. That is what we tried to do with this film, portray the life of a man who made the worst decision possible, costing him everything he had in this world. Jesse is pure, yet extremely flawed, his heart is big, yet extremely fragile. His faith is dark and he is completely broken and misguided because he's relying on himself to walk. His brokenness is what will possibly give him the greatest gift of all, but only through forgiveness and accountability of his own actions, and the generosity, forgiveness and love, of the one person who shouldn't love him at all.\nI WAS BROKEN is a character study of how two estranged brothers work together through the worst scenario imaginable. It's about family, relationships, love, survival, and the willingness to commit the most unselfish act of all. We're all walking down a path, a Divine path. And this film will hopefully show us all, that the path of least resistance, is seldom the path one should take.\nEQUIPMENT\nCameraEOS C300 or RED EPIC", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenges/risks are making every dollar count and having great physical producers that can make really good deals as well as working with the right people.

It started as a seed for a short film where creative camera angles told the story of a guy tripping out on psychedelic drugs on the Venice Boardwalk. While contemplating how to make a larger feature film story out of this idea, Trevor was showing someone Miguel Calderon's painting featured in the film \"The Royal Tenanbaums\" when the idea of \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" came to mind. At this moment he discovered the conflict that would fuel the story, psychos in killer masks harvesting a psychedelic compound out of their victims.\nIt took one year for Trevor to pen the script, however the script continued to develop, until they made it in the editing room. Trevor decided to cast himself as the lead role at a very early stage in the process. By casting himself he was relieved of all pressures from having to rely on another actor for the large majority of the scenes, since the majority of the movie features the main character, West Walker.\nSummer 2013 - half way teaser\nTrevor had 2 motorcycle wrecks filming this movie. He broke 3 cameras. Was in the back of 5 cop cars. Real blood was spilled as the cast and crew risked their life to get these shots. All for you to enjoy.\nApril 2012. Venice Beach.

Skoti also delivered high production value cop cars and uniforms at an unbeatable price.\nAND IF WE MEET OUR GOAL - WE WILL ADD SCENES FOR...\n We have been in contact for quite some time now with Eric Roberts and his management team.  Unable to afford his day rate, we have not been able to shoot a couple of scenes that's primary focus is to set up a sequel in which Eric Roberts will be the star.  Having Roberts on the cast will PROPEL Misirlou to a whole new level.  Eric will play a corrupt Army General who oversees the harvesting of enemies adrenal glands and the shipment of those glands back to the states for profit. \nTrevor is currently penning the script for the sequel.  The story jumps back and forth from past to present, like 'The Godfather 2'.  In the present, West must infiltrate a Las Vegas Pit Fighting Circuit ran by:\n The Underground Pit Fighting Circuit is suspected of Adrenal Gland harvesting.  In the past, is the story of West Walker's army days where the origins of the adrenal gland drug are brought to life.  We plan on shooting the war aspect of the sequel up north at Alabama Hills as well as Blue Cloud Ranch in Santa Clarita.  As for the aspect of the film to be depicted as the present, we plan on shooting in Las Vegas.  If we reach our goal,we will begin shooting Misirlou 2 and cut together a trailer to show as COMING ATTRACTIONS in the beginning of the Misirlou exploitation.\nSeptember 2013. Hollywood. Adam Huss as Charlie. Jordan Monaghan as Bonnie\nI set the kickstarter goal at bare minimum.  The reality of it is that films COST A LOT OF MONEY to make and even more money to promote.  P & A (Print and Ads) for a feature film release is typically around $200,000, however those prices can go as high as $1,000,000.  This campaign doesn't focus on P & A.  It focuses on obtaining what's needed to get the movie to a FINAL CUT PRINT that we can license and show.  We plan to screen the film all over the country in Misirlou's most popular zip codes.  The majority of the campaign will cover fees for Music Copyrights plus Original Score, CGI Special Effects, a Full Post Sound Mix, Screening and Festival Fees, Digital Mastering, Eric Roberts, and shooting the trailer for MISIRLOU 2.\nMarch 2013. Venice Beach. A giant bird flies into the scene\nSupport Independent. We can start a Film Revolution!\nFilmmaking 101:  Conceptualize, Write, Visualize, Plan, Execute, Exploit (our stage), and lastly Capitalize.  But most Importantly - DO IT!\nSeptember 2013. Blue Cloud Ranch. Deus Ex Machina Adrenal Dream\nThe hardest trap to get out of is the waiting trap.  The majority of unsuccessful filmmakers are stuck in the waiting phase.  Whether they are waiting for the right idea to come along or they are waiting for money, waiting is the worst habit to have.  Conceptualize an idea that is already within your own reach.  This minimizes the reliance on outside forces or other parties.\nJanuary 2013. Venice Beach. Delusions of Murder\nWrite something that you know you can make.  I had access to Venice Beach and Los Angeles, so I wrote a story to be set here.  The location was actually the first character in the script.  The location made the story!  Take what you have and build the story around that.  \nAs you write, start to Visualize the story as a visual movie.   Visualize which shots will give what information contained in the script.   Visualize which actor you want to play each role, then research actors who will fit your idea.  Write to music that you may want to include in your sound track.  Write at locations you know will be used when filming.  If you don't know the locations yet, google location descriptions and find nearby solutions. Go on a location scout.  Draw Storyboards.\nPlan your production by listing all elements of the script.  This is called Line Producing.  Make a list of everything you will need in order to shoot each scene, as well as how much it will cost.  Plan a shoot schedule by combining actors with locations so that you are as efficient with your time as possible.  Time is money.  \nAugust 2013. Santa Monica. Getting the Money Shots\nBook your talent, make sure you've got your crew and your gear ready, know how to secure the location, and create a game plan.  Make sure you have prepared a solution for any problem that could arise.  \nWhen it's time to Execute hopefully you have everything prepared so that production runs smoothly.  Set up the shot, call action, and work with the actors to best fulfill your vision.  Our current phase is the Exploitation phase.  This is when you take your hard earned movie and successfully show it to the world.  Before we can do this, we must have all of the audio refinished and music licensed.  If we can make you smile, we were successful.  This is when we Capitalize.\nJuly 2013. Vasquez Rocks.

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

THANKS TO YOU!  The support keeps coming in, and we are now driving beyond 75k to our \"stretch goal\" of at least 100k. There's much more work to be done than the 75k will cover. We're ready to make these last few days the best ones yet!\n\nABOUT OUR FILM    \nMany of you know our films Dont Look Back with Bob Dylan, The War Room chronicling Clinton\u2019s 1992 Presidential campaign, and Startup.com shot during the Internet\u2019s first boom and bust. These are stories about passionate people who took risks that changed history. We believe our new film, Unlocking the Cage, is just such a story. For the past two years we have been following an animal rights lawyer, Steve Wise, who is attempting to break down the legal wall that separates animals from humans. \nTommy\nYou might have recently read about Steve and his organization, the Nonhuman Rights Project. This past December they ignited a media frenzy when they filed the first-ever lawsuits demanding limited animal personhood rights for four chimpanzees in New York State. Tommy, a 26 year-old former film actor living in a garage on a used trailer lot, became their first plaintiff. \nSteve Wise lecturing at Harvard Law School\nWhat is animal personhood? It\u2019s a way of transforming an animal from a thing with no rights to a \u201clegal person\u201d with irrevocable protections. When Steve helped pioneer the study of animal rights law \u2013 he was also the first person to teach it at Harvard Law, in 2000 \u2013 he grappled with how the law could better protect animals, especially cognitively complex ones like great apes, elephants, dolphins and whales. He was inspired to pursue animal personhood after watching countless animals fall victim to lax welfare laws and regulations that do not keep animals out of abusive environments like medical testing centers and zoos. It\u2019s an unprecedented legal challenge, but as Steve says \u201cit\u2019s time to begin.\u201d\nThe December lawsuits were the first major step towards animal personhood, and they were a surprising victory for Steve and his team. The lower court judges were sufficiently impressed with their legal arguments to hold oral hearings and then direct the lawsuits up to the Appellate Courts for a decision on animal personhood. Steve is presenting his cases to the Appellate Court this fall. \nKanzi\nAlthough we have captured the dramatic events leading up to this historic moment, the story is not over. We need to be there for Steve\u2019s ultimate challenge this fall. We also want to film with the scientists who contributed affidavits on chimpanzee behavior that are crucial to Steve\u2019s case. And we want to hear the owners\u2019 side of the story, and see if the chimpanzees are declared legal persons and given a new life at sanctuaries.\nSteve Wise at Save the Chimps Sanctuary\nWe hope that by exploring Steve\u2019s lawsuit and illustrating the legal and ethical questions it raises, Unlocking the Cage will contribute to the evolving debate about our society\u2019s relationship to animals and, more importantly, why we should protect them. We are very excited about this project. It\u2019s a personal story of a man with an uncompromising need to change the system, a story that we want to tell from start to finish.

Yes, our family, the Trapps, own a farm just across the river from Fairlee, and when we're not busy with the motel or theater, we raise our own cattle. Even the coffee, butter, and whipped cream we serve is from Vermont.\nCredit- Valley News\n We hear it all the time now: shop local, support local small businesses. The communities we serve are fiercely dedicated to shopping local, staying local, eating local, and supporting local small businesses. But beyond ticket prices and supporting us with their patronage, we can't entirely rely on our small towns to help fund the enormous expense we now have to switch to a digital projector and sound. \n That's why we're here on Kickstarter: to ask you, the \"local\" world community of crowdfunding to help us out.\nWho we are:\nThe Fairlee Motel & Drive-In Theater is one of only two theaters in the country that also have an adjacent motel. Twelve rooms parallel to Route 5 (the main state highway along the scenic Connecticut River valley) form part of the drive-in fence, and guests can watch the night's movies from the comfort of their own beds through a picture window.\nFirst built in 1950 and named \u201cHighway 5,\u201d the Fairlee Drive-In has been in continuous operation save for a couple of years in the 1980s, providing a safe place for parents to bring their kids, friends to hang out, and people to get away from it all for a night.  \n We are unique among drive-ins in that we let our patrons bring in their own food, and since our family took over operations in 2003, we have invested tens of thousands of dollars in needed repair and renovation, including: \nA new metal fence around the field\nA new 35mm projector to replace the ancient carbon arc projector from the 1950's\nA remodeled snack shack\nExtensive renovation of the motel rooms\nFM radio sound for the movies\nSound by the snack shack and projection booth\n If we succeed in our goal on Kickstarter, the next immediate projects we will tackle this year will include repainting the screen and replacing any faulty speakers so everyone can hear the movie whether they have a working car radio or not.\nOur family (the Trapps) run the motel year-round and the drive-in during its open season, late April through mid-September. We bought the drive-in when it went up for sale in 2003. Peter Trapp went to camp in Fairlee and spent many nights at the drive-in when he was a kid. He always jokes with us kids that he takes us on vacation every night! In addition to the motel & drive-in, our family owns Thunder Ridge Ranch in nearby Piermont, NH, just over the Vermont border. On it we raise all sorts of animals, mainly Black Angus cattle from which we make our hamburgers at the drive-in. We call those delicious burgers (okay, I'm biased, but they are great) \"Thunderburgers.\"\nThe Valley News did an article on us last year, which has an accompanying audio-slideshow that really shows how our family-run theater serves the communities here in a unique and needed manner:\n Life Goes On at the Fairlee Drive-In\nWhy we need to raise funds:\nThe quintessential American drive-in theater, where generations of moviegoers enjoyed movies under the stars with their friends and family, perhaps even had their first kiss, is threatened. Looking to cut costs, the movie industry is rejecting traditional 35mm film for new digital film prints. Film as we know it is coming to an end. To keep up with changing technology, theaters must either convert to digital projectors or fade to black, forever. Unfortunately, the new projectors aren't a dime a dozen -- they cost $75,000 each. That's an enormous amount of money for a small, local theater like us. \n When we first heard about the possibility that movies would stop being made in 35mm, we hoped for the best and waited to see how much more time was left. Well folks, time's up. Paramount released their last movie on 35mm film this winter, and the other movie studios are expected to quickly follow suit.\n It\u2019s time to convert or close our gates for good.\n Honda sponsored a contest to convert a handful of drive-ins this past summer -- their video explains our situation very well.\n   Where we stand now:\nBecause there is a waiting list to get projectors ordered and installed for spring/summer 2014, we had to bite the bullet and we\u2019ve already ordered the projector. We used the donations raised so far from local people for a down payment but are still nearly $55,000 short. So, we are launching another Kickstarter campaign to pay for the projector. \nBecause Kickstarter is an all-or-nothing venture, and we get no money at all if we come up short, we are setting the goal at what we raised last time -- $27,595 -- but in reality are asking everyone to overfund us. That way, if we reach our goal, but don\u2019t get all the way to $55,000, we can still put all those pledges toward the payment and take a huge chunk off our debt -- and keep our gates open. And the movies running! \nIf you pledged before, please consider pledging again. If you feel you can't pledge a second time, please take a minute from your day to spread the word about this campaign: tweet it, blog it, email your friends about it. We need this to go viral.\nRemind people that we are a part of iconic America that is fast disappearing. Remind people that keeping local small businesses alive is really the only way we're going to face up to the Big Businesses of the world. Remind people that shopping, eating, staying, supporting locally is what this world is really about. And that the Fairlee Motel & Drive-In typifies this.\nMost people reading this will never visit Fairlee, VT (and that\u2019s a shame, because we really do live in a simply gorgeous area of the US), but remember that wherever you do live, you\u2019ll be supporting a rare breed: the motel/drive-in. And even rarer: a motel/drive-in that serves its own family farm-raised beef burgers! Our perks include options for people who live locally and live nationally or internationally. Don\u2019t be afraid to tell your friends in Australia, England, Iceland, wherever, about us. Know a drive-in memorabilia collector in New Zealand? Tell them about our perk that includes one of our old speakers! Do you live nearby and want to invite all your friends for a night out at a double-feature? Donate and pick a perk that allows you to get multiple tickets to our theater!\nWe're gonna give this our all and we need as much help as you can give. Let\u2019s keep our eyes on the prize and pray that the hot dog in the intermission clip keeps jumping into the bun out under those starry Vermont night skies.\nWhat we have done to date:\nWhen we first came to terms with the fact that we needed to purchase a new projector for such an enormous amount of money, we gathered our family around our dinner table and discussed what we could do. We decided to let our patrons and the community have a say in whether yet another community theater would fade to black. Our first post to our Facebook group telling them about our dilemma was shared 292 times, and the following outpouring of support both deeply humbled and encouraged us that this place was well worth saving. Two concerts (at the drive-in), a benefit auction, many t-shirt sales and individual donations later, we have raised $22,706 of our goal. We are so appreciative of what the community has done for us so far and hope that Kickstarter will bring our collective dream to fruition, so future generations can fall in love with the movies all over again. \nWe have ordered the projector we need for the switch to digital, but need to pay for it now. What will the new system do that the old one didn\u2019t? \nBetter sound and crisp picture quality \nAbility to play advertisements and videos before the show\nAble to also play Blu-Ray movies\nThe specific projector needed for our size screen is a Barco DP4K-32B.\n We will need to install:\nthe new projector\na new sound system\nan integrated electrical system\nclimate control inside the projection booth to protect the sensitive electronics\nThe people behind the project: \n (Credit- Mel Gitchel)\nThe Trapps: Tucker, Peter, Erika, PJ, and Cooper.\n Contact Us:  Cell: 603-272-5008   Email: etrapp@charter.net \n Website: www.fairleedrivein.com                            Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Fairlee-Drive-In/227970010557277", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHow does Kickstarter work?\n\nIt's simple.

Now, Morbid Anatomy is moving into a 3-floor, 4,200 square foot building in the Gowanus and completely renovating it. But to do it--and to make it the most fantastic space possible--we need your help! \nTo entice you, we have a wonderful array of awards including exclusive, limited edition prints by favorite artists Mark Ryden and Mark Dion; \"experiential awards\" with stars of TV's Oddities including a trip to Brimfield with Evan Michelson, shooting with Mike Zohn and a private tour of Ryan Matthew Cohn's astounding home museum; a collectable set piece from Tim Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas; tickets to Morbid Anatomy's popular Day of the Dead bus trip; manuscript critiques by New York Times bestselling author Tonya Hurley and Cranioklepty author Colin Dickey; exclusive, limited edition photographs of Walter Potters's Victorian kitten tea parties; signed copies of rare Stanley Burns' books on postmortem photography; a private party in the museum; special Morbid Anatomy merch; and much more!\nOUR STORY\nMorbid Anatomy began as a website by artist and independent scholar Joanna Ebenstein in 2007. It soon expanded to include the open-to-the-public Morbid Anatomy Library, and Morbid Anatomy Presents, which has produced hundreds of lectures and workshops covering such topics as books bound in human skin, postmortem photography, forgotten mail-order smut, pre-cinematic fright shows, 18th century Italian anatomical waxes, moulage making, Victorian hair art jewelry, and anthropomorphic mouse taxidermy. These are often sold out, standing room only affairs, and have cultivated a passionate community of like minded people over the years.\nIn 2013, CEO and Board Chair Tracy Hurley Martin approached Joanna Ebenstein with the ambitious suggestion that Morbid Anatomy be brought to the next level; Now, under her direction and vision, and with her tireless support, we are taking our biggest step yet: opening a three-story museum in the heart of Brooklyn!\nThe new Morbid Anatomy Museum will feature permanent and temporary exhibitions, a caf\u00e9/bar, a gift shop, an expanded library and more ambitious programming. It will be a beautiful and inspiring space to foster our unique international community of supporters, friends, artists, rogue scholars and like-minded enthusiasts; a place which enshrines that which we hold dear, a place to study, to delight; a place to \u201cmeet the others.\u201d\nBut we can\u2019t do it without you.\nRendering by Architects Robert Kirkbride and Anthony Cohn\nTHE MUSEUM\nWe have been working with awesome architects Robert Kirkbride (specialist in Cabinets of Curiosity) and Anthony Cohn to design the new Morbid Anatomy Museum, which will feel like a beautifully ornate 19th century Wunderkammer, albeit with modern, industrial accents. With three full floors and a roof garden, the Museum\u2014housed in a former nightclub!--will house over 4,200 square feet of oddities and rational amusements. It will be unlike any museum in the world, and will add a much needed touch of the fun and the odd to New York City\u2019s overly (we believe) serious cultural landscape.\nThe new museum will include: \n-An enlarged, beautiful library to house our rapidly expanding collection of over 2,500 books\n-An exhibition space to showcase our ever-growing permanent collection \n-A space for temporary exhibitions, many of which will contain works and curiosa from private collections that have rarely\u2014if ever\u2014been exhibited in public before\n-A new lecture and event space capable of holding twice our current number of people, and featuring all-new talks by favorite speakers such as Mel Gordon (Voluptuous Panic, Grand Guignol), Stanley Burns (The Burns Archive), Paul Koudounaris (Empire of Death), Amy Herzog, Caitlin Doughty (Ask a Mortician), and Evan Michelson and Mike Zohn of TV\u2019s Oddities.\n-Expanded public programing including visiting international scholars\u2014such as Richard Barnett (Wellcome Collection) and John Troyer (Centre for Death & Society at the University of Bath)--more field trips and classes, and live-casting of lectures\n-A caf\u00e9 serving espresso and pastries seven days a week, with plans to expand to a full bar\n-A gift shop with our own quirky merch, taxidermy, waxworks, curiosia and obscure books from around the world\n-More publications by Morbid Anatomy Press\n-A film branch, with filmmaker in residence Ronni Thomas of The Midnight Archive\n-A rooftop terrace where you can enjoy a cocktail while taking in breathtaking views of industrial Brooklyn and the mighty Gowanus\nWalter Potter's \"Kittens' Wedding,\" circa 1890\nEXHIBITIONS\nOur first exhibition, on the 19th century anthropomorphic taxidermy of Walter Potter, is slated to open in early June, and will bring together many pieces from Walter Potter\u2019s Museum (which was broken up and sold at auction in 2003) for the first time in the United States. Featuring taxidermied animals in Victorian dress, playing poker and attending weddings. Walter Potter\u2019s work both delights and unsettles, sometimes simultaneously, and reflects a time gone by and an artistry all but lost.\nFuture exhibitions in the works include the world\u2019s largest collection of death masks (with Atlas Obscura\u2019s Josh Foer); \u201cthe art of death\u201d (a celebration of memorial arts such as memorial portraiture and Victorian hair art); a recreation of the Cabaret du N\u00e9ant (a death themed cabaret in fin de si\u00e8cle Paris) with Rogue Scholar in Residence Mel Gordon; and an exhibition devoted to the work of anatomist/artist Frederik Ruysch who displayed his own macabre tableaux fashioned of human fetal skeletons in his early 18th century private cabinet. Other as of yet unnamed exhibitions will take as their subject artists, movements, and moments of history that have been overlooked, forgotten, or excluded from memory and display.\nOur future home.

As vehicle innovators on the cutting edge of design, we\u2019re excited to build the Verrado Electric Drift Trike.\nMORE POWER = BIGGER DRIFT \nLooking to make trike drifting possible on flat ground, Local Motors\u2019 engineers experimented with a hub motor and battery pack from one of Local Motors\u2019 electric bicycle prototypes and produced the first iteration of an electric-powered drift trike. After multiple iterations that tested different hub motors and battery chemistries, the Electric Verrado was finalized. It combines a BMX fork with a 20\u201d heavy duty front wheel featuring an aluminum casting around the brushless hub motors, two rear karting wheels lined with PVC pipe, a strong disc brake and a powerful programmable electric motor.\nVerrado Electric Drift Trike\nThe Verrado\u2019s electric motor lets you to drift on flat surfaces like asphalt, allowing you to ride almost anywhere with complete control (with practice, of course!). \nThe Electric Verrado uses a Lithium Cobalt Manganese battery that\u2019s easy to charge in about 3 hours. With a full charge, it will run for 45 minutes, or around 12 miles. Mileage and duration vary based on the amount of drifting you do.\nElectric Verrado Rear\nThe 5\u201d steel rear wheels with 10\u201d karting tires feature sturdy \u215e\u201d thick PVC wheel sleeves making it easier than ever to drift, whether you\u2019re on a flat surface or a hillside.\nElectric Verrado Under Construction\nThe high-quality disc brakes, combined with a motor that employs regenerative braking, give you the ability to stop you when you really need to. The brakes are durable, long-lasting, and make the Verrado one of the safest production drift trikes you can find. The front wheel features textured custom pegs for extra traction and stability.\nElectric Verrado Prototype in Action\nA cushioned seat will make sure you stay comfortable, even when you ride your Verrado for an extended period of time. The steel chassis is made in the Local Motors Phoenix Microfactory and is powder coated in four different colors giving the Electric Verrado a professional finish.\nVerrado Different Colors\nPICK YOUR COLOR!\nBoth the unpowered Verrado and the Electric Verrado are available for pre-order in four different colors: black, white, red and silver. As a Kickstarter exclusive, you will also have the option of having your unpowered Verrado or Electric Verrado powder coated in Kickstarter Green; this option is available exclusively to the kickstarter community. The frame features the unique Verrado and Local Motors logos.\nTHE VERRADO STORY\nOn July 30, 2013, Local Motors Mechanical Engineer Matt Jackson posted a new project on the Local Motors website called \u201cLM Drift Trike!\u201d (https://localmotors.com/projects/lm-drift-trike/3/ideas/list/3/). Since then, the project has grown as our online community of designers and engineers weighed in.\nFirst sketch of the Verrado\nThe initial gravity trike was the first, followed by a 500W golden motor kit using two 5-cell lithium polymer batteries in series to prove the powered concept. Several test mules were built to determine the best wheelbase length and head angle, and to develop the removable axle solution.\nFirst Verrado after assembly\nThe original, non-powered drift trike was given its first serious test on a hill located in the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona. The production downhill trike was then produced off the experimentally derived geometry, and put to market on December 20, 2013.\nThe Verrado at Verrado\nBecause the Arizona desert doesn\u2019t provide the hilly, side-winding roads like those of New Zealand where trike drifting began, we felt obligated to create a motorized version of the Verrado. A magic pie 3 hub motor was added to a production downhill trike along with a disc brake to provide the right amount of acceleration and braking for drifting on a flat paved surface. \nTHE TEAM\nMatt Jackson - Mechanical Engineer\nBen Smith - LM Labs Electric Vehicle Enthusiast\nGalen Wilson - Fabricator\nCarson Braun - Fabricator\nMike Reiter - Fabricator\nKen Bergsdedt - Contributing LM Labs member\nVerrado Second Prototype in Action\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!\nThere are a number of \u2018final\u2019 steps required to bring the Verrado Electric Drift Trike to market including finalizing the brake caliper mounting system, finalizing the rear axle and battery mounting method, and firming up our relationships with motor and battery vendors. Lastly, we will work to complete the wire routing for the Verrado.\nWhen we reach our Kickstarter Campaign goal we will use the funds to procure 4 batteries and magic pie hub motors by late April. We will then conduct thorough performance and longevity testing on the motors and batteries. Concurrently, procurement and testing of the brake will be moving forward. We will also be designing a caliper mount that will be bolted to the fork and will continue developing the disc brake system. Testing for all components is expected to be complete in the second week of May. At that time, the materials to fill the Kickstarter orders will be purchased, with deliveries beginning on 6/1/2014.\nA successful Kickstarter campaign will help us to bring the Verrado to market as quickly as possible and rapidly put the trike in the hands of our supporters. We will kickstart manufacturing of the Electric Verrado by crowdfunding the parts and labor for the first 30 Electric Verrados produced in the US.\nHELP US COMPLETE THE VERRADO!\nAs part of Local Motors\u2019 open source innovation, all of the design and prototyping of the Electric Verrado is collaboratively executed online by community members from all over the world.  Now we\u2019re looking to the Kickstarter community for help.\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to build a platform for designers and engineers to come together and help each other evolve ideas into products.  By joining our online community, you can help create the next big vehicle innovation by contributing your ideas, feedback, designs, knowledge and experience.  Help us open source a world of vehicle innovations. Head over to the LM Drift Trike project page and give us your ideas and feedback during the final stages of development for the Verrado Electric Drift Trike: https://localmotors.com/projects/lm-drift-trike/3/discussion/5318/\nCOME DRIFT WITH US!\nThe Verrado Drift Trike delivers a unique and impressive experience in its compact design.  The power and torque of the electric hub motor takes you by surprise as it launches you from a stop with just a slight twist of the throttle. You can even hear the sound of the tire peeling out on the asphalt!  As you get the feel for the slick, rear PVC tires, you can begin to experiment with how much angle you want to drift with.  The innovative idea of the trike being FWD allows you to pull and steer yourself through your drift, as opposed to a RWD vehicle that pushes you through the angle.  This allows the driver to control how much angle, speed, and direction the trike drifts in.  It gives a nice opportunity for sharper angled drifts without the risk of spinning out from too much throttle (as a RWD vehicle would).   The Verrado packs a huge punch in its design and provides an experience unlike any other.  Get a feel for what it\u2019s like to drift at your own pace, in control, and in style with the Local Motors Verrado Drift Trike!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf the Verrado Electric Drift Trike Kickstarter campaign is successfully funded, the main challenges we will face in order to bring the trike to production are finalizing design details and ordering components for the initial production run. This includes finalizing the axle attachment method, the battery bracket design, the rear wheel selection, the front peg design, the wire routing and the harness design.\n\nAt Local Motors we have a strong team of designers and engineers in the process of tackling these issues and testing the Verrado every day. The funds from a successful Kickstarter Campaign would allow us to acquire the optimal high-quality parts for the Verrado, ensuring its consistent safety, durability, and performance.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "One Year and Counting!", "update_content": "One year ago today we more than doubled our funding goal for the Electric Verrado Drift Trike!

Thank you for stopping to look at our project! We are Peter Dunham and Linnea Gits, the designers and artists behind the Chicago design studio, Uusi and we are excited to introduce our project to you: an entirely hand-drawn deck of Limited Edition Playing Cards called \"Hotcakes.\"\n  \"Hotcakes\" is the fifth deck in our eventual six-deck series that began a little over two years ago. With every deck we have created for our series we try to push the boundaries of what this genre has seen. No two are the same in style, medium or theme, but all are created using traditional artistic methods. Whether using the Fine Art medium of oil paint as we did with our Pagan deck, or the expressionistic, colorful washes of gouache that gave Bohemia its signature look or, rubbing soft pastels over color pencil to add a velvety look and texture to our first deck Blue Bloods, our goal is always to create a unique style and theme for each deck.  With \"Hotcakes\" we reached for the most spontaneous medium in our art tool bag \u2013 markers! \nFollowing in the historic, playing card tradition, our Ace of Spades is always the title card for our decks.  With Hotcakes we wanted to give it the same saucy attitude of the court and felt nothing could be more fitting than two naughty cherubs!\nTrue Hotcakes Fools! Our courting Cock and his bashful Hen add just the right amount of old-fashioned, \"awe-shucks\" charm to this racy little deck.\nOur Diptych Ad Cards are unique to Uusi. We were the first designers to develop a diptych for playing cards and used it for the first time on our \"Royal Optik\" deck. The diptych was originally inspired by cards of transformation decks, that when pieced together form a larger image. We feel they add an original, artistic flair to what otherwise would have become a throw-away set of cards in the deck and bring the perfect last touch to the uncut sheets.  \nNothing but a borderless, lacy back would be right for Hotcakes! The \"tighty-whitey\" borders have been thrown off for a full-pattern reveal. The hot-neon magenta design makes for an eye-popping fan and a flush of excitement on every deal.\nOoh la, la! Our Hotcakes tuck is royally good fun.  A hand colored bustier barely covers this buxom nobel's treasured assets and is printed on luxurious, uncoated, premium paper stock. The design is unzipped in the back adding the perfect, naughty hint at what's inside. \nOur Limited Edition, Hotcakes \"Modesty Sleeve\" keeps all this cheekiness discreetly hidden with the beautiful Hotcakes back pattern printed on very heavy paper stock\u2013 the perfect cover to protect and hide a deck of misbehaving royals! These LE cases and decks will not be cello wrapped, they will be vellum wrapped together with a special, Hotcakes seal.\nNEW UPDATE: BY POPULAR DEMAND MODESTY SLEEVE AVAILABLE AS AN ADD-ON! FOR THE SLEEVE ONLY (BLACK OR RED) ADD $12 TO YOUR PLEDGE. \n Vellum Wrap and Oversize Seals for Hotcakes Modesty Sleeve Decks\n*All images of the deck and tuck boxes you see in these photos are prototypes made at Uusi's studio. The finished product may vary slightly from what you see here \u2013 backers will be kept up-to-date of any minor changes that may occur. The overall design and theme will remain UNCHANGED throughout the funding and printing process. \n Our inspiration for Hotcakes came from traditional 17th Century, full figure court cards that have a cartoonish flair and lent themselves easily to a burlesque-style exaggeration. This new and \"naughty\" court was then mixed with the Pop Art era's hot-neon colors, Andy Warhol's playful illustration style, the one-off art decks of Charles Pry and the distinctive quailty of the Italian designer & artist, Emillio Pucci's gorgeous patterns to arrive with the final look of Hotcakes.  \nUsing a one-way court does make Hotcakes more of an \"art deck\" for us than all our other decks, but we were very careful to keep the deck as playable as we could. We made sure \u2013 as always \u2013 that our indices are large and easy to read when held in your hand, as are the small suit symbols below them. As product designers, creating a deck of playing cards always means keeping a very strong emphasis on the \"playing\" \u2013 we want you to have a deck that is not only pleasing to look at, but one that you can enjoy and share playing any of your favorite games with your family and friends. \nFifty-two playing cards and two jokers \u2013 all with original, eye-catching artwork that makes them ideal for magic and card games, yet at the same time very familiar and immediately recognizable by players and spectators alike.\nTwo illustrated Uusi Ad Cards that form a diptych. \nPrinted by the United States Playing Card Company (USPCC). *All our artwork has already been pre-approved and is ready for print.\nLimited Edition of 5000 Black decks. \nPrinted on Bicycle Playing Card Stock with an Air Cushion (linen) finish.\nHeavy, premium paper for the tucks and a bit heavier paper for the sleeve.\nEach deck we create is a labor of love. We put an enormous amount of time into designing these unique decks and rewards as we truly want you to have something of value to enjoy for years to come \u2013 as will we!

In 2012 alone, more than 11 million votes were cast from within this quickly growing minority.\nIn 2014, Hispanics will not only influence, they will in some cases decide the outcome of key congressional races that will determine the balance of power in Congress.\nAs you'll see, the facts behind this film are staggering. The demographic shift happening in America is compelling. Population breakdowns, voter preferences, party affiliations, turnout rates, and on and on. These statistics paint a very specific picture, one that is changing quickly towards Latinos and we will break them down for the audience throughout the film. \nBut the numbers tell only half the story.\nThe Story\nIn looking at polls, surveys, census graphs, the most important thing of all gets lost: The Human Factor. And that\u2019s where our story begins.\nThe drama of this story lies at the intersection of its three main characters: The Voters, The Politicians, and the Media.\nThe arc of the story based on 3 main characters\nDirected by Gianpaolo Pietri, the story follows one voter, one correspondent, and interviews a wide range of prominent politicians as they weave their way through the tapestry of American politics during the 2014 Midterm election cycle defining for themselves who they are, what they believe in, what it means to be Hispanic in this new American paradigm, and what role do they play in the future of their country.\nThis is a story of people in power, in the media, and in cities and towns across America who want to understand what the future of America will look like and what is their place within it.\nThe Voter\nThe voter will be an 18 year old female, second generation Latina college student who just became eligible to vote between January and April of 2014. She\u2019s an Independent trying to discover what her values are and how they translate into her vote for the men and/or women that will represent her in Congress.\nThe Correspondents\nThe correspondents will all be critically acclaimed Latino actors or award-winning Hispanic journalists who will travel with the crew around the country interviewing some of the biggest names in American politics. There will be between 8-10 and each will interview candidates for office, Latino elected officials in Congress, prominent public and private sector Latino leaders, activists, and more.\nThe Politicians\nAs for the politicians, we will interview some of the most prominent over the last couple of decades as they try hard to attract Latino voters. We will also interview new players, both Hispanic and non-Hispanic, to see how they feel about this new paradigm and what they are doing to adjust their strategy and policy outlook to garner support from this formidable voting bloc (see our interviewee list below for more details).\nGoals of the Project\nWe look to Kickstarter and all of you for help in funding the project in order to protect against the commercialization of the film and ensure a balanced and objective approach to our investigation.\nIn that spirit, \"El Voto Hispano\" is a non-partisan effort to create awareness among Americans of the changing landscape in their country's demographics, as well as, and more importantly, create awareness among Hispanic voters of the importance to exercise their right to participate in the electoral process with their vote. \nPurpose of the Project - Ask the Right Questions\nWith 23 million eligible Hispanic voters and 50,000 Hispanic youths turning 18 and becoming voter eligible every month, the implications are vast.  Serious questions still loom about what the Hispanic voting bloc means for America's political and cultural future.\nMore and more, people want to know what the power of the Hispanic vote will lead to, and how Hispanics are already changing the face of America.\nOur film is about sparking debate and trying to answer these questions, or at the very least, getting the conversation started. \nCover of Time Magazine - March 2012\n\u201cIt is clear that there is lots of room to grow for this burgeoning political powerhouse in America. The extent of their power in the electoral process is only beginning to be understood but will resonate for many generations to come. \u201d\n\u2013Gianpaolo Pietri, Director and co-Producer for the film.\nOne thing is for certain, Hispanics will have an increasingly larger seat at the policy decision-making table from here on in. One need only look at the importance given by current legislators to the issue of immigration to understand the profound influence Hispanics will have on America's socio-political future.\nBut that's just the beginning. Here are some more questions will pose:\nHow have population trends changed since 2010 and 2012 among predominantly latino communities? Where are new latino communities growing? How quickly are they growing?\nHow defining a role will Hispanics play in deciding the balance of power in Congress?\nHow many Hispanics will vote in the 2014 Midterm Elections? How do party affiliation rates compare to the past two election cycles (2006 - 2010)?\nWhat are the key issues that drive decision making in Hispanic households when it comes time to select candidates to support in local, regional and national elections.\nWhat was the party affiliation distribution among Latinos? How many were registered Republican? Democrat? Independent?\nWhat percentage does that represent against the voting totals? Whites? Other minorities?\nWhich Hispanic candidates were elected, re-elected, or removed from power?\nWhat party is better represented by minority candidates?\nHow influential was the Hispanic vote in the 2014 Midterm Election? Did they determine outcomes?

They produced their first feature, \u201cLa Espera Desespera\u201d in 2012. It can now be seen in film festivals around the world.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProcess - The Documentary\nOver the next seven months, starting on May 1, our award-winning film crew will study and document how influential Hispanics are in electing winners in key races of the upcoming congressional Midterms in November of 2014, and how their choices shape the agenda for the upcoming presidential election in 2016.\nThis will serve as part of a larger film study that will run all the way up to the 2016 presidential elections. \nWe will travel the country, covering key races in battleground states,  interviewing candidates, speaking with experts, listening to everyday voters, profiling Hispanic citizens, holding town hall meetings, and more in order to try and decipher \u201cEl Voto Hispano\u201d, the Hispanic vote. All of these activities will be experienced through the lens of our protagonists (The Voter, The Politican, The Media).\nProduction\nThough filming will begin immediately upon the successful completion of the campaign, the bulk of the Production (actual filming) stage of the project will take place between the months of June and November, the most important day being on November 6, the day of the mid term election.  On November 6 we will have several teams of videographers and journalists spread out across the country following our characters and covering the results of key races that may impact the \"power grid\" in Washington.  \nPost-Production\nPost Production will commence in November, immediately following the conclusion of filming (shortly after November 6th). The post production process will last around six months with the film ready for release in December of 2015, just in time for the 2016 national elections. This also gives us ample opportunities to capture the post election repercussions of what happens on Election Day.\nDistribution\nWe will look to license the film to a major TV network, cable news channel or web channel such as CNN, Netflix, Hulu, History Channel, etc. for worldwide distribution through TV or online. \n\u201cThis film is a historic project because it is dealing with the most significant issue in American electoral politics in the 21st century, and it will be released at a crucial moment prior to the presidential race of 2016. The primary mission of this project is meant to create awareness not only amongst the political class in Washington and around the country that will be vying for the support of Hispanics but, even more importantly, it is meant to increase awareness among Latino voters about the significance of exercising their right to vote\u201d           \n\u2013Alessandro Pietri, Writer and co-Producer\nCall to Action - Why We Need Your Support\nWith your support and our award-winning production team, we can bring a better, more comprehensive understanding to the American people about how their country is evolving, expanding, and becoming an ever more diverse and inclusive union of people with varying cultures and ethnicities.\nRewards for your support\nYour contributions to this project, this mission, means the world to us. To give thanks, we've come up with some wonderful rewards and gifts for contributors. You can see what we're offering in full detail on the sidebar to the right. They include:\nSigned Official Movie Poster (27\" x 40\")\nProduction Diary signed by the Producer/Director\nVoto Hispano White Tee - Option 1\nVoto Hispano White Tee - Option 2\nSpecial Edition Director's Cut DVD copy of \"EL VOTO HISPANO\"\nVIP Passes to the Film's Premieres\nCall to Action - Why We Need Your Support\nSo what will your money help us do? Simply put it will allow us to purchase the equipment we need and to fulfill our grueling three month travel schedule in order to accommodate our interviews, attend rallies and town halls, speak to voters directly, and answer the fundamental questions about Hispanic participation in the Midterms.\nOur producers will not be taking a salary from the film, but other specialized crew members require compensation for their hard work. Trust me. This is our passion. We'd do it all for free if we could, but we can't do it without your contribution.\nWhat your money will pay for:\nCamera and sound equipment - 15% of budget\nFlights, Accommodations & Transport expenses for crew and equipment  - 40% of budget\nProfessional fees for the Crew, Composer, Editor, etc. - 35% of budget\nKickstarter Rewards - 10% of total budget\nOur target figure is $158,000 and we have just over a month.  \nAs per Kickstarter rules, if we don't reach our $158,000 target, we get nothing, but then again, that's not even an option. Let's do this, people!\nHispanics deserve to have their story told. And America needs to hear their story. It is a story that will shape the lives of millions for generations to come.\nIf you are not able to donate, there are plenty of other important ways you can help. Spread the word!

They are:\n\nOne: Securing the interviews with very influential, hence very busy, political figures, candidates, journalists, celebrities, and influential Hispanics who can contribute their thoughts and expertise to the discussion.\n\nSolution: We are already working on scheduling these interviews and in many cases have obtained preliminary commitments. In some cases, the interview request has been already discussed and accepted. Our team is diligently working on scheduling all the events that will take place during filming. Though some of the shooting will happen spontaneously and seemingly last minute. We are pooling all our resources to secure as much of the desired footage beforehand. We started weeks ago.\n\nChallenge Two: Organizing and financing the travel and expenses of our investigative team that will require travel to many states across the country. Schedules will change, opportunities will pop up at the last minute, events will be cancelled, and things will change rapidly. We need to be ready to travel long distances at a moment's notice. \n\nSolution: This is what the bulk of the Kickstarter contributions will be used for. Even so, our team will have to be flexible and move from place to place using any and all means necessary inlcuding planes, trains, buses, and automobiles. That is why we have kept the production equipment to a minimum using state of the art DSLRs to get the quality but maintain the mobility and flexibility we need to criss-cross the country. Flexibility is also why we are insisting on a lean production team of 4-5 people. In some cases these teams can be split in to two teams of 2-3 people, should the need arise, and still operate at full capacity. Each member is skilled in working in front of or behind the camera.\n\nChallenge Three: Finding national and international distributors and getting attention from top film festivals and TV networks around the world.\n\nThese are things our team have already begun investigating and working on. We will spend the first six months of 2014, before filming begins, developing the strategy for exposure and distribution of the film once it is completed. This includes submission into some of the world's top festivals such as Sundance, Cannes, Venice, Toronto, New York, San Juan, etc.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Important news regarding Ours is a Future.", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #28", "update_userinfo": "Check out our newly minted IMDb page!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Happy Holidays from the \"Ours Is a Future\" team!", "update_content": "After careful consideration and reflection the producers of this documentary, formerly known as \"El Voto Hispano\", have decided to retitle the project \"Our Time\". \"El Voto Hispano\" was never meant to be more than a working title while the project developed and the core crew was finalized. \nFor quite some time, there has been agreement among those involved, and several trusted folks consulting from the outside, that the film's title should be in English so as to appeal to a broader audience at home and internationally."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Summer production wrap-up and the gift that keeps on giving.", "update_content": "Ok.

I'm Jim Rodda, better known to the assorted scallywags, rapscallions, and ne'er-do-wells of the hobbyist 3D printing community as Zheng3.\nMy minor maker claim to fame is Seej, the Open Source tabletop war game based around 3D printing, but with this Kickstarter I'm trying something a little different.\nI'm making Barbie-compatible 3D printed medieval armor.\nIt's important to note that I'm not now and never have been associated with Mattel, undisputed masters of Barbie and all her associated trademarks. I'm just some dude cranking out 3d models in his basement.\nBarbie has had many occupations over her long and storied career. Astronaut, veterinarian, pinup, and princess more times than I can count. She has not, to my knowledge, cosplayed as Brienne of Tarth until now.\nThe field plate armor depicted in the photos and video above is a nice-enough prototype, good enough for patrolling the battlements at Stonemist Castle. But wearing it to a meeting of the Kingsguard? To the Council of Elrond? To prom? Honestly.\nA fully funded Kickstarter will enable me to design and produce the next iteration of the prototype armor, a favolosa e bellissima ensemble that befits a lady of Barbie's high station.\nPermit me to be crystal clear about two things:\n1. My goal is primarily to distribute digital files for this armor; I'm happy to print rewards for backers but would prefer not to run a factory in the long term.\n2. GIF is pronounced with a hard G, no matter what Steve Wilhite says.\nThe funding will cover the biodegradable plastic used to print the armor, replacement printer parts, and, most importantly, the time needed to design a highly detailed suit of armor, with all the engraving, ensorcelling, and enamelling Barbie's parade panoply deserves.\n\nAnd test prints. Zounds, will there be test prints.\nThe armor will be distributed under a Creative Commons License. In a nutshell, you'll be able to modify, redistribute, and even sell the digital files and their derivatives as long as you credit the original designer. That's me.\n\nAlso note that I'm not selling Barbie dolls; if you want to use this armor you'll have to buy a Barbie Fashionistas Doll first.\nIf you've already got a 3D printer and know a doll that needs arming, head on over to The Forge and download a copy of the Athena Makeover Kit:\nThe spear and aegis should fit most dolls, although the winged boots are designed specifically for Barbie's feet.\n\nWhile you're poking around The Forge, feel free to download a 3D squirrel or two. Be careful, some of them are armed.\nDesign and Protoyping\nThe inspiration for this armor came, indirectly, from my four-year-old niece. I wanted to print something unique for her next birthday, and so decided to design and engineer a pair of My Little Pony-compatible glitter cannons. (Note to self: next Kickstarter should involve My Little Pony-compatible glitter cannons.)\n\nBut! Moving parts and springs can be tough to do at this level of 3D printing, and after a few test prints I became frustrated and fell back on my usual method for generating new ideas: drinking three lattes and taking a hot shower.\n\nMidway through my fourth latte, the idea to create 3D printed armor for Barbie sprang from my head, fully formed. Highly caffeinated and towel-clad I dashed over to the laptop and ordered a Fashionistas doll.\nThe design process is straightforward: photograph the doll from multiple angles and then use the photos as reference images in Maya, my 3D modelling package of choice.\nThe next step is printing a low-resolution test piece to see if it's a good fit on the doll. I'm doing all my prints on a Makerbot Replicator1, which has proven itself to be a reliable, if no longer bleeding-edge 3D printer.\n(How about we all just let that last sentence sink in for a minute and realize we live in The Future?)\nFinally, after many iterations and tweaks, print the piece at high resolution and call it good. Lather, rinse, repeat.\nBarbie takes her fashion seriously, so it's important to get the fit just right. Here's our favorite model amid a pile of not-quite-snug-enough or just-a-bit-too-loose prototypes. Note the boot model in the lower left.\nFunding Goal Reached, Stretch Goal Announced!\nUPDATE! 3/28/14 \nA huge thank you to all of Faire Play's backers! We've reached our initial funding goal with two weeks to go. I've been inspired by your generosity, and so I've created the Faire Play Recurve Bow as a digital token of gratitude for you all.\nYou can download the STL files for the bow from The Forge.\n\nStretch goal! If we can raise another $1000, I'll glamourize the bow and make it available on Shapeways so that anyone can make Babs deadly at a distance with a couple of clicks.\nThe Aegis Pendant\nUPDATE! 3/20/2014\nBowing to popular demand I've introduced a new backer reward, the Aegis Pendant. It'll be 3D printed in your choice of metals: Antique Bronze Steel, Polished Gray Steel, or Polished Gold Steel. Thanks Shapeways!\n\nDidja know you can 3D print in metal? Wowzers.\nBackers at the $65 level will also receive the digital files for both suits of armor *and* the digital files for the Athena makeover kit. \n\nUPDATE: A metal proof of the pendant has arrived from Shapeways! Here's what it looks like in polished grey steel.\nProduction and Fulfillment Plan\nStep 1: Model the parade armor and print prototypes.  April/May 2014\nI expect this process to take approximately two months. I'll embellish the 3D model I've already created, adding every rivet, flourish, and bevel required to create a truly elegant suit of parade armor. I'll be test-printing prototypes and publicly documenting the process at Zheng3.com.\nThose backers awake at around 5AM CST will be able to watch me work in quasi-realtime by gazing into the Scrying Pool at Zheng3.com.\nStep 2: Print Athena Makeover Kit awards. April through August 2014\nMy 3D printer will dutifully churn out Makeover kits while I'm busy detailing the parade armor. At a rate of two kits a day I should have plenty printed by the time I need to deliver them to my backers. Then it's just a matter of boxing them up and shipping them out.\nStep 3: Print parade armor for backers. June/July 2014\nMy experiments have shown that I can print roughly one suit of field plate in a day, though I expect the detail on the parade suits to require a little more time. I've intentionally limited the number of reward suits I'm shipping to a total of thirty, so we're looking at somewhere around a month and a half to get them all printed.\nStep 4: Design custom shields for top-tier backers. July 2014\nI'll be doing this step concurrent with Steps 2 and 3; while the printer is burbling away I'll be locked in my office with Illustrator, Photoshop, Maya, Science Friday podcasts, and three pounds of chocolate-covered espresso beans.\n\nStep 5: Deliver the goods, digital and physical. July and August 2014\n\nDigital rewards will be shipped first: a .ZIP file of the armor should still be small enough to fit in an email attachment.\n\nI'm anticipating a few days of parcel stuffing and label-affixing before the physical rewards can ship. I'll be investigating shipping options throughout the production period.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm quite confident in the printability of the field plate armor; I've printed every piece at least a dozen times already. \n\nThe parade armor has filigrees, engravings, gewgaws, gubbinses, and assorted skeuomorphisms that will need to be designed so they can be printed with a minimum of fuss, but shouldn't affect the stability of the print.\n\nHouse of Cards isn't releasing Season 3 until well after the Kickstarter is scheduled to finish, so that's eliminated as a potential source of delay.\n\nBy Grabthar's hammer, I can do this.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Oye!

It\u2019s a little bit like Virgin Galactic and Space X meet the Jetsons and Mad Men.\nThe Bureau pops-up wherever it is needed and is staffed by professional actors, who play the role of space travel agents, and professional astronomers, who play the role of resident scientists. People of all ages are invited to plan the vacation of a lifetime - to another planet. Once you\u2019ve decided what type of trip suits your needs - be it adventure, romance, or relaxation, our travel agents customize a space vacation package for you in collaboration with the resident scientist..\nRewards include space souvenir postcards and posters designed by Steve Thomas. A note from Mars or a visual snapshot of Titan (in infrared, of course) is the perfect 'hello' to send back to family and friends.\nWe\u2019ve done it before, and now we need your help to take the Bureau on tour across America and Britain.\nWe want you to tell us where to go along the way. As part of this campaign, if you support us, you\u2019ll get to vote where we go. We believe everyone deserves to dream of the stars.\nSupporters can choose postcards or posters from a selection of six pieces of original space art. A snap-shot from an orbiting space dock in the upper atmosphere of Uranus, or action shots of you skiing on Pluto are ideal for that holiday photo album.\n # Who are we?\nWe are an experienced team of science communicators, event planners and scientists. Our vision is to revolutionize how audiences experience science through live events that connect people with science in new ways:\nOlivia Koski is a laser engineer and head of community at Creatavist.\nJana Grcevich is an astronomer and educator at the American Museum of Natural History.\nMark Rosin is a scientist at UCLA and co-founder of Guerilla Science.\nWe created the Intergalactic Travel Bureau to help people learn about the incredible possibilities and challenges of space holidays.\nOnce visitors face the unfortunate practicalities of a space vacation (can\u2019t get enough time off of work, can\u2019t afford the cost), as a consolation they may send a space postcard free-of-charge from the destination of their choice.\nOver the last three years, we\u2019ve run the Bureau in New York, London and San Francisco. We\u2019ve been supported by NASA, the American Physical Society and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. Scientists from Princeton, UC Berkeley, and the American Museum of Natural History have taken part. You can read about us in the New Yorker, on NPR and in Wired.\n# How it will work\nWe want to take the Travel Bureau on tour across America and Britain, popping up in the places you least expect us: free festivals; disused store fronts; street markets.\nInitially we'll set up in New York, after which, the travel bureau will make its way round America and Britain (by rocketship, of course).\nMost importantly, YOU get to decide where we go. Once you donate, we will email you a link to vote. Voting results will be posted on The Intergalactic Travel Bureau website. \nOn tour, we'll adapt the event to the surroundings in which we find ourselves, traveling with a pop-up marquee, sets and props. When we\u2019re lucky enough to find them, we take over unused stores and buildings (always with permission from the owners). We recruit local actors and scientists to help staff the Bureau, and leave them with everything they\u2019ll need to run the event again.\nWe have a wealth of experience, a team of talented event producers, and a huge amount of interest and support from the scientific community.\n# Join in\nWe need your help to make this happen. It costs money to produce these unique, personalized experiences. We need to travel, buy costumes and equipment, print postcards and posters, and spend months preparing.\nWe want to help everyone be part of the future! For supporters who want the Travel Bureau to come to them, we\u2019ll plan our route to accommodate you. For supporters who just want to produce the event themselves, we\u2019ll provide a kit for you to run your own travel bureau (scientists and actors not included). For supporters who are just happy to see us succeed, we\u2019ll send you your very own piece of original space art (delivery times from Jupiter may vary).\nThe greater your support, the more say you have in where we go (destinations restricted to the US and Britain). For every dollar you pledge, you get a vote in saying where we go. At the end, the destination with the most votes wins. And, for every $10K beyond our goal, we\u2019ll add another destination.\nScientists, Jana Grcevich, Renee Hlozek, and Olivia Koski, at the Intergalactic Travel Bureau's Manhattan debut.\n# What the event will be like\nThe Travel Bureau will set up shop in an accessible, fun area of whatever town you send us to. We\u2019ll either take over a shop, or build a pop-up event space, or integrate ourselves in some other way. We\u2019ll be open 9am-5pm, just like a regular travel agency, and we\u2019ll hang around until business dries up (4-7 days). If there's enough demand, we may even stay open late for some star-gazing!\nTravel Agent, Mark Rosin, meets with excited travelers to plan a trip to Jupiter.\n# Stretch goals - new space art that you decide!\nWe've done it! Thank you so much for all your support. The Intergalactic Travel Bureau is going on tour. \nBut. We want to tour everywhere, so we're reaching for the stars with stretch goals! \nIf we reach $30K, our collaborating artist, Steve Thomas, is going to do a new, entirely original piece of space travel art just for this campaign. Art that you can get as a reward for your pledge!\nChoose from the following exciting destinations, or suggest one of your own: \nParty the Great Red Spot on Jupiter - This party has been raging for over 300 years and is still going strong. Join fellow interplanetary ravers as they dance in view of the swirling gasses, floating in the super-gale force winds.\nSailing the Solar Wind - Unfurl your solar sails and catch winds made of light itself. If you're brave enough, take a daredevil plunge through the plasma arches! \nSpacetime Stretch at Sagittarius A* - Take a one way trip the Universe's most singular experience, the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way. Enjoy the warped view before gravity stretches you into spaghetti. \nHot Mess of an Exoplanet 51 Pegasi b - Leave the solar system behind for sweltering heat and glowing gas. As if Jupiter fell in love with the Sun, it cozies right up next to its host star, and the intense radiation heats up its atmosphere until it escapes in a gigantic comet-like tail.     \nDeep Sea Exploration on Europa - Deep under the thick, craggy ices of Europa lies an ocean waiting to be explored by intrepid astro-mariners. You might even find something alive in the abyss.\nWe're asking all pledgers, past and future, to cast their vote on this, and where to take the Travel Bureau Tour itself.\n# Stay in touch\nhttps://twitter.com/GalacticTravelB\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TheIntergalacticTravelBureau\n# Credits\nThank you so much to all the talented editors, filmmakers, musicians and artists: Charlie Williams, Johan Bichel Lindegaard, Matthew Koski, Zarinah Agnew, Steve Thomas, and Rose Eveleth.\nThank you to all the scientists who have taken part over the years and made this happen: Hanno Rein, Viviana Acquaviva, Lucianne Walkowicz, Katherine de Kleer, Rene\u00e9 Hlozek, Josh Peek, Katie Peek, Or Graur, Jeremiah Murphy, Juan Iba\u00f1ez, Steven Mohammed, Greg Smye-Rumsby.\nThank you to all the charismatic actors: Kaitlin Prest, Mitra Kaboli, Mark Gilman, Dave Mosher, Ferris Jabr, Liz Stevens.\nThank you to our generous sponsors and supporters on previous projects: The American Physical Society, NASA, Chashama.\nFinally, special thanks to the inspirational Jenny Jopson, the original travel agent!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTouring is a huge, exhausting endeavor.

It is very rare if not the rarest film Polaroid made. Over the past two and a half years here in Southern California I have been sourcing and shooting the two types of chocolate Polaroid- the rectangular Type 100 and the ultra rare Type 80 which is square. This has been quite a challenge as the film is essentially gone and what film is available is expired and does not always work!\nIt is a very special film with unique properties that seem made for the Southern California landscape which is the setting for all of the photos.  The images in the book span a variety of themes from the complications in the life and death of a muse, to a battle ridding ones ego, and the challenges of overcoming addiction. Though personal in nature these are universal to all of us and through the images take on a transferable nature where everyone can tell their own, intimate story.  Here are more samples of Chocolate Polaroids from the project. To see some of the photographs which will be featured in the books check out my Tumblr page http://paulkaiserartist.tumblr.com/\nThis project will be the most comprehensive work in Polaroid's Chocolate film and with your help this vision can be realized. As there is no more film this is it! The photographs have been taken for the book and now it is on to assembling the book. When completed the book will contain over 100 of the best photos and if the stretch goals are achieved then I will be able to complete a special photo shoot into the book which is of high production value.\nAs I am grateful for your help, all the rewards for this project will be unique to Kickstater and once the Kickstater campaign is competed then the rewards will be a limited edition to how ever many were claimed.  The look and feel of this version of the book, digital and physical, will also be unique to Kickstater as a way to show gratitude.  This is also the only venue where original photos will be made available as indicated in the reward offers.\nHere are the choices for the print options offered in the pledge rewards:\nChocolate Polaroid Print choice 1\nChocolate Polaroid Print choice 2\nChocolate Polaroid Print choice 3\nChocolate Polaroid Print choice 4\nChocolate Polaroid Print choice 5\nChocolate Polaroid Print choice 6\nSo Where Are The Funds Being Dedicated?\nThe funds from this campaign will go towards creating a book of the collected Chocolate Polaroids and if the stretch goals are reached then purchasing newly found film and including it in the book as well. Creating the book has some unique costs. These costs include prepping and scanning the physical Polaroids for publication, professional assistance with layout and design of the book, and the physical printing and shipping.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nAs I mentioned, I recently discovered a film source and if I am able to reach $3800, I can purchase extra film and acquire props  to complete a significant body of work to the book. everyone whose rewards include a digital copy of the book or any physical copy of the book will of course have this new section included. Additionally the extra funds will enable better distribution of the book by making limited copies available in selected book stores.\nMore images from the project:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe major risk with an initiative such as this is with the film itself. Since the photos have been shot and the collection assembled this is no longer a risk! In creating the strategy for the book I have locked the costs of getting the layout done as well as setup costs with the printing process. The amount targeted to be raised covers these costs and ensures delivery of product at the rewards commitment.

Each limited deck will be signed and numbered on the deck and on the back of the paper wrapper.\nA Brief History: Andrew Dougherty Playing Card Company 1848-1930.\nAndrew Dougherty was a hard working Irish immigrant that used his own savings to start a small printing house and playing card manufacturing company. Although his cards were rough at first, his persistence and hard work led to his company becoming one of the most influential manufacturers of his time. \n In 1872 he built a manufacturing plant located on Centre Street in New York, just a block away from the Brooklyn Bridge. With the new building Dougherty\u2019s innovation shined through as he changed the playing card industry. His playing cards from the Centre St. factory had double heads and featured rounded corners. Both of these breakthroughs were advertised on the back of his famous eagle wrappers. \n In 1876 Dougherty was awarded a U.S. Patent for his triplicate cards. The triplicate was a miniature card placed in the top left and bottom right corners. It was a revolution in the way cards could be held and viewed. The decorative ace of spades and the wrapper for the first No.18 Triplicate deck showed a fanned hand of cards with the triplicate miniature indices viewable on each card. The first deck of triplicate cards came with a best bower, which was later replaced by a joker. \nThe only competition that Dougherty faced with the triplicates was the Squeezers cards from the New York Consolidated Card Co. The patent that the NYCCC acquired for the Squeezers cards was for the modern indices that we see now on all playing cards. \nDougherty printed his triplicates until 1883 when he was issued another patent for his Indicator cards. Like the squeezers, the Indicators featured a number and letter indices printed outside the border. \nAndrew Dougherty passed away at the age of 78 in 1905. His sons ran his business for 2 years following his death and then sold the company to the United States Playing Card Company in 1907. The United States Playing Card Co. continued to run the A. Dougherty manufacturing company until 1930 when they merged it with the New York Consolidated Card Company, relabeling it the Consolidated-Dougherty Card Co. Inc. They ran Consolidated-Dougherty as a division of USPCC until 1962 when they retired the label, bringing all labels and decks under the USPCC umbrella. The most famous A. Dougherty deck Tally-Ho is still available today. \nFree to all backers over $20 when we reach 800 backers\n2\" Cover coin add on released at $16,000.00\n2nd Edition Box for the No.18 Triplicate Deck\nAVATARS:\nCopy and paste any of these avatars to show your Triplicate Pride!\nAvatar 1\nAvatar 2\nAvatar 3", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a collaborative effort with the United States Playing Card Company so printing will obviously be done by USPCC.

Looking to cut costs, the movie industry is rejecting traditional 35mm film for new digital film prints. Film as we know it is coming to an end. To keep up with changing technology, theaters must either convert to digital projectors or fade to black, forever. Unfortunately, the new projectors aren't a dime a dozen- its $75,000 a pop. That's HUGE for a small theater like us. There is simply no way that we can afford a sum like that.\n When we first heard about the possibility that movies would stop being made in 35mm, we hoped for the best and waited to see how much more time was left. Well folks, time's up. Paramount Theaters released their last movie on 35mm film this winter, and the other movie studios are expected to quickly follow suit. http://www.courierpress.com/news/2014/jan/23/paramount-stops-releasing-major-movies-on-film/ Its time to convert or close our gates for good.\nWho we are:\nThe Fairlee Motel & Drive-In Theater is one of only two theaters in the country that also have an adjacent motel. 12 rooms parallel to Route 5 (the main state highway along the scenic Connecticut River valley) form part of the drive-in fence, and guests can watch the night's movies from the comfort of their own bed through a picture window.\n First built in 1950 and named Highway 5, the Fairlee Drive-In has been in continuous operation save for a couple of years in the 1980's, providing a safe place for parents to bring their kids, friends to hang out, and people to get away from it all for a night.\n We are rather unique among drive-ins in that we let our patrons bring in their own food, and since our family took over operations in 2003, we have invested tens of thousands of dollars in needed repair and renovation, including :\n A new metal fence around the field\nA new 35mm projector to replace the ancient carbon arc projector from the 1950's\nA remodeled snack truck\nExtensive renovation of motel rooms\nFM radio sound for the movies\nSound by the Snack Truck and projection booth\nand more!\nIf we succeed in our goal on Kickstarter, the next immediate projects we will tackle this year will include repainting the screen and replacing the speaker poles in the field that don't work, so everyone can hear the movie whether they have a working car radio or not.\nWhat we have done to date:\nWhen we first came to terms with the fact that we needed to purchase a new projector for such an enormous amount of money, we gathered our family around our dinner table and discussed what we could do. We decided to let our patrons and the community have a say in whether yet another community theater would fade to black. Our first post to our Facebook group telling them about our dilemma was 'shared' 292 times, and the following outpouring of support both deeply humbled and encouraged us that this place was well worth saving. Two concerts (at the drive-in), a benefit auction, many t-shirt sales and individual donations later, we have raised $22,100 of our goal. We are so appreciative of what the community has done for us so far and hope that Kickstarter will bring our collective dream to fruition, so future generations can fall in love with the movies all over again.\nWhat can YOU do?\nYou can help us out in a number of ways-#1 being Pledge on Kickstarter!

We bought the Drive-In when it went up for sale in 2003. My father, Peter Trapp, went to camp in Fairlee and spent many nights at the Drive-In when he was a kid. He always jokes with us that he takes us kids on vacation every night! In addition to the Motel & Drive-In, our family has the Thunder Ridge Ranch in nearby Piermont, NH just over the Vermont border. On it we raise all sorts of animals, mainly Black Angus cattle from which we make our hamburgers at the Drive-In.

Through the application of high voltage and various chemical agents, this project explores and extends the expressive capacity of instant photographic film technology beyond its ability to capture images of the world. These treatments approach the film technology as a recording media, capable of creating images from physical, electrical, and chemical transformations. The project takes its cues from artists such as Man Ray (photogram), Pierre Cordier (chemigram), Marco Breuer (scratched expose and developed c-prints), Chris McCaw (sunburned prints) and Hiroshi Sugimoto (static discharges on photopaper).\nWith your support I will:\n1. Create Archival scans and Enlarged Prints for Exhibition.\nPieces from Retinal Pigment Epithelium, Type 55, and new works will be scanned, archived and printed for a confirmed solo exhibition at Transfer Gallery (date TBD).\nThe original prints from this body of work are relatively small, measuring only 3x4 and 4x5 inches. The detail produced by the film itself though is staggering. Entire worlds reveal themselves, but only when viewed scaled up. To get the full experience of the work requires the originals be scan at high resolution to enlarged prints. Some of these signed and editioned prints are being offered as rewards!\n2. Create New Work\nIn addition to working on new series for High Voltage Image Making, I'll be producing new works just for you. Check out the rewards!\nFEATURED REWARD: Woven Throw - $225\n I was curious to see how well images from the High Voltage Image Making project would transfer into textiles, so put together a design file for this throw, made from the lead image for the Kickstarter campaign, and sent it off to the weavers who make my Glitch Textiles. I\u2019m super pleased with the results and will be making this design available for a limited time, exclusively through this kickstarter campaign as a reward for backing at the $225 level.

At present, I have a friendly relationship with a print lab that will produce the archival scans and enlargements.\n\nOn the 3.25x4.25 custom originals, I'll send nothing but the finest, however the process is incredibly variable. When the time comes, I'll let you select general features you'd like your print to have, and I'll do my very best to deliver. If the original isn't to your satisfaction, simply return it and I'll create another one as soon as it's received.\n\nAs of February 2014, Fujifilm had not made any announcements to discontinue the FP-100c type instant color film used in this project.

All of the rewards from $20 and above will include the digital download, sneak peak and access to the production diary, Unfortunately we can't edit the description for the rewards. \n--\nKUNG FURY is an over-the-top action comedy written and directed by David Sandberg. The movie features: arcade-robots, dinosaurs, nazis, vikings, norse gods, mutants and a super kung fu-cop called Kung Fury, all wrapped up in an 80s style action packed adventure. \nDuring an unfortunate series of events a friend of Kung Fury is assasinated by the most dangerous kung fu master criminal of all time; Adolf Hitler, a.k.a Kung F\u00fchrer. Kung Fury decides to travel back in time, to Nazi Germany, in order to kill Hitler and end the Nazi empire once and for all. Kung Fury is a visually spectacular action comedy that has it's foundation in 80s cop movies.\nWhen I started this project over a year ago I was driven by a strong will, love for the 80s and action movies to create a unique movie that the world has never seen, which has taken to a finished trailer and enough material to create a 30 minute long film. This with help of friends and giddy days. This movie has been made on a very limited budget. At the beginning of this project I took $5000 of my own money and just started shooting whenever I and my friends had time. \nKung Fury takes place in a variety of exotic locations; 1980s Miami, Asgard and Germany in the 1940s, to name a few. With a limited budget to work with, we had to solve this by shooting most of the scenes against a greenscreen backdrop. \nShooting on greenscreen means that we have to recreate these environments digitally instead. The advantage of shooting on greenscreen is that it doesn't require expensive sets or locations to shoot, it is very simple and only requires a small crew, which helped a lot in keeping the costs down. However, once you're done shooting a movie like this, there's a massive post-production phase that requires a lot of time and effort by talented visual effects artists.\nWhen I started this project I knew that I had the skillset required to make a movie like this, since I have a background in visual effects. Now I need the manpower to finish it.\nHence kickstarter and the wish for you to get involved in this project, where all my dedication remains and where my goal is to finish this movie and share it with the world. \nWith the kickstarter funding we'll hire a team of 7 visual effects artists who will work closely with David Sandberg on the post-production for a period of 6 months to complete the film. Pretty much every shot in this film requieres some form of visual effects treatment so there's a lot of work to be done. Apart from creating all the environments digitally, there's a lot of CG animated characters such as dinosaurs and robots that requires talented people and lots of time. To hire these artists we need to be able to pay them a decent salary. Money will also go to hire an exceptional artist to create the artwork for the movie poster. It will have that classic, illustrated 80s style that you rarely see anymore. Costs will also go to the rewards, such as printing costs for posters and stickers, t-shirts, blu-rays etc.\nWe're open to all the help we can get, so if you're a 3D artist, 3D animator, visual effects artist, compositor, or if you feel like contribute to this movie in any way not mentioned here, please contact us at: laserunicorns@gmail.com\nNo man should be left empty handed, so we've put together packages of exclusive rewards for each donator, all from t-shirts and posters to the soundtrack by Mitch murder and Lost years. Find more about the rewards on the panel to the right.\nIf this kickstarter campain is successful, we will release this 30 minute film online, for free. We want everybody to be able to watch and enjoy this film. It is our dream to be able to expand this into a full feature film. And if we were to exceed our kickstarter goal that something we want to look into.\nThis film was shot entirely on the Canon 5d, with the exception of the slow-mo scenes which were shot with the Sony FS700.\n CAST & CREW\nDavid Sandberg has worked closely with the production company Lampray (www.lampray.se) from the start. The company is run by Linus Andersson and Martin G\u00e4rdemalm.\nRecently the production company Salmon Fox (www.salmonfox.com) got onboard with the project. With the Academy Award nominated producer Mathias Fjellstr\u00f6m. David and Mathias share a love for the 80s and that will reflect in the final film.\nBecause this film has been shot on the span of over a year, there's been a number of talented cinematographers involved. They are:\nMartin G\u00e4rdemalm, Linus Andersson, Jonas Ernhill, Mattias Andersson (www.anderssonmattias.com) and aerial cinematography by Henning Sandstr\u00f6m (www.vimeo.com/henning). \nStarring: David Sandberg as \"Kung Fury\", Joanna H\u00e4ggblom as \"Viking Babe\", Leopold Nilsson as \"Hacker Man\", Andreas Cahling as \"Thor\" and Per-Henrik Arvidius as \"Chief\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKUNG FURY is a very ambitious project to say the least.

The Springfield Art Association is seeking help from the public to fully fund the restoration of this priceless piece of American history. \nThe courting couch as it appears now, awaiting treatment at The Conservation Center in Chicago\nStretch goal\nThe Springfield Art Association is celebrating its centennial anniversary in 2013. As part of that celebration, we are undergoing a capital campaign to raise funds for new art facilities, renovation of our art gallery, and the restoration of the interior of historic Edwards Place to the grandeur of its mid-19th century appearance.  Any funds raised above and beyond what is necessary to restore the courting couch will go towards the restoration of Edwards Place and the conservation of other objects in its decorative arts collection.\nEdwards Place, built in 1833 and remodeled in 1857, was a social center of Lincoln's Springfield. It is slated to undergo interior renovation in the spring of 2014.\nThe \"courting couch\" is just one of several deeply significant objects at Edwards Place.  These include an 1831 mahogany sideboard signed by the cabinetmaker and originally owned by Springfield's founding family; an 1850s center table originally belonging to the Edwards family; a rare 1830s upright grand piano originally belonging to Congressman William L. May, and many others.  These are all objects from antebellum Springfield that Lincoln would have seen in the homes of his friends.

Don't fret. Pre-order OpenBCI today!\nOur latest design!\nThe OpenBCI Board mounted onto the OpenBCI 3D-Printable Headset\nOpenBCI is a low-cost, programmable, open-source EEG platform that gives anybody with a computer access to their brainwaves. Our vision is to realize the potential of the open-source movement to accelerate innovation in brain science through collaborative hardware and software development. Behind the many lines of code and circuit diagrams, OpenBCI has a growing community of scientists, engineers, designers, makers, and a whole bunch of other people who are interested in furthering our understanding of the brain. We feel that the biggest challenges in understanding what makes us who we are cannot be solved by a company, an institution, or even an entire field of science. Rather, we believe these discoveries will be made through an open forum of shared knowledge and concerted effort by people from many different disciplines. By donating to this Kickstarter you will be supporting our efforts to make the existing OpenBCI hardware ready for mass production and available to the general public. In addition, you will be joining the OpenBCI community where people of all ages, locations, and backgrounds can contribute to unlocking the mysteries of the human brain.\nBrain-computer interfacing (BCI) is a relatively new field of science with a seemingly limitless range of applications. Medical grade BCIs are often used in assisting people with damage to their cognitive or sensory-motor functions, however, more and more we are seeing affordable BCIs emerge in neurotherapy applications that assist people with ADHD, anxiety, phobia, depression, and other common psychological ailments. Both neurofeedback and biofeedback are starting to be used more frequently by artists, musicians, dancers, and other creative individuals who want to find new ways of connecting people with the world around them, making more immersive experiences. There\u2019s great potential for research in psychology and behavior studies with portable EEG devices that can record brain activity in real-world environments. As the tools for interfacing the brain become more widely available, we will see BCIs come out of medical facilities and labs and become a bigger part of our everyday lives. We envision BCIs revolutionizing everything from neural gaming and augmented reality to meditation and concentration aids. We hope to see OpenBCI lead to toys and tools we haven\u2019t even thought of yet!\nOver the past summer we developed working prototypes of the OpenBCI board and verified its functionality and signal quality. We currently have a fully-functional Arduino Shield design, which links the electrical signals of your brain to the limitless power of computation. Now we want to take it to the next level. With your help, we will be able to add wireless bluetooth connectivity to the OpenBCI board to enhance its safety and make it more portable and wearable. We also want to integrate a reprogrammable microcontroller onto the board, as well as a SD card slot for local data storage capability. All of these pieces are tested and in place, we just need your help to leverage manufacturing at scale to make OpenBCI affordable and accessible to everyone. Lastly, like any open-source initiative, the OpenBCI board is only as powerful as the people that use it. We are asking you to join us in revolutionizing the way our minds interface with the world around us by joining the OpenBCI community and letting your voice and mind be heard.\nWireframe Concept Render of OpenBCI V3 (Kickstarter Release)\nTools for reading brainwaves have been around since 1912, when Russian physiologist, Vladimir Vladimirovich Pravdich-Neminsky published the first use of electroencephalography (EEG). However, this technology was way ahead of its time. The first digital computers weren\u2019t created until the 1940\u2019s! As a result, the first EEG recordings were difficult to understand, compare, and make relevant. Now, one hundred years later, we live in an age where technology is rapidly getting cheaper, smaller, and more portable. As a result, wearable technology has emerged as an exciting field with seemingly limitless possibilities to record all aspects of life in real-world environments. We think this trend equates to some pretty exciting possibilities for taking EEG outside of the laboratory! \nNow, you might be asking yourself what EEG actually means. If you haven\u2019t googled it already, EEG is all about measuring the teeny-tiny electrical signals that our brains make when we do things. These signals are emitted when we think, day-dream, sleep, move around, or meditate - pretty much all the time, if you think about it. Whenever we use our brains, electrical impulses are moving and potentials are flowing all around inside of our heads. EEG is a technique for recording these brain signals. \nAn EEG system has three basic parts to measure these signals: electrodes which are placed on the scalp; an electronic amplifier that can sense and relay the tiny electrical changes that your brain makes; and a signal processing computer used to make sense of the data and map it to some type of output. After that, the possibilities are endless! One of the most important links in the chain is the amplifier. It is the goal of our Kickstarter to make an open-source, affordable, high-quality EEG amplifier available to everyone so that those possibilities we are talking about can be realized by anyone.\nOpenBCI is built around Texas Instrument\u2019s ADS1299 IC. The ADS1299 is an 8-channel, low-noise, 24-bit analog-to-digital converter designed specifically for measuring teeny-tiny EEG signals. It has lots of bells and whistles, like the ability to generate internal signals for testing and calibration, as well as EEG-specific functions like lead off detection, to ensure that the electrodes are making good contact with the subject. It has a programmable Bias signal (DRL) and a very flexible input multiplexer. If you dork out on hardware, like we do, you\u2019ll want to take a look at the datasheet. Because this data sheet can be pretty scary for people that don\u2019t have a background in electrical engineering, we made the OpenBCI board and code libraries so that communicating with and controlling the ADS1299 chip is easy.\nOpenBCI V2 being configured at our first hackathon (hosted by Thoughtworks NYC)\nThe OpenBCI Board comes with an onboard re-programmable micro-controller. All backers that select a reward that includes an OpenBCI Board will get to choose between the 8-bit ATmega328 core made by Atmel (with Arduino bootloader) and a 32-bit PIC core made by Microchip (with chipKIT bootloader).  We will send out a survey at the end of the campaign to make sure you receive the microcontroller that works best for your needs. And we have broken out all of the pins so you can blink lights or move motors just like with Arduino or ChipKIT, except now you can do it with your brainwaves! Version 3 of the OpenBCI board will use bluetooth low energy (BTLE) for data transmission and programming of the on board micro-controller. Your safety is super important to us. That\u2019s why we are using a wireless connection to transmit your brain data and the necessary code to and from the OpenBCI board.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! The ADS1299 is daisy-chainable. That means you can add another 8 channels to your system by simply plugging on the OpenBCI Daisy Board! Check our rewards list for the OpenBCI Daisy Chain option if you want a lot of electrodes!\nThe next important part of our OpenBCI system is the electrode sensors. There are two main types: Passive and Active. The OpenBCI board works with both types of electrodes. If you have your own, you can support us at the OpenBCI Board reward level. If you don't have any electrodes lying around, support us at OpenBCI Board w/ Electrode Kit level, we will also send you 10 passive electrodes, conductive paste, and all you need to get started reading your brain waves right out of the box!\nElectrodes and conductive paste included in the Electrode Starter Kit!\nIn addition to the OpenBCI hardware, we have been working very hard to build template computer programs that visualize and process your brainwaves to make the raw EEG data meaningful. We have code examples built in Arduino, ChipKIT, Processing, Python, and openFramworks. In addition, we have no intention of reinventing the wheel, so we are actively working to make the hardware data accessible to all commonly used open-source EEG signal processing applications, such as BrainBay, OpenVibe, and more. Because you have direct access to the data on the hardware side, making it portable to any existing EEG software is as easy as structuring the way the data is formatted and related. The image below is a screen-shot of our basic OpenBCI Brainwave Visualizer demonstrating 8 channels of raw EEG over a period of 5 seconds and a fast-fourier transform (FFT) plot of the data. This code is available on our Github and can be easily expanded upon.\nA screenshot of the OpenBCI Brainwave Visualizer showing strong alpha waves (8-13 Hz)\nIn the OpenBCI Brainwave Visualizer above, the graphic at the top left shows the electrode placement positions for the experiment. The color intensity of each node indicates the EEG wave amplitude at that region of the scalp. On the right is a graph of the raw EEG data from all 8 channels over time in pretty colors. You can see, at the 4 second mark, a signal artifact in channels 1 & 2 from when our test subject (thanks Aisen!) closed her eyes. The graph in the lower left is an FFT plot, which shows the dominant frequencies in the data stream. \nThe screenshot was captured about 4 seconds after our test subject closed her eyes. There is a high amplitude waveform seen clearly in channels 5-8, which are placed on the back of the scalp. Notice a spike in the FFT graph at about 10-12Hz. This shows a predominance of alpha waves in the occipital region of the brain, which is what one would expect to see when the subject\u2019s eyes are closed and the visual cortex has nothing to do. Whether you want to do neural therapy to improve your attention or productivity, control video games with your motor cortex, or control the disco lights at your next house party based on your mood, it's the software algorithms and signal processing that make it work. OpenBCI is a community of scientists, engineers, and users coming together to learn and share code and experiences. We hope to make all of these wild ideas become a reality!\nIn addition to EEG circuit design, we\u2019ve been busy attacking the EEG headwear design challenge from an entirely new angle. Throughout the design process, our goal has been to find a solution that is truly customizable while still taking into account cost, comfort, and signal quality. The reason we think customizability is such a key to the advancement of BCI is because the field is very new and evolving so quickly; there are still so many unknowns in other aspects of the overall BCI design challenge. Low-cost BCI research and development should not be limited by fixed electrode systems that require you to repeatedly sample data from the same regions of the scalp.\nA digital prototype of the OpenBCI 3D-Printable Headset\nAt first we considered an injection-molded solution with a semi-fixed form factor but quickly realized this would entail making a lot of assumptions to create a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d headset. Inevitably, that design would be too big or too small for some. In addition, because the major cost of injection molding is the design and creation the initial mold, the process would limit iterative design. As a result (and in the spirit of open source) we designed the first 3D-printable EEG headset, with a heavy emphasis on customizability.\n4-view screenshot of the OpenBCI 3D-Printable Headset digital prototype in Autodesk Maya\nBecause we want OpenBCI to be beneficial for researchers as well as novice brain hackers, we made sure our design implemented the International 10-20 system \u2013 the internationally recognized method for placing electrodes on the human scalp in the context of EEG. We wanted the design to support electrode placement anywhere on the 10-20 diagram, but at the same time, not be bulky and uncomfortable as a result of extraneous components. Because of this, we designed a hierarchical system of snap-in pieces, allowing for a comfortable, personalized headset design.\nThe first 3D-printed physical prototype of the Spider Claw 3000!\nThe body at the back of the 3D-printable headset design (positioned over the visual cortex) has a mount for the OpenBCI Board as well as a slot for a rechargeable lithium battery. The removable arms that extend from the body have nodes where a variety of different hands (1-electrode, 3-electrode, or 5-electrode) can be snapped into place. The option of choosing between 1 and 5 electrodes allows you to target general or granular regions of the scalp, while sticking to 10-20 standards.\n5-electrode, 3-electrode, and 1-electrode \"snap-in\" OpenBCI 3D-Printable Headset electrode mounts\nTo support the assembly and customization of the OpenBCI 3D-printable EEG Headset, we\u2019re developing an online interface that enables you to drag and drop components while visualizing a 3D render of your headset. The interface will also have inputs for important head dimensions (inion-to-nasion distance over the top of the scalp and around the side of the scalp) to algorithmically generate an appropriate headset size. The interface will allow you to export 3D files (in common formats like .obj and .stl) that can be imported into 3D-modeling software like Maya, Inventor, or SolidWorks for further customization. Additionally, you will have the option to order a fully functional pre-printed version of an appropriately sized headset and desired components.\nA digital mockup of the \"OpenBCI 3D-Printable Headset Assembly Environment\"\nWe will be publishing all OpenBCI 3D-Printable Headset files on our Github so that they can be improved by the masses. We hope that the open-source community takes our initial designs and perfects them over time, adapting them for numerous use-cases. 3D printing capabilities are improving rapidly each day and we think the field of BCI has a lot to gain from the potentials of this growing technology.\nResearch-grade EEG equipment is known to be very cumbersome and very expensive. As hardware has become smaller and cheaper, there are more portable products available that will read your brainwaves and tell you something about your mental state. Today, the leading commercial brain-computer interface companies distribute fixed devices with limited or closed access to the algorithms that translate raw EEG signals into meaningful data. These devices are powerful and effective for application development but not ideal for R&D requiring adjustable hardware setups and direct control over the signal processing techniques. The hardware and software behind OpenBCI are totally transparent; there are no blackbox algorithms or proprietary hardware designs! Not only is it fully accessible, but it is powered by an open-source community of hardware and software builders, making it easy to approach for creators of any skill level and ideal for researchers who modify their system design to suit a specific study. The OpenBCI platform is intended to serve as a malleable tool in the rapidly growing field of brain-computer interfacing.Your donations will allow us to leverage large-scale production and they will support the OpenBCI team to grow and work with the community that you will be helping to found. When you support us at one of the pre-order levels you will receive your OpenBCI hardware in the Spring of 2014, and then our collective efforts to accelerate brain science and research will really kick off! Whether you're a scientist, researcher, hacker, maker, student... your participation will add to the growing pool of available code, implementation tutorials, and user experience. Then we will all be crowd-sourcing brain research! How cool is that!?\nThe story begins back in the fall of 2011 when Conor was one of Joel\u2019s Physical Computing students in the Parsons MFA Design & Technology program. Conor, who had always enjoyed taking things apart, stumbled upon a hack done by some engineers at NYU\u2019s ITP program. The hack involved taking apart a toy EEG called the Mindflex and porting the brain data into Arduino and Processing. Conor, who was new to neuroscience and electronics, quickly realized the amazing possibilities of interfacing the brain with low-cost, open-source, brain-sensing tools. Joel and Conor worked together to create a hack that allowed EEG data to be stored over extended periods of time by connecting to an Android mobile application through a wearable brainwave-sensing hat.\nConor's BrainCap that he created while taking Physical Computing w/ Joel\nIn completing the project, they both learned a lot about the field of commercial and DIY brain-sensors, but were frustrated by existing systems, due to their limited number of electrodes, fixed headset positions, and the proprietary algorithms that made sense of the raw brain data. Because Joel and Conor were both actively using open-source hardware and software, they longed for a more powerful, open-source alternative.\nThen, last winter, out of the blue, Joel got invited to be part of a team applying for a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) grant awarded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to design a portable, high quality, low-cost, open-source, EEG system. The grant was a result of the larger BRAIN Initiative launched by the Obama administration last April. BRAIN stands for Brain Researching Through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies, and involves the approximate investment of $100 million \"to give scientists the tools they need to get a dynamic picture of the brain and better understand how we think, learn, and remember.\"\nThe request to be involved in the project was a crazy coincidence for Joel and he jumped at the chance! Naturally, he got Conor involved due to his passion for the challenges surrounding the field. Now, almost a year later, Joel and Conor have taken their research and development from working under the SBIR grant and turned it into OpenBCI, a fully open-source EEG system for everyone!\nLast summer was spent prototyping and testing the hardware circuit designs and building the first versions of the software platforms to visualize the OpenBCI data. The first prototype was unveiled at the World Maker Faire in New York, where Joel and Conor captured the imaginations of folks who had a chance to see their brainwaves for the first time! OpenBCI was honored to receive the Maker Faire Educator\u2019s Choice Award!\nNow OpenBCI is hoping to leverage the support of the Kickstarter community to make the OpenBCI board available to the general public. If the Kickstarter campaign is successful, Joel, Conor, and the rest of the growing OpenBCI community will be fulfilling a dream conceived only last year to make an open-source EEG platform available to everyone!\nThe community that has begun to develop around OpenBCI is one of the main driving forces for us taking the project further. We were very excited by the amazing feedback and support we received at the NYC Maker Faire and it made us realize the importance of getting more people involved.\nBjorn showing his brainwaves to his daughter at Maker Faire NYC back in September\nIn addition to making and distributing hardware and software designs, we are committed to focusing a lot of energy on community outreach. In November, we hosted the first OpenBCI Hackathon in collaboration with Thoughtworks NYC and it was huge success. Over the course of weekend-long event, 35 creators from a variety of backgrounds, ranging from electrical engineering to software design to visual communications, joined us in an amazing effort to help expand the capability of our hardware and its rapidly growing suite of software frameworks. Participants of all ages joined us from a number of elite institutions, including MIT, NYU, Parsons, and Columbia.\nJoel and Morgan hacking an OpenBCI Board V2 at the OpenBCI/Thoughtworks Hackathon\nMoving forward, we want to coordinate many more hackathons and meetups around general techniques of interfacing the brain, showing how OpenBCI and other EEG platforms can be used in tandem to utilize brain data. We love to host hackathons, and if you back us at the Hackathon Reward level, we will coordinate a weekend long event in your town to grow the OpenBCI community and code base. We hope to lower the barrier of entry to the OpenBCI platform so that makers of all ages and skill-sets can contribute to solving the design challenges around putting EEG in real world environments. We plan to build out a well-organized and well-managed forum for sharing questions, ideas, and research. In addition, we hope to see notch hackers emerging who want to share their research and development through an Official OpenBCI Hackers aggregate blog section of our website.\n.\nConor explaining Aisen's brainwaves through the OpenBCI Brainwave Visualizer at a hackathon\nThere are already a few early adopters of the OpenBCI technology who are doing really cool things with the system. Our official \u201cResearcher & Developer At Large,\u201d Chip Audette, has been grinding away on some amazing EEG hacks, demonstrating the capabilities of the OpenBCI platform. We hope others will join Chip on leading the way of showing what OpenBCI can really do when there are many minds colliding on the same problems.\nChip ecstatically talking about his brainwaves at Maker Faire NYC\nWe have witnessed the amazing capabilities of open-source platforms like Arduino, ChipKIT, Rasberry Pi, openFrameworks, Processing, and many others, and we are modeling a lot of the OpenBCI structure after their transparent and community-driven practices.\nIf you help us get funded, we are going to expand our website to enable Chip and others to have a centralized forum for sharing knowledge and R&D techniques. We are in the early stages of developing an online portal for fostering crowd-sourced EEG research and experiments. The site will be a social platform for researchers to meet subjects and share code, experiment protocols, and data. The portal will have 3 major components. First it will serve as a social network for all OpenBCI researchers and developers to connect and share ideas around future research topics and implementations of OpenBCI. Secondly, there will be a platform to create experiments with structured hardware and electrode placement configurations, allowing researchers to crowd-source data collection via a well-structured research initiative. Lastly there will be an organized and completely open repository of data collected by OpenBCI and other EEG hardware.\nTo help get established and nascent research organizations started with OpenBCI, we are offering an Official Research Partner reward level, which includes an invitation (for up to 5 members of your team) to our Research Partner Conference to be held in the Spring of 2014. Research Partners will also receive 5 OpenBCI Boards or Daisy-Chain Modules, an electrode cap identical to the one seen in our video, and an Electrode Starter Kit. Your entire group will also get beta access to our online portal for collaborative research and data sharing. \nSTEAM stands for Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics. STEAM is the new STEM! The presence of EEGs in every classroom in America would stimulate the imagination of youth and promote science technology and creativity. OpenBCI wants to be a part of STEAM education and hands-on science activities in academic environments. If you support us at the \u2018Donate A Board\u2019 reward level, we will donate an OpenBCI Board & Electrode Starter Kit  to the high school or university of your choice.\n\n\nJoel has experience bringing product ideas through prototyping and into production with the Pulse Sensor project (Thanks Kickstarter!) and his work as a consultant with artists and designers.

Bringing a complex technology product to market has many challenges and points of potential breakdown, but we have fully functioning prototypes that we\u2019ve tested in numerous environments. All that\u2019s left is to synthesize the final design, and schedule a production prototype run before mass producing the OpenBCI Board and OpenBCI Daisy-Chain Module.\n\nEngineering\nMost of the design work to bring OpenBCI into production has already been completed. Our current hardware version functions as a shield for Arduino and other Arduino-pin-compatible development platforms. We\u2019ve tested code on the Arduino UNO, DUE, Freescale FRDM board (mbed compiler), and ChipKit Uno32. Software implementations have been designed in Processing, openFrameworks, Python, and MATLAB. We\u2019ve successfully Daisy-Chained two boards and verified up to 16 channels of EEG. The Bluetooth connection has been prototyped and tested. Our final design will be a wireless, re-programmable, 8-channel EEG platform with SD card data-logging and electrode expansion capability. \n\nManufacturing\nJoel, one of our artist/engineers, has strong relationships with manufacturers, and we have a good grip on the parts supply-chain, so we hope you will put your trust in us to make good on our promises! We have been working with an established factory in Taiwan that we've used in past projects. They are a large firm with many clients, and they have been helping us throughout every step of the prototyping phase.

All you have to do is use your imagination. MakerSwarm gives the power of X-ray vision to makers, so that they can \"see\" into any of the smart devices around them, from cell phones to TV sets, from connected thermostats to wearable sensors. It's about giving you visual tools so that you can grab hold of any capability within a device and drag and drop it into a new app that spans across a swarm of your friends' devices in a massive peer-to-peer community.\nPeople and Their Swarms\nMakerSwarm lowers the bar for building never-before-seen Internet of Everything experiences and unlocks the power of trillions of connected devices so that the best makers can earn rewards in the market of ideas. \nAnd, if you're a parent, teacher, or anyone who has anything to do with improving kids' lives, then MakerSwarm is the perfect way to engage both sides of their young minds. Think circuitry meets architecture, or logic meets design. MakerSwarm will activate their left and right brains in STEAM thinking\u2014simultaneously teaching them science, technology, engineering, art, and math.   \nHow We Got Here:\nSince the early 1990s, MAYA\u2019s work in both the commercial sphere and in basic research has focused on narrowing the chasm that divides the users of computers from the developers of computers. For example, in the 90s we built a demonstration of a 3D desktop called 200 Points of Light to explore what would happen if you could directly manipulate all the documents on your computer. This later led to what Xerox PARC, Intel, and Microsoft all called \"the first 3-Dimensional document management system\" called Workscape. Soon thereafter we teamed up with the SAGE group at Carnegie Mellon to build Visage, a prototype software environment for exploring and visualizing large amounts of diverse information. Throughout the 90s and early 2000s, we continued our research into pervasive computing culminating in the publishing of our field guide for the Internet of Everything, called Trillions. Below are two excerpts from Trillions.\nIn 2010 MAYA proposed a research project to be funded by the United States Government's \"Department of Mad Science,\" or DARPA (the same organization that fueled the creation of the Internet and more recently self-driving cars by the likes of Google). We wanted to build a platform that enables power users, using interchangeable components, to build \u201capplications\u201d with highly usable interfaces without resorting to long, complex development processes and teams of programmers. We thought of it as a roll of duct tape for the MacGyvers out there, and code named it \"MacG.\"\nMacG Concept Sketch\nIn 2012, MAYA finished the DARPA research and delivered the precursor to MakerSwarm. We wanted to foster a community of people who could innovate and cobble together apps across devices without waiting for a costly, highly organized software development cycle. That first prototype had limited support for devices and had no network access. But, it was a valuable proof of concept that explored the possibilities that open up when normal people can mashup hardware and software.  \nWe decided to invest our own time and money into taking this early concept to the next level. Over the last year, we've built out support for peer-to-peer networking among devices, added a host of other components from toys to home automation systems (for a full list of components so far, check out our list here) and have started experimenting with robotic \"hives\" that can connect to the swarm and activate all sorts of things in the real world with servos buttons, dials, and displays.\nIn the spring, we entered the big DEMO conference in San Francisco with our MakerSwarm idea and locked ourselves in our basement laboratory until we had something amazing to show.\nMakerSwarm Labs\nStoryboard For DEMO Conference\nPracticing for DEMO\nWe went to DEMO and won the DEMO God award for most ambitious demo.\nHowever, we realized that we weren't doing enough, and we weren't able to move fast enough on our own. We also started to hear from all sorts of people who wanted to help out, become test pilots for the swarm, and lower the barrier even more so that a 10-year-old could assemble a swarm of 10,000 devices into a never before seen idea in 10 minutes.\nWow! That's a challenge. Could we do it? Could MakerSwarm help the next generation of kids dream bigger?\nBrainstorming with Students\nWe began running brainstorming sessions with kids, parents, and school teachers and saw that there was a huge opportunity to take MakerSwarm to the next level. \nWhat if we could build game mechanics right into the system so that anyone could learn to build big ideas and have fun while they gained mastery?\nAs users learned new skills they could unlock new capabilities and earn credits along the way...\nThat's when we realized we needed your help!\nWe want to mobilize a community of inventors, dreamers, and malcontents who are interested in making unheard of, never before seen, crazy, artistic, stunning, and maybe, just maybe, world-changing, ideas.\nWhew! Did you really read all that stuff? Do you want to be a test pilot and help us get this out into the world? We can't do it alone and we know you'll have better ideas than we do.\nMore Details on MakerSwarm:  \nHave you ever wanted to connect your phone to your garage door? Or, maybe you\u2019d like your phone to alert you when someone sneaks cookies from the pantry? How about going to a wedding where every photo anyone takes is automatically uploaded to a shared space? Well, all you need is the right authoring tool to make it happen\u2026 and that\u2019s why you need MakerSwarm.\nWe give you the superpower to be a hacker (even if you\u2019re not). MakerSwarm is an authoring tool that gives you the ability to make any idea you can imagine. You can unlock the mysteries of your own phones and tablets to build useful, innovative, and even eccentric things, for a full list of current support features see: http://www.makerswarm.com/v2/info/. Think about it\u2014the possibilities are limitless. With MakerSwarm, you simply tap, connect, and build.\nUsing all the features of your Android device, MakerSwarm could help you invent an app to brew your morning joe or power down your basement studio from your phone. It\u2019s intuitive enough for a novice or a child to use but it also has scripting and an SDK that's open so that an ambitious programmer can customize it. \nWe even offer a \u201cStarter Maker Kit\u201d which is a box of fun gadgets (including 2 proximity sensors, 6 NFC sensor tags, 1 NFC key fob, deck of idea cards and QR sticker codes) to help you start creating your own apps.\nWith the full version of MakerSwarm, you can even connect with other DIY hackers and form new communities. Then, you can communicate with anyone else in your community and create even more robust apps. Plus, share your DIY creations at the MakerSwarm Marketplace. If other people buy what you\u2019ve created, you\u2019ll get points to buy other DIY creations.\nFinally, enhance your MakerSwarm with stackable robot hive modules, a revolutionary product which allows you to integrate a variety of things\u2014 digital or physical\u2014into one functioning unit. The hive modules we\u2019ve created will make it even easier for you to be a DIY hacker. The 3-hive module package includes: input/output expander, WiFi connector and a base. Plus, we'll include an analog dial, button, and character display to get you started building. The 5-hive module package includes everything in the 3-hive module package plus an Insteon/x10 module so that you can manage all your electrical devices used for home automation and a servo, a motor to power your dreams.\nMakerSwarm Hive Demo:\nStacked Modules\nHive Modules\nBut we can\u2019t do it ourselves just yet. We need you. Help us finish MakerSwarm. Through user testing sessions, we can refine the user interface for MakerSwarm and finish building the MakerSwarm Marketplace.  Together, we can launch something truly revolutionary: anyone, anywhere in the world, equipped to invent our future by using a visual authoring tool. \nIn appreciation for certain level backers, be a proud wearer of this first edition MakerSwarm t-shirt:\nAnd a few high-level backers will be proud to have their own MakerSwarm Action Figure on their desks.\n What We Will Do With The Kickstarter Funds:\nInterface Design - We want MakerSwarm to be accessible to practically everyone.  We will use a large portion of funding to overhaul the current user interface (UI) by making it simpler and more inviting, building useful learning tools, and streamlining the design process.\nUser Experience (UX) Testing - We will use a portion of the funding to conduct usability testing with a wide range of users.\nThe Marketplace - Makers should be able to share, trade, and possibly sell their blueprints to other members of the MakerSwarm community.  With your help, we will build a marketplace that does just that.\nStrengthen our Network - We will create a robust \"personal cloud\" network layer that handles failures gracefully and is capable of managing complex peer-to-peer network communications so your swarms will work even if you have zero infrastructure.\nAdd Hive Logic - Hive Logic will allow blueprints to define the types of devices that can be part of a running blueprint without the Maker finding that specific device by name. This makes it even easier for Makers to create.\nAdd Maker Profiles/Security - Makers will create a profile with MakerSwarm that will allow them to share, collaborate, and build blueprints with other MakerSwarm Makers. Profiles will also give members of the swarm the ability to connect to their favorite social network and manage privacy and resource allocation.\nNew Components - New components will be created for external devices and web services that are currently supported. List of current components can be found here under \"Toys and Gadgets\": http://www.makerswarm.com/v2/info/\nScripting Component - For more advanced Makers, we will build a scripting component that will let users write small scripts into their blueprints.\nComponent Software Developers Kit (SDK) - We will document the SDK to allow hardcore Makers to build their own device components.\nSchedule:\nNote: One of MAYA's successful spin-out companies, LUMA Institute, teaches Human-Centered Design methods so that product developers put people first. We'll be using LUMA techniques during the whole development cycle. Putting people first with constant feedback builds better applications.\nMonth 1: We will deliver an alpha version of MakerSwarm to our test pilots (everyone who has backed us). We will also begin development of our Profiles/Security layer. \nMonth 2: We will create a Scripting Component and finish the Profiles/Security layer and begin work on solidifying the network layer.\nMonth 3: Deliver new version of MakerSwarm to test pilots that includes the new Scripting Component and the Profiles/Security layer. Design our plans for upgrading the UI based on the early user sessions that we'll be running throughout the project. \nMonth 4: Begin development on the marketplace, UI enhancements, and Hive Logic.\nMonth 5: Deliver new version of MakeSwarm to test pilots that includes some of the new UI enchantments and the beginnings of the marketplace, and finish development of the marketplace and UI enhancements.\nMonth 6: Make final adjustments to UI based on the ongoing user sessions and test pilot feedback. Solidify code base for final release. Write documents for the Component SDK and begin the process of getting MakerSwarm into Google Play.\nMonth 7: We'll deliver all our rewards and then go celebrate with beer and cheese!\nMeet the Team:\n Mickey McManus, President & CEO: As president, CEO, and principal of MAYA Design, Mickey McManus leads a highly-skilled, interdisciplinary team that works at the intersection of complex, information-rich technology and human experience.

They make carrying anything a hassle, and we couldn't find a good quality electric scooter anywhere. So as a side project during our free time, we decided to make our own!\nWhile in design school in 2006, Elliot Ortiz came up with a concept for a cargo scooter. Years later in 2010, Elliot, Zach Levenberg, and Lit founder & RISD grad Danny Kim built the first scooter prototype out of a variety of off-the-shelf parts and a hand-carved pink foam body. Danny was intrigued with the idea of developing an electric version, and after a few years of prototyping and development...\nprototypes, prototypes, prototypes\u2026\n...we arrived at kubo!\nBOOM.\n45 mph top speed\nUp to 50 miles per charge\n300 lbs capacity, cargo + rider\n22\" square cargo space with tie-down hooks, loops, and rails for a wide variety of ways to secure your stuff\nOn-board charger\u2014charge in a few hours from any wall outlet\nAdjustable-height seat to accomodate a wide range of riders, from 5'0\" to 6'5\"\nSmall lockable stow compartment, perfect for extra bungee cords, phone, etc\nIntegrated digital speedometer, odometer, and voltmeter (battery indicator)\nLED headlight and tail light\nAdjustable rear suspension\n3 kW high-torque rear hub motor with regen braking\nFront disc brake\nDesigned & manufactured in San Francisco, California\nWe think kubo is the bee's knees, and we think you will too!

We know, because we already did it! We built a fully-functional alpha prototype, as shown in the photos/video above. We identified and lined up most of our vendors for parts and supplies. But some development remains...what do we have left to do?\n\nWell, thankfully we already have a crackin' team. We're a team of experienced and well-educated makers (including two Art Center grads, Eric and Enoch!), with many years experience working on electric vehicles. Our founder, Danny Kim, has even built his own SUV! So we definitely have the necessary hands-on experience to make this happen. There are some minor design/engineering issues to address and some basic work to prepare our CAD models for production, but we already have the designers and engineers on board to take care of that.\n\nWe'll need to build up our factory. Our space right now is perfect for prototyping and development, but we'll need a larger space for actual production. We already have a space lined up, and our Production Advisor, Mark Thorogood, used his 25 years experience at BMW and the Rover Group to lay out a production plan. We just need to purchase the tooling, move into the new space, and set everything up.\n\nThen we'll hire some employees for the actual fabrication and manufacturing. San Francisco is the epicenter of the maker movement, so that shouldn't be a problem in the least.\n\nOnce we have that set up, we can begin manufacturing scooters! We don't anticipate running into any major engineering challenges, as we've already addressed them developing our current prototype.

Each issue will feature an original story by a new artist. The material will be unrelated to Blade Runner, but will take place in a similar hi-tech dystopian universe. The issues will be 5.5 x 7.5\", 16 pages, and risographed in two colors on French Paper.\nWe're beginning with just a two-issue subscription, but the series will hopefully continue indefinitely. The first two issues will be drawn by James O and A.P. Westcott, shipping in March and April, respectively.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE: 2ND EDITION. The support so far has been incredible. Due to the wonderful and unanticipated explosion of backers, the original risograph edition of the zine ($13 reward level) is permanently sold out. However, we're producing an unlimited 2ND EDITION with a few differences. These will be printed digitally, so the images will be sharper, but lack the cool print quality of risography. The paper will be of equal thickness, but it won't be from French Paper Co. The content and everything else stays the same! Thanks so much for your continued support.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nReplicants unite! We're bringing you a fan-made tribute to one of the greatest sci-fi films of all time, Ridley Scott's Blade Runner. Known for its futuristic, dystopian aesthetic, the Blade Runner universe provides the perfect fodder for a collaborative art project. In an off-world mining colony, twenty-five of us illustrators have taken up the challenge, and plan to collect our work in a super high-quality booklet. But we need your help to ensure it reaches Earth.\nMonica McClain\nNoah MacMillan\nJames O\nA.P. Westcott\nMax Temescu\nThe Zine\nThe zine will be staple-bound, A5 size (5.8 x 8.3\"), made of the highest quality paper (sustainably-milled at the incomparable French Paper Co.), and printed in two colors on a risograph printer-duplicator. Risographs are manufactured in Japan and can be thought of (conceptually) as automatic screen printers. They look like photocopiers, but instead of using toner, they force real ink through a stencil - as such, they are beloved among illustrators and comic artists for their vibrant and tactile print quality. Basically, we're shooting for the same quality as an art print you might hang on your wall - except it's an entire book.\n\nIllustrations include new interpretations of favorite scenes, futuristic cityscapes, fake ads, character collages, parodies, and more. The sample images above are digital approximations of how the printed pages will look. Once on paper, the artwork will appear less precise, and assume a more lively, handmade print aesthetic. Slight misregistration and imperfections in the ink ensure no two copies will be the same. The final product will be a piece of beautifully gritty ephemera that would not be out of place on a rain-soaked newsstand in 2019 Los Angeles.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE: RISOGRAPH EDITION SOLD OUT. See top^ for info on the 2ND EDITION.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOther Rewards\nThe digital PDF version of the zine will be scanned from an unbound copy of the printed zine. In lieu of giving you the digital versions of the artwork, you'll get to see the richness of ink on paper.\nIn-process photos will be posted as the zines are printed and hand-assembled.\nSmallprint\nThis is, of course, a fan-made labor of love that is not affiliated with anything that would make it \"official.\"\nFor Non-US backers: shipping costs are already included in your pledge, but we cannot be responsible for any additional VAT or import duties levied by your country.

Thank you, everyone! Thank you, MailChimp!\nThanks to the 10,500+ of you who make this show possible. We received the extra $20,000 grant from MailChimp because of an incredible surge of support on Thursday. I\u2019ve long since run out of clever ways to express my gratitude. I have new empathy for the greeting card writers of the world.\nIf you\u2019ve been following along, you\u2019ll notice a pattern in the stretch goals of this campaign: fixing what's broken in the public radio system. Don't get me wrong-- I do this work because I love it, and it has been my privilege to be an independent radio producer for more than a dozen years. I am extremely lucky that I get to do this for a living.\nHowever, there are things about the public radio system that need to change. One by one, our stretch goals have been addressing these issues. You\u2019ve proven that the audience will reward innovation. You\u2019ve provided health care stipends to our contract workers. You\u2019ve ended the endless internship. It has been amazing to watch these goals get shattered so quickly, because I always knew that the right audience would consider these things to be important.\nThe time has come to replicate this across public radio. We\u2019re creating Radiotopia.\nFor a couple years, I\u2019ve been scheming with PRX to create a collective of exceptional radio shows that will push the boundaries of public radio. Modeled after 99% Invisible, we want to provide support for a select group of creator-driven, high-quality, entrepreneurial programs that will establish a path to success for the most talented audio producers. We call it Radiotopia.*\nThe most common question I\u2019m asked, by far, is \u201cWhat other podcasts do you listen to?\u201d There are great ones out there and I want more. The hardest part of creating a new show is getting started and then getting enough audience and support to move into regular production. We want to provide a platform where the best producers can find an audience and flourish. That has always been my ultimate goal, and it\u2019s time to get it done.\nSo here's the plan: pledges collected up to the $350,000 mark will go towards rounding out the 99pi 2014 budget: relocation money for our next hire, raising freelance rates, creating an experimental fund for us to try things that we haven't thought of yet, and also buying some new equipment (Avery is using Sam's computer from college and most of our gear is older than my boys).\nAnything pledged beyond that threshold--$350,000--will go toward establishing a seed fund for programs in PRX\u2019s Radiotopia.\nCreating this support network helps 99% Invisible achieve long-term sustainability, and everyone will benefit from more great radio in the world. I kept thinking that an ecosystem of other 99% Invisibles would spring up after our initial success, and a few have, but not nearly enough. And the few programs out there are in constant risk of going away without a network to support them. So, let\u2019s build it ourselves.\n-roman\n*The term \u201cradiotopia\u201d came from Julie Shapiro when she was at the Third Coast International Audio Festival. Many of the most creative, independent producers of public radio get together every year at the Third Coast Conference to find our community and explore our craft. Julie called this gathering and all the great plans we had for audio storytelling \u201cradiotopia.\u201d It\u2019s a place where everything is radio and everything is really good.\nStretch Goals:\nOver $350,000- Start the Radiotopia program fund.\nOver $400,000- Respect.\nOver $500,000- Mad respect.\n$590,808- Take down Planet Money as the highest-funded podcast on Kickstarter.\n99% Invisible is a popular public radio show and podcast about design, architecture and all the thought that goes into the things most people don\u2019t even think about.\nThe show started as a side project I made in my bedroom at night, and after two years of making the program, I turned to Kickstarter to see if I should keep it going. To my great surprise, the Season 3 fund-raising campaign broke all previous records for a journalism project on Kickstarter. We hired a producer (Sam Greenspan!), overhauled the website, grew the audience, and made the show better than it has ever been.\nFor Season 4, we want to Kickstart the next giant leap in the evolution of 99% Invisible:\nWe want to go weekly.\nWe're staffing up and going pro. This involves hiring more help (contract reporters, editors, a production coordinator, paid interns), moving into a proper office, and commissioning more stories. The 52 weekly episodes of Season 4 will start February 4, 2014 and run for one year.\nWe are making a new kind of public radio in a new way. I must admit, after the huge success and growth of the show in the last year, I thought the public radio decision-makers and granting institutions would really get behind 99% Invisible, but they are slow to act. It's OK, their deliberate nature is part of why we love them, but it means it is up to you to tell us if we should expand and make more. This is as public as public radio gets.\nOur dream is to hire Sean Cole as a monthly contributor. Not only is he the best reporter in public radio, he also produced one of our favorite 99% Invisible stories, \"Some Other Sign That People Do Not Totally Regret Life.\"\nREWARDS\nT-Shirts!\nOur awesome new shirts were designed by Chop Shop and they will be fulfilling the t-shirt orders. We are only guaranteeing that they will arrive by January, but we will do everything in our power to get t-shirts to you by Christmas. After the campaign is over, you will get a Kickstarter survey that collects your t-shirt size and address.

Each with black line artwork and a one color accent layer. Final version may vary from what is pictured below. Each notebook contains 32 pages of grid-lined paper.\nDazzle Pocket Notebook\nHeyoon Pocket Notebook\nSecret Staircases Pocket Notebook\nPosters!\nSteve McCarthy created a brilliant new poster/desktop image that combines a bunch of our favorite things on one stunning map.

An underwriting partnership with 99% Invisible will demonstrate that your company is very passionate about all aspects of design. During this campaign, underwriting spots are discounted and have lots of bonus prizes and goodies. Get in touch and we will work out all the details: roman@prx.org\nCustom Recording\nAs part of the \"Two-of-everything\" pack, I'll record something unique for you. It could be an outgoing voicemail message, or a favorite short story, video narration, anything under 30 minutes that doesn't make me cringe (I reserve the right to refuse the recording on moral or ethical grounds--e.g. I won't record the narration for your racist cult recruiting video). This is only for non-commercial use. Last year, people used this prize to great effect. I voiced cool videos for The Noun Project and Sing Statistics.\nProducer for a day\nPick from a couple dozen potential days (we'll make something work) and we'll invite you into the 99% Invisible production. You'll sit in on a story meeting, critique whatever rough draft we have in process, go out to lunch (probably for pho, we love pho), and just hang out all day. Plus, you'll take home all the swag you see on this page. You just need to get yourself to Oakland.\nMusic\nThe music in the video is courtesy of two great bands I love, Melodium and Les Savy Fav. Melodium has inspired more of my radio stories than any other artist in existence and Les Savy Fav is quite simply the greatest rock n' roll band alive. If you have spare money after this campaign, go buy an album or two.

PyroPet is a family of animal shaped candles that each reveal a surprise within as they burn. The first PyroPet product is a cute little cat called \"Kisa\". (\"Kisa\" means \"kitty\" in Icelandic).\nAs the sun begins to set and the shadows lengthen on the wall take a match and light the wick on Kisa. Settle into a cozy chair and relax. Watch as Kisa burns. Look at her shadow on the wall. A lazy warping profile of a kitten in the gathering evening darkness. But look closer. That is no kitten's profile. That is a skeleton's profile! Now look back at your candle. Your cute kitten's now melted skin has peeled back to reveal a menacing flame scorched skeleton. Its sharp teeth glinting in the candle light and fire filled eyes staring back at you unblinking and unamused.\nFeatured in:\n\"This Halloween, burn a kitten with PyroPet!\" - VICE\n\"...it\u2019s eerie, a bit creepy, and i couldn\u2019t stop staring. \" - NOTCOT\n\"Like they say naughty is the new cute!\" -YANKO DESIGN\nHow did the idea come about?\nThe idea came to Thorunn when she was thinking about the way people use candles:\n\"One day as I watched the chubby body of a jolly Santa Claus shaped candle slowly melt, deform, and perish into a sad pool of wax I wondered if I could elevate this common place ritual sacrifice into a true theatre of the macabre in wax.\"\nShe came up with the idea of embedding a metal skeleton within a cat shaped candle. A sinister form, lurking, biding its time, waiting to be revealed.\n\"Cats have always had a split personality. One minute purring contentedly the next hissing and temperamental. While they are cute and huggable they have a dark side associated with witchcraft and sorcery. Kisa was created to capture this duality. Kisa performs a slowly unfolding transformation from cute kitty to brooding skeleton.\"\n(Photos by: Glamour Et Cetera.)\nHow is the candle produced?\nWe have developed a special production process to create the PyroPet products. This process involves cutting a shape out of aluminium sheet, folding it into a skeleton shape, and then inserting the skeleton into the mould used to shape the candle. Our approach is a synthesis of high-tech production and traditional handcraft.\nPhotos from prototype development:\nProduct details:\nThe dimensions of a Kisa candle are: 6.7 x  2.9 x 4.5 inches  (17 x 7.5 x  11.5 cm)\nEach candle should have a burning time of approximately 20 hours.\nEach candle is slightly different and will burn in it's own unique way. We recommend placing your candle on a plate with a minimum diameter of 10 inches (25cm) to contain the wax as it melts. One of our rewards also include a lovely glass jar that will safely contain the wax and help prolong the burning time of the candle.\nNote: Images of the Kisa candles have been featured in various blogs and magazines where it was presented under the name of \"The Devil's Pet\".\nWhat is the current stage of the project?\nWe are ready to start PyroPet production as soon as the Kickstarter campaign finishes. Production and delivery will take approximately 3 - 3.5 months. This is what happens during that time:\nWeek 1-4: Production of tools and packaging.\nWeek 5-8:  Producing and packing the candles.\nWeek 9-11: Shipment to USA/Europe\nWeek 12-14: Dispatch rewards to our backers.\n\nWhy do we need money?\nWe have spent the past two years developing PyroPet production technology and finalising the first designs for the PyroPet family of products. What we need now are the funds for our first production run in a factory, industrial tooling, packaging, and marketing.\nAs a reward for supporting us you will receive Kisa at a special reduced Kickstarter price. In addition as a special thank you from us you will receive some nice extras and rewards.\nRewards:\nFREE US SHIPPING WITH ALL REWARDS.\nFOR Non-US customers: we will be shipping all orders from the UK, these orders will incur an extra shipping and VAT cost.

They all said the same thing: \"Our customers don\u2019t care about domestically produced products.\" We call bullsh*t, but we need your help to prove them wrong.\n Let's give American Manufacturing its own yellow ribbon... a wearable way to show your support for the war they're fighting daily.  \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAbout the Bluelace itself: We asked one of America's very last shoelace manufacturers to produce the very best shoelace they'd ever made. \nAdding extra pressure to the pot, we promised them that if they could develop something truly impressive, it had the potential to become more than just a simple shoelace; it could become a symbol! \nAnd this symbol could do more than just help their business, it could help break the ongoing cycle of outsourcing, offshoring, and making things cheaper, faster and worse. It could help ALL American manufacturers. \nWe said that if this shoelace was amazing enough, and we get it into enough shoes and tied to enough wrists, it would let retailers know that cost isn't the only thing driving their customers' buying habits, and that if they stocked the right domestically produced goods, their customers would be willing to give them a chance. \nTHEY CAME BACK WITH A SHOELACE UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'D EVER SEEN: A triple-dense, double-waxed canvas lace, tipped in Aluminum. Could they be the everlasting gobstoppers of shoelaces? They're certainly light-years ahead of whatever cheap lace came pre-loaded in your imported sneakers. \nSo how do we know THE BLUELACE is better? It's a good question. Truth be told, we weren't sure how to test 'em either. So we called our friend, American strongman Matt Mills and asked if he could put them through the ringer. We wanted to see if he could rip them like a phone book. He said he had a better idea though. \nWith nothing but a single pair of BLUELACES linking his harness to a set of ultra-heavy duty tow straps, he was able to pull a 13,000 pound truck!\nIf they're strong enough to pull a 13,000 pound truck, they're probably tough enough for whatever you'll put them through... they just might be sturdy enough to pull us all together!\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhy lace up blue at all? \nLacing up blue lets retailers know that you're willing to give a second look to domestically produced products. \nLacing up blue lets American manufacturers -- the men and women fighting to innovate and bring better-built products to market at a time when their competitors undercut them by cutting corners abroad -- know you appreciate the war they're fighting daily. \nEqually important, whether worn in a sneaker, boot, or tied to a wrist, lacing up blue is fun, bright, bold and vibrant.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhether or not you decide to take the plunge and lace up blue, we'd love it if you kept the following in mind this holiday seasons:\nAccording to printed reports, the United States has lost a staggering 32 percent of its manufacturing jobs since the year 2000.\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, every $1 spent on American made products fuels another $1.40 in spending elsewhere in the US economy. \nAccording to The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation, on average, 1,276 manufacturing jobs were lost every day for the past 12 years.\nAccording to Diane Sawyer and ABC World News, if each of us spent just $64 on American made goods during our holiday shopping, the result would be 200,000 new jobs.\n For this particular project though, per $5 contribution\u2026\n$1 goes to Processing fees (10% of all money received is paid directly to New York City-based Kickstarter and Amazon for processing the transaction)\n$2 goes directly to our shoelace factory in Portsmouth Ohio for manufacturing the laces using American materials and shipping them to our warehouse. \n$1 covers shipping, this includes the stamps purchased from USPS and the envelope bought in bulk from our Texas-based manufacturer.\n$1 is paid to our Henderson, Nevada warehouse for packing each individual order (likely a set of BLUELACES plus whatever additional goodies we decide to throw in the pouch).\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur stretch goals are all about helping to spread the word and telling OTHER American Manufacturer's stories.  \nWhen Flint and Tinder first launched on Kickstarter a little more than a year ago, we found that what drove the success of our underwear project was a simple idea: For the first time in a very long time, by telling their story in the video below, we connected the buyers with the makers in a very powerful way. \nIt was exciting stuff! And that connection ultimately helped us to keep 100 people employed and the factory doors open for far longer than anyone had forecasted. \nNow, with your support, we want to tell OTHER, amazing American manufacturing stories through video with the hope that we can make an even larger impact on their businesses...\nStories like the Fortune 500 CEO who gave it all up to revive a New England wool blanket factory. \nStories like the American machine shop that used old-world gearing techniques that helped to land the Rover on Mars. \nStories like the young, energetic team who bought a hat factory and are making the old cool using a mix of modern marketing and classic style. \nFor the first 5,000 backers and every 10,000 there after, who lend a hand to make THE BLUELACE PROJECT a reality, we'll produce another video and distribute it direct to your inbox.\nKnow of an amazing American manufacturing story? Send us an email with your story idea(s) and if it's a story that fits the bill (and we have the # of backers to do it! ) we'll send our high-end video production team around the country to capture the best of best. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur 10-Year Hoodie project taught us that making a great product in a bunch of colors and sizes can get pretty complicated.

My name is Jesse Alexander. I\u2019m a photographer, and I\u2019m principally known for my motorsport images. At 84 years of age, I've made thousands of photographs in this field for the last 60 years and have authored at least ten books devoted to auto racing. These include works on Porsches, Ferraris, and racing that have become collector\u2019s items.\nRecently I went back into my archive and uncovered many previously unpublished images, which has prompted this latest project, MONACO, a celebration of the Grand Prix weekend in that famous principality on the Mediterranean. \nThis is not just an auto-racing book. What I\u2019ve tried to do is to paint a picture of the glamour, excitement, and romance of the golden age of motorsport in this tiny country that once a year hosts the most famous Grand Prix race in the world.\nSteve McQueen, Princess Grace, Prince Rainier, and many other celebrities were all part of that amazing scene. There were also classic Grand Prix cars with legendary drivers behind the wheel, like Sir Jackie Stewart, Phil Hill, Stirling Moss, and Juan Fangio. \nMy new book, MONACO: THE GOLDEN AGE OF THE GRAND PRIX, captures them all and much, much more.  The book is a large 12\"x12\" hard cover and consists of 160 pages of black & white and color images, many never seen before, with a beautiful Foreword by Sir Jackie Stewart. It will retail between $50-$60 USD.\nMonaco Book\nI have decided to self-publish MONACO using Kickstarter to make it happen. Please join me in bringing this exciting project into the world.

I want to capture some of that history in a deck of USPCC playing cards. \nThe spiritualist movement grew out of mesmerism\u2014which is what hypnosis used to be called. But with so much loss of life with the civil war, the spanish flu, and WWI, spiritualism became the hope for many across generations to contact more than the subconscious mind. It was a chance to reach their loved ones who had passed on. Many spiritualists believed they were able to reach \"through the veil\" and contact the spirit world. \nConsidered by some to be at best an interesting parlor distraction, by others as outright fraud, still many more viewed it as a chance to find solace, comfort, and closure to those whose lives meant the most and who's absence was unbearable.\nAll this history has for me added a lot of meaning and depth to this project. \nThe Cards\nSuits - Each suit will have a unique background as illustrated in the cards below. Also, each suit will have a theme\u2014seance, automatic writing, and spirit photography. \nQueen of Hearts\nKing of Spades - William Butler Yeats\nAce of Hearts\nKing of Hearts - Arthur Conan Doyle\nJack of Spades - Charles Dickens\nJack of Hearts\n This is a really cool Gaff card that one of our backers thought of to include in his magic routines:\nDouble-sided Gaff Card\n Elaborate aces for all suits was a stretch goal that was unlocked, here's the Ace of Spades:\nAce of Spades\nQueen of Spades\nQueen of Diamonds\n The card back has a reversible talking board design:\nCard back\nI've opted to design the number cards in circles and I'm pretty excited about it. Not only is it a unique way to design the cards, it also really fits the theme. Seances of course are circles of participants, and talking boards have prominent circles through which you read the messages:\nTen of Clubs\nEight of Hearts\nNine of Spades\nSeven of Diamonds\nYou can probably see all the work, love and passion I've put into these cards, here are some of the production details:\nProduction Details\nThis deck will be printed by the USPCC. As of now I'm planning on having it printed on Bicycle stock with \"Magic\" finish (Bee stock could become a stretch goal). It will be a limited printing\u2014limited to whatever the final tally is from this KS campaign. The deck will not however be numbered and will arrive to you cello-wrapped.\nThe Box Design\nI've spent a lot of time making sure I was getting the design right\u2014a little spooky, worn and aged, and keeping with the time period. I hope you agree that the box design captures all of that and hits the right notes aesthetically:\nTuck case\nThe Prints\nBecause of the popularity of the prints from my last project, I'm again offering woodcut prints of each royal design, the card back, and the aces. My process is to have the designs laser etched onto wood plates, I ink the plates, then run them through my press on museum-grade artist paper:\nHere's an example of the detail this process makes possible (art is from my last project):\nPrint detail\nI think there's something really rare and special about the artistry of hand pulling editions personally. I'm thrilled to offer these gallery-worthy prints for about the same as what others offer mass-produced silk screened prints or even less than Giclee prints (which are nice, but don't be fooled, they're really just ink-jet prints with a fancy name). These woodcut prints are a unique chance to own a limited edition work of art\u2014I haven't seen anyone else doing anything like this on KS.\nFrame not included - this is just a mockup.\nAll prints will be 12\" x 16\" on Stonehenge (cream color), with hand-torn deckled edges on 3 sides with the manufacturer deckle on the 4th. All prints will be 1 color only, signed and numbered editions. \nHere's a list of all prints:\nAll royals, AOS, and by demand, the box front. When/if prints are added to this list they will be included in the $500 and $1000 pledge levels by default - those levels get every print created for the project.\nAdd-Ons\nLimited Edition Deluxe Bicycle Package - $28/$34 (International)\nOnly available as an add-on, this package includes the following:\n(1) Limited Edition Bicycle brandeddeck:\nMetallic copper ink for the fine detailed areas\nEmbossing \nCopper foil stamping\n(1) Custom metal antique copper finish planchette, \n(1) Custom wood double-sided spirit board/authenticity placard with edition number\n The edition size will depend on the number of people who add this on, but due to manufacturing minimums there will be at least 1000 decks printed. The cards within are the same as the standard Oracle decks, but there is a LOT of collectability to this package which is one of the reasons I'm doing this\u2014I want it to be extra special for all of you collectors. \nOracle Uncut Sheets - $50/$75(Int.) Uncut sheets are taken off the press as they're printed at the USPCC. They show every card in the deck, front and back. Each sheet will be signed and there is no limit to the number you may add-on.

After a lot of searching over nearly two decades we decided to make the book that we want to use. We\u2019ve created many prototypes and are ready to place our first order for manufacturing\u2014and that's where we need your help. Without a significant amount of orders the manufacturers cannot make any books at all.\nWe're a small group of thinkers (designers, illustrators, writers, entrepreneurs and the like) that love to sit down with a notebook or sketchbook and give birth to interesting thoughts and ideas. While today\u2019s digital age is fantastic\u2014we love technology\u2014we\u2019ve found that our best work always starts on paper.\nFrom the very beginning we've had to ask ourselves to define and redefine what a notebook is. We came to the conclusion that a notebook is a tool\u2014a means to something greater than itself. Using this understanding as a guide we began to break down the individual subtleties that comprise the whole and improve the design in small ways. There are no gimmicks, no unnecessary parts\u2014just intelligent improvements to a simple tool.\nUsability is important, and we wanted a notebook that felt natural when used at your desk, on your couch, in the train\u2014anywhere. To do this we had to account for various use cases, including laying the book flat on a desk, holding it with one hand and writing with the other, carrying it in a backpack or purse, using it all day or just in spurts, and so on. (At roughly 5.4\" x 7.7\" it's small enough to go with you anywhere and big enough to comfortably use all day at home or work.) We\u2019ve strived to bring you a more refined book through detailed questioning and testing.\nWe've worked hard to get out of your way. The books aren't covered in branding (the cover is completely blank) and inside we've included the absolute minimum necessary tools: a bookmark for keeping your page and a box on the inside endpaper (where you can write your name, subject, date, or anything else you desire). This is your book, not ours.\nWe started a dialog with hundreds of artists, designers, developers, entrepreneurs, illustrators, and other thinkers around the world and asked them one simple question: What do you like in a sketchbook or notebook? All the hours of research, testing, and discussion have helped us distill the qualities that make a tool conscious enough to help the creative process and simple enough so that it doesn\u2019t get in your way.\nThe subtleties that make a difference.\nSmart design is crucial when it comes to the subtleties of a simple item. We've carefully considered every detail to create a great tool for exploration.\nEvery inch of our books have been meticulously pored over\u2014and we will continue to work on and improve them. Your feedback will help shape our books as we make them more and more refined.\nWhat does Baron Fig mean?\nThe creative journey revolves around the dichotomy of Discipline and Impulse: having the impulse to go to places you (and others) haven\u2019t, and the discipline to see it through. The Greek gods Apollo and Dionysus represent this dichotomy perfectly. From Apollo, who is associated with order and discipline, we derive \u201cBaron\u201d; from Dionysus, a god of madness and ecstasy, we took the symbol of the \u201cFig.\u201d\nThus Baron Fig\u2014Discipline & Impulse.\nHow Kickstarter works.\nThe following is taken from Kickstarter's info page.\nKickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects. Everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative projects that are brought to life through the direct support of others.\nThousands of creative projects are funding on Kickstarter at any given moment. Each project is independently created and crafted by the person behind it. The filmmakers, musicians, artists, and designers you see on Kickstarter have complete control and responsibility over their projects. They spend weeks building their project pages, shooting their videos, and brainstorming what rewards to offer backers. When they're ready, creators launch their project and share it with their community.\nEvery project creator sets their project's funding goal and deadline. If people like the project, they can pledge money to make it happen. If the project succeeds in reaching its funding goal, all backers' credit cards are charged when time expires. If the project falls short, no one is charged. Funding on Kickstarter is all-or-nothing.\nBacking a project is more than just giving someone money, it's supporting their dream to create something that they want to see exist in the world.\nRewards.\nCheck out the rewards below. Keep in mind you can pledge as little as $1 or as much as you like\u2014every little bit helps.\nOur project is based on simplicity, in keeping with that spirit we're not going to do stickers, posters, and postcards like many Kickstarter campaigns do. We believe in these books, and have worked on perfecting every subtlety to make a product you can use and love.\nOnward.\nThese books are a work in progress. We plan to create open channels to easily connect with you, the very first Baron Fig users. This will be achieved by having part of our website dedicated to receiving your feedback. We will actively listen, respond, and refine our books. You're part of the process\u2014and we can't wait for what's in store.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing a product is a monumental feat. Every element is made by a different group of specialists; then we have to arrange for each of these elements to arrive at a manufacturer who then puts all the pieces together. Essentially, it's a task that involves a lot of scheduling, preparation, and care.\n\nOur greatest challenge is to organize these elements for mass production. The different elements include (but are not limited to): cover material, end papers, bookmark material, quality paper stock, printing on the endpapers, dot grid printing, ruled lines printing, quality control, packaging, shipping packaging.\n\nOnce the books are created then we have them delivered to us in New York City where we will ship them to our backers all over the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Introducing Bags for Thinkers", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Something new is coming!", "update_content": "4,242 shipments containing 8,760 books have been shipped to 48 countries around the world.\nTwo Fridays ago we told our backers to start watching their mailboxes.

It allows you to sketch your designs as you normally would and then manipulate your sketches directly on your phone. Unlike similar products, the use of computer vision speeds up the process and understands your sketches. AppSeed can identify an enclosed space in your sketch, allowing you to make it into a button, input text, map, or another UI element. Making your sketch into a functioning prototype running on your phone.\nFeatured on:\n\nPURPOSE \nAppSeed exists to speed up how you create, test and share your ideas.   We love the process and seeing how ideas start and grow with a team. We wanted to build a tool that builds on what designers currently do, and uses the processing power of your phone to take some of the manual labour out of going from a sketch to a prototype.  We wanted to let you have an idea in a meeting and show it on device right away, letting you focus on your idea, not how to get it on device. \nWHAT IT DOES \nAppSeed uses computer vision to make the process of going from a sketch to a prototype faster and smarter.  Using OpenCV, AppSeed:\nCaptures your sketched design \nIdentifies contained areas of your sketch and allows you to make them into a number of UI elements, including: Buttons | Maps | Streetview | Form text inputs with more to be added based on your feedback\nAllows you to run the prototype on your mobile device \nAllows you to share the prototype as an HTML5 prototype with others \nSend the designs to a layered Photoshop file for editing \nAppSeed Options\n THE PROCESS   \nSketch -> Capture -> Modify -> Test \nAppSeed is designed to fit into your existing process. Sketch your designs on paper as you normally would. Capture your designs through your phone camera. This is where AppSeed starts to do some of the heavy lifting. It uses computer vision to automatically crop your design to the designated area, and isolate each drawn element.  With your elements now isolated, you can interact with them. You can move them or make them function as the UI element you want them to be. Test your design on the phone and edit it in Photoshop through PS Connection.  This creates a Photoshop document that has all your drawn elements on their own layers, giving you the pixel perfect control to move your design into the next stages of production.   \nAppSeed Prototype opened as PS layered file\nSUPPORT AND NEXT STEPS\nWe need your support to make this app a powerful part of your creative process.   We currently have a demo that shows the technology works, but need your support and feedback to make it work in the real world. Your support will help us build a robust version and your feedback will guide the future features.  In return you will get privileged status as a founding backer of AppSeed, getting the app before the general public and getting access to the latest features first.   \nThe video does not contain any special effects.  What you see is how the current demo of the app works.  We need your help to go from demo to commercially ready app.   \nUNDER THE HOOD\nThe secret sauce behind AppSeed is the use of computer vision to search your sketch and isolate individual elements.   Specifically, we use the wonderful OpenCV (an open source computer vision code library: opencv.org) to isolate lines and drawn shapes within your sketches.  We then use our own algorithms to identify the UI elements. These are generally identified because they follow a visual pattern (for example, an enclosed rectangle can be taken as a button).  That drawn element is then copied from the original image and made into a button with the drawn shape as its up state.  Once it is a button, we can manipulate it in a variety of ways, allowing you to change it into a number of different UI elements.  We will be refining which UI elements are available and how the algorithm works to identify elements based on your feedback.  \nOnce you have your prototype ready, you can see it on device, share it with your team as an HTML5 app (we convert all the UI elements you made into an HTML5 page) or open your images in Photoshop (this is done through the PS connection).  PS connection is a built in feature of Photoshop and is available in Photoshop CS5 or later.     \nSHIPPING \nFree Shipping in Toronto area and US, $5 rest of Canada and $10 rest of the world.\nSome Initial Responses \n \"Very cool\" - Bill Buxton, Author of Sketching User Experience @wasBuxton\n\"Holy Cow!\" - Seth Porges - Forbes @SethPorges - http://www.forbes.com/sites/sethporges/2013/09/27/holy-cow-this-app-claims-to-transform-hand-drawn-sketches-into-working-apps/\n \"Greg demo'd this to me earlier this summer and I must say it was kind of an 'oh wow' kind of experience.\" - Tom George, entrepreneur @speedbird \n \"Love it...I'm a total whiteboard addict.\" - Caspian Rabone, Global Creative Director at Wunderman @Caspiano \n \"woah thats awesome\" - Paul De La Merced, Art Director at Grip Limited\n\"Looks like a great tool!

We have all personally benefited from the Seattle community, and the film will be a reflection back to the community itself on how many amazing companies, events, and projects are based here. In our daily lives we rarely step back to see the entire city, and We Make Seattle will inspire by telling the story of how many great things happen around us.\n2.

Not least of which is our deep love of classic American Cars and the craftsmanship spirit of mid-century modernist furniture designers.   Coupled with the realization that we\u2019re slowly drowning in forgettable toys that break and disassemble \u2013 ending in piles of plastic bits -  this determined us to create a line of heirloom wood toys that are elegant, indestructible, and simple, giving kids a chance to create their own stories around the objects they play with.  \nThat\u2019s how MO-TO came about.  Two years of experimentation, development, testing and relentless encouragement from friends, family and perfect strangers at the playground have resulted in a multitude of designs that we are totally excited about.  We selected four to preview with you and publicly launch at the Gift and Toy Fair in NYC on August 18th.\nABOUT THE COLLECTION\nMO-TO cars are at heart a series of refined wood blocks on wheels.  Elegant proportions reminiscent of iconic 1960\u2019s automobiles, minute and complex carving details, perfectly smooth rubber tires and lively graphics- this all adds up to a stunning toy.  The dense beechwood gives it unexpected heft, making for highly realistic play scenarios based on real world physics \u2013 evident in ramp jumps and landings.  The water-based paints and clear urethane are safe and environmentally conscious \u2013 while the high gloss finish, cool graphics  and candy-like colors spark imaginative play scenarios. \nThey are virtually indestructible, with no loose parts to worry about.  Dropping them at the playground or fishing them out from the bottom of a toy chest would only bring about the occasional romantic battle scar.\nTHE APPAREL\n4 Distinct tee designs - by yours truly and Sasha Iacob- for our backers to choose from.  Available in ladies or men's style - and running the usual sizes variation. \nLAUNCH MODELS\nThe GT-10\nIn a bright orange, race striped livery, it riffs on the pure soul of a classic sports car if there ever was one. They don\u2019t come much more American Muscle than that. \nCarbon 77\nMuted, discreet gray with a hairline bright red stripe.  The wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing, lucky number 77 will be the star on the imaginary quarter mile circuit.\nDoc Ryder\nNamed after legendary \u2013and imaginary- wood toy race car driver, this two-tone racer will fight tooth and nail at every hairpin turn. The imaginary huge engine requires a large hood air intake. \nThe Plum 50 - New addition!\nA head turning beauty, draped in a striking color, she will stand out at the track.  Same racing bones as its other brethren, but oh-so-smartly dressed.   This model will stay exclusive to our backers for a while, as we currently do not plan mass production for it.\nAll racers: \nMaterial: German Beech Wood, water based paint and clear urethane coat. White ABS plastic rims, with rubber tires. \nDimensions: 7.2\"L x 2.8\"W x 1.95\"H (18.3cm L x 7.3cm W x 5cm H)  Weight: 13oz / 368g\nPolice Cruiser\nBoxy and assertive, shiny Black-and-White paint scheme, gold star  and with two cherries on top.

Your arrival here has fractured the world; the city that these other beings resided in is now broken into shards  across a broken, bleak landscape.\nYou must infiltrate these cities, searching to discover your marks - investigating both precisely who, and where.\nKeeping to the shadows is to be encouraged - reality here is a fragile place. Your interactions with the world cause it to fall apart. In homage to Burrough's cut-up technique, the world collapses and rebuilds itself the more you interact with it - future areas rebuilt with the fragments and personality of places you mistreated. From this every play-through will, subtly or drastically, be unique to you.\nThe fragile state is inherent in the entire setting. The spoken words of its inhabitants materialize physically - collect the frustrations of a guard unable to locate you and use them to distract, mislead and spread disinformation. Gather the intimate words of an illicit conversation and use them to unveil secrets, hidden pockets within the city. Turn them into reality - a character mentions rats and you can turn his words into a devouring swarm of them.\nTraditional rules are lost. Buildings ignore gravity, ignore the constraints of space. Architecture adopts the mind-state of its inhabitants, who are in turn physically and violently changed in response. This is a world that is as horrific as often as it is absurd and inane.\nSome, but not all of the features you'll find in Tangiers are:\nShadow based stealth engine.\nSandbox environments: choose how you'll proceed through areas and the manner in which you do so, be it ghosting unseen or methodically disposing of all you come across.\nExpansive external landscapes full of side-narratives and hidden areas to discover. \nLanguage becomes reality - collect other characters' spoken word to utilize as a tool to your own ends. Use words and combine them with your standard abilities to distract, mislead or create new effects based on their meaning.\nNon-linear progression: Entirely up to you as to the order in which you approach each levels.\nReactive difficulty: The depth of challenge in areas is set based upon your overall progress.\nReactive game world: The world of Tangiers rebuilds itself as you progress, based upon what you do and where you do it.\nWindows, Mac and Linux versions.\nAt its heart, Tangiers sits on a traditional stealth engine. Keep to the shadows, keep quiet and use your abilities to manipulate a hostile environment. Levels are open ended - plan and choose your approach, infiltrate any number of routes, keep to the shadows and stay quiet.\nWhile we're keeping closely to this style of game and indeed aiming to go back to the genre's roots, we don't just want to repeat what's been done before. A lot of similarities, yes - but almost all your interactions with the world, and the world's interactions with you will be viewed through the concepts and ethos of our creative inspirations.\nWe're Andalusian, a Bristol based two-man team and friends aiming to render games that are both off-kilter and mature: games that look to a wider range of cultural influence than you'd normally find in the medium.\nThis is our debut game - while we are perhaps inexperienced, we've scrupulously designed Tangiers from the ground up to take that into account. From holding off fundraising until the core game-play was satisfactorily implemented, to designing the aesthetics and workflow to accommodate a rapid development of the world, we're confident that we're well-placed to see this through to success. But who are we?\nThere are two of us in the core team of Andalusian: Alex Harvey and Michael Wright.\nAlex is the lead of the project. He orchestrates the whole operation, managing and coordinating everything, as well as spending far too many sleepless nights scripting the game and modelling up the art assets.\nMichael is the number two of the studio. He's our workhorse; While Alex focuses on making sure everything works and looks pretty, Michael sets to grinding through the bulk work of texturing up the cities and making the coffee.\nWe're not alone on our journey though!\nCatt Stewart is our concept and character artist. Formerly from Bristol, Catt now lives in Barcelona, a few hours from the real Andalusia.\nContinuing the theme of our colleagues living in different timezones to us, Joseph Rubio is in Texas while he takes care of all audio duties.\nWe'll be putting up a \"Meet the team video\" soon to let them introduce themselves better.\nThe sound design of Tangiers is very much the cornerstone of our atmosphere, our world. \nJoseph Rubio will be producing us a textured, industrialized soundscape for the project. The audio will be exploring a range of emotions, from suffocating, tight mechanical drones to light, alienating atmospheres, the soundtrack will co-exist perfectly with the game's visuals.\nBut we're not stopping there - we're taking an approach of mood and tone to all the games sounds. Footsteps become percussion, the echoes and reverberations blend, merge with the ambiance.\nWe've been working on Tangiers both part and full time for close to 8 months now - but we've got to a position where further funding is necessary to continue development.\nDespite the sensible choice being \"don't do it\", Alex left his job to pursue his long standing dream of developing such a game. Michael put himself in a similar position, so as it stands currently, the two of us are working full time without anything approximating an income. It's all very utilitarian and DIY in the Andalusian office - the so called \"office\" is Alex's bedroom, Michael's laptop is far too old and held together by duct tape and his office chair is missing a wheel.\nTo continue work on the game full time (and to give development the attention it deserves), Andalusian needs your support.\nIf we're successful with this, the money raised will be split between allowing the two of us to work on Tangiers full time, as well as pay for the time and services of Catt, our concept/character artist, and Joseph, our musician. It'll also go towards replacing Michael's laptop with a device that is free of duct tape, on producing and delivering the Kickstarter rewards, as well as on the omnipresent shadow of taxes, software licenses and business overheads.\nGetting funded on Kickstarter would not only garner a new wheel for Michael's chair, but it gives us the capability to see the game through to completion, to finish a project that is a bit too niche and off-beat to fund through most other avenues.\nWorking with you, we can produce a daring, original game - one that wouldn't be possible otherwise.\n\u00a335,000 is the minimum amount of funding that we can get away with. Our fingers are firmly crossed about getting more - from our angle, more money means the chance of a better working environment than Alex's bedroom, a third full time developer and more resources to spend on external art and music. For you, that all means a deeper, richer Tangiers.\nNext to making everything better, let's look at what else is possible:\n\u00a340,000 - Commentary\nIf we hit this mark, we'll be able to put a commentary into the game. It'll be an optional toggle - in the Valve style of activated talking points dotted around the game.\nTangiers is a sometimes esoteric, sometimes enigmatic project. While we won't be spoiling or explaining any of the narrative, with the commentary we'll discuss the thought process behind a lot of ideas and the nature of how our influences directed certain parts of the world and design.\n\u00a345,000 - Extra Difficulty\nHere we add a \"hardcore\" difficulty mode. Not for everyone, but for players that want their life to be a bit more difficult. Hardcore difficulty will not only restrict the camera (still third person, but you'll lose the extra awareness), but your enemies will have heightened awareness and a greater aptitude for searching you out. This mode will force you to constantly think tactically and make best use of everything you come across.\n\u00a352,000 - Reality Tears\nAt this level, we incorporate reality tears into the cut-up and collapse of the world. Dorways and fractures into pockets of alternate existences. Similar to the portals in Prey (or Portal!), you step through them into alternative fragments of the world. Built up from memories of already visited places, they act as bridges across the map, areas to fall back on or - if you can find a way to close them, a place to lure and trap other characters.\n\n\u00a358,000 - Reactive Music\nThe music takes on the properties of the cut-up - reflections and echoes of visited locations find their way into the audio as do you current actions and some more targeted influences of the current environment. Using the audio compositions as a base, we'll pull and push it in directions unique and driven to every playthrough.\n\u00a364,000 - Enhanced Character Dynamics\nWe can build upon the AI in the game. Two factions will be apparent within the characters, and there will be a strong tension between the two.\nAs you spread disinformation and paranoia amongst the inhabitants of Tangiers, these tensions will flare up - push things even further and you may even manage to have the world's characters deal with your targets for you.\nEventually in the late stages of the game, events will lead to conflict. As you hide in the shadows, pitched brawls and combat will emerge around you. You're faced with the further challenge of an unpredictable environment, of waves of hostility flaring up and dying down. The ambiance of Tangiers will of course be maintained during this - but it opens up a whole new creative avenue for exploring the game's parameters.\nAll listed in the side bar, check 'em out!\nWe're approaching our Beta access slightly differently to normal though. We've got a strong, single player focus on Tangiers, and the game is something that we really want you to experience as a whole. To find balance and to be able to provide a satisfying early access offering, our beta will come in the form of a prequel to Tangiers' main narrative.\nThe beta will be approximately a fifth of the size of the main game - equivalent to one of the city-shards and its surrounding landscape. It's the perfect opportunity to showcase and give an early look at all our mechanics and narrative techniques without spoiling all the surprises we have planned in the full game.\nWe should probably also show the Tangiers shirt - it should look something like this:\nFeel free to give us feedback on this - we'll be refining the design so shout us out :)\nAdd-ons\n\u00a37 - Second Copy of Tangiers\nDo you have a friend that might be interested in the project, or perhaps know someone whose unsure as to whether it's their sort of thing? An extra download of the game, discounted to the early-bird rate as a thank you for the extra support! Limited to one extra per backer.\n\u00a310 - Early Poster +\u00a32 for international shipping\nSome backers might not want to wait for all your rewards to come through, so we'll be getting this poster printed and sent out as soon as the money comes in! As a memento of your support, they'll be signed and have a thank you message written to you.\nA3 Glossy posters. To keep the cost reasonable, we'll be (gently) folding them in half and keeping them safe between two sheets of rigid card. If you would like to have them sent out rolled in a tube, it's a bit pricey but add \u00a34.00 on top.\nThe design will be based on this image, though I'll be reworking and polishing the textures, lighting and composition on it (that skies looking a bit too plain...).\n\u00a320 - Postcards from Tangiers +2 for international shipping\nA pack of ten, high quality glossy postcards of various landscapes around the world. \n\u00a325 - Digital Only Credits Mention\nWe've had a few bits of feedback asking about a credits mention without the physical rewards. Fairly self explanatory - this is the end credits mention found in the \u00a380 tier.\nwww.TangiersGame.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo - we've not shipped a game before. But we are well aware of the massive effort involved in building a complete game, just as we've played Boiling Point enough times to see what happens when games get too ambitious. \n\nTangiers has been designed from the ground up with our experience and limitations in mind. From the workflow surrounding level design and testing to the low-fidelity art-style, we're positive that completing Tangiers is well within our reach. \nWe've been holding back from fundraising until we got to a point where the biggest hurdles are passed. The areas that we considered the highest risk are now robustly implemented - the stealth engine and the AI. Our work now is expanding these platforms and building the game world. \n\nThere is of course the risk that we overrun against schedule. With the exception of overheads and collaborators that we'll be paying at the start of the project, all of the work is being done by the two of us at Andalusian - if we do overrun, we'll simply tighten our belts and carry on working. The chance of Tangiers being cancelled for whatever reason is negligible.\n\nWe've put a lot of effort into planning ahead with Tangiers to make sure everything is set to a realistic scope and schedule, and hope that you'll be happy trusting us to deliver.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "2021-May: Design Talk #1; Tangiers\u2019 Soul", "update_content": "It has been a long time since we began development on Tangiers.

She has really enjoyed turning Point Break into her own personal playground. As Program Director of Seattle-based NWFilm Forum, she presided \"over the most explosive growth period in the organization's history,\" and became, \"a major tastemaker in the Seattle film scene, responsible for bringing hundreds of films every year.\" - The Stranger. After moving to New York, she was the founding programmer for L Magazine's outdoor film series SummerScreen in Brooklyn. She has produced a handful of film projects, working with directors Guy Maddin, Rob Devor, Matt Daniels, and Per Anderson, but most notably she produced the Spirit award-winning and Gotham nominated independent feature film Without. Also, she's a double dutch (jump rope) enthusiast who grew up in Arkansas. \nCASTING DIRECTOR Susanne Scheel has been working in casting for over 5 years.  She has worked with notable casting directors such as Avy Kaufman, Francine Maisler, and Lora Kennedy, and on films such as Academy Award winning The Blind Side and Moneyball and Academy Award winning Argo.  She is currently working with Mackey Sandrich Casting on a film adaptation of The Normal Heart directed by Ryan Murphy.

I've been designing cards for magic company Ellusionist for the past 5 years and it's been a great experience, but I've always dreamed of launching my own deck one day, and maybe even more to follow. It's time to finally realize that dream and it all starts now, with you, and with Empire. I've got a lot on the line, but I'm hopeful the risk is worth it. I'm so excited you're here.\nEmpire is a limited edition, bold, commanding, obsessively intricate and empowering design with the finest finishing, to be printed by United States Playing Cards Company for unrivalled quality. It's a deck that represent what it means to stand up and fight for what's important to you, your dreams. To follow them no matter how challenging and strive to make your own dent in this world. \nI hope you can see the passion and heart I've poured into Empire over the last 12 months. My life's been on hold trying to make this the best deck I can and one I hope you'll love.\nJoin the adventure with me and be the reason Empire exists. Back Empire today and help me bring it to life. I can't wait to get them into your hands!\nPlease Note: Although I'm based in the UK and all rewards are in UK currency (\u00a3), Empire is open to everyone around the world. Everything will be made and shipped from the US, so US shipping is already included. Everywhere outside the US is considered International.

I want this deck to truly complement it's name and what it stands for. My hope is that it will be one of the finest decks you'll own. One you'll cherish.\nIt's handling, durability and touch will be highly functional and worthy of card lovers everywhere. As a magician too, I know what it is to handle a quality made deck and the difference it makes. This deck will hold nothing back. It's for that reason that the deck costs a little more to produce than others you may have seen.\nSecret Design Features\na. The sharp-eyed magicians and hustlers among you may notice that because both the back design and faces have that centre edging detail, having any reversed cards in the deck is no problem. They'll still be very difficult to identify at a glance, should you need to ;)\nb. The edge detail also holds an incredibly subtle one-way feature that a trained eye will have at their disposal.\nc. The mischievous Jokers can also be used as a creative revealing tool for magicians.\nd. Empire will also come with a utility card ('DB') useful for card magic  or even as a cut card for poker, bridge or any other games.\nThese built-in features do not have any impact on the normal functionality of the deck for use in any kind of game play and merriment you desire.\nAdditional Rewards Available Now\nTo compliment the Empire deck, I've created a number of additional rewards that you can choose from in the reward tiers (on the right) or add them onto your pledge later (see Add-On chart below).\nNew Grey/Black Empire Ace Shirt - Click to enlarge\n.\nJoker T-Shirt - Click to enlarge\nJoker T-Shirt ft. the latin, \"Luceo Non Uro\" or \"I Shine Not Burn\"\nEmpire Uncut Sheets (21 7/8 x 26 3/8) - Click to enlarge\nEmpire Back Design Art Poster 18x24 - Click to enlarge\nGet Your Name in Every Single Deck - Limited to 6 Spots\nLimited Empire 'Anything is Possible' Bottle by Jamie D.

I hope you can see what it stands for and what it took for me to create. I've poured literally everything I have into this deck over the last year and I'm devoted to continue putting that level of effort in and doing whatever it takes to get it to you.\nHowever, it's only with YOUR backing and belief, that we can finally make it real. Empire lives or dies here with you. Back it today and be a part of this adventure. Lead the way and help me get it in your hands!

Please add it on top accordingly.\nI wish I could send Empire to everyone for free. Unfortunately, until we all have desktop teleportation devices, paying for shipping is the only way to get Empire to you. Which, in the end, is a good thing!\n\nCheck the FAQ below for more details, or feel free to contact me.

I will be sure to keep you updated at every important stage so you can be confident that everything is being done to move things forward.\n\nThe risk I face is that I've literally stopped my life to work on this deck and resources are almost gone.

The Bicycle\u00ae Calaveras will still be limited, hand numbered, and delivered unwrapped. The cost for the unbranded decks is the same as branded add-ons, $11 domestic, $13 int.\u2014just click on \"Manage your Pledge\" to the right and increase the amount to cover the additional decks you'd like. After the funding period you'll be able to specify how many of each branded or unbranded you want so no need to worry about the admin stuff yet. Also, if you were wondering, the only difference is to the tuck case, not the cards themselves. I'm really excited to offer these to you!!\nI've always loved the artwork and pageantry of el D\u00eda de los Muertos (Day of the Dead). There's a whimsy, and a seriousness to it that underscores the common bond we all share\u2014and the art is just amazing. So I'm creating a deck of playing cards that's true in spirit and design to the roots of the Day of the Dead.\nWith that aim, I'm harkening back to the work of Jos\u00e9 Posada\u2014a famous Mexican printmaker who brought this art form widespread attention. He worked at the time of the Mexican Revolution and his Calaveras really caught on\u2014surviving to this day as iconic expressions of the holiday, the social views he held, and the times he lived through. These all-original cards and their illustrations are designed to celebrate Posada's work without being limited by it. I'm paying homage, but I'm bringing my own voice to them.\nThe United States Playing Card Company will be printing these cards and has agreed to let me use the Bicycle\u00ae logo from their original 1895 \"Expert Back\" deck. I believe this is the first time this logo will be used on a Kickstarter deck, and I'm so thrilled to be able to offer these cards to you.\nI'm also doing something I think is kind of unique\u2014I'm offering original limited edition woodcut prints. I'm really excited about these prints\u2014check below for more about them.\nIf you back this project, I'm hoping you'll give me your feedback as I release designs over the next 40 days so we can create these cards and the woodcut prints together. Help me make this project a reality by backing me as we bring Calaveras to life!\nThe designs.\n> View all the card designs\nThe woodcut prints.\nA lot of the rewards are for woodcut prints, there's a reason. While the cards are turning out great, the prints are breathtaking. The details in these woodcut prints is unbelievable. And unlike Gicl\u00e9e prints (archival inkjet printing) or commercial offset printing, I'm hand pulling woodblock prints to maintain the character that only this process can bring. Each print will be a one of a kind member of a limited edition, signed and numbered, on fine artist-grade archival paper. All prints will be one color prints\u2014raw umber. This is a unique chance to own gallery-worthy art (IMO). I'm really excited to bring this reward to you, I haven't seen anything like it with any other playing card project.\nFrame not included with prints\nAdd-ons.\nI've got some great add-ons to offer, and it's a snap to do.

My name is Al Satterwhite, I've been a photographer since I was in high school shooting for major publications such as Life, Sports Illustrated and Time Magazine. My career gave me an opportunity to get to know some of the major personalities and icons of our culture. Little did I know what was in store for me when I met, and became friends with, the one and only gonzo journalist, Hunter S. Thompson. \nHunter and I became friends back in the early 70's when I first met him at the Republican Convention in Miami Beach. We were both there covering the event for different magazines; he for Rolling Stone, me for Newsweek\nHunter and I hit it off so when Playboy wanted to interview Hunter in 1974 he insisted I be assigned to photograph the event. I knew this wasn't going to be an ordinary gig. \nHunter and I met up in Cozumel, a small island in the Caribbean off the coast of Yucatan, Mexico. From the moment we got together until the work was finally submitted to Playboy, mischief and mayhem ensued. Not only did I capture Hunter photographically, I captured the experiences we shared together - and what a ride it was\u2026\u2026. including the start of 'the Great Shark Hunt'.\n Five days later I flew back to the States with a hangover and 20 rolls of exposed film. What I'm publishing is the story of that trip (and it was, indeed, one helluva trip). And since Hunter and I continued our relationship I'm adding a few other Hunter stories that were most definitely warped as only Hunter could be whenever he came to visit me in Florida. Tales involving the Secret Service, drugs, stopped for speeding in Palm Beach late one night, a harpoon gun and more. The phone would ring and off to some crazy adventure we would go.\nWith so much material, I've decided to put a high quality photographic book together to share those stories along with many of the never before seen photos that I took of Hunter being the quintessential Hunter S. Thompson.  It's called 'The Cozumel Diary'. If you're a Hunter fan, you'll enjoy this candid slice of life with Hunter.  \nThe entire print run will be exclusively limited to 1000 good sized books printed at one of the finest printers in China. They will be available with or without a slipcase (extra with) and only a small number of books will be available in clamshell boxes with a personally signed & numbered archival print. \nFrom a selection of images from the book I meticulously make my own archival prints in limited editions of 25 for the print sizes that I offer. All are numbered and signed, and printed solely by me.\nJoin Hunter and I as we take on Cozumel and beyond. It was the ride of a lifetime. \nThe Cozumel Diary in a clamshell box with the letter from Hunter\nsample page from The Cozumel Diary\nHunter Thompson in Cozumel, Mexico\nHunter ordering two more cervezas during the interview\nat Pepe's Bar where we spent most of our afternoons (sepia tone)\nheading out on 'The Great Shark Hunt' - a great story\nhanging out by the pool\nan afternoon at San Francisco Beach\nsitting on the seawall at the beach\na contact sheet from a roll of Tri-X\na Triptych of Hunter at Pepe's Bar one afternoon\nthe double-page spread in the March 2013 issue of Playboy\nthe letter from Hunter", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've published three books in the past four years; one with a traditional publisher and two self-published.

Check the bottom of the homepage for more info.\nHello! We are thrilled you've stopped to check out our project. We are Peter Dunham and Linnea Gits and we are both designers and artists and partners in the design studio, Uusi. \nRoyal Optik is an entirely custom deck of playing cards and the third deck in a planned, six deck series from Uusi. We began making these custom decks about a year ago when we decided to create a deck using only hand-drawn artwork for the court characters. That deck was called, Blue Blood and sold out almost immediately. We had so much fun creating the artwork for the first deck, that we decided to do another, only this time we thought it would be cool to hand paint with gouache every card in the deck \u2013 not just the court characters. This deck became Bohemia and it with its success we thought it would be a great challenge to create six completely unique, Limited Edition decks that would some day make up one collection of Uusi playing cards.  \nCreating original artwork for one deck of cards means creating 56 illustrations for the deck itself as well as designing the custom look for the packaging on the box.  Along with that, we also create unique items most of which are handmade by us at our studio for each of our projects. Our goal is to give you value and enjoyment from these decks by creating work that is unique, highly playable and instantly collectable.  We hope you find them so as well and are inspired to back Royal Optik!\nRoyal Optik Ad Card Diptych\nINSPIRATION\nOur inspiration for this deck came from two sources: We chose a woodcut style for the faces, hands and weapons of the court because it has such an expressive, traditional look and used the more precise geometric style of Op Art to create the shapes, postures and costumes of the court characters. Both use negative space to create volume and movement, but differ greatly in how they express it. \nAll the court faces and hands were penciled in by Linnea, while Peter happily sketched out weapons and used his steady drafting skills to hand-ink both his and Linnea's pencil sketches in a woodcut style. The bodies were created by Linnea, cutting out geometric shapes from fields of blue-green black and warm reds that we first painted on printmaking paper and then scanned into the computer. Combining these two styles and techniques gave Royal Optik a traditional yet edgy-modern look.  \nAs artistic as our decks are, it is equally important to us that they are playable. We are careful to make sure the pips and indicies are not only pleasing in their design layout, but that they are easy to read. We have kept all the traditional elements of the court cards most used in games such as poker: two one-eyed Jacks (Spades and Hearts), the \"Suicide King\" (Hearts, with sword \"through\" head) and the \"Man with the Axe\" (King of Diamonds). Last, but never least, we created a signature Joker unique to the Royal Optik court.   \n**Thanks to reaching our 300% stretch goal we now have a Royal Optik seal for our limited edition deck!\nTHE DECK\nFifty-two playing cards and two jokers \u2013 all with original, eye-catching artwork that makes them ideal for magic and card games, yet at the same time very familiar and immediately recognizable by players and spectators alike.\nTwo illustrated Uusi Design ad cards that form a diptych.\nPrinted by the United States Playing Card Company (USPC) in a run of no more than 5000 decks. Print run size will be determined by demand and will be strictly limited.\nMade on Bicycle playing card stock with an Air Cushion Finish.\nLinen/embossed finish on tuck box. \n\n*All images of the deck and tuck boxes you see in these photos are prototypes made at Uusi's studio. The finished product may vary slightly from what you see here - backers will be kept up-to-date of any minor changes that may occur. The overall design and theme will remain UNCHANGED throughout the funding and printing process.\nRoyal Optik Uncut shown in custom, redwood frame.\nDetail shot of custom frame.\nROYAL OPTIK UNCUT PRESS SHEET\nWhen creating the artwork for our decks, we always try to keep in mind how they will look when shown together on the press sheet. Uncuts are very limited in their editions and thus highly collectible.  Though it is the low number of these sheets that are produced that make them desirable to collectors, we like to think they can also stand alone as a work of art. In addition, we like to create  special cards \u2013 like our Ad Card Dyptych \u2013 to give a final, signature touch to our press sheets.\nFUNDING\nDesigning and producing high-quality, limited-edition decks printed in small quantities requires your support.  Our art and design time for this deck was enormous. We want to cover every detail and make sure we are offering you a well thought-out product that is as complete and original as possible. We also want to make sure it is produced with the highest quality printer to ensure a deck that will last the test of time which is why we choose to print with USPC. However, most of the large playing card companies they deal with print in the tens of thousands with decks that can continually be reprinted. To meet USPC's minimum for these highly custom, one-time printed decks is an expensive endeavor for our small company, but with your help we can make Royal Optik happen!\nA LOOK AT THE REWARDS\nRoyal Optik Limited Edition Screen Print\nThis edition of the Royal Optic screen print is an exclusive to this Kickstarter project. We will not be offering it after the project ends, so the total number of pledges will determine the actual print run quantity. All prints will be signed and numbered. Overall dimension of the print is 9\" x 12\". Printed with black, water-based ink on archival, print-making paper at our studio. \nRedwood Playing Card Display Case\nOur Redwood Playing Card Display Case was first introduced for our Bohemia deck and was so popular we decided to bring it back for Royal Optik.  Each case is handmade at the studio from reclaimed, old-growth redwood that was salvaged from Chicago water towers built at the turn of the 20th century.  Because of the high amount of handwork involved in each case we cannot offer more than 25 for this project. Each case is signed and numbered and comes in an Uusi branded, cotton bag with a small allen wrench to adjust the swivel speed of the case tray.\nRedwood Deck Stand\nRedwood Deck Stand Made from reclaimed, old-growth redwood at our studio.
