Before we get started, I know it's been a really long, strange, difficult 12 months for a lot of us, so I hope everyone is doing okay and staying safe.\nSo... where were we?\nIn the not-too-distant past \u2013 about 6 years ago, November 2015 AD \u2013 we ran a Kickstarter to BRING BACK MST3K after 15 years in hibernation.\nIt was a little bit stressful, and a lot of work, but I've gotta tell you... the whole experience went better than we had ever hoped:\nThanks to you, our campaign broke a bunch of Kickstarter records.\nOver 48,000 of you took up the cause... and together, we raised over $6 million.\nWith your help, we got picked up on Netflix and made 20 new episodes!\nAnd you know, you can't ever please everybody, but it seems like most of you were pretty happy with 'em.... and the critics were too: \nAlso, having those new episodes on Netflix, along with a lot of our \"classic\" episodes, helped a lot of folks discover Mystery Science Theater for the first time. So, if you weren't there to help #BringBackMST3K... Welcome! We're glad you're here to help  #MakeMoreMST3K.\nThanks to our Kickstarter, we also built up enough momentum to experiment with taking MST3K in new directions, including three live national tours, where we got to meet thousands of you in person!  Also, during our live tours, it became really clear to me that MST3K works best when you can experience it together, with your family and friends, or your fellow MSTies.\nAnyway: as you know, nothing good lasts forever.  Sometime in late 2019, during our third live tour, we got word: even though Netflix liked how our new episodes came out, they wouldn't be renewing us for a third new season.\n(Sometimes, business is just business, you know? Was it disappointing not to get renewed? Well, sure. But starting now, we want to focus on looking forward, not back. And when you see what we're planning now, I hope you'll agree that this could end up being the best thing for MST3K in the long run.)\nThen, the day after we finished the live tour, the whole world shut down for a year. And you know, as terrible as COVID has been, it did mean that I had plenty of time to think about where Mystery Science Theater can go next.\nWhen I thought about it long enough, I realized three important things:\n 1. The world isn't done with MST3K yet.\n We still want to make more episodes of MST3K.\nA lot of you still want us to make more MST3K.\n2. It's time to try something new.\nIf enough of you want more MST3K, maybe we don't need anyone to renew us.\nFrom now on, we want you to decide how long MST3K keeps going.\nWe don't need a network to \"let us\" make more MST3K. We can make it for you. \nWhen we do, you should be the first ones to see it.\n3. We need a better space for sharing MST3K, and watching it together.\nWithout a network, we'll need a home for new MST3K, and...\nWe want it to be easy to enjoy MST3K live with other people, so...\nWe need our own online theater for live screenings and events! \nI'm glad you asked, friend... because that's what this new Kickstarter is all about.\nThanks to all of you, Mystery Science Theater 3000 has come a long way since our first Kickstarter.  Now, if you decide to get involved again, here's what we can do next:\n1. MAKE MORE MST3K episodes with a new, sustainable model, that lets you decide how long we should keep going, and lets us bring new episodes directly to you, without depending on a network to distribute or keep renewing us for new seasons.\n2. BUILD THE GIZMOPLEX, our own virtual online theater, where we can host frequent live screenings, premieres, and community events \u2013 and you can host MST3K watch parties with friends whenever you want. More on that in a minute. \nMan... you're way ahead of me. \nIf you were part of our first Kickstarter, this next part might sound familiar:\n If our new Kickstarter can raise at least $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three more new episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000...but we'll also have enough to build the Gizmoplex. \nAnd then \u2013 just like last time \u2013 the more we raise, the more we can do! Here's what we'll be able to do at each of our goals, all the way up to our final goal of $5.5 million: \nUPDATE (5/8): We hit $6.4M, which means JOEL ROBINSON will return to HOST 2 NEW EPISODES and we'll add a 13TH NEW EPISODE!\nAlso, you know, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but if things go well, we've got a lot of other ideas we'd like to add into the mix. You can find out more about that below, and also in this Backer Update.\nNow listen, I hope you're already convinced that the best reason to join our new Kickstarter is because we'll able to #MakeMoreMST3K and #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nBut since this is Kickstarter, let's talk about REWARDS.\nI'm really proud of how most of the rewards from our first Kickstarter campaign turned out, and ever since then, a lot of you told me how much you loved them too. So, this time around, I want to do our best to \"raise the bar.\" You'll have to decide for yourself if we pull it off, but I'll tell you that we've got a few rewards this time that I'm really excited about \u2013 especially the Gizmoplex DIY Concession Pack, our new Challenge Coins, and a pretty amazing design for an MST3K Musical Snow Globe! \nUPDATE \u2013 Since there are so many rewards to keep track of, and we want to make sure you know what to expect in each pledge level, we've also put together this chart, which has been UPDATED to include the ALL-DIGITAL EXPERIMENT 85! \nSo yeah, as you can see, until you get above Experiment 500, most of the rewards \"stack\", which means you get all of the rewards listed in all of the lower pledge levels,  not just the new rewards listed with each pledge level. And unless it says otherwise, all reward levels above Experiment 500 include everything listed on this chart. I'm telling you, it's a lot of cool stuff. \nUPDATE (MAY 5): Joel has shared some \"sneak peek\" images of the designs for our new rewards, including TWO T-SHIRT DESIGNS, TWO POSTER DESIGNS, the MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE and the just-released MISSION PATCHES!\n FIRST LOOK: T-SHIRT DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: POSTER DESIGNS \nFIRST LOOK: MUSICAL SNOWGLOBE \nYou can read more about the Musical Snowglobe in this Backer Update, but you should know that it will have a \"wind-up\" mechanical element in the base which plays a new rendition of the MST3K Theme Song, composed just for this reward by Paul Sabourin:\nFIRST LOOK: NEW MISSION PATCH (ADD-ON) \nAlso, one big change since last time is that we're now able to offer \"Add-On Rewards\" right here on Kickstarter. That means that we don't have to guess exactly what you'll like, or create a million different confusing pledge levels. \nHere are some of the Add-On Rewards available right now:\n\n SHIPPING NOT INCLUDED!\nAlso, just in case you missed the notice in the description of each reward level: We're not collecting shipping costs for any rewards until after the Kickstarter ends.\nAbout 2-4 weeks after our Kickstarter campaign ends, you'll get a reward survey to give us all of the details we need, like your t-shirt size, or the name(s) you want us to use for each of the \"Special Thanks\" rewards. When you give us those details, we'll also collect shipping for any rewards that go in the mail!\nREWARD TIMING\nWhile a handful of rewards \u2013 like the \"MST3K Season 13: Collector's Box Set\" on DVD and Blu-Ray \u2013 might not be available until as late as June 2022, other rewards \u2013 like Weekly Production Updates \u2013 will start within just a few weeks of when our Kickstarter campaign ends. So, don't let the \"June 2022\" delivery date scare you. Kickstarter just asks us to list the latest date when we expect all rewards to be sent out.\nNow, I know this is already a lot of information, especially if you already watched our video, and I think I've told you most of the really important stuff.\nAnd, if you still want more information, there's a lot more detail below, so keep reading if you want to know more about...\nHow the Gizmoplex will work!\nHow the Gizmoplex can make MST3K better! \nHow we set our funding goals!\nHow we'll spend whatever we raise!\nAlso, one of the things I like best about Kickstarter is that it's not just a \"monologue,\" but a really great way to have a conversation with all of you who care about the show. So, if there are other things you want to know about, I hope you'll take a look at our FAQ... and if the answer isn't there, I hope you'll ask!\nWe'll also do our best to read and respond to all of your comments. But just so you know, I'm pretty sure that our first Kickstarter also got more comments than any project that came before it! So, if that happens again, please be patient if it takes us a little while to get to everything. We've got a whole month, and a lot more to tell you!\nThere's one more thing I need to say before you go, and it's pretty important:\nOver the last year, as I was trying to imagine where Mystery Science Theater can go next, I also spent a lot of time thinking about how we got here.\n(It's kind of crazy to realize that it's been almost six years since our first Kickstarter, and almost thirty-three years since we first aired on KTMA on Thanksgiving in 1988.)\nAnyway, when I look back on everything that's happened, it's really clear that our first Kickstarter was one of the defining moments in Mystery Science history. For our first campaign, we asked you to help us make new episodes, and to prove to \"the networks\" that there was still an audience for MST3K... and you did!\nBut together, we've done a lot more than that. Thanks to you, Mystery Science Theater has been able to produce 2 new seasons, 20 new episodes, 6 comic books, 3 live national tours, and 1 record-breaking Kickstarter.\nToday, I hope you'll join us again to write MST3K's next chapter: to prove that we can #MakeMoreMST3K without depending on a network to keep us alive, and to #BuildTheGizmoplex, a unique online theater where MST3K can continue to grow.\nBut \u2013 and this is the important part \u2013 I also want to be cautious. We're all just crawling out from COVID, and it's been a difficult year. I know that things are more difficult for a lot of people than they were during our first Kickstarter. If you decide to pledge, please: only give what feels comfortable, even if it's just a few bucks. And if you can't afford anything, that's okay too! We'll find other ways for you to stay involved, and to make sure you can still get access to all of our new episodes and Gizmoplex events.\nThat's all: more than anything, please just take care of yourself... and if you can't help out right now, don't think twice about it. We'll still be here when you're ready.\nI guess that's everything, so... we've got 30 days. Let's see how this thing goes.\nCheers & Thanks,\nJoel\n\n\nHey, you're still here. So, I guess you want more details, huh?\nOh yeah, that's right. Thanks for reminding me.\nI think the Gizmoplex might be the biggest \"new idea\" we're working with this time around, so there are a lot of details and possibilities I'm excited to share with you as we go. Here's what you should know right away.\nHaving a Gizmoplex All-Access Pass has three important benefits:\n1. Live Premieres & Events: The Gizmoplex will host at least TWO LIVE EVENTS EVERY MONTH for our first year, where you can join me, our cast and writers, and some special surprise guests. Each event will be like a night at the theater, and will have a lot of fun surprises. Some of our ideas include theme nights hosted by our cast and special guests, live commentaries, and maybe even live riffing! Also, we won't just screen episodes: it'll be a real show, and could include new sketches, trailers (done \"MST3K style\"), live Q&A panel discussions, interviews, contests... and the return of the MST3K \"viewer mail\" segment! (And yes, if you can't make one, you'll be able to see it after.)\n2. The MST3K Watch Club: To make it easier to watch MST3K with your friends, the Gizmoplex will also be the official home of the MST3K Watch Club! Each month, you'll get on-demand access to a new selection of episodes, and the ability to host your own live screenings for up to 10 people! Anyone with a Gizmoplex Pass can join for free, and if you want to invite someone who doesn't, they can get a \"Day Pass\" for just $0.99!\n3. Gizmoplex Apps: Since we reached our second goal ($3.3M) we'll be able to develop apps that bring the Gizmoplex to mobile devices and TVs! Right now, the plan is to include apps for six of the most popular platforms: iOS, Android, AppleTV, AndroidTV, FireTV and Roku. And no promises, but we're also looking into apps for XBOX, PlayStation and Samsung TVs. Like Crow says: we're gonna conquer cyberspace, man! (Read more about the apps here.)\nSo, if you think about it, we think it's a pretty different model than we could pull off anywhere else. I really want the Gizmoplex to feel like something new: less like another Netflix with nothing but MST, and more like a charming, off the radar, suburban cineplex that plays movies for 99 cents, long after their first run.\nIf we get this right, the Gizmoplex Pass won't just give you a monthly subscription to a catalog of MST3K episodes, or a place to watch the episodes you own on-demand: it'll be more like a \"Season Pass\" that gives you tickets to every show at your favorite theater: front row, opening night, every time. Take that, Moviepass!\nYou can read a LOT more about our plans for the Gizmoplex in this Backer Update.\nAlso, even though this won't make a lot of sense until I give you more details, there's one more thing I want you to understand:\nThe Gizmoplex won't just be our new online theater and event space. It's also going to be an important new location that The Mads are creating on the show, and inside the world of Mystery Science Theater, as their next step toward world domination: the first cineplex on the moon!\nAnyway, I think it'll all make sense when you see it... but until then, remember, \u201cIt\u2019s just a show, I should really just relax.\u201d\nSo, there you have it: in a nutshell, this is what we want to do. After 33 years, it's time for Mystery Science \"Theater\" to have an actual (virtual) theater that MSTies can call their own. It's time... to #BuildTheGizmoplex.\nAny other questions?\nOh, wait. I think I know what you're going to ask. \nJust like last time, I'm sure some of you are wondering, so go ahead and ask. \nI knew that's what you were gonna ask! And since we're asking you to pledge some of your hard-earned money \u2013 especially after a difficult year \u2013 I want to be really open and transparent about this. So, let's break this down a little bit.\n1. Without a network supporting us, we need to fund everything ourselves. During our first Kickstarter, we estimated that, once production was up and running, we'd be able to produce new episodes for about $250K each. In the end, though, the budget for each new episode ended up being closer to $350K. For the last two seasons, we were able to cover the difference through our deal with Netflix... but this time, we're on our own. We've got a lot of ways we can keep the budget lower, but, you know... it's still going to cost something. And when you think about it, $350K for 90 minutes of television is still one of the best deals in show business.\n2. We still can't spend everything we raise on Kickstarter to make the show.\nCampaign Fees: Between Kickstarter and the credit card processor, we pay about 8% of your pledge in fees. There's also a fee for CrowdOx, the platform we'll use to manage all of your surveys and rewards after the campaign ends.\nMaking Rewards: We reserve about 20% of your pledge in order to design, produce, print, sort and pack all of your rewards. And that's not even including shipping, which we're not collecting until after our Kickstarter campaign ends!\nDedicated Support: During our first Kickstarter, we underestimated the amount of work involved in providing customer support and creating detailed backer updates, so we had to depend on volunteers to do a lot of it. This time, we want to make sure we're prepared, so we budgeted about 4% of each pledge for that.\nBuilding & Running the Gizmoplex: We really want the Gizmoplex to be great, but getting it started will take some work \u2013 and keeping it running also means we'll have some monthly fees to cover. We also need some budget to support all of the special live events we're planning to host. So, we're using about 3% of your pledge for that.\nWhen you put it all together, we have to spend about 35% of what we raise just to cover Kickstarter expenses, and to keep all the promises we're making to you.\n\n3. The more episodes we make, the less each one costs! Like we explained during our first Kickstarter, the basic idea is pretty simple: for some parts of production, we have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we're making.\nFor example, let's say that our writers realize the show needs a custom-built oversized rubber chicken. No matter how many episodes we have, it's going to cost $1000 to make. So, if we only use it in three episodes, we have to spend $333 per episode on a rubber chicken. But, if we use the chicken in twelve episodes, that $1000 goes a lot farther, and our rubber chicken kaiju only costs us $83 for each episode. Make sense?\n     Based on those numbers, you can see that the cost for each episode gets lower as the number of episodes goes up:\nSo yeah, just like our first Kickstarter, I know that a fair number of you won't care about these types of details... but since some of you will, we want to be as clear as possible.\n1. KEEP CIRCULATING THE URL. Back in the day, MST3K wasn\u2019t seen nationwide and we encouraged people to record the shows on VHS and send them to their friends and loved ones. It was our version of \u201cI Want My MTV.\u201d Every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged MSTies to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes,\u201d and you guys did. Then, in our last Kickstarter, we updated that to \"Keep Circulating the URL,\" and you did that too. Now, we've got a new URL, so we're asking you again:\n2. FOLLOW @MST3K ON SOCIAL MEDIA. Be sure you're following our account on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. Those are one of our best ways to keep everyone up-to-date on what's going on, so encourage your fellow MSTies to follow them too! We really appreciate it, and we couldn\u2019t do it without you. You\u2019re like our virtual street team!\n3. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGE FROM EACH UPDATE. From now until our Kickstarter ends on May 7, most of the backer updates that we send will include a suggested message or image.

The world of Thrones & Bones is the sort of place where legends are born, and I have no doubt people are going to be talking about it in the same breath as DragonLance and Greyhawk in years to come. This is the start of something very special indeed.\u201d \u2014 George Mann, former Publishing Manager, Games Workshop and bestselling author\nThis first volume of the Thrones & Bones Campaign Setting contains approximately 200 pages of lore and mechanics for your 5th edition games. Within this lavishly illustrated tome, players and game masters will find over 60 pages of lore detailing the people, places, and perils of this northern land, as well as new races, subclasses, feats, spells, and magic items. Norr\u00f8ngard features a mechanic for gaining and losing honor, an original system of rune magic, a bestiary of 29 new monsters (well, 28 monsters and a very cute seal), as well as rules for playing the ball game of Knattleiker, the insult-rhyming competition called Flyting, and the in-world popular board game, Thrones & Bones. Two complete starter adventures kick off your exploration of this fascinating setting.  \nThrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard is gorgeously illustrated throughout with original artwork from such amazing artists as Andrew Bosley, Justin Gerard, Ksenia Kozhevnikova, Randall Mackey, Will O\u2019Brien, Craig J. Spearing, and Bryan Syme. It features original cartography from Rob Lazzaretti and battle maps from Heroic Maps (available in a Digital Map Pack for VTT or Printing).   \nCreator Lou Anders is a Hugo-winning editor, a Chesley-winning art director, and a critically acclaimed author with 25 years experience working in genre entertainment in magazines, television, film, book publishing, and role playing games. In addition to his own novels, Anders has written Star Wars stories for Disney Lucasfilm and has done RPG design for Kobold Press, River Horse Games, and 3D Printed Tabletop.\nEditor Misty Bourne provides more than twelve years of publishing experience, having worked on such projects as Mythic Odysseys of Theros (Wizards of the Coast), Underworld Lairs and Tome of Beasts 2 (Kobold Press), and the Epic Legacy series, Total Party Kill series, and Tyrants & Hellions (2CGaming). She edits Hit Point Press\u2019s \u201cBig Bads\u201d (2020 silver ENNIE winner) and is the author of HPP\u2019s Animated Tarot.\nThrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard presents a world ten years in the making.  Although the Thrones & Bones trilogy is a middle grade series, Thrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard is not a children's RPG. This first volume in a planned series greatly expands on the lore of the novel, and as such, presents a rich, Norse-inspired realm that stands on its own and which promises hours of adventure for 5th edition fans of all ages. Take the first steps into a world of adventure today. \nThe Raven Guard, the Hrafnhird, are a group of 9 elite warriors who protect Norr\u00f8ngard at the king's command. A special, limited reward tier allows you to help us craft one of these 9 warriors. We'll work with you to determine their name and specific characteristics, then we will use your own likeness, or another you prefer, to create their appearance. Futhermore, your name will appear in the credits of the book. Be a part of Norr\u00f8ngard history forever! Limited to 9 backers. (Update: This tier has SOLD OUT!)  \nThe Troll King, Digr Miklimunnr, came to his position by being both the largest forest troll in all of Norr\u00f8ngard and Ymiria, and the only troll ever reported to have not one or two but three heads. A special, limited reward tier allows you to become one of the Troll King's three heads. We will use your own likeness, or another you prefer, to create the appearance of one of Miklimunnr's heads. Futhermore, your name will appear in the credits of the book. Be a part of Norr\u00f8ngard history forever! Limited to 3 backers (for obvious reasons). \nIn collaboration with Andrew Mills and Mike Sheridan at Alter3dimensya, we're proud to be able to offer the 3D printable Thrones & Bones Board Game Arena as an add-on available to all pledge tiers. This add-on will include files for 3D printing a Thrones & Bones board game with two variant sides. One side will be a faux-wood textured frame with the Thrones & Bones logo, for using the board game as intened (as a board game). The other will be stone stadium seating, for when you want to use the board game in your RPGs as a \"life-sized\" arena upon which the player characters must fight to the death. Also included are LED torches for adding lights to the corners of the board game when it is used in the arena configuration.  (Note that this add-on is for downloadable .stl files, not physical product, and that the final version may differ slightly from what is pictured here. The retail version of the Thrones & Bones Board Game Arena available after the Kickstarter is expected to cost approximately $35.) \nIn collaboration with Heroic Maps, we're proud to offer the Thrones & Bones VTT Map Pack, already included at certain pledge levels. This digital map pack will include all the maps needed to run the two adventures included with the Thrones & Bones: Norr\u00f8ngard book, offered here at a sizable discount, as the retail version of the Map Pack available after the Kickstarter is expected to cost approximately $75.  \nIn collaboration with David Joseph Wesley, the Thrones & Bones Original RPG Soundtrack will be 30 to 45 minutes of instrumental music designed to accompany you on your adventures in Norr\u00f8ngard. For a taste of this Grammy-nominated composer's work, you can listen to his song \"Midwinter\" here. The Thrones & Bones Original RPG Soundtrack album will be delivered via Bandcamp, available as a high quality download in MP3, FLAC, and more.  \nDelivery of digital products\nAll digital products will be sent to every backer via email through DriveThruRPG.\nDelivery of physical products\nAll physcal products will be sent to every backer through DriveThruRPG.\nShipping costs are not included in any of the listed prices. Because of postal variations and yearly increases in shipping costs, the shipping for print rewards is calculated and charged in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter closes.\nPricing estimates here:\nhttps://support.drivethrurpg.com/hc/en-us/articles/209936893-Estimated-Shipping-Costs-For-Printed-Products\nIf you'd like a preview of the setting, you can listen right now to Part 1 and Part 2 of \"The Aptrgangr's Challenge,\" an actual play podcast of the first adventure in the book from the good folks at Table Talk. The episode is available on iTunes and Spotify and here is the direct link to their page. More episodes will be posted as they become available.\nMore information on the Thrones & Bones series, from which the campaign setting originates, can be found here. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a low risk Kickstarter. To minimize the risk, the entire book has been written, illustrated, and designed prior to the launch. It is with a copyeditor now. In other words, THE PROJECT IS 99.9% DONE. Funding is for recouping the investment that has already been made, and stretch goals are to acquire even more artwork and to bring in other designers to add additional adventures to the setting. In other words, the book is happening. Funding and stretch goals only make it that much more amazing. \n\nAlthough it is my first Kickstarter, prior to becoming a full-time author, I worked as an editor and art director in science fiction and fantasy publishing for fifteen years, winning both a Hugo award for editing and a Chesley award for art direction during that time. Before that, I had five years experience working in science fiction and fantasy magazines. I've been a full-time writer since 2014, and I have also written RPG content for Kobold Press, River Horse, and 3D Printed Tabletop. All together, I have over 25 years of experience writing, editing, art directing, and presenting imaginative content. \n\nFinally, I believe very firmly in seeking the advice of smart people and listening to them.

The copyedits were delivered a while ago, and I am slowly updating the text to replace it with the copyedited text. Nearly done with chapter 2 (of 5) there. And I can't stop making monsters. We've got 37 of them in the bestiary now, the most recent additions being the \u00e4lva (a fairy from Scandinavian folklore), the galtifer\u00f0 (a ghostly pig of my own invention), and the hyldemoer (a creature from Scandinavian myth that is sort of a cross between an awakened tree, a dryad, and a hag). Of course, all these new monsters need artwork, and the last of that is coming in now through early July, along with a couple additional spot and half page illustrations commissioend just to fill in some gaps.

The is nearly complete with only print-testing of the arena portion remaining. And Grammy-nominated composer David Jospeh Wesley has begun work on the Although this is subject to change, the idea we are working towards is to have a \"theme song\" followed by music that matches the key settings in all eight of the adventures from the two books.

Please join us as we raise funds to continue our coverage of board games and the wonderful people who play them.\nWe are a group of gamers dedicated to growing and promoting the board game hobby and those who enjoy it. Tom Vasel, Zee Garcia, Roy Cannaday, Mike Dilisio, and many others produce weekly videos covering hundreds of different games both new and classic. Additionally, Eric Summerer, Suzanne Sheldon, Mandi Hutchinson, and Tom produce a weekly podcast all about games and the people who play them.\nBut that's not all! We also provide you with news, variety shows (such as Board Game Breakfast), a series of popular \"Top Ten\" videos, shopping guides, and more! All of this can be found at our website - www.dicetower.com.\nOur show gets a majority of its funding from our Kickstarter campaign each year. We have seven full-time employees and four part-time employees. Like so many of you, we had various plans last year which were disrupted.  We pivoted into a ton of live coverage instead.  This year our goals are to:\n Continue to produce regular live content on a set schedule \nIncrease interaction with our listeners\n Continue to increase the quality of our current YouTube shows \n Produce more top ten lists with special guests \n Upgrade our equipment \nYou might notice that these are very similar to our goals in 2020, and that's because I want to focus even more on the quality of our streaming.  The Winter Spectacular was something we worked hard on, and we believe we can bring ALL of our content up to that level.  In this campaign, we have a myriad of cool rewards but we hope that your main goal in supporting this campaign is keeping the Dice Tower on the air.\nWe are dedicated to keeping the show and our videos free for download and viewing, and we appreciate you helping us in reaching that goal.  We ask you to consider giving above and beyond the cost of the rewards to maximize what we can do this year!\nPLAY\n\nGoing beyond our goal will allow us to do more for you on the channel!  Here are some of our stretch goals!\n\nWe have a pile of wonderful rewards to send out to you as a gift for backing our campaign.  We know the value of these rewards does not come close to the amount you are donating to the show but they are simply a small \"thank you\" gift that we are sending as a token of our appreciation.  We also ask that you look at them that way - to donate money to the show is the main goal of this campaign.\nThe following promos each have their own pledge level, but also can be added to a regular pledge.  Simply add the amount to your pledge and you can choose which ones you want at the end of the campaign.  Realize that some add-ons will accrue more international shipping at the end of the campaign.\nThere will also be some add-ons that are only added on in the pledge manager.  These will include (but are not limited to) promos from last year, and more!\nWe can only fit in a limited number of these rewards, so they are unlikely to be available in the pledge manager after the Kickstarter.\nEach Thursday, we do a live show of Boardgame Breakfast!  Want to show us up in the trivia section?  Backers will show up live in one of our Thursday Breakfasts for the game show section!\nWant your own Dice person?  Tina will draw you (based on a picture you send in) in the color die of your choice.

It's taken a while and a little bit of courage but I've decided to try and release a fully-illustrated compendium of all the magic tattoos I have created over my time DMing for my parties. Magic tattoos are special in that they allow you an extra level of character customization (look that much more badass) while simultaneously granting you unique and interesting abilities (be that much more badass)! Why not give it a shot, right? There will be more than 120+ illustrated, never-before-seen, and functional magic tattoos, with much more to come depending on the stretch goals we reach!\nThe tattoos will also all be tweaked to be more in line with the ones being introduced to us in recent 5e releases. All the tats you'll find in this book will have some amazing flavor of their own, which will set them apart from the limited selection of existing magic tattoos and the large pool of magic items already out there!\nThe Elongating Tattoo presents some interesting new opportunities...\nFor one, all the magic tattoos you will find in this book are tailored to work in tandem with specific body parts! For example, tattoos like the Soaring Tattoo will grant you majestic inky wings when applied on your back (and only your back)! The Tome of Mystical Tattoos will also show you exactly how each beautiful tattoo would look on the optimal limbs alongside a detailed flat sketch for a clear view of all the designs. Beautiful full-page illustrations are also in the works showcasing the wide variety, utility, and power of the tattoos within this compendium. \nHonestly, the best way to show you the type of quality and content you can expect from this project is simply... to show you! You can click up there to download a sneak peek which includes some of the new tattoo mechanics, and at least 2 fully-illustrated and fleshed-out tattoos from each of the six sections of the Tome of Mystical Tattoos. \nHey again! I'm Karl Nicolas (he/him), a librarian, writer, and editor. I also manage the day-to-day of Natwuns as the creative director. We create beautifully illustrated maps for tabletop games along with other assets. This can range from monsters and NPC characters to magic items or comics, depending on our mood! I'm an avid D&D player and DM, and I am thoroughly in love with the imagination and creativity that this beloved game inspires. For this project, I want to produce the best possible book that I can for all of you, and I'll be working with some talented editors and artists to supplement my work in whatever way possible to deliver on that promise! \nYou can also check out our website at natwuns.com to subscribe to our newsletter, check out our social media to follow along with this project's progress, and anything else coming down the pipeline.\nTattooist's Tools... I wonder what those do...\nThis wouldn't be as much fun if we didn't fiddle around with the system a little, right? In the Tome of Mystical Tattoos, I will outline a system that explains the mechanics of things like obtaining tattoo designs, recreating found designs, and how the new artisan's tool - the Tattooist's Tools - fits into all this. I promise this will be a fun addition and something that you can forego completely anyway if you're only interested in some kickass tats! \nUnlocked Stretch Goals\n$5000 - UNLOCKED - 10 more tattoos in the \"Head\" section of the book - a total of 30 instead of 20!

Nope, that's definitely a mystical tattoo!\nSummoning is not beyond the magical tattoos in this book.\nNeither is domination for that matter...\nWould you like a full magical sleeve, perhaps?\nNo body part is off-limits! Well... maybe some.\nAfter you choose to back this project for the hardcover book reward in one of our tiers, you will be sent a link to purchase the book at cost from DriveThruRPG. DriveThruRPG Print on Demand services will print the book at-cost (this would probably be in the range of $15 to $25 US) and then shipping costs to your address will be calculated. This is honestly the most cost-effective way for you to receive the hardcover book, especially at this time. It reduces overheard and allows you to buy the book cheaper than if I opted to include the printing and shipping costs in the Kickstarter reward.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " LAST 24 HOURS! \nSkies of Sordane is live!  \nThe Skies of Sordane has now launched! After a bit of a delay (sorry about that everyone!), my team and I are now ready to present the Skies of Sordane Kickstarter!\nThis Kickstarter's goal is provide a high quality range airship and miniature STL files for your 3D printers (Both FDM and resin printers!). All miniatures will be test printed on multiple FDM and resin printers to ensure quality. After the campaign ends (if successfully funded) we will roll out miniatures after they are tested and completed!\nAll miniatures will be sculpted for 32mm/35mm scale!\nNote: This is for digital files only. Physical products will have to be purchased from our licensed sellers.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nMy name is Benny, I've been playing D&D for over 20 years now and love that I can still be inspired by others. As most of you can probably tell, I was inspired by Eberron this time! I said to myself \u201cI need some airships in my life!\u201d .. I couldn\u2019t stop writing lore and before I knew it, Sordane and its Skies were born!\nKickstarter allows us to present to you all the work we have been doing and the work we intend to complete and provide to the masses. We've take a long time, put in a great deal of effort and thought to create 5 awesome bundles each with their own unique feel while still remaining individually to one another within each bundle.\n3D printing has opened the world up for us DMs to make supremely customized sessions for our players. Since becoming a 3D printing advocate, my players and I have enjoy vibrant sessions on terrain and settings that feel exactly as they should!\nCore Bundles\nThere are 5 Core Bundles. Each bundle has 1 airship and 6 crew miniatures. All files will be printable on filament and resin printers (and will be tested on multiple printers of each type before sending out the files!). \nReward Tiers\nThere are reward tiers for 1, 2 or all of the Core Bundles. There is even a cheaper all in pledge that gives everything except the 2 larger ships (Arrodan Syndicate and Cin'dar Navy Core Bundles' ships) that will not be printable on small resin printers. The 3 other ships will be printable on small resin printers! Large resin printers and normal medium FDM printers will be able to print all 5 ships.\nMerchant Tier\nWe have a special merchant tier available to everyone who is looking to sell printed miniatures from our range of products. Our merchant licensing program is still in the works, but you can sign up for it right now! \nYou will be paying a small admin fee and 10% from all sales. Every month you will send us a report in a format provided from us.\nFirst year - $60 CAD admin fee (included in your pledge) + 10% of sales\nEvery year after - $30 license fee + 10% of sales\nThere will be no $100s paid yearly for your license fees. Stay tuned for more information on this as the campaign continues.\nPrinter Preparations\nShips will be keyed and sliced up for different sizes of printers. The 3 initial sizes are:\nAllstretch goal ships will be printable on small resin printers and The Fleet reward tier with only 3 of the ships, will include every stretch goal just like The Armada tier. The only difference is the absence of the 2 large ships!\nSmall resin printers from Photon and Mars sizes and up. \nMedium sized FDM printers like the Ender 3 and up\nLarge volume resin printers like the Transform.\nAesthetics\nThe aesthetics of Sordane and its many airships and races, are inspired by arcanapunk fantasy. The world is very much still high fantasy (dragons, swords, magic, etc), but magic makes life more interesting, deadly and ultimately more fun by introducing a high level of technology created from magic! It is entwined into every element of the existence of this world. \nNote: if you don't like the way something looks, the stretch goals will provide great amounts of additional miniatures and modular options for the core minis and ships. Please don't be afraid to make recommendations of stuff you would like to see in the stretch goals! Only the first initial stretch goals are set. More will come later!\nCin'dar Navy Corsairs from the Cin'dar Navy Core Bundle\nThe Gleaming Shard from the Artificer Guilds Core Bundle\nTesting out some homebrew rules with a couple of the ships =)\nShoal Class Trade Barge from the Merchant Guilds Core Bundle\nSize comparison of the 5 Core Bundle ships!\nCin'dar Navy\nThe Cin'dar Navy is one of the greatest fighting forces in the skies of Sordane. They are well equipped and patrol, not only their own territory, but that of neighbouring nations that pay tribute to the crown of Cin'dar for its protection of their trading and passenger routes.\nThe Ship - Roshan Class Cruiser - These massive ships are the main battle might of the Cin'dar Navy. Aside from the legendary Titan Class Battleships, they are equipped with powerful fighting forces and impressive armaments. There are almost no other ships known to the continent that exists that can go 1 on 1 with a Roshan Class Cruiser.\nThe Crew - Cin'dar Corsairs - The Cin'dar Corsairs are the grizzled backbone of the Cin'dar Navy. Ranging from eager fresh recruits to war-hardened veterans, the Cin'dar Corsairs are a righteous organisation of warriors that sail the skies of Bordair exterminating pirates and keeping the peace - Cin'dar's peace...\nCin'dar Navy Core Bundle\nMerchant Guilds\nThe world of Sordane has 9 continents and many nations on each of them. The powerful Merchant Guilds control most of the economic life blood. They travel the skies moving people, resources and riches all around the globe to seek their piece of the pie and live better lives.\nThe Ship - Shoal Class Trade Barge - The Shoal Class Trade Barge is a mainstay in the Merchant Guilds of Sordane. Heavily armoured, slow, but reliable, they populate the skies of the trade routes and above the major cities. The Trader Guilds save money and spend less on their ships. Opting for the less expensive Shard Blimps. Powered by engines with smaller crystal shards providing magical vapors. While slower and less advanced, they attract less attention from raiders and pirates.\nThe Crew - Mercenaries - The Merchant Guilds often hire mercenaries to travel the skies with them. These mercenary contracts are often short term as typically adventurers will barter for payment and free passage from one city to another parting ways on arrival in order to provide protection. Pirates need be wary for these seemingly innocuous ships can often contain a very combat capable crew of guardian adventurers.\nMerchant Guilds Core Bundle\nArrodan Syndicate\nThe Arrodan Syndicate is known as the Arrodan Guild by most. But  unlike most, they live outside the law in most of the nations where their operations can be found. Their size and influence provide their leadership with unparalleled protection from the authorities in the nations in which they operate and some even say they run several nations as a shadow organisation. No one knows their true numbers and they are entirely nomadic in nature and they are spread far and wide.\nThe Ship - Geshtar Class HQ Airship - The Geshtar HQ ships are from where the Syndicate operates out of. These flying fortresses have entire communities living aboard them. They are slow, but incredibly powerful and the focal point of any large scale battle. Few ships command the respect that even 1 of these monstrosities does.\nThe Crew - Ardragoons - The warriors of the Syndicate are known as the Ardragoons. They are a fierce and loyal fighting force of powerful wizards and fighters. Children are stolen from orphanages or taken from defeated enemies. Ardragoon training methods rely on creating new family bonds within the group. Indoctrination is how they operate and power is what they respect.\nArrodan Syndicate Core Bundle\nCarren Pirates\nThe Carren Pirates are one of many criminal organisations. While not massive, they are  well known for operating along the Chill Mountains between the nations of Cin'dar and Kaydlen. Their numbers are large enough to require frequent patrols from both nations in order to stem the acts of piracy in the region.\nThe Ship - Sintel Class Frigate\nThe Sintel Class Frigates  are a dated, still used, Cin'dar Navy mainstay. They are cheap, reliable and battle ready. After the war with the Oldathar nation, Cin'dar decommissioned older frigates and left them in storage yards. During a great heist, the pirate king Histalethen broke in with his crews and stole 20 older decommissioned Sintel Frigates.\nThe Crew - Carren Raiders\nThe Carren Raiders come from all over Bordair. Typically poor or less well off citizens of the various nations are recruited when they are young and impressionable. They are promised riches and freedom from past hardships. They often have deep connections with the well organised crime syndicates in the larger cities where the Carren Raiders need help to sell their ill-gotten gains.\nCarren Pirates Core Bundle\n\nArtificer Guilds\nThe Artificer Guilds across Sordane have a reputation for creating the most useful, powerful and dangerous items in the world. There are many guilds, but only few hold enough power to create such powerful ships as The Gleaming Shard. Crews often consist of wizards, artificers and their bodyguard creations.\nThe Ship - The Gleaming Shard\nThe Gleaming Shard is one of the most advanced ships in Sordane. While there are other comparably powerful ships, when complimented with it's powerful crew, it's nearly unstoppable. The Shard is also used by the guild to study the stars, nature of the surface and the volatile nature of Sordane.\nThe Crew - Watchers of the Shard\nThe Watchers of the Shard are a group of powerful artificers and guardians personally selected by Jexal to crew the Gleaming Shard - pride of the guild. These crew are battle hardened and employ all manner of magical aerial tactics. \nArtificer Guilds Core Bundle\nKickstarter Exclusive Monster Mini\nThe Arcane Dragon will be available to the following reward tiers for free:\nThe Fleet\nThe Armada\nMerchants of Sordane\nIt's just added value on top of everything else. I really hope that those of you who are on the lower tiers don't feel left out. Nothing is being taken away from your pledges and you're still getting the 2 Skycoaches completely free no matter what tier you are on. That's still some pretty awesome value!\nIf I know anything about Lee and his abilities, this dragon is going to be AMAZING. Head on over to his Patreon and check him out. https://www.patreon.com/minimonstermayhem/posts.\nNote: If you upgrade your pledge or late pledge to one of the included tiers up until the end of May, you will still receive the dragon file. After that, it will never be sold again.\nKickstarter Exclusive Arcane Dragon (lore to follow later)\n50 Cast n Play Bases For All Tiers!\nCast n Play have provided us with 50 of their bases for ALL TIERS. You read that right. We just added a ton of beautiful bases to our campaign for you to print out for your minis. They feature many different useful terrains!\nPlayable Interiors\nWe unlocked them at $160k and that will allow us to make interiors for every ship in the campaign. This Stretch Goal will add some initial development time to each Core Bundle, but we will still try to get the bundles out as we had planned before (one at a time and release them likely in pairs or singular 1 month apart or so).\nIf you are not interested in printing your ship with the playable interiors, you can still print the solid form pieces of each ship. This is simply an added option =)\nAll 4 levels of the Carren Pirates Sintel Class Frigate\nPrototype Work in Progress\nAs you can see from the images, we have finished the first draft of the ship, but there will be more work required as we go forward and we will be continuing to review and improve. Some things are final, some things are not. This ship will be the biggest of the medium ships (some of the stretch goal ships may be on this level as well like the brain flayers).\nThere a few things to note about the ships and their interior designs going forward:\nThe ships will have open spaces and closed rooms like you see on the lowest level of the example ship and the 3rd level with the engine room, brig and cannon battery. Lots of space, but they will have predefined areas\nOn the prototype the internal doors are solid, but we will be engineering a way for them to either be removable or able to open! Stay tuned for updates =)\nThe main deck or the \"2nd level\" of the Carren Pirate Sintel Class Frigate\nThe main deck or the \"3rd level\" of the Carren Pirate Sintel Class Frigate\nShip Dimensions\nThe dimensions of the Carren Pirate Ship are the largest of the 3 medium ships in the Core Bundles. It is about 70 cm long, 26 cm wide (excluding the propellers), and about 8-9 cm in height per level. It's not small =). The interior you get is expansive. I already have multiple sessions planned on this bad boy. The Merchant Shoal Class Barge and The Gleaming Shard are both around 50 cm long each and a little bit skinnier in deck space than the Sintel Frigate. They will each have 1-2 internal decks along with the top deck. The Arrodan Syndicate Geshtar and the Cin'dar Navy Roshan Cruiser will both have 4-6 decks (they are big!)\nThis specific ship will be one of the 3 medium ships (and all stretch goal ships) that will be pieced and keyed for small resin printers from the Anycubic Photon and larger. It's obviously not a quick build, but it will be with you forever and it will provide many great playing experiences. I am currently printing off the prototype right now on my Transform printers so I should have some updates for you of actual printed ship layers in a couple of days. Look for updates on the smaller sliced and keyed versions coming soon!\nNote: There will be assembly instructions with every ship for each of the different sizes of sliced versions! (small resin, medium, etc)\nThe main deck or the \"4th level\" of the Carren Pirate Sintel Class Frigate\nAs promised, I have taken 4 popular Stretch Goals that were unsuccessfully voted for from the survey and moved them over to addons for people to help chip to reach more Stretch Goals!\nThese 4 Addons are just that - additional content. These would have been developed outside of the campaign eventually, but since we want to give you guys a chance for more stretch goals, we are adding them to the back end of the campaign for that extra push! (see below for How It Works)\nHow It Works\nOn each Addon, you will see a dollar amount (in Canadian dollars!) to add to your pledge for each addon. Simply change your pledge and increase the $ amount for the number of addons you want. You will be allowed to select your addons in the MyMiniFactory pledge manager at the end of the campaign\nIncreasing Your Pledge Amount\nIf you're not sure how to increase your pledge amount, it's pretty simple. Just go to the top of this campaign page and click the button that says \"Manage your pledge\" \nFrom here, you will click on \"Change your pledge\" and simply increase the $ amount by which addons you would like! For example, the Roc + the Rules Guide would be an additional CA$14. All of them would be CA$ 34 .\nDelivery\nAddons will be done after the Core Bundles are delivered. Same as the regular stretch goals! (The Rules Guide may come out earlier).\n\nBy popular request, we now have a Social Stretch Goal that we can reach! If we get 100 backers from the shared link below, we will unlock 3 unique halfling pterodactyl riders! (Please make sure you tell your friends to actually pick a tier - $1 donations will not be counted towards this goal!) - We have unlocked this stretch goal!!\nUNLOCKED!\nStretch Goal Link:  https://bit.ly/2HAT5cV\n\nMyMiniFactory Pledge Manager\nWhenever we are ready to start delivering files, currently planned for April tentatively,  your pledge will be accessible via the MyMiniFactory Pledge Manager.\nThe MyMiniFactory Pledge Manager is designed for seamless STL file fulfillment.

The base set of .STLs offer incredible value which will get greater with the more stretch goals achieved.\n A FREE .STL file is available here to test print for yourself, it also includes a Chitubox file if you happen to be printing on a resin unit. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5lxbh345cuumtq2/AAC3DwE0uusEhBaVH4zSQLv8a?dl=0\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHere are the renders and original prints for each of the 25 base Dwarves. .STL files have versions with both an attached base or no base variations. \nPrinted physical models come attached to a black base as shown in the images and are printed in either Elegoo or Anycubic Grey resins. Models are on a 32mm base (apart from the Blacksmith who is on a 40mm, stretch goals might also vary).\nBackers of the digital tier will also receive the chitubox project files which contain the models hollowed and supported, the same files I used to print the models below. So if you have a resin machine such as the Elegoo Mars, Epax X1, Anycubic Photon etc... these files will just need slicing and should be ready to go :)\nDwarven Barkeep\nDwarven Barkeep Variant\nDwarven Travelling Merchant\nDwarven Brawler\nDwarven Brawler Variant\nDwarven Brawling Santa\nDwarven Santa\nDwarven Blacksmith\nDwarven Guardian\nDwarven Infantry\nDwarven Rogues\n Here are the stretch goals for this campaign. Work will start on these once the campaign has ended. Any new art will be featured here.\n\u00a32,000 - Undead Dwarf ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a32,500 - Dwarven Wizard ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a33,000 - Dwarven Cleric ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a33,500 - Dwarven Ranger/Hunter ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a34,000 - Dwarven Barbarian ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a34,500 - Dwarven Paladin ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a35,000 - Dwarven Death Knight ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a36,000 - Dwarven King ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a37,000 - Female Dwarves x 3 (Artificer/Engineer, Herbalist and Sorceress) ---- UNLOCKED!!!! \n\u00a37,750 - Dwarven Gravedigger ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\n\u00a38,500 - Beach Holiday Dwarf ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a311,000 - 3 Additional Female Dwarves (Warrior Tank, Paladin and Ranger/Hunter) ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\u00a312,000 - 3 Additional Variants, Logger (based on the Barkeep), Druid (Based on the Wizard) and Chef Warrior (Based on the Chef and Santa) ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\nSOCIAL MEDIA STRETCH GOALS :\n25/25 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Guardian Variant ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n 50/50 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Coal Miner ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n75/75 Shares/Retweets - Dwarven Chef ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\n\n104/100 Shares/Retweets - Female Dwarven Barkeep ---- UNLOCKED!!!!\n\nWe utilise a combination of Pixologic Zbrush and Autodesk Maya to create our models, Marmoset Toolbag is used to bring you the model renders and Chitubox Slicer is the software for prepping our 3D printing files.\nOnce we have a 3D file ready for printing we transfer it via USB to one of our 3D Printers. Our farm consists of several Elegoo Mars' MSLA printers along with a Kelant S400 for larger/bulk prints. Prints take varying amounts of time, to maximise hardware consumable life, as well as printing time, we pack our printbeds with more models as long as it doesn't reduce quality or success rate. We have a range of spare consumables and a supply of resin upfront for incoming work.\nOnce printed we clean our models using a 2 stage isopropyl clean. Models are then given time to dry before going into an ultrasonic bath in warm water. Once done, we remove supports and then submerge them into water and cure via UV lamps to be sure all the resin is completely solid. Models are given a mild isopropyl rub after they have cured/dried, finally they're glued to a base.\nWith regards to packaging and delivery, we like to recycle as much as we can so will re-use as much packaging as possible whilst also keeping the models safe. We use a combination of boxes, sponge and padding(like bubble wrap) to ensure models are well protected.\nOnce the campaign has ended production will begin. .STL files will be sent out for the base models soon after campaign end to those that pledged for them. \nIf you have pledged to a physical tier we'll need to know which of the Dwarves you wish to get in your pledge, this can include stretch goal Dwarves that have been made at the time, although the manufacturer of these might delay your order slightly. Once the campaign is over and all the pledges tallied we'll send out a survey asking which models you would like, you can also email - EpicsNStuffs@gmail.com with any questions or queries.\nProduction on both the stretch goals and physical prints will happen simultaneously. If people would like to purchase additional physical prints of the stretch goals if reached then they will be able to at additional cost. You can add additional models by adding the value of them to your pledge (\u00a310 for 1, \u00a315 for 2, \u00a319 for 3 and \u00a322 for 4). If you do this please send us a message either via the above email or direct PM and we'll add a note to your pledge and reference it once all pledges have been processed.\nUPDATES - We'll publish updates to the Kickstarter as and when they're needed prior to the campaign ending as well as keeping people informed on progress once production has began. This campaign will have email: EpicsNStuffs@gmail.com dedicated to it, any communication should come to this email to get a fast reply. \nShipping costs added when you pledge, nothing else is added once the campaign ends. We have shipped plenty of these miniatures around the world, this is simply how much it costs and includes the packaging and postal charges. \nEstimated delivery for this project is June 2020/July 2020. There may be minor delays caused by factors that are not under our control such as postage delays or customs. We haven't currently experienced this in current store sales but there is always the risk of incidents outside of our control. We would endeavor to keep backers updated via the Kickstarter until all items are delivered.\n\"Please note the above estimate is based on a prediction we have done, if the KS becomes more successful than I thought this will cause the delivery date to shift.\" ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe base set of digital files are complete and have been printed by myself, so with regards to the digital base element of the project there is no risk at all. Additional digital stretch goals along with their test printing is also low risk as we have a track record of producing such assets in a timely manner.\n\nWe have delivered over 50 physical miniatures via online stores since enabling this feature a little over a month ago and have received brilliant feedback. We have scaled up to accommodate targets outlined in the kickstarter in terms of hardware and consumables needed for printing.\n\nIn crowdfunding projects there are always certain variables that could escape the initial plan. As a consequence there is always the possibility of a delay in delivery although delivery estimates for physical items are currently very conservative. These delays are typically caused by last minute additions to the campaign, such as new Stretch Goals, or are a delay within the shipping process itself such as problems with customs releasing the goods, there is always the potential for 3D printer hardware issues however we have spares and the means to purchase additional hardware if required.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Digital", "descp": "This pledge grants you access to all the digital .STL files for the Dwarven miniatures so you can print them at yourself.\n.STL files will be delivered via a download link and will not have shipping costs.\nINCLUDES:\n.STL Files delivered via Dropbox or My Mini Factory\nAll Models Test Printed", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2020"}], "stat": ["1,005 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Physical x 1", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 1 x Dwarven miniature 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n1 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (16 left of 20)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a315 or more", "title": "Physical x 2", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 2 x Dwarven miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n2 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers", "Limited (11 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a319 or more", "title": "Physical x 3", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to 3 x Dwarven miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n3 x Dwarven miniatures of your choice", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["8 backers", "Limited (7 left of 15)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a334 or more", "title": "Physical Rogues", "descp": "This pledge gets you access to the 8 x Dwarven Rogue variation miniatures, 3d printed in resin.\nResin models will come with a round plastic base and shipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nINCLUDES:\n8 x Dwarven Rogues (1 of each variant)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["0 backers", "Limited (5 left of 5)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a388 or more", "title": "Physical -

The adventure includes pre-generated characters, and is playable as part of a campaign or as stand-alone play. Doom on the Warden is a new frontier for Metamorphosis Alpha, in both style and substance, and for the first time the pre-generated characters include wolfoids.\nFloating Above the Starship Warden...\nThink you know everything about the starship Warden?\nThink again!\nIt was a little-known fact that the colonization starship Warden had many discrete safeguards and catastrophe protocols in place should complications arise during its long voyage. These safeguards proved insufficient to protect the Warden when it encountered the radiation cloud. When the ship\u2019s computers analyzed the impending threat, the military A.I. enacted the Omicron Protocols, causing a portion of the ship\u2019s dorsal hull to disengage. This portion, hidden within the Warden\u2019s outer bulkhead, contains the classified military cantonment, code named \u201cLevel 0.\u201d\nUncontrollably drifting through uncharted space, mankind\u2019s first colonization starship Warden has survived for over 300 years. While floating through the interstellar dark, strange civilizations have arisen - mutant, human, and wolfoid. Battles have been fought, wars have been waged, and finally the end is near\u2026if anyone survives. The moment has come to repair the Warden and return it on its course \u2013 or to disable it forever.\nIn 1976, TSR published Metamorphosis Alpha, the very first sci-fi RPG, written by James M. Ward.\nIn 2014, Goodman Games worked with Mr. Ward to re-release Metamorphosis Alpha in a deluxe hardcover edition.\nIn 2016, Goodman Games released Epsilon City, the largest expansion to Metamorphosis Alpha since its debut.\nNow, in 2020, James M. Ward is back with an adventure to rival the deadliest crafted by the mind of Gary Gygax, Tomb of Horrors. Goodman Games brings you Doom on the Warden, the adventure that changes Metamorphosis Alpha forever!\nColor cover edition of Doom on the Warden\nAbout the Product\nSince the release of Metamorphosis Alpha, the story of the starship Warden has continued unchanged, but that ends now. Doom on the Warden is the first-ever official Metamorphosis Alpha adventure that continues the story and answers the question\u2026What next?\nFormat: Doom on the Warden will be published as an 8.5\u201dx11\u201d hardcover, with an estimated length of 32-48 pages. (This will likely grow with stretch goals.) The hardcover is available with a color cover, or in a gold foil edition. \nAuthor: Mr. James M. Ward is the creator of Metamorphosis Alpha and a 44-year veteran of the gaming industry, with prior creative credits that include Gamma World as well as many D&D products during his time as a creator and Vice President with TSR. Mr. Ward has already completed the manuscript, expanding on materials, playtests, and notes built over a lifetime of gaming, including some that trace back even to his famed original campaign.\nContent: Doom on the Warden is packed with the answers to the starship Warden\u2019s biggest mysteries!\nThe Adventure: James M. Ward\u2019s most devious adventure ever! Part hex crawl, part deadly delve. Forty-four years after the original release of Metamorphosis Alpha, the story of the second half of the voyage is finally being told.\nCampaign-Style Play: Drop this adventure into your ongoing campaign to turn everything on its head. Complacent denizens of the starship Warden will find themselves racing to uncover the deepest of the Warden\u2019s secrets, and to restore its course.\nConvention-Style Play: Three teams of pre-generated characters, each with their own individual reasons for undertaking this deadly quest, are ready to populate your table as the adventure was originally run.\nThe Maps: A map of the mysterious \u201cLevel 0\u201d and the military command dome found within.\nWhat is Metamorphosis Alpha?\nMetamorphosis Alpha is the original science-fiction tabletop role playing game in which the players are passengers on the interstellar colony ship Warden. Struck by radiation, the ship\u2019s occupants have mutated into unusual and deadly creatures. After several generations, civilization has been cast into ruins, and there is little knowledge of how to use the technology of the Warden. Reduced to tribal barbarians, they must struggle to survive amidst a backdrop of advanced technology, mutant monsters, and the vast spaces on an intergalactic colony ship.\nNeed a copy of the original rules? Goodman Games publishes a Metamorphosis Alpha Collector\u2019s Edition, which reprints the original 1976 first edition rules set. The collector\u2019s edition also reprints all the original Dragon magazine material for Metamorphosis Alpha, and has new content as well. It is available as both a softcover and deluxe oversized hardcover edition, as well as a foil oversized hardcover, and can be purchased as an add-on to this campaign.\nFoil cover edition of Doom on the Warden (mockup)\nWhat is Doom on the Warden?\nAt its core, Doom on the Warden is a horror story. Characters enter a strange, secluded location and are immediately confronted by incomprehensible foes who often strike without warning. Mad voices taunt them and, no matter how prepared the characters think they are, they are in truth out of their depth. Whether it is the primal dread of the shroud of darkness or the maddening uncertainty that vital equipment will work when called upon, the referee should emphasize the horrific elements of each region, seeking to unsettle not only the characters but the players themselves.\nThe adventure expands on the mysterious involvement of Earth\u2019s military aboard the starship Warden, previously mentioned in The Warden Armory and the Goodman Games Gazette. There is new information on what happened in the Warden\u2019s early days. Unraveling the mystery sends the characters through 4 distinct geographical regions, into the secret military command dome, and beyond. Along the way, they will be confronted by threats old and new across 54 possible encounter areas.\nThe Stretch Goals\nWe love Metamorphosis Alpha as much as you, so we\u2019ve outlined a series of stretch goals to elevate your experiences aboard the starship Warden. Here is the breakdown of stretch goals, which may evolve over the course of the campaign:\nStretch goal #1 ($7,000): CLEARED! First set of printable reference cards. There are 100+ creatures, weapons, and items to encounter in this adventure. We would like to create simple cards to summarize them for players and judges alike. These will be provided in PDF format and can be printed for use in game. This first stretch goal will cover creation of approximately 30 such cards, which should encompass most of the weapons in this adventure. \nStretch goal #2 ($12,000): CLEARED! Two new colored metal arm bands available as add-ons. First launched in our previous Metamorphosis Alpha projects, these metal arm bands mimic the control bands in the original game. These make great tabletop props and Mr. Ward allows their use in his convention games. At this stretch goal, we will manufacture two kinds of new bands: the bio-science band (first encountered in Level of the Lost), and the military command band (first seen in the Warden Armory). These will be add-ons available at $10 each.\nStretch goal #3 ($15,000): CLEARED! Second set of printable reference cards, similar to the goal above. This will be another 30 or so such cards, which should be enough to cover most of the items encountered in the adventure.\nBonus stretch goal! ($19,000) CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of Level of the Lost! \nStretch goal #4 ($22,000): CLEARED! Printed endsheets with great art to adorn them!\nBonus stretch goal! ($24,000): CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of The Android Underlords and Warden Adventures. \nBonus stretch goal! ($26,000) CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of Robots Among Us. \nStretch goal #5 ($27,000): CLEARED! Third set of printable reference cards, similar to the goal above. This will be another 30 or so such cards, which should cover most of the monsters, mutants, and robots encountered in the adventure.\nBonus stretch goal ($29,000): CLEARED! Backers will receive a PDF of The Mutation Manual.\nStretch goal #6 ($35,000):CLEARED!A sewn-in satin ribbon bookmark to hold your place when you run the adventure.\nStretch goal #7 ($45,000): Expanded page count on the printed books to include some or all of the reference cards. There are some printing parameters we'll have to verify but the goal is to get most or all of the reference cards printed and bound into the book.\nAnd beyond that...who knows?\nDoom on the Warden color arm bands (mockup)\nAdd-Ons\nThere are so many ways to support this Kickstarter!\nAdd-On Items from Previous Metamorphosis Alpha Projects: You can add any of the below print items to help support the Kickstarter and achieve stretch goals.\n Metamorphosis Alpha Collector\u2019s Edition, softcover edition, $30\n Metamorphosis Alpha Deluxe Collector\u2019s Edition, oversized hardcover edition, $80\n Metamorphosis Alpha Deluxe Collector\u2019s Edition, oversized hardcover gold foil edition, $120\n Metamorphosis Alpha deck plans illustration, 24\"x36\" poster, $20\n The Android Underlords (adventure), $10\n The Captain\u2019s Table (adventure), $10\n The Level of the Lost (adventure), $10\n Death Ziggurat in Zero-G (adventure), $10\n Warden Adventures (scenarios), $10\n What are the Prisoners of Rec-Loc-119?

These make great tabletop props and Mr. Ward allows their use in his convention games. Backers of Doom on the Warden will be able to add on bracelets at a cost of $10 each! We will do a fresh production run to meet demand. \nThe colors available are based on the previous two Metamorphosis Alpha Kickstarters, plus the two new ones from Doom on the Warden, and include all except the rare command band. The available colors are:\nFrom the original Metamorphosis Alpha: civilian (brown), ecology (green), security (red), engineering (gray), and medical (white) bands.\nFrom Epsilon City: military (black), programmer (yellow), sciences (light blue), administration (dark blue).\nFrom Doom on the Warden: bio-science band (first encountered in Level of the Lost), and the military command band (first seen in the Warden Armory).\nAdditional bands may be unlocked via stretch goals. Quantities are limited!\nPlease note: the arm bands must be shipped separately from books and will have a small incremental shipping charge applied after the Kickstarter (roughly equivalent to an extra $1-$2 per armband depending on destination.)\nTimeline for Release\nDoom on the Warden is scheduled to ship in September of 2020. Many of our previous Kickstarters have expanded significantly in scope as successive stretch goals are cleared. If this project expands significantly with new stretch goals, we will provide an update on release date.\nShipping & Handling\nShipping and handling costs are not included in the pledge levels. At the end of the Kickstarter, Shipping and handling charges will be invoiced via BackerKit. This allows us to add on stretch goals as the project expands. Expected cost of shipping/handling may change if the project evolves from a single hardcover. If you are unsure how expensive international shipping can be, please ask us for an estimate.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has run many Kickstarters and all have been successfully fulfilled.

While we ultimately expect to reach our typical fulfillment speeds, note that orders placed during this closed beta may take several months for fulfillment as we ramp up capacity. Fulfillment will be gradual, as we work through orders in the order they are received. \nThis timeline is our best estimate, but we will open submissions and start shipping orders as early as possible. Note that, in the case of high order volume, order submission for both hand-painted and 3D printed color miniatures may be made available in stages, with priority based on time of the pledge.

Our rendering and UI has re-imagined classic techniques for the digital world. Replicate the beautiful subtlety of dry brushing, ink-washing's ability to add depth, and much more. Printed designs will include subtle shading and lighting within the color texture, making details pop and adding fantastic realism to your design.\n\nBy giving you the option to hand-tune highlights, low-lights, shininess, hue shift and more, we will give you unparalleled design tools and let you see a whole new spectrum of possibilities.\nCutting Edge Manufacturing Technology\n3D printing has evolved at incredible speeds, with new technologies emerging all the time. We're happy to say that this thrilling new print technology means that highly detailed, color printed tabletop minis are finally possible! \nHigh-tech, full-color 3D printers turn pixels on the screen into atoms in your hand!\nColor is produced by mixing a range of color materials on the fly, allowing for full, vivid CMYK prints with beautiful gradients and detail. This technology employs dissolvable support materials, removing the need for support sprues and allowing for smoother, more consistent surfaces than ever before.\nThis plastic is similar in durability to our premium plastic material. Faint layer lines may be visible on the surface of the figures, especially in strong direct light.\nOne-Click Color Schemes \nNo need to have an art degree or knowledge of color theory to have fun coloring your character. You will be able to quickly paint your character in seconds, using a wide range of artist-designed color motif presets so you can \u201ctry on\u201d a wide range of color schemes or use them as a jumping-off point for your own design.\nA Multitude of Digital Paint Options\nWe'll offer a library of artist-tuned paint options for a wide range of materials. Experience the coloring-book joy of turning a character from grayscale to full, rich color quickly and easily!\n We'll also offer the ability to \"mix your own paint.\" Customize more than just the color: adjust shininess, highlight, mid-light, and low-light tones, and more. Your hand-crafted digital 'paints' will be saved with your character, allowing you to revisit and tweak them to your heart's content.\nTons of artistically tuned options for every material, all at your disposal!\nFive years ago, Kickstarter's support allowed us to launch revolutionary web-based design tools for custom miniatures.

We've continued to work tirelessly, adding content and working with the world-leading 3D printing service providers to deliver the latest and greatest technology--and the best custom miniatures on the market.\n\nSince our launch, we've expanded our tools and customization options.

And we're certainly not done yet! You'll even find several sneak-peeks at upcoming parts sprinkled throughout this very Kickstarter! We continue to develop new models for the site, prioritizing the most commonly requested additions. \nHero Forge adds new content every single week on what we call \"Treasure Tuesdays!\"\nWhy Kickstarter? \nKickstarter has been an incredible tool to help us connect with tabletop and miniatures fans. This direct connection has helped us work with our most passionate supporters and offers an avenue to hear about what features and content you'd like to see added.

In particular, for their creativity and dedication, we would like to thank Glenn De Leon Garza, Ilya Bondarenko, Roman and Vadim at ZugZug Art, and Rich Carey.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQ: Will reaching your funding goal distract you from adding new content? Color is great, but I want more stuff on Hero Forge too!\nA: Our modelers\u2019 time and effort will still be dedicated to new content, parts, fantasy races, and features, even as our tech development team works on color at the same time. With independent, focused effort by our art team, we anticipate accelerating additions to the site, even as we add our new color features.\n\nQ: Will I be able to redeem my reward for an \"XL\" or mounted \"XXL\" figure?\nA: For simplicity, we have set rewards for our standard size-range, unmounted figures. If you prefer to redeem your reward's value towards a more expensive XL or mounted figure, that's alright: we will apply your pledge value and you can pay the difference. Pricing on larger-sized XL and XXL figures is TBD.\n\nQ: I saw a part or feature in your video which isn't on your site yet! What's the story?\nA: We have new parts, features, and content in development constantly. In order to keep up with weekly content releases, our art team works diligently on future releases, both those near completion and ones much further away. If you don't recognize any particular parts on this page, chances are they are in development and will appear on the site in the future!\n\nQ: When are you going to add X part? Will Y feature be available when color launches?\nA: We process all feature and part requests through the following survey, so please feel free to fill it out to have your request added to our official user wish-list: https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/HeroForgeRequest. Our user request wishlist has many hundreds of unique entries, so we cannot provide estimated dates for specific additions.\n\nQ: Will Hero Forge 2.0 be backwards compatible?\nA: Yes! All of your existing characters and saves will be fully compatible with our new tools. You will be able to revisit old designs and add color.\n\nQ: Will digital download .stl files be available in color?\nA: No. Not initially, at least. File formats which support color are less widely supported by 3D printing software platforms, as color is not yet common for home 3D printers. While we expect to one day offer textured, color 3D model files, for the time being we will continue to distribute digital download model files in .stl format: the most commonly supported format for 3D printing software platforms.\n\nQ: What Printer are you using for your color prints?\nA: We plan to manufacture full color prints using the Mimaki 3DUJ-553 full color printer. We have experimented with a wide range of color printers, and have found this technology to offer the most vivid color, cleanest gradients, and best quality at miniature scale. At Hero Forge, we are always exploring the latest and greatest materials, and have historically added to or updating our material options as 3D print technology improves--this is always a possibility for the future.\n\nQ: Do I have to use all my rewards at once, or can I order figures one at a time?\nA: Backer tiers include one instance of shipping. If you'd prefer to redeem your backer rewards one at a time, you will simply need to pay for any instance of shipping after the first.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1x 3D Printed Color Mini", "descp": "Receive Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on a full-color, 3D printed tabletop miniature!\nINCLUDES:\nCustom FULL-COLOR 3D PRINTED miniature\nGet early access to full color design tools\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["17,577 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 39 or more", "title": "1 Year Access to Token Maker Unlimited", "descp": "Get a full year of access to the new Token Maker.\nINCLUDES:\nGet early access to full color design tools\nReceive 1-year access to the Token Maker Unlimited\nGet access to Kickstarter Backer-Exclusive \"decal\"\nBe added to our mailing list and receive exclusive-mail updates", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["834 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Print and Paint Yourself", "descp": "Receive special Kickstarter-exclusive pricing on 10 digital download .stl files for 3D printed tabletop miniatures!

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The coolest game to ever hit the planet first appeared some 38 years ago, featuring an electronic tower that lit up, played music, and somehow ran an epic fantasy adventure game with its state-of-the-art technological wizardry. That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar.

So, while we've learned from each one we've done, the challenges keep getting bigger as well. Notably, the tower itself is a complicated component with mechanical and electrical components. Fortunately, we've enlisted Tim Burrell-Saward and Andrew Sung, both with significant experience on these types of projects, to assist us in overseeing the manufacturing process.

And we're finally ready for you all to have an early look. I tapped Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer, to do a deep dive on the app's heroic journey to date. As with all of these updates, keep in mind that we are still refining and will continue to refine until the game gets into your hands and beyond. Everything here is still \"in progress\".

It's one last check to find any last little problem before we hit the big red button that says: spend a million dollars and make 25,000 copies of this game.\nI have to say, it's an extremely rewarding milestone. This is a project that I've been working on for three years. To open a box and see an actual playable game, is pretty amazing. But it's also a bit tense.

With the print materials locked down, we're looking to refine the data in the app to further balance the game and make it more fun. These playtests will be done in Tabletop Simulator (on Steam) and (unlike prior playtests) will use the actual app (with a built-in Tower simulator). We know some of you signed up for and did some playtesting for us last year. But circumstances can change -- especially during current events these days. So, even if you signed up before, if you're still interested in testing, please sign up again.

As most of you know, the original game from 1982 was a competitive game. Players raced to defeat the brigands in the Tower. The first one to do it won the game. Early on in our development, we decided to make our restored version cooperative. We think it's more thematic appropriately and mechanically. But we knew some folks would like to be able to play competitively like in the original. We continued to work on it even as we entered the Kickstarter and finally announced we were doing it way back in Update #11."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "Let's Check Out the Box Bottom", "update_content": "As we move into this next stage of production, my plan is to post smaller, more regular updates and start showing off some stuff you all haven't seen or that has been updated since the campaign. Today, we're going to take a quick look at the box bottom.\nFirst thing to mention is that it's not really the box bottom at all. The box will, of course, have a bottom, but this ain't it. Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet. This meets our needs for the store shelf, but allows you to have a beautiful game box on your shelf at home."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #45", "update_userinfo": "Guest Update: Checking in on the Tower with Tim Burrell-Saward", "update_content": "I know folks like to get a closer look at the manufacturing process, and there's no one better to fill us in than Tim Burrell-Saward, our project manager and lead engineer.\nBefore we jump in, Board Game Geek's annual \"Most Anticipated\" list is underway.

This is a very visual Kickstarter, and you will need to watch the videos to see for yourself. Each individual dice has a video below! There are 10 total dice, be sure to watch them all!\nMassive increases to production have been made; new equipment, hired help, and a more efficient process means that all dice will be shipped before September of 2020. This is still an overestimate, they may arrive sooner.\nOrders will be filled by backer number, meaning the first orders in go out first. If you haven't ordered and want your product faster, don't wait any longer!\nWhat you see in this Kickstarter is not what you get, because what you will get is even better. The funding has allowed me to make some major improvements to the dice. The improvements: higher quality colorant for the resin, higher quality acrylic for the numbers, better equipment to make molds for a more perfect dice, and improved sanding process to eliminate small imperfections.\nSome individual dice have gotten improvements, read the message under each one. You will be able to see the full improvements before finalizing any selections.\nMalfeasance \nPLAY\n\n Malfeasance will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nAcropolis \nPLAY\n\n Acropolis will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nAndromeda \nPLAY\n\n Andromeda will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nGrandiosity\nPLAY\n\n Grandiosity will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above and a darker purple paint for numbers.\nBotanical\nPLAY\n\n Botanical will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above and a darker green paint for its numbers.\nTempest\nPLAY\n\n Tempest will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nHellfire\nPLAY\n\n Hellfire will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nNoxious\nPLAY\n\n Noxious will look much like it does in this video, but with the improvements stated above.\nAphrodisiac\nPLAY\n\n Aphrodisiac will look a little different than it does in the video, the core and shell will be similar, but the paint for the numbers will be white.

But excellent results can also be achieved with the filament\nFree files Example stl files\nfree download:\nhttps://www.crosslances.net/2019/11/15/free-files-example-stl-files/\nInstead all the scenic pieces are ideal for filament printers, without any support necessity.\nWhen battles are raging in the world there are always those who choose to be part of the factions of evil and those of good. Paladins fight for light and peace, faithful to the sun god, these brave fighters protect their golden cities, do you want to fight in the path of light too?\n\nThe tower is built in three distinct sections: base, center and top. So that the center is modular and the height of the tower can be decided\nWood elves don't like war but when the threat of other armies comes closer, they surely know how to defend themselves and counterattack!\nThe wood elves live in the woods and forests, they worship the goddess of nature, if you also want to defend mother earth, then you know which side to take\n\nThe tower is built in three distinct parts: base, center and top. So that the center is modular and the height of the tower can be decided\n\n               Unlike the paladins, the chaos warriors have given their soul to evil and darkness, their hearts are dark and full of evilness, always ready to give vent to their weapons!\nThe knights of chaos worship evil and darkness: demons, devils and any evil entity.\nIf you don't have any pity on anyone in battle, then the chaos is right for you!\n\nThe tower is built in three distinct parts: base, center and top. So that the center is modular and the height of the tower can be decided\n This miniature is our gift for you!\nYes exactly, you will just need to pledge any level, even just 1 euro and you will be able to download immediately!\nYou will find the download link in the updates as soon as you made the pledge.\nNow our regular customers know that we are not used to classic add-on methods found on many kickstarters.\nWe will not include stretch goals, but we will listen to all your suggestions during the campaign and we will try to sculpt as many pieces as possible based on your requests.\nIn the meantime, here you have some sculptures that you can receive for free in the \u20ac 22 or higher packages.\n\n\n               Crosslances studios is founded by 3 artists and their commons passion for the world of games.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Chess has been a game that was part of our lives as we grew up. As long as we can remember, our parents enjoyed playing a game of chess with friends, while having a glass and telling stories.\nMotivated by these memories, we decided to take a game that has been played for over 1500 years and create a set of uniquely crafted glass pieces that pay homage, but also add a new dimension to this iconic classic game. \nIt was a journey of over 12 months that got us to the point where we are ready to create the moulds so all we need is your support to start the production!\nThe process of developing the final chess pieces was as important to us as the result itself. From modern 3D printing, to an old school approach to glassmaking, our designs slowly progressed to a stage where we now partner with a factory that uses high precision technology to make our full set which requires no less than 72 simultaneous injection points. \nThe old school approach taken in the development of the final glass pieces\nThe result speaks for itself.\nThe Glass Knights are also a collection of the most refined shot glasses ever, that you can use to create a twist and a completely new playing experience, or simply flip the board over and you have yourself a tray of unique glass shots for your next party.\nYou asked yourself how come the drink doesn\u2019t spill everywhere, right? We took care of that. The food grade silicone is placed on the end of the piece in less than a second and it creates a seal that ensures that not a single drop of your precious liquid escapes.\n\nIn addition to the fun element, we wanted to create a chess board that wouldn\u2019t need to be hidden away when you\u2019re not playing. \nQuite the opposite. In fact, we designed the Glass Knights board and pieces down to the most minute details so that you would be proud to display it in your living room or office.\nRest assured that almost every person walking in the room will stop and pick up the pieces.\n\nWe were ruthless in the engineering of each piece to add intricate details on the glass, while ensuring they are durable so you don\u2019t have to worry about dropping them. That is why finding the right factory that could create such a quality piece of glass narrowed the search down to only a few that had the technology to manufacture the Glass Knights.\n\nAside from the visual aspect, we know just how important is the feel and the weight of each piece. The smooth surface of the glass and the intricate details, combined with just the right thickness, make from each piece an experience to play with.\n\nThe Glass Knights is created with kids in mind too! Aside from the fact that you don\u2019t have to worry about your kids dropping the glass pieces because they are made from one tough tempered glass, the pieces can be filled with sweets or dried fruit. \nThat will take their enjoyment of the game to the next level. The only downside may be that it\u2019s your responsibility to go down to the store and get the tasty rewards. Once you\u2019ve done that, you can have your free time while they play away!\nAlthough we don\u2019t recommend going around throwing your Glass Knight pieces, we did thousands of iterations and reiterations to create the ideal tempered glass that can be dropped and live to play another game. \nThe Executive Set is the add on that can raise your game to the ultimate level.\nWe introduced the handcrafted wooden board that glows in the dark in a limited edition that will be capped at only 100 pieces. Each will have a unique serial number as proof of its authenticity.\nIf you decide to upgrade to the Executive Set, simply choose the appropriate reward level. The only thing left is for you to enjoy it. You deserve it.\nEach Executive Set wooden board requires over 15 hours to handcraft.\n\nWhen designing the Glass Knights, we wanted to go beyond any expectations from a normal chess piece set and make every element have at least one function.\nThat is exactly what we did with the thermoformed containers that house each glass piece, as well as double as ice cube trays.\nNow with each full set, you will have 36 of the most unique ice cubes that are shaped as chess pieces! \nGetting the right dimension and weight is also something we looked closely at in order for you to feel the weight of each piece, while also ensuring the optimum thickness of the glass to make withstand pretty much all accidental drops from day to day scenarios.\n\nTo make things even more excited, we are introducing two free upgrades once we smash our first stretch goal.\nPart 1: Three Box Colors To Choose From\nThat\u2019s right! You will be able to choose the color of your Glass Knights box so that it best fits with your style or house and office design.\nPART 2: Water-Resistant Box \nIn addition, we know that you may want to take the Glass Knights box out to the pool or simply don\u2019t want to have to worry about spilling liquids inside. That is why the 100K Stretch Goal will also mean that we make the box water resistant!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreating a Kickstarter project without a doubt can pose a lot of challenges. We acknowledged this and that is why we set out to diminish to a minimum each risk by working with a team of fellow Kickstarter creators that have successfully launched 11 crowdfunding projects.\n\nWe then started to analyse each aspect and reached the conclusion that most of the challenges arise in the pre-production preparation which defines the quality and pace of the actual production process.\n\nTo diminish this risk, we narrowed our partnership to two factories which we worked closely with for over 6 months to ensure that when we launch the Kickstarter project, the Glass Knights chess board and glass pieces are at the stage where every detail is worked out, without the need to make any further changes, before creating the final metal molds and starting the production. \n\nWe look forward to embarking on this journey with you as our backers and members that helped found the Glass Knights!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "1 x Glass Piece of Your Choice", "descp": "A unique glass King, Queen, Bishop, Knight, Rook or Pawn to display in your office or home.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["90 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 159 or more", "title": "Glass Knights Pieces + Board |Early Bird", "descp": "Your unique opportunity to own a unique, full set of the Glass Knights that includes the glass pieces + board.

This time, he\u2019s deciding who\u2019s been naughty and who\u2019s been nice\u2026 that\u2019s right, he\u2019s not just Trolley Tom anymore, get ready for ."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "What's next on the Tracks?", "update_content": "Hello all you Trolley Hoppers!\nThis campaign has been a whirlwind, and we\u2019re thankful that you all took a chance on us and backed it! It was incredibly fun, so thank you guys for that! Now that the vast majority of games have been out for a bit, things are winding down slightly on our end. We wanted to give you guys an update on how things will be  moving forward.\nNumbers wise, the campaign is 91% completed. The other 9% represents backers who have either never responded to their PledgeManager email or backers who started it but didn\u2019t actually finish it. Of course the PledgeManager system isn\u2019t perfect, and it\u2019s possible you never got your email. I tried to help by posting several updates reminding you all to do it, just in case you didn\u2019t get your email, but I'm aware those may have also slipped through the cracks. Even though we were trying to cover all the bases, we understand that everyone has different circumstances, and things may have still been missed accidentally. I\u2019m here to let the remaining 9% of you know that there\u2019s no need to worry! You will still get your games, and, in fact, your entire original orders, unaltered! Since the PledgeManager is locked, you\u2019re not able to complete your orders on your end anymore. In order to still get your games, you can reach out to me, Maya, at  for help putting your address in and getting you on our weekly batches. Moving forward, we\u2019ll be sending out small weekly batches to get your games to you. I submit the batches to QuarterMaster every Thursday, and they get shipped out the next week. You can also shoot me an email if you\u2019re just curious about tracking or any sort of updates with your order in general. Now that things are really winding down, we won\u2019t be doing regular updates anymore. Here\u2019s a bunch of links to all of our websites and social media which will alert you of new games and new fun in general!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #40", "update_userinfo": "Trial by Trolley: Social Distancing Rules", "update_content": "Hey Trolley Fans, \nThank you all for your ongoing support! We have some great updates to share with you:\nShipping Update - Third Wave and Weekly Batches\nThe third wave is about to be shipped! We transferred the backer data over to QuarterMaster on Monday night. They let us know they got everything, and are just doing a final look over. This means the third wave will go out any day now! If you're on the third wave, you will receive tracking information to your email when your order has shipped.

I\u2019ve slipped and fallen on ice 3 times, so I\u2019m clearly doing amazingly. We\u2019re sending you this update just to fill you in on where we are right now as far as shipping. We had a really great time at PAX Unplugged! We were able to meet a bunch of you guys while at the con, and it was rad playing the game with you! You guys have some weird humor and apparently a lot of murder secrets, but I guess we all know whose fault that is. We\u2019re very excited to get you your games.\nLocking the PledgeManager "}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "Elaborating Production Update Info", "update_content": "Hey y'all!\nSo, a little more info about the delay. There were quite a few things that factored into us missing December as the estimated fulfillment window. It isn't actually very hard to be off on an estimate by a month. There is a lot that goes into making something on the other side of the world and then shipping it to all corners of said earth.\nWe added the Tram Sam mini pretty late in the campaign, and we had to get that mold started much later than the other molds. Typically, molds take 30-45 days to make, and there is no speeding those up. We really wanted to give you guys a great quality Tram Sam miniature, so we knew that was going to make our timeline a little tighter. As expected, it did."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 6552, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyanideandhappiness/trial-by-trolley", "project_name": "Trial By Trolley"}}, {"backer": "Impact!

This means that our fans have the power to continue or cancel the story. We crowdfund through Kickstarter because it allows us to bypass the traditional studio system, ensuring that the stories we want to tell are not constrained by what Hollywood is willing to fund. Every JourneyQuest film is produced under the Shared Cinematic License Agreement which allows you to remix, create, adapt, and distribute works set in the world of Fartherall. These are films funded by you for you. \nNote that anything marked with \"kickstarter exclusive\" is an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers (or from other crowdfunding platforms), with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.  \nTake a moment to like and follow our social media and community accounts on the services you use (ZOE Facebook \u2022 JourneyQuest Facebook \u2022 Twitter \u2022 Instagram \u2022 Twitch \u2022 Discord \u2022 YouTube). Then encourage your friends and fellow JourneyQuest fans to do the same \u2013 these signups allow us to build enthusiasm for the campaign and communicate important updates.\nAdditionally, this year we are adding Quests to our campaign. We know that our fans are our best promoters and we want to celebrate this! For all backers at any level, we will add exclusive digital rewards to your pledge for every quest completed.  \n *Final Quest rewards are contingent upon Kickstarter campaign success.\nThroughout the campaign, our livestream studio will host JOURNEYQUEST\u2019S MOST VICTORIOUS CHARACTER, Fartherall\u2019s epic bracket competition. Your votes throughout the week determine which character will arise victorious from their encounter.  Every Thursday at 6pm Pacific, we will announce the winners of the current week's matchups and immediately go into live polling for the next round's winners who will be announced at the end of the livestream. In the final week of the campaign, we will live stream a 5-hour campaign countdown and finale on Friday, July 12th. \nIn addition to the game, we will host regular JourneyQuest watch parties complete with live commentary. Be sure to watch the \"Upcoming Events\" section above as well as our social media channels to make sure you don't miss a thing! \nSHIPPING\nIMPORTANT: WE CHARGE FOR SHIPPING AFTER THE CAMPAIGN IN BACKERKIT, NOT IN KICKSTARTER.\nDo NOT add shipping fees to your pledge now. \nAnything that you pledge over the cost of a reward level will not count as credit in BackerKit and will go directly to the JourneyQuest 4 production. Only give more than a pledge level if you want us to spend your additional contributions making JourneyQuest 4 even more awesome.\nFULFILLMENT\nThe JourneyQuest 4 campaign will be fulfilled by our partners at Ship Naked, who maintain shipping depots in the United States, Canada, Germany, and Australia. Barring circumstances outside our control (like tariffs or trade wars) we will fulfill physical rewards from those depots.\n What will shipping cost in BackerKit?\n International Backers: expect to pay around $7.75 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\n United States Backers: expect to pay around $5.75 in BackerKit for base shipping on the $50 reward.\nAll shipping estimates are subject to change but will reflect the best market rates we can find when fulfillment begins.\nJourneyQuest is created by an ever-growing team of talented and passionate actors, producers, crew, and support staff. Together, we've not only produced three seasons of JourneyQuest, but the ongoing Gamers series, Dark Dungeons, Demon Hunters, Attacking the Darkness, Strowlers, and much more. \nWhile our budgets are still a fraction of what Hollywood spends, doing it right means taking care of our cast and crew. Your support is what lets us keep telling original stories that you can't find anywhere else!\nWe are excited to shoot this season in British Columbia with talented Canadian director Joanna Gaskell, the co-creator of Standard Action.\nShowrunner and writer Matt Vancil has once again lent his talents to a hilarious season four script and will oversee production.\nProducer Tony Becerra returns to oversee production. He is joined by Mike Waverecan, a producer from M1 Films. M1 Films joins Zombie Orpheus for production of this season.\nSocial media coordinator Lee House will add his considerable talents to spreading the word about this campaign far and wide.\nOf course, it wouldn't be JourneyQuest without our phenomenal cast. This season we're thrilled to bring back Christian Doyle (Perf), Alyssa Kay (Nara), Fran Kranz (Silver Tom), Kevin Pitman (Glorion), Brian Lewis (Carrow), Emille Shimkus (Wren), Jesse Lee Keeter (Rilk), Bob Sapp (Karn), Samara Lerman (Assassin), and many more! \nZombie Orpheus Entertainment is pleased to team up with The Fantasy Network, a fan-supported, creator-distributed streaming service, to broadcast every JourneyQuest episode. In addition to works from Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, The Fantasy Network distributes original programming from Arrowstorm Entertainment (Mythica), The Forge Studios (The Rangers), Recursor.tv (Nina Unlocked) as well as numerous independent producers (AFK, One Hit Die, Ren the Girl With the Mark). While many titles are available on The Fantasy Network for free, your pledge of $10 or more unlocks one month of Fantasy Network subscriber-exclusive access.\nWe will be using BackerKit for pledge management after the campaign. A BackerKit survey will be sent to all backers several months after the Kickstarter campaign has completed. You will be able to update your address, add shipping fees and shop our pre-order store for any additional items from our back catalog that you would like to add to your shipment. \nOur shipping partners at Ship Naked will be handling warehousing and shipping for our campaign from their warehouse in the US. If we have a sufficient number of international backers, we will utilize their warehouses in Canada, Germany and Australia as well.\nWorld of Fartherall is available for your storytelling and art under ZOE's new Shared Cinematic Universe License Agreement (the SCULA).\nWhat does this mean?\nIt's like the Open Gaming License and Creative Commons had little license babies: it's an agreement that gives you permission to create, adapt, and release your own derivative works within the world of Fartherall!\nCheck out the web page for the full details, but the fast and dirty summary is that as long as you abide by the terms of the agreement, you have the freedom to create non-commercial AND commercial Fartherall derivatives. Make a roleplaying game. Shoot a web series. Create your art. Sell it if you want. Or give it away. It's your choice.\nYou, the fans, have made these works possible and this new agreement helps us give back. Come and play, you're invited!\nJust remember to Share Alike, Transform (don't copy), provide accurate Attribution, and don't break the law.\nPlus, if you want your creations to become a canon part of the world, we offer a path to make them official. And a cool seal. It's pretty awesome. \nZOE and JourneyQuest are committed to cultivating healthy, inclusive communities where everyone is welcome. We extend that mission to improving representation both on screen and behind the camera. We're stronger when we work together to achieve common goals!\nWe welcome fans old and new to the community that will come together during this Kickstarter campaign and remind everyone that hate speech is not tolerated in this space. \nOur moderators are trained to help if you experience harassment in any ZOE-managed social arena. If we happen to miss it when it happens, please don't hesitate to reach out and let us know, so that we can take action to resolve the issue.\nWe are always happy to assist! If you have a question that was not answered here, please send us a message through Kickstarter or via the contact form at zombieorpheus.com.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we work hard to mitigate our risks, the unforeseen can always throw a curve ball. Sometimes we have to recast a role at the last minute. Sometimes we have to redo work in post if it doesn't meet our standards. Sometimes product gets delayed at the manufacturer. And any time international travel is involved, we have to be prepared to adapt and adjust with circumstances outside our control. But with a nine-year track record of crowdfunding success at Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, our reputation should speak for itself. \n\nAdditionally, we now have excellent relationships with manufacturers, our fulfillment partners at Ship Naked, the team at BackerKit, and everyone else who's part of making sure that our campaigns are completed to your satisfaction. \n\nOur pledge to you is that we will always do our utmost to deliver on our commitment to excellence.\n\nNOTE: We have budgeted for rewards and production based on current treaties, exchange rates, and tariffs. Given political volatility in the USA and elsewhere, we want to make special note that our plans may require significant revision should domestic or global turbulence affect the production of JourneyQuest Season Four.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Tip Jar", "descp": "Receive access to backer-only updates and the post-campaign BackerKit store.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2020"}], "stat": ["197 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Stream it First!", "descp": "Stream JourneyQuest Season 4 when it premieres on The Fantasy Network with a one-month subscription.

Stretch goal bookmarks for all! And more stretch goal news, and The Legion of the Skull returns! All subscribers receive four stretch goals! First, a copy of \"Cubicles of the Magician's Skull\"! This booklet compiles the hilarious missives from the immortal sorcerer Skull who is our leader, publisher, and mascot! And secondly, a never-before-published Morlock story by James Enge, plus a new story by John C. Hocking! And a new bookmark! Additionally, backers at the Legion of the Skull level will receive a booklet of essays on sword-and-sorcery literature!\nTales From the Magician's Skull is a printed fantasy magazine dedicated to presenting all-new sword-and-sorcery fiction by the finest modern crafters in the genre. These stories are the real thing, crammed with sword-swinging action, dark sorceries, dread, and ferocious monsters -- and they hurtle forward at a headlong pace. \nLast year, we published issues #1 and #2 to great acclaim. The stories were well-received, and the fans demanded \u2013 more! MORE! We hear you, fans, and the Skull is prepared to grant your desire!\nThis Kickstarter launches issues #3 and #4, as well as subscriptions to future issues! \nPublication Schedule\nOur goal is to publish Tales From The Magician\u2019s Skull twice a year, with issues released in March and September each year. Issue #3 is complete and ready for printing, with a September release date. Issue #4 will release in March 2020, and others will follow bi-annually thereafter. Upon reaching issue #666, the Skull will travel to a higher plane and the magazine will end.\nSubscriptions\nSubscriptions are available at a 10% discount from single-issue pricing. Subscriptions are 4 issues in duration and are offered in print and PDF format. Just select the appropriate pledge level.\nPrint Format\nWith our first Kickstarter, we included a stretch goal to print the magazine on a luxurious textured, tan-colored paper stock that conjured memories of the pulp papers of years past. We love this format and will continue to print the magazine using this paper stock. It does mean a higher funding threshold, which we believe is worth it.\nInterior illustration by Samuel Dillon\nIssue #3\nIssue #3 is brimming with 80 pages and contains 7 stories, each featuring a full page black-and-white illustration. When appropriate to the tale, maps to strange lands and martial arenas are included as well. Each story has been written, edited, illustrated, and laid out in classic pulp magazine format. A bonus section translates elements from each story - creatures, magic items, and more - into Dungeon Crawl Classics game terms. \nIssue #3 features fiction by James Enge, John C. Hocking, Howard Andrew Jones, Violette Malan, Joseph A. McCullough, Sarah Newton, and William King. The magazine is edited by Howard Andrew Jones and published by Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games, with layout by Lester B. Portly. An appendix by Terry Olson provides DCC RPG game statistics based on some of the stories.\nEach story is lovingly illustrated by industry stalwarts, and issue #3 features art by Samuel Dillon, Justine Jones, Doug Kovacs, Brad McDevitt, Russ Nicholson, Stefan Poag, Matthew Ray, and Chuck Whelan. The cover is by the legendary Sanjulian.\nIssue #4\nWe have already started recruiting stories for issue #4 but there is still more work to do. Our target release date is March 2020, and all will be complete by then!\nInterior illustration by Samuel Dillon\nHere are the stories in issue #3!\nThe Face That Fits His Mask, By William King\nHe could change in mid-spring, tear out the man's throat, feast on his bones, drink his blood. The beast of the change gibbered in the back of his mind, begging to be unleashed. His fingers splayed, his nails began to lengthen\u2026.\nBy That Much, By Joseph A. McCullough\n\u201cYou claim not to know me, and that is probably best for you, but do me a last service. If you can, gather what remains of my body and give it a suitable place to rest.\u201d \nTyrant\u2019s Bane, By John C. Hocking\nSomeone in the garb of a royal guardsman came out of the stairwell.  His blue armor was covered with blood and there was a fist-sized hole in his cuirass through which Benhus could see the wall behind him.  There was a sword in each hand and, as he advanced, the dead man lifted both weapons.\nFive Deaths, By James Enge\nThe heavy stone door moved easily upon its hinges; Morlock pulled it open and stepped through cautiously. Lernaion was about to follow when there was a sudden bodiless screaming and the door slammed shut.\nThe Forger\u2019s Art, By Violette Malan\nHis head wore a surprised look when it landed a few feet away. The body slumped to the ground, pumping out blood onto the grass. \n\u201cWhy do people always talk too much?\u201d Parno wiped his sword clean on the dead stranger's tunic.\nThe Second Death of Hanuvar, By Howard Andrew Jones\nHanuvar twisted, parried a blow that would have caved in his skull, and lost his balance. He saw the pit yawning, and the flame more than twenty feet below.\nThe Wizard of Rememberance, By Sarah Newton\nThe memnovore towered over him, its mouth distending into a translucent sleeve of slime. Acid burned Suven\u2019s flesh, and he screamed. In the demon\u2019s larval embrace, he prayed for oblivion.\nTable of contents page for #3\nMaps \nThis is a small detail, but we think it's important. The early issues of pulp literature occasionally included illustrated maps and diagrams to help the reader understand the fantastic places being explored by pulp heroes. \nTales From the Magician's Skull does the same. Doug Kovacs, famous for his fantastically illustrated maps in the role-playing-game space, has provided illuminated maps to explain some of the stories' locations. \nThe T-Shirt\n\"There is no greater honor than to wear my visage upon your frail husk,\" says the Skull. \"And now you can achieve this honor with a mere 25 of your monetary units. Dollars, I believe they are called.\" Simply select the T-shirt pledge level if you only want a tee. If you want a tee in addition to the magazine, select the magazine pledge level you want and add +$30 (which is $25 T-shirt cost plus $5 shipping).\nBack Issues\nWe still have copies of issues #1 and #2 available. Select the appropriate pledge level to purchase these back issues while they last!\n Shipping Costs \nPhysical copies will be shipped as they are ready. When you make your pledge, shipping charges will be applied.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " The Dark Trails RPG is a game which pays homage to the popular weird West genre.  It can be used as a standalone game or as the perfect complement to a growing line of products that all utilize the rules found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) RPG.   As a player, you\u2019ll find a wealth of material that allows you to assume the role of one of 11 unique classes, with descriptive names like: the Calavera, the Bedlamite, and the Sin-Eater.   As a Judge, you\u2019ll find over 400 pages of material giving you a wealth of resources for designing and running fantastic adventures set against the haunted landscapes of an unforgiving weird West. \nYou may be wondering about the above mentioned game that Dark Trails is tethered to. Dungeon Crawl Classics is a Fantasy RPG written by Joseph Goodman of Goodman Games. Since debuting in 2012, the book has gone through seven (7) printings and spawned a wonderful community of passionate gamers both new and old. DCC continues to grow by leaps and bounds by way of exciting adventures penned by some of the best writers in the industry, including third-party publishers using the system to fuel their own creative fires.\nFortunately, the Dark Master (Joseph Goodman) has granted permission to include a modified version of the DCC ruleset within the pages of Dark Trails to make it the first 3rd party published work to include the necessary rules for play. You don\u2019t need anything other than the Dark Trails RPG to play the game aside from some dice, paper, and pencils. \nSome of the DCC rules were purposefully left out when weighed against their place in a weird West setting, but these omitted rules can easily be added to Dark Trails should you own a copy of DCC and wish to include them.\n This Kickstarter funds the standalone hardcover book for the game. Funds raised will be used to pay for additional art, editing, and layout for a quality book made by traditional offset methods to ensure it is as durable as it is beautiful. \n Dark Trails is the product of three years of writing and playtesting by author David Baity. You may remember David from his first DCC adventure \u201cCarnival of the Damned\u201d published by  Purple Sorcerer Games. While David has handled the majority of the writing chores with the Dark Trails RPG, lots of folks have thrown their name into the hat to help flesh out the magic and bestiary sections. Daniel J. Bishop, Brandon Goeringer, Bob Brinkman, Diogo Nogueira, and Jeff Scifert are just a few of the talented minds that have worked their magic to make Dark Trails something truly special.\nFor one of the two editions of the game we've commissioned none other than the legendary SanJulian to grace us with a beautifully painted cover filled to the brim with \"weird.\" You can see a few more of SanJulian's DCC covers below, and be sure to check out his website  for several works you've probably seen grace the covers of your favorite novels and other publications over the years.\nWho else is on board to help to bring the world of Dark Trails to life? Over the last two years, the author has recruited some of the best up-and-coming artists in the industry. The Dark Trails RPG currently features work by Angga Augustiya, Todd McGowan, Christopher Torres, Simon Todd, Danny Prescott, Adam Slivka, David Hoskins, Aaron Robinson, MARCINs, David Coppoletti, and Diogo Nogueira.\nAdditional funds raised by the Kickstarter will help continue to fund new art from the above-mentioned artists, in addition to work by Stefan Poag, Peter Mullen, and Bradley K. McDevitt, just to name a few!\n Dark Trails will be printed in two editions (standard and limited edition), both are hardcover books  8.5\u201d x 11\u201d trim size. The books will be printed in the USA by offset printing methods to ensure the quality of the book meets consumer expectations.  Currently, we plan to keep the interior printed in B&W on 60# paper and stitched binding. \n The standard edition will feature a full-color cover painted by iconic artist, Sanjulian (Creepy magazine, Vampirella, etc.) while the limited edition will feature a leatherette cover, accented with metallic foil stamping and an embossed version of the Dark Trails RPG logo. The ultimate goal with the limited edition is to create something that looks like it was pulled right out of the Old West! \nBelow, you can see mock ups of each book to give you an idea of what we're visualizing. The painting used to represent the standard edition is not the final Sanjulian cover, and both covers are subject to change. \nA mock-up of the standard edition. This is not the actual cover and all elements are subject to change\nA mock-up of the limited edition leatherette edition. All elements are subject to change.\n\n\n The weird West genre is certainly well represented in the RPG industry, but those wishing to find a fully developed weird West RPG that utilizes a class-based system based upon the DCC RPG will be sadly disappointed. Dark Trails fills a niche for a DCC based weird West RPG by providing 11 original character classes paired with innovative rules designed to leave your players feeling like they\u2019ve just spent several hours adventuring in a Western landscape where the emphasis is placed upon the weird!\n\n\nYou\u2019ll find several classes to choose from within the pages of the book, so let\u2019s give you a basic rundown of what you\u2019ll find. \nBedlamite: Absent-minded inventors constantly constructing inventions that defy all logic, including \u201cwondrous\u201d contraptions that are brought to life by their creator\u2019s sheer force of will. Bedlamites often become addle-brained and introverted, preferring the company of their automatons to that of their allies.\nCalavera: Spirit-mediums, most often female, that can both see and speak to the nearby dead wandering the closest regions of the Spirit Lands. The calavera shines like a beacon in the night to the restless dead, eager to have her deliver a message, or perform one last task that will put the spirit to rest. Aiding in those tasks marks her as a veritable queen of the underworld and the dead are not only willing to share some of their dark secrets but also have been known to reach across the grave to protect their only connection to the land of the living.\nGambler: With the big changes running through the weird West, the gambler could be called the chosen paladin of Lady Luck, able to manipulate the ebb and flow of chance like an occultist weaves arcane energy. Gamblers alter the probability of events going on in their surroundings and have a skill set that favors thievery and subterfuge.\nGunslinger: Sometimes, a poor soul is cut down before their time, and when that person is a law-dog or hardened soldier even death isn\u2019t enough to discourage them from staying in the fight. These restless spirits possess the guns they died with and send out a call to those deemed worthy of carrying them. Gunslingers find their uncanny skill at gunplay supernaturally elevated by the spirits of vengeance that choose them.\nLuchador: A luchador is most often a person noble of heart seeking the thrill of martial combat in and out of the sacred ring. In addition to high-flying acrobatics coupled with raw strength and fortitude, luchadores gain the ability to tap into their inner spirit, channeling it through their masks for supernatural effects.\nMountebank: The typical \u201csnake oil salesman\u201d of the frontier, these amateur alchemists and full-time showmen find that the events of the Seven Days of Night have unlocked a doorway to the mind that reveals recipes that defy all logic and, once brewed, resemble the magic potions of legend.\nMystic Monk: Trained in the sacred art of martial arts and schooled by master philosophers, the mystic monk is a humble warrior wandering the weird West in search of enlightenment. In addition to being a master of martial arts, the mystic monk can summon his inner chi, a virtual battery of spiritual energy used to perform superhuman feats.\nOccultist: Occultists devote their lives to the mastery of the ambient arcane energies constantly flowing around all living things, learning to weave and channel them to miraculous effect through spell work. Occultists are considered master investigators and have a nose for all things arcane and unusual.\nRevelator: The revelator serves as a bastion of faith to those seeking refuge from the madness infecting the world. They can perform divine healing and miracles in addition to serving as a bane to evil creatures\u2014both living and dead\u2014all while serving as a pillar of faith to those that still believe in the comforting words of The Good Book.\nSin-Eater: During the Seven Days of Night, no souls were granted passage to the Underworld and instead were cursed to wander the Spirit World where they were preyed upon by creatures native to the realm, or worse, taken as slaves by their own kind. Charon, lord of the ferrymen, knows an abundance of restless spirits could potentially unravel the barrier between worlds. Some ferrymen are hand selected by their lord to return to the surface world in order to shepherd lost souls to the afterlife and destroy those that prey upon them by using River Rites and the soul-aegis, a weapon that strikes fear in the hearts of the wicked.\nTommyknocker: Sometimes, a soul is just too pissed off to pass on and needs to get a slice of vengeance before taking that ride into the sunset. Tommyknockers are walking corpses for almost all intents and purposes, but the strength of their soul is such that it acts as a furnace, providing a means to animate its corpse-shell to take care of unfinished business. In addition to an unnatural strength, the tommyknocker is one of the toughest hombres found in the weird West.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the DCC magic system, you\u2019ll be familiar with how things are done. If you\u2019re new to DCC styled magic you\u2019re in for a real treat! Spells can be cast multiple times if you continually roll high enough. Roll low and you might lose the spell for a day, or worse, suffer from the effects of corruption! On top of being able to cast known spells multiple times, the total of your roll means potentially casting that low-level magic missile spell with effects so strong that you just might wipe the playing field with your trusty \u201cfinger guns.\u201d In addition to a full complement of spells and miracles found within the pages of Dark Trails, you can import any of the 120+ existing spells found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG into your game, should you own the book.\nYou\u2019ll find over 150 spells, wondrous contraptions, elixirs, and miracles within the pages of Dark Trails, but we didn\u2019t stop there. In addition to the above, you\u2019ll find a reliquary of beneficial and cursed magic items, along with rules and tables for crafting magical firearms. \nThe author of the Dark Trails RPG really wants to present you with a game that has some innovative rules that help capture the feel of a Western-themed game. You\u2019ll find several interesting mechanics scattered throughout the book (some that you may even wish to port to your DCC game), but the main rules that make the Dark Trails RPG a horse you\u2019d want to throw a saddle on include:\nNew rules for firearms that incorporate a standard poker deck, including specialized critical hit and fumble tables.\nBoons & Hexes represent a run of good/bad luck your character might be having during a typical session. They\u2019re awarded based on things like exceptionally good/bad die rolls, true heroics, and great role playing.  Boons earned can be spent for in-game perks, while Hexes increase your chances of receiving more disastrous results on fumble and fear charts. In addition, they affect how NPC interactions pan out\u2014consider the unlucky cowboy to have a dark cloud following him around.\nA new system that replaces the \u201cstandard\u201d alignment mechanics found in most RPGs. The new system helps tell the story of how decisions determine the path a character may walk and how that path affects their reputation when dealing with NPCs.\nAn innovative system for fear and madness that simulates a character\u2019s ability to handle both physical and emotional stress during the adventure, including an extensive list of mental disorders for those who slip too deeply down the rabbit hole!\n\n Lot's of folks are hard at work putting their twist on the weird West genre. For starters, you can check out Thick Skull Adventures \"The Last WIll and Testament of Obediah Felkner.\" Author Stephen Newton is close to launching his exciting take on a weird West adventure that blends perfectly with the Dark Trails RPG. You can find more info at Thick Skull Adventures \nYou can also take comfort in knowing some talented up-and-coming writers in the gaming community have become so inspired by past playtests that they\u2019ve taken the initiative to start writing Dark Trails adventures. \nThere\u2019s no bigger compliment for an author than to learn folks think enough of their game to create material before the book is even released! The author has big plans to produce both free and paid content once the book is released into the wild. This includes supporting those who wish to produce their own Dark Trails material!\nYou\u2019re going to love the bestiary in this book! Over seventy-five creatures have been pulled from the works of Lovecraft and the pages of folklore from all around the world! Several notable folks have thrown their passion into helping make the bestiary something special, including but not limited to: Daniel J. Bishop, Jon Hook, Brandon Goeringer, Bob Brinkman and more! \nYou\u2019ll also find that several included creatures contain charts with all sorts of tweaks and nasty surprises to make each encounter terrifying and unique!\n\nSometimes, a Judge has a hard enough time wrangling up a posse, let alone coming up with a trail-ready adventure to keep'em busy! Don't you worry, partner, we got you covered! You\u2019ll find a complete 0-1st level action-packed adventure included within the pages, and a ready-made town filled with personalities to get you started on the trail.  As we reach stretch goals, more material gets added.  \n What Kickstarter would be worth its weight in whiskey if it didn't have some awesome stretch goals to sweeten the pot?

The Seven Days of Night brought about supernatural changes to all things, including much of the land! If we reach US $20,000, we\u2019ll bring on master cartographer Jared Blando to craft a black and white map to be used for end sheets.\nUS $22,000: Dark Trails is filled to the gills with 11 playable classes, but there\u2019s room for one more, as we love even numbers! If we can reach US $22,000, author Pete Spahn (Operation White Box) has agreed to throw a 12th class into the book.\nUS $24,000: Judges bringing the weird West to the table are going to need something pretty to spruce up those custom screens, and it needs to be as functional as it is purdy!

Bishop!

Take a gander at Jared's color work.\nUS $34,000: We're going to offer up a form fillable character sheet for both the funnel style and higher level character sheets!

I'm way over budget on art, so I'd hoped we could get by with it, but when Gilbert brought it up I knew it needed to be addressed and immediately hired some of the regular Weird Frontier artists to kick something out fast, and the end result is the art that will fill up those ugly pages with too much \"empty\".

But not any miniatures. Our expert team of Gnome Wizards work tirelessly to bring the most customizable and powerful figures for your character. Our sleek, seamless, flash-less miniatures are unrivaled in appearance and each is blessed by a team of Clerics. \n    Can\u2019t find the perfect miniature for your Dwarven Fighter?  \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Are the only miniatures available carrying a broadsword instead of a warhammer? \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Is the figure\u2019s beard too short for your perfect avatar? \nEldritch Foundry.\n    Through dark and forbidden rituals, we have given you, the player, the ability to select everything about your character. Complete customization is now in the hands of the player. Whatever hands, head, tail, wings, clothes, weapons, and practically anything else you can think of, we can do. Even the most mundane of coin purses will look amazing on your character \u2013 through our high-quality 3D printing.  \n This project combines everything you want from a miniature - the original creative art, with the best quality that can be found for a customized unique printed miniatures.\n*Warning: Miniatures may contain bonus Experience Points \n     The Eldritch Foundry has partnered with the leading US 3D printer manufacturer, 3DSystems, and our in-house printers utilize the most advanced technology available on the market. As such, we are printing at a quality that is substantially higher than anyone else. We print at about 40% higher definition than anyone else on the market.\nMost miniatures currently available on the market are printed at around 50 microns. An Eldritch Foundry miniature is printed at around 32 microns. In addition, we use wax supports. This process means your miniatures will have no flash, no mold lines, and no seams. \n       Our character creator interface is like nothing you\u2019ve seen before, except perhaps in video games. We have developed a one-of-a-kind character creator to a look and feel that closely resembles the character creators in Baldur\u2019s Gate, Planescape, Torment, or even Skyrim (well, at least the starting bit). The interface is intuitive and easy to use, while providing for a maximum level of customization for your miniature.\n    Each and every character choice, from race and class, to armor and weapons, has a unique lore associated with it. We have partnered with several brilliant writers (most notably- the amazing Patrick Stuart!) to create a lore that is as unique as our character creator. \n    This process, from the unique character creator to the expansive and in-depth lore,  makes creating a high quality and custom miniature more immersive and helps create a world-building experience.\n       We have developed the first and only conditional marker base for your miniatures. This base allows for the quick and easy identification of conditional statuses of your character, without the need for conditional rings or milk jug rings. The conditions available on your unique Eldritch Foundry miniature base include poisoned, restrained, concentration, deafened, petrified, grappled, blinded, and frightened. We have even provided conditional marker bases that are blank, if you prefer to draw your own. We\u2019ll even have an option where you can choose which conditions you want on your base (but that\u2019s a bit more down the line).\n      In order to bring you the finest quality miniatures, every piece is first individually drawn by gentle hands of our Tiefling concept artists. Then, these sketches are animated, given sentience, and turned into 3-dimensional models.  Our miniatures are then crafted from these models by an expert team of Gnome Wizards. This process is designed to bring you the highest-quality, unique, and magically enchanted miniatures possible. \n      To bring you more, we must first provide offerings to the lords of darkness and miniatures, who enslave hapless concept artists for no less than 99 years. These concept artists provide us with all the exquisite art, in order to bring the most realistic and beautifully rendered miniatures to you, the player.  Through this project we intend to bring you more items, races, mounts, perhaps a campaign setting, and even a little thing we think of as \"the bits box\".\n       The Eldritch Foundry's founders are gamers, like you. We would like to let gamers take their character from the imaginary and make them a reality. To provide miniatures of the highest quality, both in the form of the model and in the quality, while using the latest in 3D printing quality available. More than that, table-top gaming is a community experience. As such, we provide services both with online sales and through friendly local gaming stores.  \nEnjoyable and intuitive site - for the quick and easy customization of your characters.\nUnique and original craftsmanship -of all the items, armor, weapons, clothes, and accessories your character will ever need.\nBuilt-in status indicator bases - for quick and easy identification of character status' \nNew origin lore written for Eldritch Foundry - making the character creation process much more immersive and interesting. \nQuality 3D printing - showing the finest detail available on the market, exactly as designed by you, the player.\n      The Eldritch Foundry, a group of nerds and geeks dedicated to bringing the most unique and customizable miniatures available. We are committed to improving your games. And we are enthusiastic about our mission.\nThe Eldritch Foundry loves the TTRPG community- and acts on it with a business model that is geared towards helping your local gaming store thrive. We incentivize foot traffic by offering free shipping if you send your avatar to your local gaming store. We share in every miniature sale made within store grounds, and for every miniature sent to stores.\nRetailers- feel free to reach out, we'd love to discuss this in person!\nOur partner FLGS, Knight's Watch Games:\n  \"Eldritch Foundry is a revolutionary company that bridges the gap between producers, retailers and customers.  The ability for a customer to design, purchase and pick-up their customized miniature at the brick and mortar store facilitates better relationships between buyer and seller, guarantees a better shopping experience, and higher customer satisfaction. The immersive process of personalizing a character and reading the powerful descriptions for the various options makes building your dream character super entertaining!\" - Brenda and Paraic Mulgrew of Knight's Watch Games\nThe Eldritch Foundry is a firm believer that the TTRPG community is just that- a community. We strive to work with everybody- from stores, to local artists, to gaming streams, and beyond. As such, we've begun partnering with the D4 D&D stream (go check them out!) to provide their gaming miniatures.\nWe've also started working with artists from the community which we love- first and foremost- the Griffon's Saddlebag (you can see his Retaliating Shield on some of our minis, even!).\n      Based on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes, based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all.\nUS shipping (to your local gaming store)- FREE!\nRest of the world - shipping will cost $10.\n What is the Eldritch Foundry?\n      We are two friends, who quit our day jobs, and founded Eldritch Foundry. We provide miniatures of the highest quality, both in the form of your miniature\u2019s model and in the quality, while using the latest in 3D printing technology available. This process will give your miniatures a sleek, seamless, flash-less appearance not available in any other product on the market.\nHow do the miniature coupons work?\n      All rewards for \u201ccustom miniature coupon(s)\u201d are presented as coupons, and as such, are good indefinitely. This allows you to redeem at any point and even for future releases and features.  \nWhen will the Miniatures Ship?\n      Tricky question! Our full Character Foundry will be up and running August 1st, when we debut at Gen Con. We are currently gunning for a weeks turnaround (1-2 days to print, 3-6 days of shipping in the US), but a two week turnaround is a bit more likely (especially if we have a huge backlog). \nIt should be noted that we will be adding more and more items, races, weapons and\u2026 stuff(?) as time progress, so if you have a specific idea for your mini, look up our development schedule on our site!\nWhat about international shipping?\n      Shipping to the US is free of charge. Shipping to Western Europe is going to add about 10$ on top of your pledge level.\nHow do I select more than one pledge goal?\n     In Kickstarter you can only really select one pledge goal, but no worries. If none of the pledge levels are just right, pick the one closest to what you want, and you can adjust upwards later in our backer kit. \nRetailers - What are the typical cost of an Eldritch Foundry miniature in a retail store?\n      Our current pricing point for a single miniature is about MSRP 35$. The conditional marker base should add another 10$ on top of that. Oversized models will run you about 10$ extra. \nWe\u2019re still looking into \u201cbits\u201d pricing and quantities, so that\u2019s a big WIP right now.\n     New to Kickstarter? No problem! Just follow these simple steps: \nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n1) Development challenges\n\n We have been accepted as exhibitors at Gen Con 2019. As such, we have a hard deadline to have our character creator site up and running by August 2019. With this in mind, our current plan is to launch as soon as possible, with various additional features being introduced later on in the development phase. These additional features, which are being considered non-essential for initial launch, are thus marked down as a phase 2. For example, these additional features consist of features like \u201cbits\u201d purchasing and social media sharing with cool filters are lower on our priority list.\n In all regards, development of the product is largely complete with high-quality highly detailed miniatures. This project is intended to raise capital in financially reasonable way.\n\n\n2) Asset creation:\n\n Our asset creation timeline is very much dependent on how successful the Kickstarter campaign is. Our current funding is enough to let us reach Gen Con 2019 with an already assembled asset library of high Fantasy weapon and armor sets, and the base races of Humans, Elves (& half-Elves), Dwarves, Goliaths and Halflings.\n The greater our success, the faster we hope to add additional assets and features to the system. However, there is an upper limit to how fast we can add additional assets, while still maintaining a high-quality of production. We will have a production schedule posted on our home website once we see how far ahead, we are. This will allow Eldritch Foundry fans to come and see new products and plan ahead for when their favorite race and genres come online.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "",

The journey that brought me to this point was that I had already collected all of the sets of chibi minis I could find on the market to paint for my D&D campaign, but I found out that the company I was following would no longer be making minis.\nI love playing D&D, but once I had set my sights on a more anime style, the usual minis just wouldn't cut it. The first 5 minis in the Starter Pack are actually the original 5 players' characters in the campaign I'm currently running.\nThere are a few reasons I'm running this campaign. The first is that I invested some start up funds in getting together the illustrations for these ten. I plan to invest funds from this campaign into more illustrations for future projects.\nThe second reason is that I plan to look into more tools like a drawing tablet, zBrush, which I see many others in the space using with amazing results, and increased marketing efforts to build a social media presence I can go to for ideas and inspiration.\nMy final reason for running this project is a very long way out, but I've been inspired by fantasy board games that use minis like these and I'd like to one day make my own. If I can continue to create models and illustrations, it will be that much easier to convert them into collectible characters. \nPlease Note: This campaign IS NOT for a boardgame, and it IS NOT for physical merchandise. The rewards include digital .STL files for 3D printing and .PNG files for digital art.\nMagnetic Modular Japanese Gate Wall\nI created this Japanese Gate set to appeal to anyone-not just fans of minis.

Sent to him by his mysterious brother, he continues to find clues about his own path, and that of his family.\nThe swords themselves aren\u2019t the only piece of the puzzle. The note that came with them included writing from his brother, but also writing from an unidentified source.\nOrphan Rogue Mahi:\n\nMahi is a young wood elf who was orphaned at a very young age. Not knowing her parents, she grew up feeling isolated and was met with great hardship even trying to find daily meals.\nNaturally, she honed her skills to ensure her survival. Stealing food meant living another day, and this is what drove her forward.\nMahi enrolled in the military and protects her kingdom to achieve her two simple goals: Get 3 square meals a day and find friends to share them with.\nAlice of Ravens:\n Alice grew up in a large family with five older siblings. Being the youngest in the bunch, she found herself overshadowed by their vast range of talents.\nOnce her family moved from the magical floating city of \nEukalade to the non-magical walled city of Locaste, Alice dearly missed the days she could cast magic freely.\nShe strategically joined the military to gain access to the few areas of the walled city where magic was permitted and began to master her techniques with her raven staff in hand.\nNature's Protector Odessa:\n Odessa spent her childhood growing up within Locaste\u2019s thirty walls. Coming from a family of bakers, fighting was never in her blood.\nShe got a taste for protecting others when a large, rabid dog broke loose and started attacking some nearby children.\nFollowing her faith of the goddess Archena, Odessa decided on her paladin oaths and set forth to make the country safer for all.\nLolita Vampire Lobelia:\n Little is known about Lobelia the vampire; she seems to come and go as she pleases. It is rumored that she\u2019s a fearsome fighter, but nobody seems to be able to provide an eye-witness account.\nIn truth, this playful devil loves to mess around with her \u201ctoys\u201d\u2014a word she uses to describe the unsuspecting victims of her games.\nHer parasol keeps her safe from the sun\u2019s harsh rays, but she\u2019ll use it as a masterful weapon when the need arises.\nDeadly Smile Ellie:\n Ellie suffered her first defeat at the age of three when her entire family was murdered by bandits. Sadness was never an option for her; there was one lesson to learn.\n\u201cThe strongest are the killers, and they\u2019re the ones that survive.\u201d\nThis mantra fueled her every decision and she soon found herself standing atop a metaphorical mountain of the hundreds of lives she had taken.\n\u201cYou certainly look strong. Let\u2019s play a little...\u201d\nPlague Doctor Rust:\n If you\u2019ve ever received treatment from Rust, consider yourself among the lucky ones. Rumors of this mysterious, seemingly decrepit man are many and varied, but it\u2019s agreed that anyone who sees the shadows that follow him will die.\nRust will not talk to you, and it\u2019s unknown if he\u2019s even able to speak at all. He\u2019s been seen deep in speechless conversation with small animals and birds, but one has to wonder if he looks upon them with evil intentions.\nJust what is in those potions of his?\nHealing Scripture Basil:\n Basil: the gentle angel sent from the heavens. His calm demeanor is certain to put you at ease as he remedies your ailments with his powerful healing magic, but you can\u2019t help but wonder what his personal goals might actually be.\nWhile the young angel appears to be an ally of the kingdom, he\u2019s said to have been seen healing the crown\u2019s enemies. Is he just so kind that he\u2019s willing to heal those who are good and evil, or is there something deeper behind his actions?\n\u201cI\u2019ve ensured you\u2019ll all survive, but I must ask that you be more careful in the future.\u201d\nRain of Fire Kress:\n Kress grew up in the western country of Robur. Here, his family has been stationed on the giant wall called the Thievesguard, where their sworn duty is to keep the thieves of the country Genii from invading their allied nation of Lenus.\nKress understands the importance of his duty on the wall, but what he truly wants is a change of scene. Channeling his innate magic to bring fire to the skies with his bright arrows, Kress tries his best to stay distracted from boredom.\n\u201cThe wall\u2019s greatest strength is it\u2019s ability to stand still forever\u2014my greatest disappointment.\u201d\nStretch Goals\nPlease note that I do not already have the illustrations completed for the stretch goals, as I'm relying on the success of this project to finance them. On the launch of this campaign, I've finished 4/6 of my originally planned stretch goal models in multiple poses, and I'm working on the final 2.\nIf the project surpasses all of my stretch goals, I will come up with more.\n[LOCKED] $1500 Stretch Goal: Thousand Fists Orka | 3 Poses\n\n[LOCKED] $2000 Stretch Goal: One-Man Fortress Goldar | 2 Poses + Helmet Variant\n\n[LOCKED] $2500 Stretch Goal: Summer Solstice Folia | 2 Poses\n\n[LOCKED] $3000 Stretch Goal: Tricky, Tricky\n[LOCKED] $5000 Stretch Goal: Musical Twins\nCredits:\nAll of the illustration work was done by Kari, who you can find at:  https://www.facebook.com/karissamoloney/ \nThe music I used in my video was provided by Brenden Obuck, who you can find at:  https://brendenobuck.com/ \nSpecial thanks to my girlfriend Alex for her fantastic mini painting work!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe format of providing 3D-printable digital files means minimal risk for me.

Our goal is to create a wide variety of high quality 3D printable miniatures priced affordably for $1!\n\nBeginning\nWe are starting off with our $1 Miniature Set - Viking Raiders. If you back this set we will send the images displayed to one of our partnering professional 3D modelers, who will turn our sketches into 3D printable models for you!\n\nFuture\nWe have a voting page with access renewed monthly. If you select to back our project with a tier including voting rights you will gain access to our SCoFA page for the month the Quickstarter ends + the following month. We will submit ideas for future models to our SCoFA page for decisions on what models we should pursue next, as well as votes for other things we are working on.\nWe will also make all model miniature sets available on our website once they are developed, and you have our word that any models made under our $1 Miniature Set title will always remain $1 for everyone forever.\n\nAncient Cityscape\nOur $10 tier includes a 50% off ($10 coupon) for our modular city core set. This is available on our website, and is comprised of 17 .stl 3D print files allowing you to build a custom ancient city. It also includes all tiers before it.\nIf you are interested, we have plans to develop a lot of add-on sets for this which we will make available in the future!\nwww.iungogames.com\nOur $20 tier includes a 100% off ($20 coupon) for our modular city core set.

Next, we will develop the models with the Stretch Goal Kickstarter funds, and then will deliver them, in addition to our Viking Raiders set, to you!\n\nWhy are there double Tiers?\nThis is our very first Kickstarter, and we forgot to add clear stretch goals at the outset of our campaign! Once someone backs a tier we become unable to edit it, so we had to create duplicate tiers to add the Stretch Goal reward to them.\n\nThe Viking Raiders\nWe paid an artist to illustrate these three characters (Viking Raiders), and with our goal funded we will work with our partnering 3D modeler to make them 3D printable model miniatures!\nWe had a poll in which our backers voted to decide what position/pose they want these models to be in, and we have updated the illustrations to what they voted on!\n\nHorns on the Helmets\nWe received feedback from our backers, almost half of them, would prefer a version of the models without horns on the helmets. Our 3D modeler has agreed to create this variation on the two models with helmets for an additional $20. We will pay this extra cost, and deliver both versions of the models to any backers of either the Sword Raider or the Axe Raider!

This time around we've got civilian/NPC miniatures from the varied fantasy races to help diversify your RPG/wargaming experience.\nWHAT IS TOWNSFOLKE?\nTownsfolke is a range of 3d-printable miniatures designed by us (Ill Gotten Games). This campaign is for the digital files (not finished miniatures). Townsfolke models (like much of our catalog) are designed to be easy to print at stock settings, and print without support material.\nThe miniatures from the core rewards printed in resin.\nEach Townsfolke model can be printed with or without a textured base. Though optimized for stock FDM printing (with detail levels to match), you can print these models in resin as well (and can do so without support that way too).\n\nWHAT DO I GET?\nThe base pledge ($15) gets you all 15 miniature files included in the core set:\n\nIS THERE MORE?\nYou bet! Not only do we have an extensive range of existing Townsfolke sets available on our storefront (and included with a higher pledge level), but as we unlock stretch goals, every backer at the $25 level and higher will get bonus sets added to their haul. We'll update this space as stretch goals are revealed/added.\n\nIn addition to these new sets, we have an extensive range of Townsfolke sets that are currently available for purchase. These sets will also be added to pledges at the $70 level and higher.\nPlus, we have a free starter set, featuring tavern patrons, town guards, a(n ominous looking) ferryman, and more!\nAnd- we've released a special set, the Interplanar Dutchess with Pet Mimic, that's available for free via Thingivere! \n\nWHAT SCALE ARE THESE MINIATURES?\nTownsfolke are firmly in the 32mm scale, which means they'll be compatible in size with Reaper Miniatures, CMON, modern Games Workshop models, Hero Forge, and most other contemporary/mainstream ranges. However, if you play in a specialty scale, you can easily re-size the models before printing. (If re-scaling, you'll probably want to print the base-free versions and base them afterward to keep fidelity with the rest of your collection.)\nThe guidelines above should work, but when in doubt, eyeball the scale change next to a model that you know is in the scale you want.\n\nWHAT IF I DON'T HAVE A 3D PRINTER?\nIf you don't own a 3d printer (or know someone that does), some of our Patreon members are licensed to sell our Townsfolke models (along with the rest of our catalog of designs), and you can find a list of licensed printers here. It's not necessary for you to back this campaign to buy printed versions from our patrons, simply reach out to them and place an order!\n\nMINIATURE GALLERY\nDwarf Traveler (on and off base) printed by Patreon supporter, Scott Frega\nVarious FDM prints (Ender 3) by Patreon supporter, Mike Sheridan.\nDwarf travelers on a journey, printed and painted by Patreon supporter, Stephen Renwick.\nPixie Pickpockets printed by Patreon supporter, Scott Frega\nThe Interplanar Dutchess taking Blue (her pet mimic) out for an off-leash stroll.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny models we show have been successfully prototyped, so once funding clears, we'll be ready to deliver your rewards as promised.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Passerby", "descp": "You get the core Free Folke set including the 15 3d-printable miniatures shown on the main page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Onlooker", "descp": "You get the core Free Folke set including the 15 3d-printable miniatures shown on the main page + any sets unlocked via stretch goals.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["65 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 70 or more", "title": "Bystander", "descp": "You get the core Free Folke set including the 15 3d-printable miniatures shown on the main page + any sets unlocked via stretch goals + all of our previous Townsfolke sets.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["38 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "Sheriff", "descp": "You get the core Free Folke set including the 15 3d-printable miniatures shown on the main page + any sets unlocked via stretch goals + all of our previous Townsfolke sets.\nIn addition, you will receive a special seller's license allowing you free reign to sell 3d printed versions of the Townsfolke files including future sets you acquire that are in this range.

The dragon was printed in 4 parts, the base, tail half, neck half, and head but I really disliked how the seam line was a bit problematic at the tail and neck half so I decided to shrink down the body a tad bit to fit in the 3d printer instead it's at around 170mm now but only requires gluing at the head and to the base which is notched.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Over $100k Canadian Raised! Four Stretch Goals Unlocked!\nTime for some real Sweet Rolls!\nI created Ice Cream Dice to address the severe lack of nearly edible looking dice in the marketplace. I believe I have succeeded.\nOK, OK, that wasn't actually why I started Ice Cream Dice. I wanted dice that were fun, unexpected at a gaming table and a little bit whimsical, all while being usable. I started it because I was so tired of seeing the same dice offered on different sites, by different companies with different names. Names like 'Goblin's Blood' and 'Dragon's Blah Blah Blah'. \nWhen I got to thinking about fun and whimsical, ice cream came immediately to mind and I started on a journey to design the most ice creamy looking dice I could.\nNeo, the classic flavor we all love to hate (well a third of it anyway).\nOrange Dream, a dreamy mix of orange and cream.\nRainbow, also known as Schubert's Sherbet.\nYour Favorite, whether your favorite is chocolate, coffee or caramel, this set has you covered with just a touch of cream.\nBubble Candy, old school bubblegum and carnival cotton candy.\nKiwi, it's even got the seeds!\nThe matte set on the left and the glossy d20 on the right.\nRazzman, the Kickstarter semi-exclusive set. \nAfter this Kickstarter is done, Razzman will be offered once a year to celebrate the day this Kickstarter was fully funded.\nButterscotch: The epitome of potential. \nButterscotch will be redone in production to look like Orange Dream. The original intent was to swirl white and a light brown with a highlight yellow/brown. Unfortunately, these are what I got and with no time to order more test sets, you'll just have to trust me. As you can see, I take my dice palettes very seriously, and will deliver on the potential of these dice.\nThe Dice You See are the Dice You'll Receive\nUnlike some dice companies, there are no renders here, these are the dice you will receive. \nExcept Butterscotch. \nButterscotch will get the Orange Dream treatment with a brown and white gemini/swirled result.\nKiwi's numbers will be re-inked in a pale/golden yellow.\nThe Waffle Dish\nThis waffle dish is a Kickstarter Exclusive. They will never be made or sold again. These are each individually hand blown glass waffle dishes. They are made with borosilicate glass, which is often used in cookware. They are not as delicate as soft art glass, however, they are still fragile.\nThey are small. Roughly 1.5\" - 2\" high and about 2\" - 2.5\" across at the top.\nThis shot shows you how beautiful the inside is.\nSsssssssssstretch Goals\nI could easily have done what most dice companies do and locked the popular dice designs behind fake stretch goals, but I won't. I could have easily found something that was sort of related to dice and offered that as a stretch goal, I didn't.\nI'm a very small company (it's just me) and this is my first Kickstarter, so over complicating things to make it 'look' cooler seemed both dishonest and foolhardy. There's enough moving pieces already, and I'm confident I can deliver on these stretch goals.\nQUICK EDIT: If you're stoked about the D6/D10 Sets and mini D6 Bricks, please read update #17. The graphic below will be changed to reflect the updated information later today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight about now you're saying to yourself, well, that's great and seems like you can deliver it all, but I WANT MORE! To that, I say, take a gander.\nAdd-ons, or...more ways to give me your money!\nI have worked with small creators in our community to bring you two add-ons. These will both be available to add on to your order in Backerkit after the campaign ends.\nFlavour of the Month\nFor $5 (approx. $4 USD / \u20ac3 / \u00a33 ) You can take your kids, your friends or both on an Ice Cream Adventure written exclusively for Ice Cream Dice by Andrew Morley. The local ice cream maker has disappeared! It's up to your party to discover what happened to him. Along the way you may meet yourself some new elementals inspired by Ice Cream Dice. You'll receive a PDF copy of this sweet adventure by late June.\nHandmade d4 Dice Bag\nFor $15 CAD (approx. $12 USD / \u20ac10 / \u00a39 ) you will get a custom, handmade d4 shaped bag that holds over 100 dice! \nThese are Ice Cream Dice exclusives. I partnered with people that could create things that were special, a bit whimsical and useful. These d4 dice bags aren't likely to be produced again. If you want one, this may be the only time to get one. The inside of this dice bag will be a waffle cone pattern, rather than polka dots.\nPins\nFor $5 CAD (approx. $4 USD / \u20ac3 / \u00a33 ) You'll receive a soft enamel pin that will not only shout to the world you love dice, but also, ice cream.\nIf you love pins and just need a couple extra for every lapel you own, I got you covered! The pins are soft enamel with a rubber backing.\nIce Cream Dice Custom Dice Box\nFor $110 CAD (approx. $83 USD / \u20ac75 / \u00a365 ) you can get yourself an Ice Cream Dice exclusive dice box made by the wonderful folks over at Dog Might.\nFor $150 CAD (approx. $114 USD / \u20ac100 / \u00a385 ) you can get yourself an Ice Cream Dice box made out of stunning Wenge wood. This rare dark chocolate colored wood is stunning and sustainably sourced.\nThe folks over at Dog Might reached out to me after seeing my project and told me they had a great idea for a dice box. They weren't lying. These boxes have a lifetime warranty and are gorgeous. Dog Might only works with the best of the best in the industry. I will update this with more details and pictures once I have the prototype in my hands and have all the information.\nFrom Dog Might:  The Dog Might Ice Cream Dice Box is crafted from Flame Birch wood and features a hand applied finish. It comes with a removable foam insert cut to cradle your set of dice perfectly. Remove the foam to easily carry two full sets of polys. Like all Dog Might products, the Ice Cream Dice Box comes with a lifetime guarantee. \nThese boxes are prototypes and a couple of small changes will be happening in the final production. The edges of the D20 top will be a little crisper, and the front facing number will be a 20, because we all know that's the number we like to see the most!\nThe Blue Ice Cream Dice Box\nThis color combo is called cake by Dog Might, but I call it sno-cone!\nThe stunning Wenge wood box with Your Favorite. A match made in heaven.\nFlat Pack Ice Cream Dice Dice Tower\nFor $25 CAD (approx. $19 USD / \u20ac17 / \u00a315 ) you can get yourself an Ice Cream Dice dice tower made by the awesome folks over at Galaxy Gaming Gear.\nThe awe inspiring Ice Cream Dice Tower of Doooooooooooooooooom!\nGalaxy Gaming Gear makes a slew of flat pack minis, terrain and buildings for all your gaming needs. Their designs are particularly kid friendly and it's great to have them on board. I will continue to sell this tower after the campaign, though the price will likely be $30.\nI know, Mom said not to talk about the 'S' word, but we have to...Shipping.\nShipping is the one spell that neither creator, nor adventurer, can break. Being based out of Canada, I feel your pain. I have partnered with a Canadian company that ships straight from China. This is hugely beneficial to all of us, myself included, for a few reasons.\nWe don't have to wait three months for the dice to arrive by freight ship to North American shores, and then wait further while it's unpacked and sent to different shipping centers which then finally get it shipped to you.\nIt's reasonably affordable and delivered with tracking number and insurance to everybody.\nI save money on not having to ship it by sea, which means I pass that savings on to you.\nSo here's the shipping breakdown, it doesn't cover every possible currency, but it covers a lot.\nThere, we did it, we had the dreaded 'S' talk.\nMatte or Glossy, that is the Question:\nHere are the side by side shots of the Matte & Glossy versions of each set. Some key things to keep in mind: \nThe glossy look is achieved by tossing the dice into a rock polisher, so the matte dice are a little larger because they've haven't been polished for as long as the glossy sets. The matte Rainbow and Neo d20's are a little larger than the rest, due to being cast in resin.\nThe powdery look on the matte Neo and Rainbow will eventually wear off. The colors are still softer than gloss, but the frosty look is not permanent.\nIf you prefer your colors to be vivid and brighter, you'll want to go with the gloss.\nMatte isn't very shiny, I know this should seem obvious, but if you like your dice shiny, go with glossy.\nThey do feel different, but the difference isn't night and day like it is with matte and glossy paper.\nWith less polishing, there is occasional color bleed around some of the numbers, it is negligible when it does happen and it only happened on a couple of single numbers on a couple of individual dice in the 25 test sets I got. This may be fixed in production, but I felt it was worth noting\nLet's get to the comparison shots...\nNeo\nOrange Dream\nRainbow\nYour Favorite\nBubble Candy\nKiwi, the numbers on Kiwi will be re-inked with a golden yellow during final production.\nRazzman\nThe Final Butterscotch will look more like Orange Dream\nLet's End this on a High Note\nThank you. They're two simple words that we often toss around without really thinking about what they mean. I think about them a lot and how they relate to this company.\n'Thank' is defined as: to express gratitude to or to hold responsible.\nSo, let me say it again. Thank you. I hold you all responsible for the gratitude I felt every single day leading up to this launch, and will always feel. You cheered me on and you cheered me up, you shared my dice on your podcasts, streams, tweets, instagram, on Facebook. You made sure people knew about me and Ice Cream Dice. \nThis company was inspired by some pretty amazing kids and my desire to make D&D and other TTRPG's more accessible to schools and kids. It is my belief that the skills learned and demonstrated while playing tabletop games, of any sort, are the ones we want our next world leaders to possess. Risk taking, problem solving, learning that you can't do everything by yourself, the value of friendship, exploration, listening to multiple viewpoints, among many other things. \nI didn't get here because of a marketing budget or the right analytics or targeted ads. I got here because of my own work and your support. I didn't get here because I hired a team or had an unlimited amount of money to throw at things. I've said from the beginning, what you see is what you will get. Initially I thought I meant my dice, I soon learned I meant that about myself as well. \nThis community we're all a part of is amazing. I am proud, and humbled, to be a part of it. Here's to many sweet rolls with friends new and old!\nThank you,\nMarc Schubert, aka Ice Cream Dice\nA Really Great Facebook Group!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk in this project is the production & shipping time required to manufacture the dice and get them to you, my backers. I have been working with my factory for a while now and they are expecting my order at the end of March. Production time is usually in the 45 - 60 working day range. So somewhere between 9 - 12 weeks. However, complications can occur, holidays happen and to be safe, I have estimated a 9 - 18 week production range into my timeline. This allows for the custom molds to be created that are required to honor the stretch goals that may become unlocked during the campaign.\n\nI have partnered with a Canadian company that has years of experience shipping dice. They ship from their warehouse space in China which allows me to ensure a lower shipping cost that I can pass on to you, the backers.

FREEBIES!\nReviewers and pro-painters truly love it and are already using it daily.\nWhen painting miniatures, you cannot hold your miniatures with bare hands: You need a miniature handle. Today, there is no straight forward solution on the market: they are either too clumsy, not ergonomic, or overly expensive.\nThat's why we created RGG 360\u00b0, the first natural ergonomic handle for miniature painting. \nWith our unique design, you will be able to hold your miniature for long and comfortable painting sessions. No more cramps, no more unnecessary movement, just having fun painting.\nRGG 360\u00b0 has been designed by painters for painters and developed with the feedback of pro-painters. \nIt is already considered as the best tool available.\n\"[...] Once you\u2019ve got used to the rotating platform [...] may end up being one of those features you never knew you wanted.\" Sorastro's painting\nVous pouvez trouver une VF de la campagne sur le site de Redgrassgames/holder\n3d printed prototype\n\nRGG 360\u00b0 is the only natural ergonomic handle designed to create the best connection between you and your miniature, help you adopt the best painting position and minimise unnecessary movements.\nThe added benefits are greater stability, better precision and minimised fatigue to paint for hours. \n\n3d printed prototype\n\nMany do not pay attention to the handle of their holder. It is however at the heart of your painting experience. The handle is how you connect with your miniature. It needs to be perfect. We perfected it for months!\nRGG 360\u00b0 is the only handle designed to fit naturally in your hand with its unique shape. \nAs there is no strain on your hand and fingers, you won't have to move them and you can enjoy full control of your miniature.\nOnce you have it in your hand, there is no turning back.\n\n3d printed prototype\n360\u00b0 rotation axis is not an afterthought, it is inherent to the natural ergonomic design. Thanks to the handle, you can rest comfortably your wrist on the desk when painting. The 360\u00b0 rotation allows you then to access any part of your miniature fast and reliably. No more parasitic movements. You will rediscover the joy of painting.\n\nNo additional accessories needed. You have the best handle and the best mounting solution for the best price!

More details in the shipping section below.\n\nRead below to have all the details!\n\n3d printed prototype\nA straight simple handle does not fit your hand comfortably. To achieve a good quality painting, you need to stay focused and to hold your miniature naturally without causing hand fatigue. For that, RGG 360\u00b0 is slightly curved and designed to feel very natural in your hand. No odd shape. That's why the sculpted handle has been designed to sit comfortably in the hand.\nPLAY\n\nRGG 360\u00b0 has been tested by many pro painters, painters and even by a 9 years old (Vivien's daughter) to ensure a comfortable handling for most hand size.\nQuite the opposite because the hand on the handle helps improve your overall precision.\nAlso it offers more control and allows you to get around your miniatures without removing your hand from the handle. This innovation will help you achieve a better painting on every angle- Effortlessly\nRGG 360\u00b0 can rotate easily yes, but once you stopped the rotation it will just stay in place. You don't need to hold it with your thumb.\nThanks to our custom made mounting putty, you can fix a large range of miniatures from your favorite games! The putty is of course reusable, we have been using the same putty for months. \nSquare, round, oval up to 55mm\nRound, square, small, large, exotic bases\u2026 miniatures bases come in many shapes. When designing RGG 360\u00b0, we tried some mechanical designs and all kind of sticky materials but they were either non adaptive, clumsy, heavy, none reusable... anyway, they always had disadvantages.\n So we have created a custom made mounting putty, as the perfect mounting solution for your miniatures: Reusable, adaptable, safe, for long. We have been testing the putty for several months, and it never dried out.\nWith 15 grams included with the handle, you have 3x the amount needed to stick your miniatures. \nPLAY\n\n    Made in Europe.\nRGG 360\u00b0 is weighted for optimal stability.\nAdditional custom-made mounting putty included: Our orange putty was customized to have the perfect stickiness and consistency.\nHigh quality axle of rotation: We tried it all, plastic friction, ball bearing... but nothing compare to our special designed axis. It will provide a smooth, accurate and fun rotation, and will last up to several hundred thousand of rotations. Rotate it freely with your thumb, it will stay in place during your painting. Axle of rotation will be graded up to 500k+ rotations.\nMade of PREMIUM plastic: we selected ABS as the best plastic for our handle, due to its density and toughness. The weight will just be perfect in your hand and the handle will last for long\nGraining and engraving on the plastic for optimal grip: Instead of smooth plastic, we decided to add some areas with slight engraving, to improve the handling.\n3d printed prototype\nColour selection available during the pledge manager\n\nPro painters understand and have come to expect advances on miniature tools. All those who tried it said it just feels right and gives a lot of comfort when painting.\n\"[...]  Once you\u2019ve got used to the rotating platform, may end up being one of those features you never knew you wanted.\" Sorastro's painting\n\"[...] This is pretty awesome!\" The Beasts of war (Ontabletop)\n\"[...] RGG 360\u00b0 fits better in the hand and the 360\u00b0 feature is really a great help, which ensures a lot of comfort. For me personally it is the better choice.\" Bruckenkopf online (DE) \n\"[...] The bearing (axle) is easy but it is not too \u201cloose\u201d so you will not be afraid to move your mini just by moving your brush or removing your hand I repeat, for me it\u2019s very well done.\" Le temple de Morikun (FR)\n\"[...] the handle is excellent. This is now my default paint handle. I don't reach for the GW or other brands as much as possible. Totally recommend this handle for any painter !!\" War of sigmar \n\"[...] The key feature and the best thing about this holder is the fact that just with the touch of your finger you can actually turn around  so when you airbrush in a miniature you can literally be   airbrushing and just touch the top of   the holder with your thumb and you can brush all around  [...] it's also nice to obviously hand brush and use a 360\u00b0 feature of this holder now\" Orcpainternerd \n\"[...]Thanks again to Redgrass Games for the use of the fantastic painting handle.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have gained a lot of experience thanks to our first Kickstarter project last year : The Everlasting wet palette. The first KS was a very complex project, coordinating many different suppliers worldwide. But it was a big success with more than 8.000 backers. We have learned from this experience how to create a technical product with a lot of backers from all around the world . For our second Kickstarter campaign, RGG 360\u00b0 will be made in Europe. This new Kickstarter project is driven by one goal: to create a high-quality miniature holder for your painting sessions.\nAs with any production, there are risk concerning the time needed for production and the control of quality. We however believe one point is key and necessary to our project, and will be worth delaying the production, in case the quality is not satisfactory : the quality of the rotation axis. We will focus a lot of attention on this production part. Sample productions showed excellent performance, we will make sure that the mass production rotation axis will be on par with it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "SOLO pack - RGG 360\u00b0", "descp": "Retail value: 12\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\nRGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n15gr of our custom made mounting putty", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,708 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "DUO pack - RGG 360\u00b0", "descp": "Retail value: 24\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n2\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n2\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["677 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac29 or more", "title": "TRIO pack - RGG 360\u00b0", "descp": "Retail value: 36\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["320 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac36 or more", "title": "SOLO + Brushes", "descp": "Retail value: 40\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\nRGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2/0\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["573 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac45 or more", "title": "SOLO + Painter Wet Palette", "descp": "Retail value: 49\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\nRGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nEverlasting Wet Palette Painter\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["388 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac55 or more", "title": "TRIO + Brushes", "descp": "Retail value: 64\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2/0\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["262 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac66 or more", "title": "TRIO + Painter Wet Palette", "descp": "Retail value: 83\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nEverlasting Wet Palette Painter\nFree Hydration Paper Pack - 50 sheets\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["122 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac80 or more", "title": "TRIO + Studio Wet Palette", "descp": "Retail value: 101\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nEverlasting Wet Palette Studio XL\nFree Hydration Paper Pack XL - 50 sheets\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["42 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac97 or more", "title": "RGG \"All In\" TRIO + Painter + Brushes", "descp": "Retail value: 121\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nEverlasting Wet Palette Painter\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2/0\n2\u00d7 Free Hydration Paper Pack - 50 sheets\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac115 or more", "title": "RGG \"All in\" TRIO + StudioXL + Brushes", "descp": "Retail value: 144\u20ac\nDelivery estimate is subject to change\nINCLUDES:\n3\u00d7 RGG 360\u00b0 Ergonomic Handle\n3\u00d7 15gr of our custom made mounting putty\nEverlasting Wet Palette Studio XL\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2\nRGG Kolinsky Brush #2/0\n2\u00d7 Free Hydration Paper Pack XL - 50 sheets\nFree shipping to US,CA,Western EU*", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["60 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "1 Day Left To Back Our Newest & Most Historic Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Hi all,\nWith the RGG360 project, we had decided to produce for the first time our handles in Europe.

There are 3 waves per Battle, and Victory Points are added up for each player at the end of every Battle. If a Drakka gets through the defense, they raise the Panic Level in the kingdom according to the Threat they present.\nEach turn is a wave, and consists of 5 phases:\nPhase 1: Advance\nPhase 2: Draw\nPhase 3: Defend\nPhase 4: Resolve\nPhase 5: Develop\nIf the players last through all 5 Battles in the game and clear the board, they are victorious & the game ends.

I can think of 2 things that might delay or somehow jeopardize the creation of this game:\n\n1. Manufacturing & Fulfillment Issues\nThis is my first project, and I will readily admit that some things might sneak up on me. However, I've made it a point to surround myself with industry veterans, incredible resources, and trustworthy partners to mitigate any potential delay, and handle any bumps in the road.\n\n2. Injury, Illness, or Death\nFingers crossed nothing like this will happen, but because this is primarily my creation, a lot hinges on me staying healthy. So far there's nothing to be concerned about, and I'll do my best to keep it that way. Although because I'm from Alaska, a random bear attack isn't out of the question - but not very likely. Also, rest assured that I have amazing people around me that will make this happen in any case.\n\nIf there's anything at all you're concerned about, please feel free to email me at info@terminusbreach.com and let me know. I'll be happy to address any questions or issues personally.\n\nOnce again, I want to assure you that if there's any worldly way to make this game a reality, I will find it.

While this is the goal of the campaign, and everything would be fine if that had happened (to be clear, this was not a clerical error), i realized that it was just not true to my vision of the game.

Pledge for '66\u20ac Dragon Hoarder' and get all the dragons plus all the stretch goals.\n WARGAMES VERSION   \nThe Wargame version is meant to be used in tabletop battles along with other fantasy armies and regiments. These models are more pose constricted and carry a compatible wargame square base.  \nROLEPLAY VERSION  \nThe Roleplay version has a larger circular base and has a unique dynamic pose for each dragon, that is meant to be used when roleplaying with your RPG party. The dragons are sculpted without armor or harnesses as found natural in wilderness or dungeon.  \nDIORAMA VERSION The Diorama is the most dramatic and dynamic of all the sculpt types and shows the dragon mid scene interacting with its environment. This model can be used in games, but it is meant for the modeller or painter that wishes to immortalize a scene on his mantle piece.   \nFDM & SLA Samples\nDwarf Regiment \nThe dwarf regiment comes with 2 command figures, a standard bearer and a musician. The 'Hero' pack above contains 2 additional figures, a dwarf hero and commander. There are 6 unique posed infantry miniatures to choose from bearing different weapons and combat styles.\nIMPERIAL REGIMENT   \nThe Imperial regiment comes with 2 command figures, a standard bearer and a musician. The 'Hero' pack above contains 2 additional figures, a dwarf hero and commander.

Some models print in one go whilst most are split up into parts which must be printed separately and then assembled.\n\nThe file format of choice will be .STL and the models shall be zipped and made available to the user for download. The user is responsible for downloading their product and must have a valid internet connection and email with which to collect their reward, via internet download. We will keep the files on our system for at least three months after the first date of issue. The user must ensure that he collects the files within this time frame or risk forfeit.\n\nBackers must realize that the resolution you obtain on your print is down to the system you use. Our high resolution files will give you almost render quality prints on high end SLA machines, whilst the same files will produce lesser resolution prints on standard FDM printers. At any rate, all the files have been previously tested on SLA and FDM printers and have shown satisfactory produce.\n\nWe recommend FDM Prints with at least a 400micron nozzle and 200 micron layer height for terrain. A 100 micron layer height will give you outstanding prints all round. We have also tested the files with larger nozzles, at 500 microns and decent results are possible on most prints, if the layer height and temperature is controlled correctly. 0.5(500 micron) nozzles are not recommended for miniature printing.\n\nSLA printers should have no problems obtaining excellent resolution and finish even at 100 micron layer height although 50 micron layer height is recommended for minute sculpt detail clarity. We will try our best to split models so they will fit in smaller print beds like those found on SLA machines. Although miniatures and figurines can be split into smaller parts, large terrain pieces will require a standard 220x220mm print bed. Standard for FDM Printers like the 'Ender3'\n\nWe supply the user with a design that has been tested on conventional home hobby printers and is proven to print.\n\nAll the models are tested and sliced with 'Cura' software which is freeware and available to all backers for use. We recommend that backers use 'Cura' as it is fully tested with our models and we can offer customer support, if any problems are encountered. We are unable to give customer support for other slicing software and backers use this at their own risk. \n\nWhen using our digital media, we do not hold ourselves responsible for the production or manufacturing process of the design, this is exclusively up to the user.\n\nUsers may modify models and files at their own risk and only for their own personal use. Modified files are not guaranteed by us and as such, users do this under their own risk and know how.\n\nThe Images shown on the campaign page are just for visualization and although they may come very close, they are not an exact representation of the final design or printed model, which may vary.\n\nWe reserve the right to alter any of the models shown, at any time, before delivery, with the intent of improving the design, or efficiency of production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "Add-On", "descp": "Select this pledge and add-on the total amount for the products that you wish to receive.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Known only through whispers and rumors, the DCC RPG Annual is a legend before its time. Those few who have seen its pages are now but blasted ash. It's your turn, mortal. Be careful when you turn its pages...\nThanks everyone for a terrific Kickstarter! If you missed it, you can find the finished product at www.goodman-games.com once it's in print!\nColor cover to the DCC Annual! By Doug Kovacs\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game, also known as DCC RPG, is the most fun you\u2019ll ever have playing an RPG. It is also a game founded in principle. Important amongst those principles is an aversion to rules bloat. The DCC RPG core rulebook is but a single book. There are no splatbooks, sourcebooks, character books, monster manuals, or other supplements for DCC RPG. They are not needed. Incumbent upon the judge is the need to create: yon horizon is filled with adventure, and it is your adventure. You have worlds inside you: find them.\nYet the urge to create is a hungry god, and gods demand nourishment. It was originally conceived that an annual publication would exist in some form to showcase the brilliance of the DCC RPG community. This would be the DCC RPG Annual, published each year to distribute these gaming creations.\nThe best of things happened: the DCC RPG Annual was never needed. The DCC community burst forth a verdant jungle of inspiration, with ripe fruit on every limb. Blogs and personal posts; zines; community publications; the Gongfarmer\u2019s Almanac; officially licensed third-party works: there is a vast supply of inspiration from whence the DCC judge can draw and iterate.\nAnd thus we come here to Kickstart a volume which has no place. If you are a DCC fan, you absolutely do not need to support this Kickstarter. Should you to desire to do so, however, you will receive a book that has become a legend, despite never before being published.\nFoil cover to the DCC Annual! By Doug Kovacs. Imagine this printed in gold foil on a leatherette background.\nThe DCC RPG Annual\nSpoken about for half a decade in hoary whispers, at long last Goodman Games brings you: the DCC RPG Annual. Much of the material for the DCC Annual was written between 2012 and 2014, when the original need was perceived. In many ways, it springs forth from the original inspirations of DCC RPG, which were psychically close at that time. There are magic swords. There are patrons. There are even more tables for making monsters unique. There are rules for making cleric deities more distinctive. There are rules for patron weapons and magic rings. There is the lost continent of Mu, and the hidden places between worlds. And there are rules for magical moustaches.\nThe DCC Annual is a hardcover estimated at 160 pages finished length. Like the original DCC RPG core rulebook, it is available in two cover options: a full-color and foil cover edition. It is organized in the same manner as the DCC RPG core rulebook: chapter three is equipment, chapter five is magic, and chapter nine is monsters, just as in the core rulebook. There is no chapter two, because the skills section of the core rulebook has no expansion material in the Annual.\nThe DCC Annual comes in two cover versions. The color cover is painted by Doug Kovacs and features Hugh the Barbarian and his Band. There's a story in this cover, a chapter of the Band history, for those who can find it. There is also a foil edition featuring a new foil design (and someone\u2019s decapitated head). For this Kickstarter, the foil edition will be printed in gold foil. The distribution version will be printed in silver foil. And never fear, art fans \u2013 the foil edition also features Doug's amazing cover art from the color cover edition (reproduced on the interior pages of the foil edition).\nYou absolutely do not need the DCC Annual to play DCC RPG, nor does any material in the Annual supersede or otherwise change the baseline game experience as expressed in the core rulebook. There is no rules bloat: only new vistas of imagination.\nAnd with every gift from the gods, comes a toll. Not only does this Kickstarter offer the DCC Annual, but it also offers three other artifacts to show your devotion: a new printing of the DCC RPG core book featuring yet more amazing art; a new hardcover edition of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin; and an opening offer of the DCC Quick Start Rules for new initiates. Read on! \nThe Shanna Dahaka cover to the DCC Core Rulebook! By Doug Kovacs\nNew Fans, Welcome!\nWe invite newcomers to join the Cult of DCC! As part of this Kickstarter, we are offering the DCC RPG Quick Start rules, in print+PDF format, for the ridiculously low price of $2.00. That price includes postage to anywhere in the world. If you haven\u2019t experienced DCC RPG, this is your chance to get in very affordably. The Quick Start Rules include everything needed to get your character from level 0 to level 2, and also include two one-session adventure modules. This pledge level also includes three free PDF adventures of our choosing.\nWe are also giving away a PDF of the Quick Start Rules for free at this link right here. If you\u2019re not sure what DCC RPG is, this is a great way to test the waters!\nAnd finally, if you as a newcomer decide you want to jump in a little deeper, we invite you to check out the Three Best Pledge Levels, detailed below. The Favored Retainer level offers an affordable way to get started on DCC RPG. \nThe pterodactyl-wizard cover to the DCC core rulebook! By Sanjulian\nDCC RPG Core Rulebook, 7th printing\nAlso offered in this Kickstarter are two other items of interest to the DCC gamer: a new printing of the core rulebook, including new cover art, and a compiled hardcover edition of DCC #83: the Chained Coffin.\nThe DCC RPG core rulebook has been through 4 hardcover and 2 softcover printings prior to this run. (And wow, isn\u2019t that amazing? Thanks everyone for the support!) Now that the hardcover is once again out of print, we are doing another printing.\nAs always, the content is materially identical to prior printings (except for fixing a couple typos). There will be a new adventure substituted in the back, as we do for each printing This printing includes \"Yddgrrl's Maze,\" a level 2 adventure by Michael Curtis. In addition, this print run will be distinguished by the covers. We are offering three covers on this hardcover edition:\n\u00b7 The \u201cbasic blue\u201d cover, the classic Doug Kovacs cover we all know and love.\n\u00b7 The Sanjulian cover. Fans of 1970's fantasy and sci-fi art will know Sanjulian's art from Warren magazines like Creepy and Eerie, as well as his run of Conan covers. This is the red-and-yellow \u201cpterodactyl-wizard\u201d cover you see above. The Kickstarter edition will include an exclusive foil imprint over the DCC logo.\n\u00b7 Doug\u2019s new Shanna Dahaka cover. The Kickstarter edition will include an exclusive foil imprint over the DCC logo. \nThe hardcover 2nd printing of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. Cover art by Ken Kelly\nDCC #83: The Chained Coffin (hardcover 2nd printing)\nDCC #83: The Chained Coffin was originally released way back in 2014. The boxed set proved immensely popular, and not just for the spinning map puzzle. The Appalachian-style fantasy setting of The Shudder Mountains, inspired by the works of Appendix N author Manly Wade Wellman, provides a unique place for your characters to adventure. Michael Curtis did a wonderful job of bringing The Shudder Mountains alive, and several supplemental volumes were published.\nNow that the original boxed set is out of print, we are offering a hardcover book that compiles all material from the original DCC #83: The Chained Coffin boxed set, including all the stretch goal booklets, as well as much, much more:\n\u00b7 All content from DCC #83.1: Tales of the Shudder Mountains and DCC #83.2: Death Among the Pines\n\u00b7 The Shudder Mountain material published in several Gen Con Program Guides\n\u00b7 Moon Eyes and Fire-Flies, a new adventure set in the Shudder Mountains\n\u00b7 Buzzard Hollow, a new Shudder Mountains mini-setting\n\u00b7 Ma Bigginty\u2019s Book of Backwoods Wisdom,a collection of inspiration material that will bring the Shudder Mountains to life in your game\nThe DCC #83 hardcover is estimated at 160 pages and yes, it will also include the spinning map puzzle! (We are working with the printer on logistics, but the most likely scenario is having the map tucked inside the back cover of each hardcover.)\nOne last thing. Doug\u2019s original art for DCC #83 is amazing, but you know we like variety. The hardcover edition features new art by none other than fantasy legend Ken Kelly. Fans of 1970s Warren magazines like Creepy and Eerie will also recognize the work of Ken Kelly, whose career also includes a long stretch of amazing illustrations. And his illustration builds on Doug\u2019s original design for the chained coffin itself. And don\u2019t worry, Doug\u2019s original cover art will also appear in the hardcover edition.\nDCC #83 will also be available in a foil edition, featuring the same amazing image that was printed on the limited-run foil editions of the original module. This cover art is timeless and deserves to remain in print. The Kickstarter edition will feature a different foil color than the distribution edition.\nThe original \"blue cover\" edition of DCC RPG core rulebook. By Doug Kovacs\nThe Three Best Pledge Levels\nIf you'd like to buy copies individually, the table below shows their cost. You can add on funds to purchase more than one book. However, there are some bundle deals that offer a great value. See the summary after the table: \nThe Three Best Pledge Levels. We are offering three great deals that make it easy to back multiple books in this Kickstarter. If you\u2019re a new fan, a dedicated fan, or a diehard collector, one of these is for you.\nFavored Retainer: You are new to the adventure, and you have promise. This pledge level is for new DCC fans and offers a $120 of product for $100. You\u2019ll receive the color-cover editions of the DCC Annual, core rulebook, and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. If you would like to have the Sanjulian or Shanna Dahaka covers for the DCC Core Rulebook, pledge for this level and add an extra +$20 for the price difference.\n Name Level: Your fame precedes you within the DCC community. This $150 pledge is a $30 savings on the cover price of $180. At the Name Level pledge, you\u2019ll receive DCC Annual (Kickstarter-exclusive foil cover), DCC #83: The Chained Coffin (Kickstarter-exclusive foil cover), and a copy of the DCC RPG core rulebook, with your choice of either the Sanjulian or Doug Kovacs cover.\nLanded Lord: Other fans make pilgrimage to witness to your legendary collection. This $300 pledge is a $60 savings on the cover price of $360. As a Landed Lord, you will receive everything offered in the Kickstarter, which is seven books: both covers of the DCC Annual, both covers of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin, and all three covers of the DCC RPG core rulebook (7th printing).\nPrint + PDF\nEvery print copy of the DCC Annual, DCC core rulebook, and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin books offered in this Kickstarter also includes a PDF edition.\nKickstarter Exclusives\nThis is stated elsewhere but also to call it out explicitly: this Kickstarter features cover variants that are exclusive as follows:\n\u00b7 DCC RPG core rulebook, Sanjulian edition: the DCC RPG logo will be foil-printed\n\u00b7 DCC RPG core rulebook, Doug Kovacs Shanna Dahaka edition: the DCC RPG logo will be foil-printed\n\u00b7 DCC Annual, foil cover edition: the foil will be printed in gold. The distribution edition will be printed in silver.\n\u00b7 DCC #83: The Chained Coffin: the foil will be printed in gold. The distribution edition will be printed in silver.\nShipping Costs\nPlease note that shipping costs are not included in the pledge levels. Shipping costs will be assessed at a later date via Backer Kit. \nUSA shipments will ship via media mail, bound printed matter or equivalent rates.\nInternational shipments will ship via a tracked service, most likely FedEx or UPS. We will endeavor to find the cheapest option, and also partner with international shipping partners where possible to reduce VAT charges via local-market shipping. \nThe exact cost of each shipment will vary according to the content but please be aware that the hardcover books in this Kickstarter are heavy. International backers should expect to pay minimum postage charges for a single book of at least $20-$25 for Canada, $30-$35 for Europe, and $35-$40 for Australia and Asia. Additional books will obviously add to this cost. Final cost will be assessed via Backer Kit. \nStretch Goals\nWe have learned over the years that there are so many ways to make these books cool! We\u2019ve already worked out a couple options as options for stretch goals, which are listed below. As the project progresses we are open to suggestions from fans on others!\nAt $40,000: CLEARED!We will print new color art on the endsheets of the DCC Annual.\nAt $65,000: CLEARED! We will print maps on the endsheets of DCC #83: The Chained Coffin. PLUS we will include a free 11x17 poster print of one piece of cover art with every print pledge!\nAt $80,000: CLEARED!Free adventure! For every book you buy, you'll get one free DCC adventure module in PDF format (exact module to be determined). (The $2 quick start rules don't count!)\nAt $100,000: CLEARED! We will include satin ribbon bookmarks in the DCC Core Rulebook and DCC #83: The Chained Coffin.\nAt $125,000: CLEARED!We will include printed 11\u201dx17\u201d posters of the cover art. There will be several \u201ccheckpoints\u201d on this stretch goal and we\u2019ll use backer feedback to decide which posters to print \u2013 the Chained Coffin cover, the Annual cover, the Sanjulian cover, etc. (Or maybe we\u2019ll just blow past this stretch goal and print them all!)\nBeyond that: We have some fun ideas. We would like to print custom dust jackets featuring the Deadly Hands of DCC art that premiered at Gen Con 2018. Some fans have requested books bound in real leather, and that may be an option we unlock. And we\u2019re open to your ideas as well!\nThe Demon Skull Add-On\nWe are also producing a version of the DCC RPG core rulebook that features the original iconic demon skull image.

Although you can simply add anything you want from the main shop as an add-on, if you like!\" ~Andy]\n \u00a38,000 STRETCH GOAL KLAXON!\nIf we hit \u00a38,000 the New Alternate Dragon Head will be unlocked and everyone can swap it for their Original head or add it for \u00a315 to their pledge.\nYeah ignore what I said above, sort of. Not a crazy stretch goal, though but a very cool one - people asked me to make a new head and I couldn't resist, so if we make it to \u00a38,000 (about 5 dragons away at the time of writing) then everyone can either swap their original Dragon head for this new Alternate one, or add it to their pledge as an extra head for \u00a315.00. It will be used on the next Dragon that Andy makes, in I dunno, a few years' time? Who can say, eh? but if wee hit \u00a38k then Andy will make it fit the current Dragon's body. (Note: above picture is early stage work in progress, it'll have lots more little spines and stuff.)\nThe Heresy Dragon. \nWhat a beast! (For an assembly video, check out Update #4, which is Andy assembling a Dragon for your delight)\nLong story short, this model caused a lot of problems during it's original production run; with ALL of those problems solved there's nothing stopping Heresy from making a short second run of models for those people who missed out on the first run, other than the amount of money, time and intensive labour it takes to make a full set of moulds for the beast, and to cast them. it's a glorious kit and will totally steal the show in your display cabinet!\nDragon painted and given a wonderful scenic base by Sean Powers\nDragon painted and given a wonderful scenic base by Sean Powers\n All 330+ Dragons of the original production run were finally completed in August 2015. Swearing never to even think of bringing it back into proper production after such a gargantuan effort, Andy gladly drew a line under it and plunged into the Return Of the Monsters Kickstarter production (that campaign is all but completed, the final model, the Light Vs Dark diorama should be finished over the Christmas break, for those last 8 backers waiting for it) but since then, email after email has come in from people who somehow missed their chance to buy a Dragon for themselves. They ask him about it at shows or on the telephone. Without fail.\n\nAnd so, the tempting whispers have won. The Dragon's Master model castings are all safely stored, ready for moulding again, and here in 2018, Andy has decided that enough time has passed to distance himself from the emotional attachments surrounding his fight to bring the original production run to fruition, to allow himself to face the Great Enemy one more time. This thing is totally ready to go!\nDragon painted by Daemonslave\nEXPERTS ONLY \nThis is an Expert Kit. Do not buy this kit if you are not expecting to have to put some work in to assemble this beast. Although the joins are incredibly good (weeks of work went into making them as good as possible at the time), you will still have to do some gluing and a bit of gap filling with the putty of your choice, as you would with any multi-part resin model kit. The Dragon is supplied unpainted and unassembled. There is no painted option available, sorry.  Andy recorded a video of him assembling it for Update #3, Well that Worked Well, which should give you an idea of what is involved and if you could cope with it. Click the link above.\nThe kit is produced using a paintable mould release spray but we still advise that, prior to assembly, you wash the parts in warm soapy water to remove any residue of release spray, rinse and dry throughly and prime with a paint suitable for plastic surfaces.  Any minor mould lines can be gently scraped away with a knife or fine file, etc. It would be an ideal model to use airbrushes and oil washes on, in Andy's opinion. If any parts have bent or distorted during the casting process (quality control is extremely high but oversights can happen) simply immerse them in hot water for 20-40 seconds or so and carefully bend into desired position.\nThe Dragon uses a phenomenal amount of silicone and resin in it's casting process, over 21kgs of silicone and the final model is around 750 grams of resin. It is double cast to ensure the best bubble free castings, parts being both vacuum and pressure cast. It takes an entire day to produce one casting and clean all the moulds ready for the next one.\nThe finished model is around 30cm from base of rock to extended wingtip, and approx 44cm wide and 34cm long, in the pose as pictured. It (carefully) fits into an Ikea display cabinet, although you might have to take a shelf out to allow for the height.\nAfter this production wave is done, there will be a significant gap before the next one, if at all. So don't miss out this time around!\nIf this project funds, the first ten dragons will be ready by the end of January 2019. The next ten are scheduled for May just in case, because the Salute show comes along in April and really ruins everything production wise. Last year Andy worked so hard prepping for Salute he gave himself Type 2 Diabetes, so he's allowing plenty of time for it next year. However, if funding hits \u00a38,000 he will be able to speed things up and make extra moulds so some of those second ten will no doubt be ready in February, ahead of schedule.\nThe Dragon vs the Heresy Giant, Mucklegeet, vs a 30mm human figure, Brother Lucius, to give you a sense of size.\nPLEDGE MANAGER AND ADD-ONS - PLEASE NOTE: \nThere will be no pledge manager for this campaign. It adds so much complication to things for a one-man business and Andy wants things to go smoothly and simply this time around. You will be able to add models to your pledge later via the regular Heresy Miniatures shop once your Dragon is ready, or, if you really do want to pay for them now via Kickstarter, you can add any model from the main shop to your pledge by increasing your pledge enough to cover the cost of the models you are adding. MAKE A NOTE OF WHAT YOU WANT. A lot of people immediately forget what they pledged for after a campaign finishes. Surveys will be sent out almost immediately after the campaign so that you can tell us if you want any extras. \nIf you want to make a separate order right away to be sent out with your Dragon, you can do so by visiting the shop, adding whichever models you like to your basket, and then choosing the shipping option ADD TO DRAGON KICKSTARTER. This will not charge you for shipping, but you will be asked to pay correct shipping once your Dragon is ready to be sent. (Do you see why this suddenly makes things get more complicated for a one-man business now?). If you want to add any items from the normal shop to your pledge, simply click 'edit pledge' in the side menu, and add the total amount of add-ons to your existing pledge. Make a note of what you want, I repeat, for convenience. Kickstarter will charge your card during the payment process, which will be during the 14 day period after the campaign ends. You may receive a gentle reminder message from Andy if your card does not get charged sucessfully, as these things happen and often people don't realise they haven't paid for something. We all assume things will go smoothly, but banks are fickle creatures and, for example, can block payments for 'security reasons', especially if your card is used online at some site you haven't used before, for example.\nYou will be emailed/messaged once your dragon is ready, so please keep your contact details up to date on Kickstarter.\nAdd a Winged Netherlord II to your pledge for \u00a3140\nOr perhaps you would like the sensuous, sexy Madame? Add \u00a399 to your pledge, or go to the main shop by clicking this link, make an order for her and anything else you want, and choose Add to Dragon Kickstarter Pledge as the shipping\n                     Andy really does love making ridiculously big models. Here's Mucklegeet the Giant from the last kickstarter, add him to your pledge for \u00a3110.00gbp\nI will add some more Add-On examples during the campaign  just to keep things vaguely amusing for you all.\nREFUNDS: \nIf you change your mind and want a refund, you must do so within 13 days of the end of the campaign, as Kickstarter deducts fees from your payment and does not return them to Heresy if you request a refund from the campaign after 13 days. Refunds will not be given lightly, as every pound of this money is needed to produce the Dragons, so if you're the kind of person who buys things on a whim and then demands their money back two days later, DO NOT BUY THIS MODEL. It is not for you. This is for serious, patient, collectors only, who expect to wait months to get their Dragon, and are happy to do so. There will not be years of waiting like the first time around, but even so, be prepared to wait, because Expecting the Unexpected is an absolute requirement of the resin casting process. See the pledges for approximated dates for delivery (these have been exaggerated to allow for unforeseen delays) If you have a legitimate reason for requesting a refund after the 13 days period, and within 30 days of the campaign ending, any refund that can be made to you will be made, less the amount deducted by Kickstarter for their fees and payment processing.\nSHIPPING: \nShipping will be worldwide, you will be contacted individually for the additional payment once your Dragon is ready to ship. As each dragon weighs around 1.4kgs packed, expect to pay around \u00a322 for shipping to the USA (or Australia) via Royal Mail Tracked and Signed, or a courier can be arranged if preferred, although those services tend to be a little more expensive (faster too) and will incur a minimal fee at your end from the courier in your country. Royal Mail usually puts its prices up in April each year by a small amount. You will be responsible for paying any import duties and taxes.\nBrexit may mean that import duties apply to the European Union countries that the UK is currently a member of, unless some miracle occurs and we manage to stay in the EU Customs Union. I will try to get as many dragons out before March as I can, just in case! Currently typical costs are around \u00a316.00gbp for European shipping\nUK parcels will be sent via Recorded Delivery or Special Delivery as each backer prefers, fortunately the costs are much lower for that here in the UK!\n RECASTERS and OUR RIGHT TO REFUSE\nRecently there has been a sharp upturn in the number of recasters producing models from various one-man independent miniatures companies such as Heresy and our friends. By buying recasts, you are probably supporting much more nefarious industries and practices in the countries producing the pirated miniatures. We reserve the right to cancel the pledge of any backer who is a known recaster or associate of such or who lives in a country renowned for producing counterfeit miniatures. It's simply not on. We also reserve the right to refuse service for any other reason.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery possible problem that could happen, happened the first time around (there's a whole depressing blog about it on Andy's blog) and can now be dealt with through Andy's hard won experience. You don't cast 330+ of these beasts without learning everything there is to know about it. \n\nThe main thing that would affect this production run would be weather conditions - if it gets really cold in the workshop, it prevents the silicone moulds curing, and especially the resin wings from curing as quickly as desired, but the production schedule hopefully allows for this. The first set of production moulds would be completed just before the Christmas break, allowing production to begin in January after the holidays.\n\nThe Dragon will be being produced alongside other Heresy models, which also slows things down, but this is also allowed for in the production schedule. The time scale given is exaggerated because I always expect the unexpected these days, when it comes to resin casting.\n\nIf the campaign proves wildly successful, Andy will shut the main shop if necessary to concentrate on only producing Dragons until things have been calmed down, or will engage the services of one or more trusted casting companies to help produce the extra dragons if it looks like there will be too much work for him to handle alone.\n\nOther than that, injury etc would be the main threats, as with any one-man business, but you can't really plan for that.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Sarcastic Support", "descp": "This gets you onto the comments board where you can sneer and snipe and pour scorn and be really a generally awful human being.

The Busts include a custom base/stand for each one. \nIn addition to designing and sculpting, I also quality check each piece. If you ever receive a defective piece, please notify me directly and I will make it right. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nI am bringing these figures to Kickstarter in order to help fund the production molds and casts.  I have paid for the 3D prints and master molds for every figure except for some of the final stretch goals.  \nShipping Chart\nShipping will be charged after the project ends.  Please refer to this shipping chart to estimate the shipping for your pledge.  The Minimum amounts listed are for a single figure.  The Maximum amounts listed would be the maximum amount you would be charged if your order includes a lot of figures, or if your order includes the 193mm Huge Bust :\nPlease send me any questions you have!\nShipping Date\nI have set the shipping date for April 2019, although I will do my best to deliver it sooner than that. \nA Little History...\nMy wife Kimberly and I founded M&K Adventures back in 2012. Our goal was to create fun miniatures, and that still remains our goal today.  We ran our first Kickstarter in 2015, which was successful and fulfilled on time.  :-)  After that we were very excited and began working towards launching Frozen Ninja 3D where I would begin showing off my own sculptures.  In 2017 we launched our second Kickstarter project, and it had figures completely designed and sculpted by me, Mark.   Once again the project was successful and it also was fulfilled on time.   Here is a link to our previous Kickstarter project :\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/670874743/30mm-to-110mm-fantasy-miniatures-and-sculptures?ref=nav_search&result=project&term=30mm%20to%20110mm\n2018 has been an exciting year.  I have been working hard to make this Kickstarter the best it can be.  In addition, Kimberly and I presented all of our figures in our first role as Vendor at ReaperCon in August 2018.  It was an amazing time, and we met a lot of great people.\nWe are looking forward to a bright and thrilling future!\nOur Booth at ReaperCon! There's Kim!!!\nOur Kickstarter figures on display at ReaperCon\nThe Huge 193mm Bust was also on display at ReaperCon\nInterview Link :\nHere is a link to an \"Artist Spotlight\" interview that was done by Justin Smith from Tales of a Mini Painter.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Earlier in 2018 Art of the Genre ran a campaign to create The Folio of Fiendish Monsters, however that campaign was the only product we've ever done that didn't include 5th Edition D&D mechanics.  Now, before we print this product, and after a lot of fan requests, we are offering the chance to add a 5th Edition monster appendix to this volume.\nIt is our hope that before this book goes to press we can add the 5th Edition content that I've already been writing with each monster I create.  \nGet this incredible monster book with 1E & 5E monsters covered by TSR master artist Jeff Easley!\nWhat will be included in the 5th Edition appendix? Currently I've been writing a 'base-line' stat block for each monster in 5E.  I hit the bigger points of each monster that relate most commonly to game play.  The current blocks look like the following:\n5E Block:\nIce Goblin [AC 14, HD 2d10+2, HP 12, Initiative +4, #AT 1, Hit +2, Dam Ice Dagger 3 (1d4+1), Stealth +5, Cold Blood (DC 14 Dexterity or take Freezing Acid 2 (1d4) per successful melee attack that damages this foe)]\nSTR: 10 (-) INT: 10 (-) WIS: 8 (-1) CON: 13 (+1) DEX: 15 (+2) CHA: 8 (-1) \nCR: 1/2 EXP: 100 \nMonster Type: Small Humaniod\nStretch Goals within this campaign could expand on the 'block', providing Speed, Saving Throws, Full Skills, Senses, Languages, etc. \nIce Goblin illustration by Simon Adams, and they are nastly little buggers!\nWhat are the monsters in this book?  I'm going to provide an incomplete list (76 monsters), just so you have a taste of what the 115 new monsters are like.\nIce Goblin, Frost Ogre, Tundarian, Frost Skeletons, Blizzard Giants, Plated Woolly Rhino, Winter Witch, Hobgoblin Ice Raiders, Warmth Wisps, Ice Wall Dragons, Monofilament Kobolds, Dwarf Eaters, Simsisiun, Demon Prince of Changelings, Lyzinia, Arch Devil of Sin, Tournament Knight, Hell Fish, Typhoon Elemental, Black Sands Lich, Tether Worm, Fey: Dragon-Linked, Fey: Nature-Bound, Fey: Bridge Guardian, Fey: Nightborn, Dungeon Lurker, Tomb Shambler, Shadow Ogre, Karasian Dwarf, Spider Troll, Gloom Husk, Gloom Interloper, Gloom Brute, Gloom Knight, Stone Goblin, Legion Orc, Goblin Wanderer, Feral Kobold, Deep Forest Orc, Tethered Beast, Tethered Humanoid, Bender Scout, Out Island Reaver, Out Island Taskmaster, Out Island Captain, Bojun, Warfang, Sinner Hangman, Old Man of the Woods, Maiden Hag, Fallen Totem, Cuddle Creeper, Marigold Man, Fool\u2019s Paradise, Dire Pine, City Stalker, Beast Spirit Haunt, Street Slitherer, Barkempkin, Brain Larva, Sewer Man, Drowning Fountain, Crimson Roses, Were Owl, Were Gull, Were Pigeon, Moon Child, Dravarian Highwayman, Chaos Bringer, Bastian Born, Devil\u2019s Minions, Blood Caliph, Sand Rippers, Silk Whisperer, Shell Collector, Zhamaran, VirVir, Bonecrusher Dog\nWhat is a Folio? The Folio series is a OSR inspired throwback series from Art of the Genre that revolves around gaming modules and supplements.  Currently there are 19 Folio adventures, dozens of Folio mini-adventures, and 3 Hardcover books.\nWhat do the AD&D pages look like? I've already been playing with designs from the original campaign, but there will have a feel like the monster blocks in the original AD&D Monster Manual, although I WILL be including experience for each creature as seen in Monster Manual II.  \nHopping Brains are coming for you!\nWhat are the other Folio Hardcovers? By the time this book is published in December 2018, there will be 5 'orange spine' hardcovers in the Folio Hardcover Series.  They are The Complete Roslof Keep (which compiles the mega-dungeon from Folio #1-Folio #6), The Complete Cities of Sorcery (which complies two trilogies from Folio #8-Folio #13), The Storyteller's Arcana (a DM supplement cataloging some of my best rules additions over the past 35 years of gaming), The Folio of Fiendish Monsters (as above), and The Complete White Ship (which compiles the mega-adventure from Folio #14-Folio #19).\n*TRADEMARK DISCLAIMER\n\"D&D\" and \"AD&D\" are trademarks of Wizards of the Coast, LLC.

Roll your dice, allocate them to actions on your player board and tribal cards and then call these out to resolve them on the board. Move cleverly across the arena, dancing around your opponents, build up for a strong attack, or pepper your enemy with quick ones. Play for your Tribe, or team up with another Chief or two, combo-ing your abilities with each other to devastating effect. With five different gameplay modes, all available in both realtime and turn based modes, replayability is huge.\n All of the stretch goals that we hit will be included with every game.\nWith many more Stretch Goals to be announced!\nWe have added a lot of content  to the game since our first go on Kickstarter earlier in the year. You now have the option of playing in either REALTIME or TURN BASED modes in one of five of the different GAMEPLAY MODES:\nEvery Eye for Themselves Arena\nAlliances Arena\nNymphlet Ceremony\nKing of the Hill\nDomination Mode\nCheck out a game of Every Eye for Themselves!\nRoll and reroll the dice! (In REALTIME this is as many times as you like - in TURN BASED you get three total rolls with some exceptions)\nYou can allocate any dice that you choose at any point during your rolling to actions that have a matching symbol.\nIn REALTIME mode, you can then keep rolling, or call out and resolve an action. Remember, there are no turns.\nIn TURN BASED mode, once you've allocated all your dice, you grab a TURN ORDER MARKER. Once all players have grabbed one, you move onto the TURN PHASE. \nThen at any point in time in REALTIME mode, you can call out an action and resolve it. In TURN BASED mode, when it is your turn, you can call out and resolve up to two of your actions.\n In REALTIME mode, there are no turns, so you can call out and resolve an action whenever you like.\nIn TURN BASED mode, you need to wait until it is your turn to call out and resolve actions (up to two actions).\nWhenever you call out and resolve an action in REALTIME or TURN BASED mode, you must then clear the dice you used from that action.\nIn REALTIME mode, you can then start rolling those dice as soon as the action is fully resolved.\nIn TURN BASED mode, you may need those dice to roll for an attack or defence. Once the action is then fully resolved, set the dice aside for the next round.\n Check out the changes made for TURN BASED mode here:\n If you just want to see games in play, then check out the videos below:\nHere is a REALTIME game of Every Eye for Themselves Arena being played:\nHere is a TURN BASED game of Every Eye for Themselves Arena being played:\nNymphlet Ceremony Playthrough Video coming soon.\nKing of the Hill Playthrough Video coming soon.\nDomination Playthrough Video coming soon.\nPlayers can choose to play Eye for an Eye in either Realtime, or Turn Based mode. Each of the different game modes can be played in either of these modes.\nEvery Eye for Themselves Arena sees you fight against the other players with the Chief that has essentially done the most damage winning the round.\nAlliances sees you team up with up to two other Chiefs to coordinate your moves and fight against another team or teams. The most effective team will win the round.\nNymphlet Ceremony has you controlling one or more Nymphlets (dragonfly like creatures) as well as your Chief. Your goal is to keep your Nymphlets out of harms way while capturing your opponents. This mode introduces a different style of play that isn't just combat.\nIn King of the Hill you want to control an important section of the arena and then while you're in it, trigger the scoring mechanism. This mode of play focuses on movement and positioning and will see you and your opponents manipulating each other to ensure that you are the only one that scores.\nDomination mode uses changing objectives throughout the game as the scoring mechanism. When the trigger in the soundtrack sounds, the designated area scores and a new one is drawn.\nAs you can see in the above image, the figures in Eye for an Eye are quite chunky and beautifully sculpted by Bob Olley. We have produced physical sculpts rather than going with digitally sculpted files because we love the quality and depth of Bob's work.\nThe sculpted base is 40mm flat to flat to provide stability during the realtime matches. None of these figures are at any risk of being knocked over.\nWe believe that the rulebook should always be available from the start. So please go ahead and download it, read through it and ask any questions that you might have. We have also provided Print and Play files to give you a taste of how it plays out if you would like to give it a crack!\nCheck out their video preview of the Realtime part of the game below\nWatch Dan's How to Play the Realtime section of the game below\nWatch the video preview for the Realtime section of the game with Nick Welford below\n  Click the image to read the preview with Dane\nClick on the image to check out the Kickstarter preview by Dez Maggs\nClick the image to read the interview Ben did with Rowan\n     More info to come...\nThe characters available in the Core game are:\nFind out more about these characters in future updates or check out our rulebook:\nPalaudis Chief Grublic\nHydris Chief Riparian\nFloris Chief Banksia\nIgnis Chief Incendiary\nNimbus Chief Pluma\nLuftle Chief Echo\nEye for an Eye is made all the better by every single one of our contributors. Together, we have produced what you see before you - Eye for an Eye - a labour of love, hard work, blood, sweat and tears. The amalgamation of many years of work, Shae and I would like to acknowledge and sincerely thank the following people for their amazing contributions to our game.\nAs you may already know, Eye for an Eye is part of a series of games called the 'Rise of the Occulites' Saga. The very first game published in this series - Dawn: Rise of the Occulites, also takes place at the very beginning of the saga, a long time before Eye for an Eye. This narrative, scenario based skirmish game allows you to step in as Tribe Chief of your own Occulite Tribe. Powered by the Natural Selection Deck and sporting 19 scenarios, it has a metric tonne of replayability.\nWe've had a lot of people asking if Dawn will be included here as an add on. Instead of doing that, we got together with Eagle Games and organised for them to run a sale on Dawn alongside our campaign. The best part is that you can order it right now by CLICKING HERE!\nFind out how the Occulite Saga began and pick up the complete Dawn - Rise of the Occulites game for a great price and play it while you wait for your copy of Eye for an Eye to arrive. Get immersed in the world!\nDawn - Rise of the Occulites is available both in pre-painted and unpainted, so pick one up that best suits your needs!\nShipping is not included in any of the pledge levels for this campaign and will be charged some time after the campaign has ended. This allows us to ensure that we charge an accurate amount for shipping. It also gives us time to ensure that we get a good balance between quality and low cost shipping solutions once we know how much content is going to be produced for the game.\nWe have engaged Quartermaster Logistics to fulfil our project which means we are EU, Canada, Australia and United States friendly. Below you will find our estimated shipping costs. It is possible that these may change as we cannot control the global market, but we believe that these should be fairly accurate costings.\nEstimated shipping for EYE FOR AN EYE GAME Pledge\nUnited States - $14 USD | $18 AUD \nAustralia - $23 to $25 USD | $29 to $32 AUD\nNew Zealand - $29.50 to $34 USD | $37 to $44 AUD\nEurope - $18 USD | $23 AUD\nCanada - $21 USD | $27 AUD \nChina, Macao, Hong Kong - $14 USD | $20 AUD\nAll other countries - $69 to $75 USD | $90 to $97 AUD \n*Currency conversions are estimates as of 4th September\nEstimated shipping for A TRIBE OF OCCULITES Pledge\nUnited States - $36 USD | $47 AUD\nAustralia - $41 USD | $54 AUD\nNew Zealand - $132 USD | $172 AUD - Sorry guys :(\nEurope - $28 USD | $37 AUD\nCanada - $40 USD | $52 AUD\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong - $35 USD | $50 AUD\nAll other countries - $220 USD | $287 AUD\n*Currency conversions are estimates as of 4th September\nEurope includes: United Kingdom, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czech, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweeden\nDue to the fact that we have to run this Kickstarter in Australian dollars, we are at the mercy of fluctuating currency conversions. The currency conversions that we have provided on this campaign were true and correct as of our launch date (4th September).\nTo minimise any issues post campaign, the money will be converted to US dollars as soon as possible as this is the currency that all our manufacturing and shipping will be paid in. This ensures that currency conversion is no longer an issue post campaign.\nFind out more about Darwin Games and Eye for an Eye through these links.\nPlease consider sharing this campaign around with your family and friends so that we can produce this game in the best possible fashion!\nWe have provided a series of Avatars so that you can proudly represent your Tribe not only in the Eye for an Eye Arena, but also in the Kickstarter arena.

Based on these experiences and extensive research, we are confident that we are well equipped to handle this process.\n\nWe have already paid for all of the art, figure sculpting and soundtrack creation in advance (and these components are all complete). We have also been in regular communication with our chosen manufacturer pre checking files and component details. This is in an effort to ensure that the project minimises the chances for any delays and so that we can get it into manufacturing as soon as possible after the campaign ends.\n\nHaving said that, there is always the possibility of delays occurring. Shipping times and getting through customs can cause delays as can the length of time with manufacturing, especially in regards to the tooling of the figures. We have put a realistic timeline on production, but will always be striving to deliver as early as we can.

Downloading STL files for your models is free, which means you can create entire armies of miniatures for only the cost of printing - about $3.50 - $5.00 USD per mini if you are ordering online, and even less if printing at home.\nUpload your own assets. Can't find anything matching the sword/helmet/tunic that you're looking for? Find it online or make it yourself, then upload it to DesktopHero to use with your characters.\nCreate your own poses. DesktopHero gives you fine-grained control over every bone in your miniature's body. Create a pose from scratch, or load a pose from the library and fine-tune it for your character.\nShare your creations with the community. DesktopHero is a community effort where you can share assets, poses, and characters.\nTry it out! The best way to see what DesktopHero has to offer is to jump right in and use it! It's live and waiting for you at www.desktophero3d.com.\nPhoto by Daniel Herrero\nPsst! There's a freebie 3D model for sharing the project! See Updates page for details.\n      We have 3 new features lined up for the next round of development: \n3 brand-new professional asset packs featuring Fantasy, Sci-fi and Modern genres\nA prettier, more intuitive user interface\nThe ability to order 3D prints of your characters directly through the site\nSince DesktopHero's release, our most requested feature has been for more and higher-resolution 3D assets. To that end, we are adding three new asset packs, built completely from scratch and with DesktopHero in mind to ensure a consistent look and feel. The assets from the different packs will be fully compatible, so that if you want to have a modern police uniform with a medieval vambrace and a techy laser gun arm, you can. Everything will just work together, without the clipping effects you often see with the current library.\nUnlike the current public DesktopHero library, these premium asset packs will only be accessible to backers. (All current DesktopHero assets will continue to be freely accessible to everyone, as will assets uploaded by the community.)\nFantasy Asset Pack - Concept\nSci-fi Asset Pack - Concept\nModern Asset Pack - Concept\nAs DesktopHero has expanded to include new features over the last several months, the user interface has become more complex and less intuitive. We're working with a professional UI designer to rebuild DesktopHero's user interface from the ground up, focusing on the following goals: \nProvide simple controls for newcomers, advanced editing features for those who want fine-grained control\nEasily find specific assets you are looking for (rather than having to browse through all of them)\nStart with a preset character, then make minor edits (rather than having to construct a dragonborn piece by piece)\nManipulate character pose in a way that makes sense intuitively\nThese changes will result in a system that makes creating miniatures fun instead of frustrating.\nIt used to be that in order to take advantage of DesktopHero, you had to have a 3D printer. No longer! We'll be working with Shapeways to add 3D print fulfillment to DesktopHero, so that you can order physical prints of your characters directly from the site.\nShapeways offers a number of different material options, including Strong & Flexible Plastic (standard), High Detail Plastic (for painting), and even a variety of metals (in case your characters are fighting a dragon).\nHow much will it cost to order a mini? From my experience, printing a 28mm scale mini through Shapeways using standard plastic costs between $3.50 - $5.00 USD per mini. Printing in high detail plastic seems to fall in the $7.00 - $10.00 realm.\nFor those of you who have access to your own 3D printers, DesktopHero will continue to allow you to download STLs for free.\nMetal-cast DesktopHero Minis, by Calohtar\n...we just wanted to say Thank You to our community.

It can now be brought into being. \nWe are associated with a young Russian company, Punga Miniatures, which will manufacture our resin figurines. The rendering is well detailed and the resin of good quality. Moreover this partnership allows us to offer you a wide selection of interesting add-ons. \nOur original idea was to highlight our origins here in North America. Canada has a history during which First Nations peoples and French and English settlers lived together and built our roots.\nWe want to pay tribute to those natives peoples who didn\u2019t have an easy life and who were often evicted from their own lands and suffered terrible clashes. In the colonies, there were also many French \u201ccoureurs des bois\u201d (wood runners) who worked very hard alongside the native peoples. These explorers discovered the territory and allowed the colonization to expand from coast to coast.\nOur project had a hard time because our Mo Hawk Troll was carrying a scalp in his hand. Blood Bowl is a violent game in which the heads are torn off, crushed and the limbs ground. At first, we didn\u2019t have any discomfort due to the presence of the scalp. However we intended to create beautiful new figurines without any bad aspects.\nIn the wake of some comments, we decided to replace the hand of the Mo Hawk. We will make an alternative hand with a corncob. You will understand that we cannot modify more the previously mounted figurines, videos, etc. So, we apologize to those who won\u2019t find it fit with the original hand.\n***** Shipping: Will be calculated according to the options chosen by each of you.

Dungeons and Doggies is the first in a planned series of Animal Adventures releases! It is a set of highly detailed miniatures combining some favourite dog breeds with the different classes of the fifth edition of the world\u2019s greatest roleplaying game!\nTedric, Cornelius and Montague prepare for a new adventure.\nThis set features not only the miniatures in preassembled ready-to-play or paint PVC, but also a bespoke set of fifth edition compatible rules for using your Animal Adventure miniatures and playing as dogs in ANY campaign setting. \nYou will be able to mix canine characters with your regular adventuring party or create an entire doggy team of heroes to save the world! The miniatures also make perfect companions and familiars for your existing characters in any fantasy setting or game!\nCornelius the Golden Retriever Wizard\nOur range of canine characters are true dogs, four legged companions true of heart and pure of soul! We have chosen to develop a range of \u2018non-humanoid\u2019 minis to offer as much of a unique play experience as we possibly could.  \nEach dog has been lovingly designed and sculpted, by some serious dog fans, to be bursting with personality and detail. From the panpipes of Monty, the bard, to the magical spell bones of Cornelius, the Wizard, care has been taken to add flavour and fun to every model.\nNightingale the Pomeranian Monk\nTedric the Chihuahua Rogue\nMontague the Cocker Spaniel Bard\n The Fetch! Pledge $35/\u00a327\nBecause this is Painting and Polygons\u2019 first independent Kickstarter project (despite our experience on other projects), we have chosen to keep things as simple as possible to make it easy for us to support, while ensuring smooth delivery.  \nThe Fetch! Pledge brings you 13 doggy miniatures along with the Rules and Adventure Companion PDFs, as well as art prints from our artist, April Prime.  \nRather than include stretch goals that would complicate the process, in an attempt to encourage more participation, we are keeping things really easy with only one pledge level, that gets you everything we can cram into this campaign!  \nWe have many more ideas for the future too, including more doggies (and maybe even kitties) so don\u2019t panic if your favourite breed isn\u2019t here! The world of Animal Adventurers is just opening up, and with your support, we hope to be able to make this our first step on our journey into it!\nThe dogs are designed on 25mm and 20mm bases and scaled to fit in with existing RPG miniatures ranges. And, although we are providing full rules to create your own doggy adventurers, each miniature comes with its own pre-generated character, complete with character sheet and short story! Whether you fancy being Hartley, a gruff and stoic fighter or Freya, a noble guardian druid, there\u2019s a dog for every player.\nWe are proud to be able to support the excellent online comic Dungeons and Doggos! As part of our collaboration with them, every backer will receive as part of their pledge, a Kickstarter exclusive cross-over miniature; Tonka, the Mastiff Bard. \nYou can read all about Tonka, and the rest of our fearless canine friends, by joining in with the adventure, as depicted by V Lee Illustrations, every Friday at dndoggos.com.\nAlongside our range of miniatures, we are proud to present and include in our campaign a full set of digital rules and a unique adventure that provides a perfect setting for a great one-shot RPG experience, for absolutely free! \nOur rules set contains OGL fifth edition racial rules for creating an intelligent dog, unique canine feats and class options, notes on a canine deity for divine doggies and magic items specially tuned for dog use (which of course, are chew proof as well!).  \nThe accompanying adventure, titled \u201cWho\u2019ll let the Dogs Out?\u201d, is designed to be played either with the characters included in the rules or with any party of equivalent level and tells the fateful tale of sinister magics, dark druids and a chance for some brave dogs to save themselves, their canine cousins and the local village from a terrible fate! \nBoth the adventure and the rules pack feature stunning artwork from professional illustrator and dog lover April Prime, who\u2019s previous work includes the excellent Baby Bestiary for Metal Weave Games. \nAlongside the free rules PDFs, we are excited to be able to offer some of April\u2019s illustrations as art prints, included as part of the campaign for free for every backer! \nIf you want to find out more about April's work, you can do so at: www.artstation.com/april-prime, or by following her on Twitter, @April_Prime.\nRuss Charles is part of the team and principal sculptor behind Painting and Polygons - a Twitch channel that regularly hosts painting and sculpting spotlights for the games industry.\nRuss has worked in the games industry for many years and has contributed to projects as wide ranging as Reaper Bones, Dr Who, Warmachine, Resident Evil 2, Guild Ball and most recently Critical Role.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter finishes based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a 'one size fits all' mentality to shipping.    \nWe will ship your pledges to several hubs around the world at our cost.

Again these are estimates: \n Kickstarter Campaign Ends \n \u2022 0 Day \u2013 Pledges are charged. \n \u2022 1 Week \u2013 Survey sent confirming emails. \n \u2022 1-2 Months \u2013 Pledge Manager sent to backers taking payment for shipping. \n \u2022 1 Month Before Shipping \u2013 Pledge Manager deadline - any late confirmations after this deadline will be shipped from the UK after all other pledges are completed and may incur additional cost. \n Shipping Starts \n \u2022 0 Days \u2013 China starts packing EU/AUS/US hub orders.

Due to the global logistics involved in shipping, some regions may receive their pledges sooner than others. \n\nWe have prepared as much as possible with our production for a successful Kickstarter; however, we will refund pledges if for some unforeseen reason the product cannot be delivered at all. \n\n======= \n\nRefunds \n\n======= \n\nRefunds may be given within 60 days of the campaign ending, including fees. After that time, refunds may be given minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees, as we will not be able to claim those back after 60 days. \n\nWe are unable to issue refunds once we have begun the packaging and shipment stages of the project (around 6\u20138 weeks before the actual shipping date). \n\nRefunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit/debit card. Refunds after 60 days of the campaign ending are processed via PayPal only. \n\nThis is a GBP Kickstarter and refunds will be processed in GBP for the amount received, excluding any applicable fees dependent on the day on which the refund is processed as detailed above. \n\n================= \n\nTerms and Conditions \n\n================= \n\nIf you do not confirm your shipping and pledge details within 10 weeks of our notification via email to confirm them, your pledge will be treated as abandoned.

Changing locations, managing your resources, and using your powers to devastating effect is just as important as making sure the League recognizes your accomplishments.

Yeah that\u2019s right. He\u2019s back too, and he\u2019s sure to put his fist in your plans.\nIn Dr. Horrible\u2019s Evil League of Evil, you play the role of an aspiring Villain who would love nothing more than to be recognized by the new leader of the Evil League of Evil, notorious Dr. Horrible. While the League still considers you small potatoes, completing Schemes, using your Powers, and betraying your \u201cfriends\u201d might just do the trick. But be careful--after ten years of therapy, Captain Hammer is back, and his preferred handshake is a punch to the face. Literally. So you and your fellow villains will have to stay on the move. Meanwhile Hammer will patrol the town, heroically fixing your mayhem and stopping any Schemes in his tracks, which means it would take a Weapon of truly epic proportion to defeat him again.

We have been working with an amazing new artist that has redone almost all of the art and helped us redesign the \"Hero\" Captain Mallet.

It's been pretty hectic, but everyone we have met and took the time to play the game has been the greatest. I'm listening to all the feedback and honestly and sincerely doing everything I can to address everything brought up. I love hearing from you guys and can't wait to give you more information.\n\nWe have been working with a couple different artists to change the look. Meanwhile we have come up with a new name of the game that we think both keeps the feeling comical and lite while still being a good ode to the original show. We wanted to stay away from the obvious parody version because we don't believe it sets the right mood. That being said we will keep everyone updated as we get closer to relaunching the Kickstarter. \n\nWe are also still making attempts to open a dialog about licensing. No more fingers crossed, but not giving up. \n\nBest regards\nNicholas Engel - Head Troll"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "A much deserved apology", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nAfter 10 years of no sequel, my heart still aches for more Dr. Horrible in my life. 2 years ago my wife and I started development on this game with that exact thought in mind. I want to play a game so I can feel like Dr. Horrible. When we started introducing the game to friends and family, I was shocked to find out so many people have never heard of one of my biggest passions. We would stop playing the game immediately and force them to watch the DVD. We even gave out a couple of the extra copies we bought (knowing at the time when we got them they would make great gifts). This is what started it all. I want to revitalize what is so dear to me and I know is dear to so many others.\n\nAttempting to attend a convention during the launch of our first Kickstarter was a mistake. I\u2019m sorry I did not address this sooner. It\u2019s clear that mistakes were made, and rushing to meet the 10 year anniversary should not have been as important as securing the IP.\n\nIt is very important for me that you, the backers, understand that it was never my intent to hurt or deceive anyone. Attempts have been made and are being made to contact both the company who currently holds the rights to the IP, and Joss himself. They have a copy of the prototype and they have been informed of everything we have done. I now know we should have explicitly and clearly stated that this product is currently unlicensed, and more importantly not gone into the Kickstarter in the current stages of licensing. As a new and overly enthusiastic board game creator I ask for your understanding and forgiveness.\n\nFor those of you that have played the game, or are still willing and eager to play the game. I\u2019m very sorry that you will have to wait a bit longer. We will go back to the drawing board and do this right. I can\u2019t say how sorry I am for the miscommunication and more importantly for the distrust this brings, but please know that this is sincere and I\u2019ve learned a lot from this.\n\nTo the game stores that welcomed us into your locations and showed us so much love. I am deeply sorry for any damage this may have caused your stores name and reputation.I hope our future actions serve as proof of our sincerity and that you allow us to make it up to you in the future. I would ask everyone involved not to hold these stores accountable for my actions.\n\nTo the fans of Dr. Horrible: I feel my passion has clouded my eyes from what is truly important here. The excitement you felt and love you have is the same thing I want to share. For those that thought this project was licensed or in any way directly affiliated with any related parties, you have my sincere apologies.\n\nFunded in less than 2 hours, 4 times the funding in about 48 hours. This shows that there is an interest and we share a common goal. However, the decision to cancel the campaign is the most honest thing we can do. Thank you for your comments and advice.\n\nSincerely\nNicholas Engel\nCEO and Owner of Lucky Troll Games, LLC\n\nPS: If you have any further comments or questions you may reach me here. headtroll@luckytrollgames.com"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Crazy Random \"Happenstance\"", "update_content": "Fellow Villains, \nObviously we need to start off by acknowledging your incredible response--we BLEW past our goals practically overnight, and now our Head Troll is going straight from working himself to death at our launch con this weekend to working himself to death coming up with new enhancements for everyone to enjoy. But before we start that fun we need to address the elephant in the room. One big issue is clearly on everyone\u2019s mind: How does Mr. Muscle keep his hair so luscious? Just kidding. It\u2019s licensing. The short answer is, it\u2019s all part of the plan--a plan we wouldn\u2019t plan if we didn\u2019t also plan on following through. The long answer is, we\u2019ve done everything short of a skywriting campaign above Los Angeles, but the trick is getting the RIGHT attention. And believe it or not, this comment section is exactly the kind of helpful we\u2019d hoped for. After all, overwhelming love and passion for the musical led us to where we are now--what matters is taking matters into our own hands.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Overturn is tactical combat based board game with co-op elements to it. The uses the rich Middle Eastern folklore as a backdrop to tell its story which is ingrained is supernatural elements, legends and conspiracies.\nThe game uses a multiboard system to depict major scenarios with each major scenario ultimately ending after defeating its boss. The objective to win is simple: defeat all the bosses to reach the final boss and win the game. This can be done all on its own but it\u2019s the coop element that makes Overturn unique. Each board or primary mission can be completed with multiple heroes and players yet each player has the option to pursue their own version of the story on the board and the choice to assist other players or not. The combat is turn based with the enemies having their own unique AI that makes them formidable as well as unpredictable. Players grow their levels by defeating enemies and learning new skills and increasing their power. This applies to enemies too who grow just as much tough as the player grows bolder.\n To add one or more Add-ons to your pledge, just add the amount listed on the add-on(s) to your pledge amount. You will be asked to choose your preferred add-on(s) in the pledge manager after the campaign ends.\nAbout Overturn:  \n\u2022 Overturn is a role playing board game set in the mystical realm of Drish Barahir where you can embark on an epic journey either on your own or with your friends in a cooperative fashion. \n\u2022 You are part of an elite rebellion who wants to free the land from the tyranny of Zahak and his minions of darkness. Little do you know that Zahak is in league with the mythical monsters of the desert Ifrits to bring them back into power and usher the world into a whole new era of shadow and flame.   \n\u2022 Your objective as a player is to defeat all the bosses on the boards by completing quests and ensuring that there is minimal collateral damage.\n\u2022 Overturn\u2019s unique element is its Co-op gameplay where another player can choose to follow their own path or assist you in the fulfilment of your quest.  \n\u2022 You can win the game by defeating the final boss Zahak and that is no easy task.\nExplore:\n\u2022 The beautiful world of Drish Barahir beckons you discover its secrets making exploration an integral part of the gameplay.  \n\u2022 Move around each intricately designed board where you can do a lot.  \n\u2022 You can either interact with NPCs or search the grid to find a secret which can either be good or a nasty surprise. Or you can engage in combat if you are facing an opponent.  \n\u2022 Every level takes place on a different board. From the moonlit graveyards to citadels and central bazars every level and there board offers a distinct landscape and its own set of enemies and challenges along with secrets.\n\u2022 Travel along the unique and mystical landscapes of Drish Barahir each with its own set of enemies on uniquely designed boards with physical architecture that can even be destroyed. \n\u2022 From watchtowers where sniper archers can shoot you on side to the ground where enemies and mini bosses keep rotating; every step you take in the world of Drish Barahir can be your last. \nInteraction: \n\u2022 Each board has its own set of mission objectives that are mandatory in moving the story forward. However you can get additional side quests by interacting with NPCs ranging adrenaline rushing rescues the hostage quests to freeing the slaves.  \n\u2022 Overturn\u2019s unique gameplay gives its NPCs hidden traits and personal attributes. Interacting with them is extremely important for getting additional side-quests.  \n\u2022 The objective of each board is to fulfill pre-determined quests, side quests through interactions and exploration and engage in blood curdling combat.  \n\u2022 Overturn gives each NPC a unique trait to keep the tension mounted. You may choose to help them but sometimes your good intensions can go against you. The NPC you may choose to help or acquire as your companion can also be a spy or worse possessed by a dark Ifrit so trust no one!  \n\u2022 But as the hero of Drish Barahir; you can\u2019t abandon them either. This dilemma and mystery makes each playthrough unique.\nCombat and characterization  \n\u2022 Select from an array of beautifully crafted heroes to play each with their own gameplay style and unique back story that will make you connect with your player on an emotional level.  \n\u2022 Fight through hordes of Zahak or his minions forces or towering Ifrits that once unleased may rampage across your board.  \n\u2022 Combat is an integral and the most interesting part of Overturn\u2019s gameplay. Every encounter can be deadly as the AI that governs the enemies makes every combat move a matter of life and death.  \n\u2022 But beware though the game\u2019s unique AI makes each confrontation a challenge as your enemies swarm you with varying skill levels.  \n\u2022 That is why each conflict delivers a different experience every time you face a foe.  \n\u2022 Ifrits are the mini bosses of the game that can wreak havoc on the board once they get unleashed through the discovery of a possessed NPC. Neutralize them quick to avoid collateral damage.  \n\u2022 As you defeat enemies you level up unlocking new perks.  \n\u2022 To face more enemies and level up; you need to take up challenges strewn across the board.  \n\u2022 But every action has a consequence in the world of Overturn. Every mission reward in Overturn works on the basis of fate hence a long grueling combat to rescue a family from blood may sometimes reward you with the curse status or you may end up earning a rare weapon.  \n\u2022 The game has a beautiful world full of different enemy factions governed by their respective bosses. You need to be tougher and far sighted to face each boss from the very beginning of the game.  \n\u2022 Be careful though; behind veil of civil war gripping Drish Barahir; there is supernatural and ancient force that is pulling all the strings.  \n\u2022 Overturn make its players choose their actions carefully because death of civilians or NPC will speed up the Chaos Clock. Enough collateral damage will set the clock to midnight which will simply end the game.  \n\u2022 Become part of the rebellion. Liberate the Oasis Lands. \nMore reviews and gameplay videos will be revealed during the campaign\n  The European Union, USA and Canada zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer import taxes.\n We will be charging for shipping after the Kickstarter ends during the pledge management phase. This is the best option we could find, since shipping to backers changes based on their location and what they have ordered. We cannot ship these packages to PO boxes domestically or internationally, due to their size and the high chance of being bounced back to us.  \nUSA: $20-$30 to most states.  \nCANADA: $25-$35 to most cities.  \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries.\nASIA: $35 to China and Hong Kong. $45 to most other countries.\nREST OF THE WORLD: $80.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. If we cannot guarantee that all backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, then we can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the Kickstarter one.

This means our estimated delivery date of July 2019 is just that, an estimate.\n\nWe will do our best to minimize any issues that would cause delays and we will be open and honest about any problems that come up. First and foremost, we respect our Backers, and want to make sure you know that you are our priority.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, fees included.

This represents approximately 15% of the full payment. Once we have started to process and packed your order, when the first ship leaves China, refunds will no longer be available. If any part of an order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the cost of this component, fees included. Refunds within the 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Even though TwixT has received multiple awards and accolades in its history, we are excited to share a recent honor that TwixT received that we are extremely proud of!\nThis re-launched version of TwixT has earned STEM.org's highest product honor, the Approved STEM Trustmark. STEM is the widely used acronym for the educational concept of \"Science, Technology, Engineering & Math\", and is used as an educational methodology in schools. Products that possess a STEM accreditation assist children in cultivating important reasoning skills and greatly improve their learning experience. TwixT was selected for this honor based upon the success of displaying the concepts of Engineering & Math.\nPlayed by two people, the goal of TwixT is to build a fence from one side of the game board to the other, each player both defending their fence, as well as preventing their opponent from doing the same. Blue and Red build their fences from behind each of their respective color borders to the other side of the board.\nRed must connect their pegs from the left to the right of the board, behind the border rows.\nBlue must connect their pegs from the top to the bottom of the board, behind the border rows.\nGAME PIECES\nPegs\nPegs may be placed anywhere on the board by each player, with the exception of behind the colored border rows of the opposing player. For example, Red may not place a pegs behind Blue's border rows, and vice versa.\nConnector Fences\nConnector Fences may be placed to connect two pegs of the same color to secure a border between one or more segments of the fence. \nGAME PLAY\n1. Player 1 (Red) plays first. The Red Player will place a peg anywhere on the board - with the exception of behind Blue\u2019s two border rows.\n2. To prevent an advantage to Player 1, Player 2 (Blue) may invoke the \u201cSwap Rule\u201d which will force a swap in sides. Player 1\u2019s color changes to Blue, and Player 2\u2019s color changes to Red. In the event that this rule is invoked, Player 1 may have one more turn to put one Peg of his or her new color on the board. The Swap Rule may only be invoked after the first turn of the game.\n3. On remaining turns, players may place as many connector fences as they wish on their colored pegs only, or remove their own existing connectors/fences as necessary for their game strategy. Each player may, however, only place one new peg at a time during their turn.\n4. New pegs placed do NOT have to connect to existing pegs, and may be placed anywhere on the board, aside from the opposing player's border rows.\n5. Once a connector fence has been placed, it cannot be crossed by either Player. In the below example, Red has built a connector fence, and though Blue would normally be able to connect their pegs, they cannot cross Red\u2019s connector fence. \n6. It is possible to connect more than two pegs of the same color together. \n7. The first player to connect their fence from one side to the other, with an uninterrupted link of connector fences from behind both of his or her border rows, wins the game. If neither player can accomplish this, then the game is considered a draw.\nBy supporting our Kickstarter project, we are offering premium and limited Kickstarter only rewards as part of our crowdfunding effort.\nCollector's Edition -- $45\nElegantly housed in a solid locking Wooden Box, which itself weighs almost two pounds, the TwixT engraved Collector's Edition adds the upgrade of metal tins to house the pegs and connector fences.  \nName Recognition Package -- $150\nLiterally have your name written in the history books of TwixT (aka - Instruction Manual) for the first 2 years of the game reprint!

With it, you will discover a living and deep setting. Nearly 1500 different miniatures were imagined by the best artists, and the authors have described in detail the vast world of Aarklash. You can lead the agile Da\u00efkinee Elves, the powerful Ophidian Alliance, the fearsome Griffins of Akkylannia, or any of the 16 factions represented in the box!

It has also inspired a role-playing game, named after one of its major cities: Cadwallon.\nEditions Sans Detour\n\u00c9ditions Sans-D\u00e9tour have published The Call of Cthulhu in France since 2008.\nIn 2015, the 7th edition of The Call of Cthulhu was subject to a crowdfunding campaign which was the most successful campaign in Europe, across all categories.

The event box will not be available in stores. However, it doesn\u2019t seem reasonable to us to offer it to stores with all of the unlocked stretch goals, as in that situation we\u2019d be getting about 30% of the final sale price, which, to turn a profit on this production, would mean selling it for roughly 1200 dollars (or more depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked). The complete offer you can enjoy here is thus a Kickstarter exclusive.\nThe miniatures\nThe core box contains 178 unique miniatures from the 16 factions of the game, plus all the unlocked stretch-goals.\nCheck the Starting Selection Catalog here.\nShipping costs will be calculated after the end of the campaign. You will be informed of the total amount of these shipping costs via the pledge manager: these costs will be based upon the weight of the initial box and, of course, the weight of every additional stretch goal contents and miniatures that will be unlocked during the campaign, and added to the box. In order to be cost efficient for our backers, all shipments will be sent by a logistics partner based in the final recipient\u2019s geographical area. For example: subscribers from the American continents will receive their parcel from our US based logistics partner, whereas Europeans will receive theirs from our French based logistics partner, etc.\nThe following spreadsheet shows low and average estimates of the shipping costs per geographical area. These estimates are based solely on the weight of the starting material featured in the Kickstarter campaign. Therefore, they may evolve throughout the campaign, depending on the unlocked stretch goals, or which Add-on contents you choose to add to your order.\nPlease note that international regulations prevent us from shipping parcels to the following countries: North Korea, Cuba, Iran, Myanmar, Sudan and Syria. We add the following countries to the list of countries where we will not deliver: Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Russia.\nWe\u2019ll present here the planned calendars for the project\u2019s completion.

If we hit all our stretch goals in this campaign, you will be getting 12 characters and their associated components, in addition to a series of other upgrades and additions at no extra charge.\n     Click here to join our Facebook Group!\n  Eye for an Eye is played in realtime to a soundtrack across a number of intense, five minute rounds. There are no turns and players all play simultaneously. Roll your dice, allocate them to actions, call those actions out and resolve them. \nPlay Every Eye for Themselves or Alliance mode in casual or tournament settings. One round in five minutes, a full tournament in an hour! Eye for an Eye is a game that will have you leaping out of your seat and enthusiastically yelling your character's moves as you do battle with friends and family.\nBelow you can watch a short how to play video and a full round of gameplay to help you better understand how to play, what the game has to offer and so you can make a fully informed decision to back Eye for an Eye!\nIf you want to see how the game plays out in realtime, check out one of the videos below and look for more during the campaign!\nAs you can see in the above image, the figures in Eye for an Eye are quite chunky and beautifully sculpted by Bob Olley. We have produced physical sculpts rather than going with digitally sculpted files because we love the quality and depth of Bob's work. \nThe sculpted base is 40mm flat to flat to provide stability during the realtime matches. None of these figures are at any risk of being knocked over.\nTo avoid the bases warping during the process, we will be producing them in ABS plastic instead of normal PVC like the figures are. This is much more expensive, but ensures that your figures sit flat no matter how fast you play.\nClick on the images below to download the rulebook and a Print and Play of the game, featuring Palaudis Chief Grublic and Hydris Chief Riparian.

Chief Grublic does not go anywhere without his Luftle advisor \u2018Cobbie\u2019 perched on his shoulder. The two have been inseparable since Grublic banished a rogue group of Palaudis to the Tundra wastes for the mistreatment of Luftles.\nInnate Ability - *Watch Out!*\nBand I Ability - Leap    \nBand II Ability - *Shield Bash*\nBand III Ability - Thunderstomp\nChief Riparian was originally her Tribe\u2019s healer until the Chief was killed at the beginning of The Drums of War. Due to the way she had looked after her Tribe, nature, as is the way with Hydris, honoured her with the new leadership. Her stalks rallied behind her as she quickly worked her way up the ranks to become one of Hydris\u2019 leading Chiefs by the time the wars ended.\nInnate Ability - Healing Mucus\nBand I Ability - Slippery    \nBand II Ability - Lunge  \nBand III Ability - Hunting Net\nChief Banksia was known by his enemies for his brutality and stubborness. During the Drums of War he would only lead his strongest members into a fight, a decision that would often leave them woefully outnumbered. This was never a problem for Banksia who saw this as a challenge. He is always had a plan that could snatch remarkable victories from the very jaws of defeat.\nInnate Ability - Savage Strike\nBand I Ability - Camouflage\nBand II Ability - Ambush\nBand III Ability - Brutal Charge\nChief Incendiary is a modest and honourable leader of the Ignis Occulites. To reduce losses to his stalks, he ensured that his Tribe never fought a battle in vain. During The Drums of War, Incendiary focused most of his attentions on defending the Ignis land borders, which he did successfully for the entire war. He only ever allied with Tribes for honourable purposes and was a key figure in brokering peace amongst the Tribes at the end of the war.\nInnate Ability - Steam Blast\nBand I Ability - Slow Heat\nBand II Ability - Vented Heat Blast\nBand III Ability - Sword Dance\nChief Pluma is known for her swift decision making and surgical precision. Sometimes thought of as reckless, her actions were always in the best interest of her beloved Nimbus Tribe. During The Drums of War, she soared high above the battlefield to ascertain troop movements, head off ambushes and if need be, intercept enemies. She is respected by her peers and feared by her enemies - the mark of a true leader in the Nimbus culture. \nInnate Ability - Gliding\nBand I Ability - Will of the Wind\nBand II Ability - Raking Talons\nBand III Ability - Dive Bomb\nChief Echo was mentored by Chief Grublic before being encouraged to raise his own army of Luftles and Wymbrix to carve their own place in the Occulite world. During The Drums of War, he was extremely proficient and strategically brilliant, taking in all he had learned from Grublic and those around him and reimagining it in his own unique way - hence his name Chief Echo. Despite the Arena\u2019s original intent being just for Occulites to settle disputes, with the support of Grublic and other allies, he successfully argued that Luftles should be able to settle their own disputes in the Arena.\nInnate Ability - Diversion\nBand I Ability - Surge\nBand II Ability - Protect the Chief!\nBand III Ability - Luftle Swarm!\nEye for an Eye is made all the better by every single one of our contributors. Together, we have produced what you see before you - Eye for an Eye - a labour of love, hard work, blood, sweat and tears. The amalgamation of many years of work, Shae and I would like to acknowledge and sincerely thank the following people for their amazing contributions to our game.\nClick on the images to take you to their website.\nAs you may already know, Eye for an Eye is part of a series of games called the 'Rise of the Occulites' Saga. The very first game published in this series - Dawn: Rise of the Occulites, also takes place at the very beginning of the saga, a long time before Eye for an Eye. This narrative, scenario based skirmish game allows you to step in as Tribe Chief of your own Occulite Tribe. Powered by the Natural Selection Deck and sporting 19 scenarios, it has a metric tonne of replayability.\nWe've had a lot of people asking if Dawn will be included here as an add on. Instead of doing that, we got together with Eagle Games and organised for them to run a sale on Dawn alongside our campaign. The best part is that you can order it right now by CLICKING HERE! \nFind out how the Occulite Saga began and pick up the complete Dawn - Rise of the Occulites game for a great price and play it while you wait for your copy of Eye for an Eye to arrive.

This allows us to ensure that we charge an accurate amount for shipping. It also gives us time to ensure that we get a good balance between quality and low cost shipping solutions once we know how much content is going to be produced for the game.\nWe have engaged Quartermaster Logistics to fulfil our project which means we are EU, Canada, Australia and United States friendly. Below you will find our estimated shipping costs.

The currency conversions that we have provided on this campaign were true and correct as of our launch date (24th April). \nTo minimise any issues post campaign, the money will be converted to US dollars as soon as possible as this is the currency that all our manufacturing and shipping will be paid in.

We have also been in regular communication with our chosen manufacturer pre checking files and component details. This is in an effort to ensure that the project minimises the chances for any delays and so that we can get it into manufacturing as soon as possible after the campaign ends.\n\nHaving said that, there is always the possibility of delays occurring. Shipping times and getting through customs can cause delays as can the length of time with manufacturing, especially in regards to the tooling of the figures.

We are confident that we have considered all of the costs that will be associated with this project.\n\nOur biggest challenge will be the time needed to sculpt and produce the miniatures. As the sculptors have to most of the stretch goal work after the project funds, the time-frame following the Kickstarter may be longer than we initially wanted. Please bear with us, these miniatures will be awesome and well worth the wait. We will keep you informed with regular updates on the progress of the project. We're not going to be idle while the sculptors are doing their work, however. The rest of the team will be busy developing the future line of miniatures and finishing games for future releases.\n\nWe reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nOur pledge manager for this Kickstarter will be our online store.

(This is your chance to participate in this celebration!) \nMissed the campaign? You can enter our Late Pledge Manager by clicking the above image. The Late Pledge Manager opens May 8th, and supplies are limited.\nNow the whole Street Fighter Universe is literally at your fingertips! What are you waiting for?!  \nHelp Ryu on his journey to surpass all Stretch Goals! Each one we unlock is added to your pledge for Free! We've planned for 12 additional fighters & battle decks to be unlocked during the campaign! With all those unlocked you get TRIPLE the size of a Base Pledge at the Street Fighter Level!\nWe wanted to make our miniatures so good that even if you didn't play the game at all, your pledge would still be fully worth it for these impressive works of art alone - and at their Collectors Scale, they are wonderful pieces to display around your home or office!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game uses a unique scale, the brand new \"Collector's Scale\"! This giant-sized scale has your models large and in charge from 65mm tall all the way up to 85mm tall on some characters all on a standardized 58mm base! We will be offering this scale for all our future Universal Tactics System Games.   \nThis size offers tons of advantages:\nThe miniatures are more like small collectable statues and makes them great for displaying around the house even if you don't play the game at all!  \nThe larger the mini the better the pre-paint process, our pre-painted miniatures are simply the best the industry can currently offer, rivalling that of action figures and full sized collector statues!  \nPlaying with larger miniatures on a board with 3D terrain gives amazing table presence when you pull this game out at any gathering! You'll be the talk of the town!  \nWe believe its quality over quantity, why have buckets of tiny miniatures if they don't get played packed away in expansion box after expansion box? These miniatures will get a lot of table time as your sole representation on the battlefield!  \nTake a look at our featured miniatures video below!\nLet us get a detailed look at each one of our fighters included in the Core Set!\nAdding a NEW DIMENSION to Street Fighter!  \nDestructible Stage Terrain adds a new exciting element to the Street Fighter experience and it adds a new layer of strategic depth to the game as you attempt to out outmaneuver your opponent and set them up for extra damage!  \nEach round the terrain is reset and the fighter positions swapped as to offer an equal opportunity to both players, plus its just more fun to crash into more stuff. Smart awareness, positioning and baiting your opponent can easily win you the day!  \nHOW TO PLAY THE GAME. IT'S SIMPLE!  \nWe wanted anyone to be able to jump right in and play! So we had to make learning the game simple, but yet still have the depth to please experienced gamers and fighting game fans. This was an extremely challenging task for sure, especially when you consider the game system is built not only for Versus Mode but also Free for All and Team Games, essentially three games in one! However after 2 years of development we've believe we have found the right balance between accessibility, strategy, luck and fun factor!  \nIt's as Simple as.... DRAW. MOVE. FIGHT!\n1. DRAW! - Draw 2 cards from your Battle Deck as you start your turn. Skipping this only for the first turn you take.\n2. MOVE! - Move your character up to their Movement Value in any direction.\n3. FIGHT! - Take 2 Actions in any order and in any amount from these Actions:  MOVE, DRAW, or PLAY A CARD.\nOn defense your choice is even easier but yet still an important tension filled decision. Do you BLOCK or COUNTER-ATTACK?\nBLOCK - Roll two default Battle Dice and apply results vs opponent's attack roll.  You may also discard certain cards with defensive dice values to \"BOOST\" your Block Roll.\n-OR-\nCOUNTER-ATTACK - Play a Counter for a Strike, Special or Projectile, if successful discard opponents card and perform Counter-Attack Ability, usually causing damage during your opponents turn!\nAnd that's how the game works! \nAs you roll your Battle Dice & play your cards you will gain meter results which contribute to your Meter Gauge allowing you to enhance certain attacks or save these for the powerful Super and Ultra Combos that can finish your opponents instantly! Best 2 rounds out of 3 WINS!\n CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK!\nClick the Image above to Download the BETA Rulebook!\nThe Boss Expansion adds in two extremely powerful Street Fighter Bosses. The power level of these bosses is so immense that other players will need to team-up to defeat them in a near hopeless final battle! Here's what's in the set in more detail!  \nStreet Fighter: The Miniatures Game Boss Expansion includes everything you need to introduce extremely powerful Boss characters. This expansion also includes the Boss Mode game rules in which one player controls the boss in a battle against a team of three rival players! Can you and your friends stop this evil-doer's dastardly plan?  \nBOSS EVENT DECKS  \nEvery Boss comes with a unique Event Deck that can change the battlefield conditions dramatically, forcing the players to cooperate and strategize to deal with the new threat! Each new boss game is a different experience as only 6 to 8 of these events are drawn each game on average!\nBOSS FIGHTER BATTLE DECKS\nIn addition to the Boss Mode, the Boss Expansion includes normal 40-Card Boss-Fighter Decks so that the boss can join in with the rabble and fight on a more even level with their opponents in Versus, Free For All, and Team Modes!\nIf you would like to purchase any of these optional add-on's, please click the \"Manage Your Pledge\" button on this games Kickstarter Page and in the pledge manager add the total amount of the items you'd like to get to your total pledge.

Please enjoy this Documentary detailing the history of the game from the 25th Anniversary!  \nWe view this as a premium product for fans of Street Fighter, tabletop games and collectable products. The costs of manufacturing a game like this are extremely high due to a number of factors including:  \nIndividual \"Collector Sized\" pre-painted special FX's miniatures that are comparable in size to (\"Nintendo Amiibos\") that can retail for around $14.99 each! And we are packing 8 of them into a single box! 24 in the World Warrior Pledge!\nWe have planned at least 12 Stretch Goal Fighter Miniatures and their Battle Decks as unlocks, each one of these are at no cost to our backers! This cuts heavily into our margins and makes offering this many free mini's impossible at Retail! So get them while you can!\nThis game has among the highest number of full sized top quality playing cards in a single tabletop game ever! 428 cards in the Street Fighter Pledge and each new character unlocked in Stretch Goals adds another 40 cards, an extremely expensive and costly inclusion! With all Stretch Goals unlocked and the World Warrior pledge that's over 1,548 cards! A ridiculous amount and again impossible at Retail!\nCountless pieces of professional & unique artwork for each type of attack and event cards in a Character Deck!\nThe only way a game like this is made possible is to sell directly to our passionate backers who are looking for a premium and high-quality product. As lifelong fans of the franchise, we simply wanted to make the best possible game regardless of the cost! So jump in on this exclusive opportunity, you never know how valuable these limited pieces can become in the future!\nIf demand is extremely high we may consider in the far future making a retail version of the game with a lower amount of miniatures, perhaps unpainted and at a smaller scale.\nIf you miss the kickstarter the game may only be available at conventions and direct from Jasco Games in limited quantities.\nDo you want to help spread the word about this exclusive limited edition celebration of Street Fighter?

When an enemy attacks, you have your entire turn to dodge out of the way, mount your defenses, and launch a counterattack before the attack connects!  \nA Challenging Single Player Game- In Stuff of Nightmares you will be able to battle solo against the trolls that we unlock as stretch-goals in the campaign. Each troll is a distinct challenge ranging from fairly simple to extremely challenging! \nAn Awesome Co-Op Game- Players can collaborate with each other to take down the trolls that we unlock during the campaign!  Play cards to support your teammate on their turn so that you both can taste the sweetness of victory together!\nA Fantastic Multiplayer Game- Stuff of Nightmares can support a four-player tournament out of a single box!

After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

Our plan is to create a 128 page book (like those in the original AD&D orange spine series) and fill it with as many monsters as we can get in there.  All monsters will be set up for 1E AD&D.\nYes indeed, we're going to get you as close to an MMIII as we can!\nWhat is a Monster Sponsor? Well, art is expensive, and even old TSR didn't get images for all its monsters in the original books, so this campaign features a level called a 'Monster Sponsor', and as a backer you are helping create a piece of art for one of the monsters in the book, and in doing so, you will get credit posted next to the image, so you'll be immortalized inside the book.\nSponsor a monster image and get your name in the book!\nWhen is the release? We plan on having this book out before Christmas 2018, so get extra copies for your friends, especially if your name is in it!\nComplete your Orange Spine Hardcover Collection!\n  $11,000: Monster Level Encounter Appendix [UNLOCKED!]: Break down monsters by HD to better customize campaign building or DMing on the fly.\n$12,000: Monster Climate Encounter Appendix [UNLOCKED!]: Break down monsters by geographical zone for better encounter charts and easier DM reference.\n$13,000: Regional Treasure Type Table [UNLOCKED!]: Break down treasure to a specific geographical region for better customized treasure distribution.\n$14,000: New Ability and Powers Appendix: Get a quick reference for various new powers and abilities of monsters in the book.\n$15,000: Full 5E stat appendix expansion! Add 5E D&D gaming stats to all monsters in the book with this special appendix.\nWhat are the backer levels?

Like obscene streamers, the bowels of the red-clothed fat man adorned his mighty antlers; that old bearded man, his fixations, he had never paused a moment to think of him!\nCharacter design by Marcof\n  Did he ever stopped to think of red as the color of blood? And that the blood itself could compete to overcome the intensity of his hateful dress?\nConcept by me\n  Those were strange thoughts, they jumped in all directions ... like his companions! ... those strange little goats on two legs, so similar to the odious little elves with pointy ears, pimps servants flatterers of the fat one, similar not so much in appearance or in the intent, as for the frenzy, the elves to fulfill the silly and repetitive mission of the red fat man, the goat to annihilate everything in their sight!\nSculpture by Cross Lances Studio\n  Rudenolf still had the harmony and the beauty (other new things he had just discovered) of the jumpy ballet in his eyes, a hypnotic dance between the heads of goat and the little elves. The former bound to destroy, the latter desperately trying to escape in panic amids torn bodies, entrails pulled like crimson ribbons to adorn those corpses like badly discarded gift packages... a chaotic motion that contrasted with the immobility of the Four.\nYes, the Four. Rudenolf became aware of them only when they granted him such notion. No matter how but he suddenly opened his eyes and he saw them, cruel simulacra of the red fat one, similar in appearance, but glorious in the aura of their intent!\nit could be purchased as add-on for 15\u20ac\nAnd there they stood, true bearers of gifts. Gifts for all, not only for the odious and boring good of spirit, whose luminous souls had marked step by step a destiny of slavery for Rudenolf.\nThe Four threw the fat man dressed in red before his feet (Rudenolf was standing!) bloodless and panting. They said to him: \"Play with him!\", what is \"play\" he asked, and one of the Four beckoned him towards the brothers with a goat's head, \"They are happy, they have fun\" he said, and as he watched the latter wearing the limbs of the elves like obscene vestiges, Rudenolf understood, and as he eviscerated the fat one he was really happy.\nEach one of them be purchased as add-on for 7\u20ac\n\"Now it's enough!\" the Four said, \"now the game changes, it will have rules, our rules!. Now you can dress red clothes too and you can bring to all the gifts that you will consider just ... pain, fear, despair, your revenge, your new game \"... Rudenolf understood, his nose lit up with a dark red, cruel, not a guide in the night, but a threat, an ominous foreboding, memento of an inevitable promise, joy and expectation yes, but only for Him and his too many buried desires.\n\"Now enough\" shout one of the Four, the one with the wolf helmet, which until now had not spoken, \"stop playing with the bowels of the Elves! ... you prepare Rudenolf, walk with us, at our side, the Coach is waiting for us!\nEach one of them be purchased as add-on for 8\u20ac\nLook at prototypes\n      Model and bases shown are here only to compare sizes.

It brings your dream of Magic, Sword, and Elements mage to reality. With only one roll away! And they are with Glowing Resin!\nFantasy Dice is made by injected glowing resin with different colors background to make it looks Magical and Elemental.\nColor Options\nShadow Black\nThere are 3 ways to maintain the power of 5 Elements, using the mysterious dark energy from another world is one of them. The force of dark energy is different from our world and it's so strong that can keep the natural force of Elements unable to breakthrough. But great power also comes with consequences...And they are with Glowing Resin!\nWhite\nThe Ancient power of Sage is able to seal the power of elements into bones or ivory and allow a caster to summon stable and controllable Elements' force to handle life or battle. However, the academy charges very high for even one Element dice. And they are with Glowing Resin!\nIron\nThe North men are very good at dealing with steel and metal. They use a different way to train mages and control the power of Elements. With the strength of their Chroma Iron, they are able to maintain the force of elements inside for nearly a century.

We are not very good at paint things ourselves, that's why some of the prototypes are sent to some reviewer with painting expertise! We will update you on that soon! And they are with Glowing Resin!\nThat is why we need your help on Kickstarter! The molding for casting is really expensive due to the design complexity.

Miniatures", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Maki Games and Royal Art Games are raising funds to start the production of a resin version for our chaos teams. Both Chaos teams are a collection of amazing miniatures made previously in high quality white metal and soon in high quality resin. 16 different miniatures per team, including a Big Guy (Bloodthirsty Beast or Minotaur, depending on the team). Don\u00b4t loose the chance to support this amazing project!\nGiven the constant increase in the price of metal and the growing competition for fantasy football teams, we felt the need for more affordable yet top quality products. For these reasons we decided to switch the production line from metal to resin. For this project we partnered with Royal Art Games for the manufacturing of resin teams since they have proven to be able to manufacture resin teams for fantasy football at the highest standards. The metal teams will soon be discontinued so this is the best chance to get a team in metal, if you like your players to \"hit like solid metal\".\nThe Blood Demons Team includes 9 Pit Fighters, 4 Blood Demons, 2 Blood Demons Heralds and 1 Bloodthirsty Beast.\n        Ares Blood Demons were designed by Macs Gallo, sculpted by Jin Vi and painted by AXIA.\nAres Blood Demons Team\n           The Chaos Chosen Team includes 11 Beastmen, 4 Chaos Chosen Warriors and 1 Minotaur.\n      Himeros Chaos Chosens were designed by Macs Gallo, sculpted by Irek Zieli\u0144ski and painted by Mindworks Games.\nHimeros Chaos Chosen Team\n        Size Comparison\n              Unlocked Freebie!\n    Unlocked Add-on!\n    Unlocked Freebie\n    Unlocked Freebie & add-on!\n  Unlocked Freebie\n  Unlocked Freebie\n  Freebie\n  Once we raise enough funds to reach the funding goal, it means the resin version of our Chaos and Blood demons team will be produced at the end of the campaign. However, reaching the funding goal is not the end! \nThe campaign will go beyond the basic rewards of the project and the more people join the project, the more stretch goals will be unlocked.\n\nThe beauty of crowdfunding on Kickstarter is that you can choose how much to spend during the whole duration of the project. This means you can join the project to get all the updates of the campaign and change your mind until the very last minute of the campaign. So, if you like our teams you could join with one of the lower pledges and then decide if you prefer to drop it before the end or to pledge more funds and get a more expensive pledge or addons.\nAfter the funding goal is reached we will announce new stretch goals for the project. The stretch goals will either unlock new add-ons or add free items to your existing pledge, so the more people join the project the more free items you will get without spending more. This is a very good reason to help us spread the word on social media and in your community of gamers. If your friends join the project you will all benefit from it at no additional cost.\n\nSHIPPING COSTS AND ESTIMATED DELIVERY\nShipping costs for this project will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager. This solution allows us to charge only the actual shipping costs, which might be different if you take only resin teams, only metal teams or if you opt to get a mix of both.\n\nEstimated shipping cost are:\n10 euros for Europe\n15 euros for USA\n20/25 euros for Rest of the world\nEstimated delivery for this project is early January for the metal teams and late January for the resin teams. There might be minor delays for the resin team depending on the customs clearance process since the resin teams will be manufactured in China.\nMaki Games is a well known Dutch manufacturer of terrain and miniatures. The company was founded in 2013 thanks to the backers who supported our first Kickstarter project. Since then we launched several fantasy football teams thanks to the creativity of Rolljordan, co-founder of Maki Games. In addition to creating our own products we collaborated with several Italian and international firms and manufacturers in the tabletop games market, helping them to manage their Kickstarter projects from concept stage to fulfillment and supporting them in the creation of high quality miniatures. \nIn these 4 years we had the pleasure to work with several world-famous sculptors and artists whose passion and creativity has been fundamental to develop our company. We grew in experience together with our partners and artists and, as we did from day 1, we are committed to maintaining the the highest quality in our casting process. \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have successfully completed several crowdfunding projects in the past and we are confident that the rewards will be delivered.\nIn crowdfunding projects there are always certain variables that could escape our control and as consequence can provoke a delay in delivery.

Everyone involved in this Kickstarter, from writer Michael Curtis on down, is so grateful for the amazing support you have shown this book. \nAnd if you missed out on the Kickstarter, you'll still be able to grab copies of The Dungeon Alphabet from a store near you, or from our online store in due time. \nIf you are a backer, WOW! You guys not only hit every goal we thought of, you added some ideas of your own that we tossed in for good measure! You got past the Leather Edition and moved well beyond, hitting the gatefold map and several extra letters. Amazing. Beautiful. Crazy. Dynamic. Extravagant. Fabulous. Great. ...and you get the idea. All the way to Z. \nHelp bring The Dungeon Alphabet back in a deluxe 4th printing! One of the most popular titles ever released by Goodman Games and a precursor to the design elements that would eventually make DCC RPG so popular, The Dungeon Alphabet is a book of dungeon inspiration that blends creative writing and inspirational art. Every RPG enthusiast, whether player or judge, will find their minds abuzz after reading this book. \nThis Kickstarter funds a 4th printing of The Dungeon Alphabet in a hardcover. Since we\u2019re running this Kickstarter over Black Friday, we are also offering a 40% discount! The book is priced at $12, but only during this Kickstarter. After the Kickstarter it will return to its list price of $20.\nThe 4th printing is expanded with 16 pages of additional content for a total of 80 pages. Depending on stretch goals, we may be able to add deluxe printing features like a sewn-in bookmark, cloth binding, and possibly even a leatherbound edition. (See below for more on that.)\nYou can also add on copies of The Monster Alphabet, a previously-released sister project to Dungeon Alphabet, to your pledge. These are also at the 40% Black Friday discount!\nWhat Is The Dungeon Alphabet?\nThe Dungeon Alphabet is a book of fantasy inspiration. It is filled with random tables that are themed to letters of the alphabet. For example, A is for Altar, B is for Books, and C is for Crypts. The target audience is dungeon masters and anyone who wants ideas for dungeon design. We have heard over the years that many players also enjoy looking through the book as well.\nEach page of The Dungeon Alphabet uses a letter of the alphabet to provide inspiration. In the first printing, so many years ago, there were 26 entries for the 26 letters. With each new printing, we have doubled-up on select letters to add even more material. This 4th printing is now up to 41 entries, including 2 completely new ones and others collected from our annual Gen Con Program Guides, to add a total of 7 letters that are new since the 3rd printing:\nC is also for Crypt\nG is also for Guardians\nH is also for Hazards\nL is also for Levels\nO is also for Omen\nQ is also for Quests\nU is also for Underwater\nJ is for Jewels\nShow Me An Example!\nCertainly!\nHere is a preview of the Table of Contents, where you can see all the letters.\nPreview of the table of contents\n  And here are pages 6-12 of the 4th printing, showing several entries.\nPreview of pages 6-12\n  Tell Me About the Author\n\u201cManly\u201d Michael Curtis is the ruffian behind the writing. The Dungeon Alphabet was his first professional RPG publication, and has launched him on a professional RPG writing career. Michael is well known for his contributions to the Dungeon Crawl Classics line, where he has authored more than a dozen adventures, including the Shudder Mountain setting and associated Chained Coffin adventure. Michael is also the creator of Stonehell Dungeon, and an instrumental contributor the Goodman Games renaissance of the Metamorphosis Alpha line. He is also the lead designer on the DCC Lankhmar project, and the mastermind behind our license to publish the works of Fritz Leiber\u2019s Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.\nMichael's work on The Dungeon Alphabet has been recognized repeatedly. Among many accolades, the book won the Three Castles Award at the 2011 North Texas RPG Convention.\nR is for Rooms\nTell Me About the Artists\nThe Dungeon Alphabet is illustrated by a who\u2019s-who of old-school RPG artists, from TSR founding artists to luminaries of the Old School Renaissance. With each new printing we have added even more art. The roster for the 4th printing includes:\nTSR Alumni: Erol Otus (cover art and interior art), Jeff Easley, Jim Holloway, Russ Nicholson, Jim Roslof\nGoodman Games Artists and OSR Luminaries: Doug Kovacs, William McAusland, Brad McDevitt, Jesse Mohn, Peter Mullen, Stefan Poag, Chad Sergesketter, Chuck Whelon, and Mike Wilson\nThe Endsheet Art\nThe first printing of The Dungeon Alphabet featured an amazing two-page spread on the endsheets. It was a cave exploration scene by Peter Mullen, printed in the same sky blue tone as the original inside covers of the TSR adventure modules.\nVarious endsheet images: the 1st (blue) and 3rd printings\nWith each subsequent printing, we swapped out new art for the endsheets. Peter Mullen provided a second 11x17 image, then Russ Nicholson drew an amazing scene for the 3rd printing. And based on the popularity of this approach, we asked Peter Mullen to illustrate another scene for the endsheets of our GM Gems hardcover.\nFor this 4th printing of Dungeon Alphabet, we plan to include Peter Mullen\u2019s original illustration on the front endsheets, appropriately printed in \u201cTSR module blue.\u201d We\u2019ll also include his other endsheet illustration on the inside back cover. And in the hardcover centerfold, we will print Russ Nicholson\u2019s two-page spread from the endsheets of the 3rd printing!\nDesign Inspiration for DCC RPG\nDungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game, or DCC RPG, is one of the most popular role playing games on the market. Now in its sixth printing, DCC RPG has inspired and re-engaged thousands of gamers, through both its rules and presentation. What many do not know is that The Dungeon Alphabet was a trial run for the graphic design that would eventually come to life in DCC RPG. If you love the overabundance of art in DCC RPG, and the classic pen-and-ink feel, you will love The Dungeon Alphabet.\nY is for Yellow\nAdd On The Monster Alphabet or Other Versions of The Dungeon Alphabet\nYou can add on copies of The Monster Alphabet to this Kickstarter. You can also add on copies of The Dungeon Alphabet in either format (color or gold foil). All are at the 40% Black Friday discount.\nThe Monster Alphabet: Given the synergy between The Monster Alphabet and The Dungeon Alphabet, we are also offering The Monster Alphabet as an add-on. Two years ago, Goodman Games published The Monster Alphabet. Designed with the same principles as The Dungeon Alphabet (and also featuring Michael Curtis\u2019 work), The Monster Alphabet focuses on inspiration for monster design. \nThe Dungeon Alphabet: If you pledged for the gold foil edition and would also like to add the color cover edition, you can do so.\nTo add items on to your pledge: simply add the \"dollars\" to your pledge amount. At the end of the Kickstarter we will send out a survey where you can tell us exactly what you ordered. \nThe Monster Alphabet: Add $12 for the color-cover edition of The Monster Alphabet (in print+PDF) or $18 for the gold foil edition (in print+PDF)\nThe Dungeon Alphabet: Add $12 for the color-cover edition of The Dungeon Alphabet (in print+PDF), or $18 for the gold foil edition (in print+PDF), or $60 for the leather-bound edition (in print+PDF)\nStretch Goals\nOnce we have cleared the basic pledge level, we would like to add a bunch of special features! Here are the stretch goals.\n$7,000: CLEARED! We will print The Dungeon Alphabet with a sewn-in satin bookmark. \n$9,000: CLEARED!

Our leatherbound editions of this nature normally retail for $100 but for this Kickstarter we will offer it at the Black Friday price of $60 per copy.

Since The Dungeon Alphabet first released way back in 2009, it has been universally praised by fans. Here is a sampling of customer feedback.\nSkyland Games: \"I cannot recommend this book highly enough for the dungeon master looking to get the creative juices flowing, and keep their players guessing!\"\nThe Earthlight Academy: \"Even if you don't end up using the tables as presented, just flipping through the pages of this book will have your head swimming with ideas. This is due, in part, to the absurd amount of old-school fantasy art.\"\nGrognardia: \"In the end, it's Michael Curtis's terrific little entries that are the heart and soul of this product and they never once disappoint. Each one of them is a tiny masterpiece, a succinct elucidation of not just what makes a good old school dungeon but also what distinguishes the Old Ways from the new.\"\nGameKnight Reviews: \"Curtis came up with some very unique (and humorous) tables, such as the one for Books. For example, one special property is \u201cBook is enchanted to prevent theft.

Where this book really shines is that in its descriptions of each element it is an inspiration for creating your own elements. In this way the book serves a dual purpose, doubling its value.\"\nDungeon Fantastic: \"This is a book I wish I'd written, and I'm sorry I took so long to find it and buy it. Outstanding stuff, and any dungeon fantasy GM (from OD&D DMs to GURPS DF GMs) can make use of this. It's better for a class-and-level, gold-and-dungeons game, but it'll work for any variation of fantasy world underground delving for treasure. Highly recommended.\"\nThe Drunk Umber Hulk: \"What I love about this book is not just that you get all kinds of fun tables and charts to roll on, it really ignites your imagination and gives you so many ideas and suggestions that can make your dungeon unique and varied. \"\nTenkar's Tavern: \"If you don't have a copy, you probably should.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGoodman Games has run more than a dozen Kickstarters.
