[{"backer": "Echo Chernik", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " ALL OF YOU ARE AMAZING!\nWe cannot thank you enough for supporting us and this incredible kickstarter! We will do our best to continue to make an even more amazing world for you to enjoy!\n\n~John and Rae\nIf you\u2019re into art, cuddling, and adorable things, but also delight in the unexpected, this Kickstarter is for you.\nBack this Kickstarter and we will send you beautiful, First Edition Tentacle Kitty designer plushies. We\u2019ve created two new designs for our original 8 inch-Tentacle Kitty, as well as new plushies for some of the most iconic characters from the Tentacle Kitty comic. All of which you can proudly display, or cuddle, or cuddle and display. \nWhat is Tentacle Kitty? Tentacle Kitty is a kitty from another dimension. She just happens to have tentacles. She also has her own webcomic about her interdimensional adventures, which you can read here:\nTentacle Kitty Webcomic  \nWhat is special about our plushies? Some artists paint on canvas, others sculpt in clay. We create art through our plush. Not only are every one of our plushies a Limited Edition work of art, but they are also high quality and huggably soft. We like to call it art you can hug.\nWe\u2019ve pushed ourselves to create more epic designs year after year, and this newest Kickstarter is our most incredible yet. We hope you love our new plushies as much as we do.\n~Love John and Rae\nIt\u2019s easy! To get the plush, simply back the project and pick your reward. By backing, you pre-order First Edition Tentacle Kitty plush for a special, backer-exclusive price, and you will be able to choose goodies that are exclusively for this Kickstarter.\nWant additional plush or goodies? Check our ADD-ONS section at the bottom of the page to customize your reward. If you have any questions, head over to the FAQ.\nTentacle Kitty and her friends travel from dimension to dimension. Over time they have run into some rather interesting things. We would like to create some of those interesting things in plush form! Let\u2019s take a look at them, shall we?\nOh. Did I mention that the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth on the Cat-O-Lantern GLOW IN THE DARK?! Cuz they do.\nBoth kitties were created during our previous Kickstarters with the \u201cDesign Your Own TK Plush\u201d reward tier. They were so popular that we decided we\u2019d like to take them to production.\nWith a little begging, we were given the go-ahead from the backers who originally commissioned them. Now you will be able to get one, too!\n*Exclusive Backer Pricing $30 during the Kickstarter, will be $35 after.\n\n*Tentacle Kitty stands 8\" tall, 13\" from tip of ear to tip of the tentacle.\nTentacle Kitty\u2019s favorite food.  \nComes in three delicious colors. (Delicious to Tentacle Kitty, of course.) \nSmell like Cotton Candy. (Unscented version available.)\nWhen startled Cotton Candy Mice freeze and stiffen up, and look exactly like cotton candy on a stick.\nTentacle Kitty likes to pop them in her mouth, swish, and pop them right back out once their \u201cfloss\u201d (fur) dissolves. The mouse scampers off unharmed in its skivvies, leaving a happy Tentacle Kitty behind.\nWe are not responsible for any zombie outbreaks that may occur as a result of Cotton Candy Mice infestation. Also, even though these smell delicious, please do not eat them.\n*Cotton Candy Mice are 5\" long from nose to the tip of the tail.\nTentacle Kitty's grandpa, Cat Guru, came to Earth long ago but got horrible allergies. When he said his name it came out as \u201cCthulhu!\u201d... It was a HUGE misunderstanding.\n*Exclusive Backer Pricing: $45 during the campaign, will be $50 after.\n\n*From tip of ear to tip of longest Tentacle, Cat Guru is 28\" long.\nFabulous and Glorious\nRat Tailed Unicorns are interdimensional vermin. They pop into other people\u2019s dimensions and set up hives. These pests gather materials by poking holes in foundations, radiators, and stop signs.\nSure, they are pests-but they're so fabulous and glorious, does it really matter?\n*The Giant Rat Tailed Unicorn Plush is 13\" tall and 30\" from tip of horn to tip of tail.\nDo you want to add a Pirate Kitty to your reward?\nSee Add-Ons Section or FAQs.\nIf your reward tier has an 8 inch kitty already, at the end of the Kickstarter the survey will include an option to pick from the 4 different 8 inch kitties.\n*Exclusive Backer Pricing: $30 during the campaign, will be $35 after.\n**Design Your Own TK Plush Tier and above will receive one Pirate Kitty along with the rest of their rewards.\n                                                                                                                    What's in it?

We\u2019ve made it our mission to design original, high-quality, designer plushies since 2011. In the process, we have become one of the most popular indie plush brands at pop-culture conventions around the country.\nOur plush popularity has not gone unnoticed. We\u2019ve been commissioned to create exclusive designs for several conventions, including Emerald City Comic Con 2015, Emerald City Comic Con 2018, Denver Comic Con, Comicpalooza, and now New York Comic Con.\nWe have also worked with Dark Horse Comics to create a 96-page coloring book. Check it out here: Tentacle Kitty Coloring Book\nNote from John:\nWhen I created Tentacle Kitty for Rae, I had no clue that it would wind up being my career. Seven years in and I don\u2019t regret choosing this path. What keeps me going is the look on Rae\u2019s face when she cuddles a Tentacle Kitty, laughs at a comic, or lights up when I make something new.\nOn top of that, seeing all the fans of Tentacle Kitty, and those who are not yet fans, squee in excitement from seeing her at conventions\u2014it makes everything that much more satisfying. I especially enjoy the criers. I watch as they are overwhelmed by the pure cuteness of Tentacle Kitty and her friends. It's fun.\nAnyway, thanks for joining us on our continued adventures with Tentacle Kitty. I hope that we can brighten your life with TK, just as much as it has brightened ours.\nLove, John\nNote from Raena:\nI never thought that I would grow up to make plushies. As a child, it would have easily been one of my top three dream jobs, but as an adult? I never imagined it would be my destiny.\nWhen I was a kiddo, I had a HUMONGOUS collection of stuffed animals. I remember my mom keeping them in a refrigerator box, and one of my greatest joys was tipping it over and watching them tumble out, creating a mountain of colors and cuddliness. I would build a fortress out of them, complete with a protective wall, and act out all types of stories.\nAs I grew older, I gifted many of my beloved plushies to the people whom I loved the most. It was like giving them a piece of myself, and to this day I still feel that happiness in my heart when I think about it.\nWhen John created the illustrated version of Tentacle Kitty for me as a gift, I knew that I needed it in a plush. Thanks to ThinkGeek and family, we were able to make that dream a reality. Thanks to all of you, we have been able to grow and expand on that original design.\nSince John created Tentacle Kitty, we have built a world for her, including other characters and a story. I can honestly say I am living my truth, and I am excited to share it with you.\nLove, Rae\n Special Thanks: Jennifer, Kaelley, Stephen, Vikki, Natalie, and our Patrons!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHere at Tentacle Kitty, we have been producing plushies for more than six years. We are confident in what we have designed, as they have had lots of real world hugging... errrr, \u201ctesting.\u201d\n\nThe two main risks for this Kickstarter are unexpected delays in manufacturing or shipping. With a project of this size, customs can sometimes also cause delays in shipping. If the project is highly successful, materials could also take longer for our manufacturer to obtain, although larger orders usually mean faster production. Overseas holidays can also cause a delay in either shipping or manufacturing.\n\nHowever, we have completed 2 successful Kickstarters and are working with established manufacturers with whom we have worked many times, so we anticipate a smooth roll out. \n\nIn any case, we will always keep everyone updated with all stages of production and shipping. \n\nWe are also always available through Facebook (www.facebook.com/TentacleKitty), and Twitter (@TentacleKitty).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Little One Mystery Bag Series 1", "descp": "What's inside?

Each a legend within the gaming industry, these Titans are responsible for such wildly popular games as Magic: The Gathering, King of Tokyo, Shadowrun, MechWarrior, HeroClix, Quarriors!, Risk Legacy, and many more.\nNow Calliope Games is harnessing the talents of the Titans to create games you can play with anyone, regardless of age or skill level. Not only will you be able to play Titan games with your regular gaming group, but your friends and family\u2014who might rarely touch a die\u2014will also love playing them!\nBy popular demand each backer at the Muse, Titan, and Mt. Olympus levels will now receive games printed with exclusive Kickstarter box art.\nWe\u2019ll be releasing a minimum of nine gateway games over the next three years. Once per year a package of three games you helped create will be delivered to your doorstep. Though each game is expected to retail for approximately $30, backers of this Kickstarter can get them for just $16 each. As an added benefit, you won\u2019t have to wait for the games to arrive to enjoy them\u2014you\u2019ll be an integral part of the creation process: honing rules sets, choosing art and art styles, identifying themes, and voting on game titles and character names. As a backer, you\u2019ll get the opportunity to help shape different parts of the series all along the way.\nThe Titans are already hard at work crafting these tabletop experiences. Our goal is to offer games that fall within different categories: a party game, a word game, a worker placement game, a light strategy game, a dice game, a game of luck, a card game, and more. We anticipate releasing the first set of games within 12 months of the Kickstarter funding. Current games include:\nZach & Jordan Weisman: This clever worker placement game finds players carefully bidding to earn items and vying for prestige. Bluffing and deduction come into play as prices for needed items are driven up by competitors. Players must decide when to go after items and when to profit off the actions of other players. The player to score the highest ranking sets at the end of the game wins!\nPaul Peterson: This unique risk management game challenges players to carefully maneuver their dice from one side of the board to the other, where locations of different point values await. Players move and manage dice along passageways according to their rolls, all while trying to stay on the best path. Event cards provide even more excitement by helping or hindering players\u2019 movement. Navigate the board, risk dice along the way and gain victory points at the end of each round. The player with the most points at the end of three rounds wins!\nRichard Garfield: How well can you link minds with your fellow players? This hilarious, thought-provoking party game invites players to think as one when responding to queries. Players receive points for responding the same way as other players\u2014regardless of whether the other players provide a correct response. The players with the fewest points receive strikes \u2013 collect enough strikes and the game ends!\nEach of the games is intended for adults, but will be accessible by children as young as 8. Most games will support 2-6 players (sometimes up to 8), play in 60 minutes or less, and be packaged in boxes similar to our previously released games Tsuro (9\"x9\"x2\") or Tsuro of the Seas (9.5\"x9.5\"x3\").\nOur plan is to release games by Eric Lang, Seth Johnson, and Mike Selinker in year two. Games by Mike Elliott, Rob Daviau, and Mike Mulvihill will follow in year three. Beyond that, we\u2019ll see where our stretch goals take us!\n\u201cWhat I really enjoy about tabletop games is how each time you play through a game, it\u2019s a unique experience. It\u2019s not just who wins and who loses, but what happens along the way, and the stories of those games that are told for years afterward.\u201d\n\u2014Seth Johnson, Titan Series game designer\nLegends within the tabletop gaming industry, our Titans are what make this project so exciting. Chances are you\u2019re already familiar with their work; they\u2019ve provided us with some of the most successful hobby games ever produced, including the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Smash Up, Brave New World, and Kill Doctor Lucky.

Please email customerservice@calliopegames.com to find out how the Titans Series can support you.\nKickstarter exists to support and fund creative projects. It is a platform where dreams are made reality; where those launching creative endeavors can access a community with similar interests that can assist in bringing recognition to and raising funds for a project. Many times, traditional funding for these projects is inaccessible due to risk, lack of experience, knowledge, or simply not having access to the right banks and/or angel investor.\nThe Titan Series is a creative project. We have some of the game industry\u2019s most creative minds all agreeing to design gateway games for us\u2014games they don't typically have the opportunity to do. We also have extraordinary artists willing to help bring these games to life. It\u2019s important to note here that Calliope is not utilizing Kickstarter as pre-order system for finished games; we actually need the funding to make the Titan Series possible. As an added benefit to our backers, Kickstarter provides a platform to keep early adopters (you) engaged in the design process. We'll provide you with a unique opportunity to view and participate in the development of the games through updates, surveys, and interviews. The end result will be games that you, your family, and your friends can play long after the Kickstarter has finished.\nWith your support, we can bring the Titan Series to fruition and expand the gaming community. You\u2019ve helped us before by backing Tsuro of the Seas and Roll For It!\u2014both award-winning titles that have earned a place on Wil Wheaton\u2019s TableTop, along with our award-winning game Tsuro. Please help us continue our quest to make great games by pledging to the Titan Series Kickstarter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Titan Series is similar to a Kickstarter project for a digital game. We have solid game mechanics and the talent to bring the games together; however, the code is not complete. We feel the Titans' skills and our experience make this a very feasible project. Like all game production, time and scheduling may slip due to extended playtest periods, art creation, and editing.\n\nThe biggest foreseeable risks relate to manufacturing and shipping. These can be minimized by leveraging existing relationships with experienced factories, which are familiar with our procedures and standards of quality. Our shipping needs are handled by world-class freight forwarder Sentek International. We expect to be able to anticipate most issues and react nimbly to mitigate them.\n\nWe\u2019re also experienced enough to know that unforeseen issues sometimes crop up.

Here is the pretty-much final list of what you can add to your pledge:\nLas Cabezas Mexican Restaurant deck: $10\nLong Wok Chinese Restaurant deck: $10\nGhicciaroni's Italian Buffet Restaurant Deck: $10\nZombie Pairs Deck A LotF-themed Pairs deck: $10\nMcPubihan's Irish Pub deck: $10 (Huzzah!)\nIf you back at the $5 level or higher, you can add these decks to your pledge for $10 each. \nMore decks should be unlocking soon, so please check our final list before the campaign closes at 8:00 PM Pacific Friday April 3! See the Stretch Goals section below for more info.\nYou can add money to your pledge now, or you can do it through the pledge manager at After the Crowd, shortly after the campaign ends.\nAbout the Game:\nYou're a Zombie working in a fast food joint, and you must build combo meals from a hand of random ingredients. That's the deal in Lord of the Fries, one of Cheapass Games' most beloved games. \nFormat: Card Game\nPlayers: 3 to 8\nPlaying Time: 10 Minutes per hand\nContents: Two 55-card decks, 1 die, rules, and three menus.\nLord of the Fries was introduced in 1998 as the sequel to Give Me the Brain. It has had several versions since then, and now it's out of print. We want to make the new edition better in many ways, including a second complete restaurant deck: McFrye's Coffee Shop.\nBut that's just the beginning. If we raise enough, we will be able to create more restaurant decks as stand-alone expansions. If we raise just a little, we can pay for just the art, and make it available online. If we raise a little more, we can print these decks and sell them alongside the core game. \nIf we unlock the printed decks (the first one unlocks at just $50k), you'll also be able to add them to your pledge shortly after the campaign ends. Read all about it below.\nWhat do you receive for supporting this game? The game, of course! We also have some Kickstarter-exclusive goodies to tempt you, as well as some other games in the Friedey's family.\n$5: The Small Fry. You're just here to support the project and make sure we hit our stretch goals. Thanks! Lord of the Fries will ship to game stores shortly after we finish shipping the backer rewards, so you can buy the game at your favorite local game shop shortly after we print it. Like all the levels below, this level makes you eligible to add the expansion decks, even if you don't get the core game.\n$30: The Cowabunga. You'll get a copy of Lord of the Fries, along with a decorative Friedey's logo sticker, and whatever other freebies we conjure up. (Such as the Kublai and Jolene trading cards, described below.) The core game contains both the original menu and the new Coffee Shop deck. Note: there is now a Double Cowabunga level, which has two copies of the game, for $55.\n$35: The Cheezabunga. Are you collecting our coins? This level includes a copy of the game, plus a new Lord of the Fries Collector Coin. This is a 39mm metal coin, with artwork from the game on the front, and the Cheapass Games logo on the back. It's made by our friends at Campaign Coins. (See the example image below.) Note: there is now a Double Cheezabunga level, which has two Lord of the Fries games and two coins, for $65.\n$45: The Sierra Madre. For those who love buried treasure, this level includes the game, the coin, and a copy of the 2006 game Dead Money. It's a Friedey's game set in the Old West, a cross between Poker and Give Me the Brain, where you're racing to get knocked out of a poker tournament. Dead Money won't be reprinted, so levels that include this game are limited by our stock on hand.\n$55: The Frying Dutchman. If you'd like just the games and none of the extras, this is the level for you. Just a copy of Lord of the Fries (and the sticker; everybody gets that), plus a copy of its sister game, Give Me the Brain. This is the new edition of Give Me the Brain, released in March 2015.\n$75: The Meat Munch. Give me everything! This level includes everything from the Sierra Madre (Fries, Coin, and Dead Money) as well as a copy of Give Me the Brain and its associated Collector Coin. Again, this level is limited because of Dead Money, but we've been balancing the limits to try to accommodate demand. Note: there is now a Double Meat Munch level, called the Carnexplosion, with twice the rewards of the Meat Munch, for $145.\n$250: Master Chef. Would you like a little piece of the game? Backers at the Master Chef level receive everything from the Meat Munch, plus one piece of Brian Snoddy's original line art. This level is limited to the number of new cards we unlock, so it started at just seven (the Coffee Shop menu). The limit will grow by eight more pieces with every menu we unlock. We will ultimately decide which piece of art you get, but we will try to accommodate requests, giving priority to earlier backers.\nCoin Preview: Here's a sneak peek at the design for the Lord of the Fries coin, along with a photo of the Give Me the Brain coins. We are considering giving the new coin a different finish, perhaps something silvery. All our collector coins are 39mm (that's the diameter of a poker chip). \nWe expect to ship all these rewards by September, just in time for our Fall campaign, the 20th anniversary edition of Kill Doctor Lucky.\nUpdate 4/2/15: All of the game art is officially unlocked, so we've simplified the stretch goals below to reflect only the printed decks. \nIf the deck is unlocked, we will print the expansion deck at the same time as the game, which means you can add it to your pledge. If it is showing as locked, we have paid for the art, but we can't afford to mass-produce the decks just yet. We will print the new decks as time and money allow, and release them to retail stores, but In the meantime we'll make them available from DriveThruCards.\nEach deck below will be self-contained playable by itself, with a unique menu (and variant rule) for up to 6 players. It will also have a second menu for up to 8 players, using cards from the core game. Over time, we hope to create more \"fusion\" menus for combining different expansions. But that depends on which ones get made.\nNote that the restaurant names and details below are not at all final. \n$25k (Unlocked): McFrye's Coffee House: This deck was always unlocked, because it's part of the core game. The Coffee House contains all new art (seven new ingredients) and a menu that uses a new coffee drink randomizer in Zone 1.\nThe core game will also contain a third menu for up to 8 players, using ingredients from both decks. There's a short discussion of what that menu might be in Update #9.\n$50k (Unlocked): Las Cabezas Mexican Restaurant. Join the cast of Friedey's at Las Cabezas. Build dishes like the Mask of Zorro (Cheese), the Rotten Burro (Cow, Pork, and Red Stuff), or the Conquest of Paradise (Three Chickens).\n$58k (Unlocked): Kublai Trading Card: A freebie for all levels (except the Small Fry), this is a Kickstarter-exclusive Button Men trading card with new art of Kublai. Learn more about Button Men here.\n$60k (Unlocked): Friedey's Long Wok. Taste the exotic at the Long Wok. Build dishes like Chicken Spicy Noodle, Hot Chicken Spicy Noodle, and Spicy Noodle Chicken.\n$63k (Unlocked): Jolene Trading Card: Like Kublai, Jolene will be a free Kickstarter-exclusive Button Men trading card, included in all levels except the Small Fry. (Actually, if you back at the Small Fry level and add any decks to your order, you will also get the two trading cards. We're not monsters.)\n$70k (Unlocked): Ghicciaroni's Italian Buffet. Taste the Old Country at the Italian Buffet. Grab some Cowabungini, some Sheep wit' da Fishes, or some Penne for Your Tots.\n$75k (Unlocked): Lord of the Pairs: This is a Pairs deck featuring card art from Lord of the Fries. Pairs is our \"New Classic Pub Game,\" described in detail in Update #16. Like the other expansion decks, the Zombie Pairs Deck will be available as an add-on for $10.\n$80k (Unlocked): McPubihan's. Welcome to Friedey's Irish Pub, with drinks and pub grub to satisfy your every need. Try the Irish Breakfast, the Just Barley Soup, or the Brown Stuff in a Pot. We went ahead and unlocked this bonus deck at $79.2k with only 60 minutes to go!\n$90k: The Early Bird Cafe. Rise with the sun and get what's coming to you at Friedey's Early Bird Cafe. Breakfast meats, hot coffee, and maybe even some pie.\n$100k: Les Cinq Heures, French Cuisine. Chef McFrye invites you to sit back, relax, and enjoy your time at Les Cinq Heures. Enjoy les meats, les escargots, and les vins as you draw in the atmosphere of La Belle France.\n$110k: Carnespadas Brazilian Grill. Do you like meat, swords, and fire? Because we have nothing else. Settle down for an all-you-can-eat feast of bacon-wrapped everything at Carnespadas.\n$120k: Yum Yum Super Fish Delicious. The staff of Friedey's have taken over the restaurant from Fish Cook. You'll serve up some fine Japanese cuisine like Stars of Quid Meat with Egg, Three-Fish Soup, and Eel with Plastic Vegetable Garnish. (We won't copy that menu exactly, but you get the idea.)\nCan we do all this? No, but we're going to get as close as we can. Tell all your friends about Lord of the Fries!\nHow Will I Get The New Decks?\nA few days after this campaign closes, we'll send you a link to our pledge manager at After the Crowd. You'll need to go there to give us your shipping information, and you will also have the chance to add any of the bonus decks that we've unlocked. The decks (including the Pairs deck) will be $10 each, plus shipping if you are outside the US.\nIf you feel sure that your favorite decks will be unlocked, you can add extra money to your Kickstarter pledge to drive our total higher. Or you can wait and do it through After the Crowd. Either way is fine with us!\nCheapass Games is a small game company in Seattle, specializing in low-cost, casual tabletop games.

Since then we have published more than 100 board, card, and dice games, many of which you can download for free at cheapass.com.\nThis is our sixth Kickstarter campaign. We have launched a mix of deluxe reprints and original games, including Pairs, which raised more than $300k in 2014, and was one of the best-reviewed games of the year.\nJames Ernest is the lead designer for Cheapass Games, and has also published games through most major hobby game publishers. Lord of the Fries also has contributions from Toivo Rovainen and Rick Fish.\nBrian Snoddy is a world-renowned illustrator best known for his work on Magic: the Gathering. He has been with the Friedey's games since the beginning, illustrating every edition of every game. \nNate Taylor is our colorist, tackling all the new artwork (and possibly touching up the originals as well). Nate illustrated two Pairs decks for us last year, and he's an exceptional all-around artistic talent.\nWe can't make games without you, so thanks for your support.\nFor more information and news about Cheapass Games, here are all the many places you can look:\nSubscribe to Shameless, our bi-monthly newsletter.\nFollow Cheapass Games on Twitter (@cheapassgames)\nFollow James Ernest on Twitter (@cheapassjames) or Tumblr (@prettybigif)\nVisit our double-secret website at cheapass.com.\nAlso, check out this new How to Play video.

Once taken Loki could not escape the might of Thor's great strength. Odin used his magic to turn Loki's son Vali into a wolf, who killed his brother Nari. Loki was taken beneath the earth and placed on 3 stones. Holes were made in the center of each stone, and Odin used Nari's guts, threaded through the center of the stones, to bind Loki.\nSkadi, goddess of winter and former lover of Loki, was so angered by his betrayal of the Gods that she placed a venomous snake above Loki's head. The snake dripped its poison into Loki's face causing him to shake the earth in pain. His only solace was his faithful wife Sigyn who collected the poison in a bowl, but it would grow full and need to be emptied, causing Loki to writhe in pain yet again.\nUPDATE 2 - Here is my drawing for the piece:\nProcess\nHere are some process images from the other paintings in the series:\n\"Odin's Secrets\" Process\n\"Yule Spirits\" Process\nWhy Norse Mythology\nI've always had a love for Norse Myth since I first read the Prose Edda 15 years ago. As I've continued to research the Norse Myths I marveled to learn that the same Gods were worshiped from the Isles of Britain across Northern Europe all the way to Ancient Russia. If you have any european heritage these are the stories of your ancestors. That only made me love these stories more! I feel that it's important for me to bring these ancient stories to life through my art in hopes that others will fall in love with them too!\nWhy Kickstarter\nBy funding this project through Kickstarter I will be able to set aside the proper amount of time in my schedule to make more personal art. You get the benefit of cool artwork from me, and I get the benefit of time to paint what I love! Thank you!\nRewards\nStretch Goals\n$5,000 - Every backer at $29 or more will get a \"Freyr's Last Stand\" postcard.

You know you're the only one who loves the Demons enough to witness their creation.  For this chunk of change you get all FOUR DEMONS with their harnesses and name tags AND the custom backpack AND every single concept sketch, drawing, doodle and printout that was used in the creation of the plush Demons.\nNext is the big question....how do you get your very own Demon?  First we need to get 3000 (750 of each) out of quarantine (have them made)! \nIn order to do that I need to raise $25,080!  GAH...that's a lot of money!  Just think of all the Demons who will cease to be homeless though!\nWhat's that you say?  What happens if you're EXTRA generous? Well, that's easy!  We'll get even MORE Demons out of quarantine.\nThese levels *may* be even less than what I've posted.  The more we get the cheaper it is!\nTHE REAL DEAL\nAll humor aside, here's the actual low down.  Since September, I have been working closely with Chris Gann of Gann Memorials to make my dream of stuffed animals of the Demons a reality.  I created detailed concept sketches and have worked with Gann every step of the way to ensure that the plushes will meet and exceed my expectation.\nI currently have, in hand, the prototypes and Gann Memorials is working on the final finished versions as I type this.  The ultimate goal of this project is to raise $25,080 so that we may produce 750 of each of 4 designs so that all of my fans may enjoy a little Demon of their own.  Each and every plush that is produced will be manufactured with all new materials and meet all safety standards and will have tags stating as such.\nHopefully, if all goes well, and I am able to raise the funds needed, the full order of 3000 plush Demons will arrive at my house in 60-80 days from when I put in my order (the end of my Kickstarter).  Once the finished product arrives, I will begin to mail out everyone's packages.  All packages mailed within the United States will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail and will come with a tracking number.  All International packages will be shipped via USPS First Class International and I will supply you with a customs number.\nAnyone who donates to the pledge levels that consist of art prints and deckbackers will receive their packages shortly after the project ends.  All prints are printed on archival paper with archival inks from my Epson R1900 printer.  All prints will come signed, and sealed in an acid free bag with a backing board.  Deckbackers will be printed with the same quality materials as the prints and will also arrive sealed in an acid free bag.\nIn the exciting event that we meet and even surpass the goal I have discussed with Gann Memorials the possibility of adding additional characters.  As all designs for all Demons are very similar this will be easy to accomplish.  As stated in the stretch goals or \"Quarantine Levels\" as I call them, each new stretch goal will unlock a new Demon design.  As these are unlocked, I will add them to the list of pledges so that you may be the first to get your hands on one.  These may take a few months longer to ship as we'll still need to make the prototypes and have them approved.\nFear not though, I will keep everyone posted about everything every step of the way!\nThank you all so much for looking over my project and I hope you'll consider giving me your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I know all of you are as excited as I am to have a Demon of your very own, don't forget that this is ALL OR NOTHING!! If I DO NOT meet my goal, none of these will be produced. \n\nIf that happens we'll all be forced to cry ourselves to sleep and nobody wants that.\n\nFor this project, I already have the initial 4 prototypes in hand and the final ones are being created as I type this. Once my project is successful and I have reached my goal, the full run of all of all of the plush will be completed and in hand in 60-80 days. If I'm so lucky as to reach any of my stretch (Quarantine goals), these additions should be able to be produced in a fairly quick manner as the basic body type is exactly the same as the first four.\n\nI will do my best to keep everyone updated if there are any delays and to announce as soon as I have the plushes in hand!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #58", "update_userinfo": "Last week of Lil' Squidy Campaign, 5/6 unlocked!", "update_content": "Greetings everyone!\nI'm heading into the very last week of my Lil' Squidy Plush Kickstarter campaign, and am doing my last push for backers.\n5 Plush are unlocked with one to go.

Ken Whitman, a friend of mine, had tried to talk me into doing a Kickstarter campaign several years ago, because many times I had spoken to him about doing a big hardback book that would cover my life's work. Then another friend, Jim Ludwig of DarkSword Miniatures, started calling me about Kickstarter.\nWhen I crunched the numbers, for me to publish a big book on my own dime, I simply couldn't afford it. I had certain publishers approach me to do a big book during the past few years....they would publish it, and of course, make all the money. But I wanted to do it my way. I never had a real agent during my career, I never particularly cared for someone telling me what to do (art directors were enough), so I have done it all my way the best I could. With an agent, I may have made more money over the years, perhaps done covers of \"bigger books\" and maybe, more popularity could have come my way, I don't know... I wanted to paint and draw. I just kept working and never ran out of work.\nI was worried about this Kickstarter project, I didn't want to be the first guy to loose money on Kickstarter :-) . I was hesitant on the whole deal. I knew I had fans out there, because I have attend a lot of conventions over the past 25 years, but I didn't really know just how many and I didn't know just how strong and true they were. It really takes your most dedicated \"hardcore\" fans to pull off a project like this. I didn't know if there were that many---\"left\". Even though I still paint every day if possible and I will paint and draw until I die.\nI basically got out of the publishing world a few years ago and lately I have been painting my own work and selling the originals. I love it. But I know that many fans have missed my work being published on books and game covers. I guess some of you thought I had \"retired\"!!! Well, I haven't! I never will. I worked as an illustrator for over 40 years, now I am ready to do my own work. I will still be around, while you sleep, I will be painting and drawing, and I will continue to do that until it becomes physically or mentally impossible for me. In the future, I will publish books of my newer works, both paintings and drawings, I will continue to make prints of these pieces, available at my website.\nWell anyway, this campaign was greatly successful ONLY because of you guys. The MAIN reason I am writing this is to THANK ALL MY FANS...all over the world!! My family and I thank each and every one of you from the bottom of our hearts, I am seriously overwhelmed. I think my family didn't have a clue that this would happen, they are just as surprised as I am. Now, I have \"pad money\" ... and that means this, when I try to do a painting every month to pay the bills, and if that painting takes me a month and a half or two months to finish, I will have \" pad money\" to carry me over until I get paid. And that, my friends, takes a load of stress off me, and frees my mind up to do more creative work.\nI am planning other Kickstarter Campaigns later on, some special books, like a NEW color Snarfquest graphic novel, and we are working on card games and board games, which I am greatly involved in. One of the most important projects, that may go up on Kickstarter next year, will be a large hardback black and white book. I wanted to get all my black and white work in this book, but there was no way...the book would be TOO thick. So, I want to do another hardback of all my black and white art, pencils and inks. The black and white book will be a matching book to this hard back color book. If you have purchased this color book and you purchase the black and white book, you will have a matching set of hardback books that cover around 95% of my life's work.\nAgain, I Sincerely thank each and every one of you ALL your support in this Kickstarter campaign, not only for this campaign, but THANK YOU for supporting me through all those years of fun and games that covered most of our lives!!! Did you ever think we would all come together one more time? I love you all!!!\nLarry Elmore\nELMORE ADD-ONS\nADD-ON #1: Add $25 to your pledge and get a Dragon Doodle in front of your book. This is a FREE add on to everyone in a foreign county.\nADD-ON #2: Add $100 to your pledge and you can get a 24\"x36\" Limited Edition print of the cover of this art book. It will be limited to 250+ the number of fans that participate here on Kickstarter. Many of you know, I have not painted the cover yet, but I do believe there will be a DRAGON on the cover.\nADD-ON #3: Want a second hardback book? Just add $49 extra to your pledge and we will send you a second book (however, it will not have all the extra stretch goal rewards). There is no additional shipping for a second book. (International FANS, we love you too!)\nExample: Just go in and increase your pledge, we will figure out what you get based on your pledge minus your reward!\nUSA FANS (Example) -------------------------------------------------\n$49-----FAN PACKAGE\n$74-----FAN PACKAGE + DRAGON DOODLE (DD)\n$98-----FAN PACKAGE + 2nd BOOK\n$123----FAN PACKAGE + DD + 2nd BOOK\n$149---FAN PACKAGE + LE COVER PRINT\n$174---FAN PACKAGE + DD+ LE COVER PRINT\n$198---FAN PACKAGE + LE COVER PRINT + 2nd BOOK\n$223---FAN PACKAGE + DD + LE COVER PRINT + 2nd BOOK\nINTERNATIONAL FANS  (Example)-----------------------------\n$97-----FAN PACKAGE + DRAGON DOODLE (DD)**\n$146---FAN PACKAGE + DD + 2nd BOOK\n$197---FAN PACKAGE + DRAGON DOODLE + LE COVER PRINT\n$246---FAN PACKAGE + DD + LE COVER PRINT+ 2nd BOOK\n**International FANS will automatically get a DRAGON DOODLE at no additional cost as a bonus for the additional cost of shipping.\nYour Fantasy Begins here!\nI want to make available, through this project, the largest, most comprehensive collection of the very best of my art spanning my full 40 year career.  Many of the images I will include in this tome are being re-mastered using the latest digital technology from original film, for unprecedented quality, and several pieces have never before been published or rarely seen.  Interspersed among the images I will also offer you glimpses into my studio and creative process, including sketches and preliminaries, as well as share with you my autobiography, my artistic journey, and my stories.  I will start from my earliest childhood drawings, and together we will journey through my challenges breaking into the industry and frustrations with commercial art, through my years working in games and on novel covers and ultimately to my latest personal works.\nThis hardback book will be 9\" x 12\" and encompass 300+ pages.  Depending on your pledge amount you can own this book as a standard coffee-table hardback edition, or a deluxe leather-bound cover edition, as well as other bonuses, such as special prints, original hand-drawn sketches, or even the original painting used for the cover itself!  Most importantly, you are helping me realize my dream of bringing this volume to you, my fans.  Thank you in advance for your pledge!\nThis kickstarter project is going unbelievably well and I am overwhelmed. I want to do more stretch goals, and believe me we have been wracking our brains. But I had an idea; I have a lot of paintings and many of them have never left my studio, the originals have never been seen, and hardly anyone has had an opportunity to purchase one. I feel that they are too much trouble to take to conventions and also more likely get damaged. In the old days every painting made a trip to the publisher in New York and after it was published they would send the painting back. When it returned I would usually put the painting on a shelf in my studio or in a flat file. Now days I drive my paintings to Nashville for a professional scan and when I get back put them either on a shelf or in a flat file. So why not put some of these paintings up for sale because so many fans of my art are following this project and everyone would have an equal chance at purchasing an original painting. I have selected 12 paintings to sell; we will keep three available for purchase at all times until they are all sold or this kickstarter project is over. We are still trying to come up with new stretch goals and want to sincerely thank everyone for the fantastic support of this project!!!\n\nSPECIAL: This Kickstarter campaign has been unbelievable, over whelming. So I decided to do one more special for everyone that is interested in original paintings. Since this campaign has been underway, many people have called me about buying original paintings. I think what surprised people most is that I have sold so many paintings over the years. Many of those iconic pieces are gone. I was never interested in hoarding all my paintings, I would always sell paintings at a reasonable price, because my favorite painting was always my next one! These paintings I am displaying here on kickstarter are some of the \"few\" that I have left to sell. I have saved some paintings to pass on to my children. Over the next 14 days, I have decided to lower the prices on these paintings $100 each day, until this Kickstarter campaign ends on December the 31st. If they sell, then I hope they find a good home, if not, I will keep them, just a few more paintings my children will have to deal with when I am gone....hopefully many years from now :)\nWANT TO SEE LARGER VERSIONS....\nThe Last Ingredient : http://larryelmore.com/lastin\nThree Doors: http://larryelmore.com/threedoors\nMight & Magic 8:  http://larryelmore.com/mightmagic\nUnexpected return: http://larryelmore.com/unreturn\nFrost Giant: http://larryelmore.com/frostgiant  \nKing Author: http://larryelmore.com/kingauthor\nPLACE OF POWER PRINTS\nThe more we raise with this campaign, the better we can make this art book. We are still negotiating with our printers to get the best price on additional pages and extras, but your support will make them all possible. Once the Kickstarter program is over, the Hardback book will sale for $80. \nHere is the curent retail value of our current stretch goals...\nStretch Goal 1: 48 Additional Pages If there is enough interest in this project, I would like to expand the book to 304 pages. This will give me more room to add more obscure paintings, more preliminary works and other black and white artwork. If pledges exceed thirty thousand, all contributors will receive a 304 page book rather than only 256 pages. COMPLETED\nStretch Goal 2: 8\"x10\" D&D Original Box Set Covers  As a special thank you to my fans, should funding exceed fifty thousand dollars, I will include three 8\" x 10\" print of one of my most remembered painting series--the Basic Dungeons & Dragons Red Dragon box cover, the Expert Dungeons & Dragons Blue box cover, and the Companions Dungeon & Dragons Green box-- in every contributor's package. COMPLETED\nStretch Goal 3: B&W Sketch Book  As an added bonus for achieving the one Seventy-five thousand dollar mark, I am going to bind together a soft cover black & white sketchbook that will include copies of all the original drawings I will be doing as inserts for this project and a few extra no one has ever seen. Everyone who has contributed from the Fan Package on up will receive a copy of this book in their package. I am so very grateful to you all for making my 40 year compendium a reality! COMPLETED\nStretch Goal 4: 8\"x10\" Original Dragonlance Covers  Once we hit one hundred thousand, I will include three limited edition 8\" x 10\" prints of the three original Dragonlance Book covers -- Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, Dragons of Spring Dawning -- in every contributor's package. COMPLETED\nStretch Goal 5: Motorcycle Ride & Studio Tour As an added bonus for achieving the one hundred twenty-five thousand dollar mark, I plan to have a studio tour and motorcycle ride in my hometown of Leitchfield Kentucky. I will send each you a ticket to bring one guest sometime during the summer of 2013. You will have a chance to walk through my studio and time to talk with me. Later in the afternoon everyone with a motorcycle is welcome to take a long ride with me through the foothills of Kentucky. If you do not have a motorcycle, you are still welcome to come and enjoy the studio tour. (Contributors would be responsible for their own travel arrangements, overnight stay, gas, etc.)\nStretch Goal 6: 32 Additional Pages will round this book out to a whopping 336 pages. If pledges exceed two hundred thousand, all contributors will receive a 336 page book rather than the expanded 304 pages.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nChallenges:\nThe greatest challenge I am facing with this project is the re-mastering and color-correcting of all my older works from the film the images are preserved on. Don't get me wrong, the quality of color will be phenominal and as close to the originals as I can get, but there is a LOT of work to do \"cleaning up\" the fuzzies, speckles and other gremlins that creep in during the scanning process. Still, I am excited to have the technology to reproduce these old favorites in a clearer, crisper way than ever before.\n\nSchedule:\nThis book will ship to Kickstarter supporters in August 2013. \n\nShipping:\nAll pledge amounts include USPS Media Mail shipping within the U.S. Shipping for international orders will receive an additional $48.00 fee.

What lurks inside?\nBrom has collected together the very best of his art spanning his 30 year career. Many pieces have never before been published. He's included a rare glimpse into his studio, and an in-depth showcase exploring his creative process, including sketches and preliminaries. Brom has written an insightful autobiography sharing his artistic journey from his earliest childhood drawings, his frustrations with commercial art, challenges breaking into the industry, to his years working in games and film, and insights into his latest personal works.\nThis book will be 9 x 12 inches and encompass 208 pages (trade edition), 224 pages (publisher edition) and 225 pages (deluxe edition). The \"Publisher\" and \"Deluxe\" editions will only be available direct from the publisher and artist. We have a fantasy cover and nude cover to choose from for the \"Publisher\" edition. Depending on your pledge amount there is a sketchbook, giclee print and even an opportunity to have your portrait done as a zombie by Brom that will go in the book!\nThe Art of Brom \"Publisher Edition\" Nude Cover\nBonus for Book Purchase Pledges:\nEveryone who makes a book purchase pledge ($47.00 or more) will receive an 8 x 10 inch print signed by Brom and will be listed in a special Kickstarter acknowledgments section in the book!\nBonus Update [8/25]\nDue to the overwhelming support we have added a second 8 x 10 inch signed print to all book purchase pledges in the amount of $47.00 or more!\nBonus Signed Prints and Portfolio Stretch Goal [8/28]\nWe are pleased to announce our first stretch goal!

Please be aware International orders may be required to pay a duty tax by your local postal station.\nThe Art of Brom \"Trade Edition\" Cover\nArtist, Brom, and Flesk publisher, John Fleskes, share their thoughts:\n\u201cWhat I'm most excited about is the opportunity to put together this art book the way I like art books to be put together: large images and plenty of close ups to see the brush work,\u201d shares Brom. \u201cI'm also thrilled that the advances in printing and scanning technology will allow me to present my work at its very best. To this I've rescanned and personally color corrected all the artwork (including previously published images) to bring the paintings to life as close to the originals as possible -- 400 dpi files and the finest dot screens on the highest quality papers to assure the clearest, cleanest reproductions.\u201d\nJohn Fleskes adds: \u201cHaving the opportunity to work closely with Brom will ensure the colors and tones properly reflect how he wants his artwork to be shown. We are combining his artistic abilities with my ten years of publishing experience to create a book that serves as a work of art in itself. It\u2019s very exciting to be involved in a project such as this: one that will challenge us both, and one that must meet our combined criteria for excellence.\"\nSample Brom Art Included in \"The Art of Brom\"\nBrom\u2019s thoughts on Flesk Publications:\n\u201cPublishing is not the easiest way to make a living in this day and age, you have to love books. John Fleskes loves books, loves publishing -- giving up a stable career to pursue this passion. I admire that. I also admire that he only publishes books that he would wish to buy, only artists whose work he admires. Publishing is a very personal matter with him and it shows in his attention to detail, his dedication to bringing the highest production values possible to every book. John promotes the arts through quality collections. I feel very fortunate to be working with him on my book.\u201d\nJohn Fleskes\u2019 thoughts on Brom:\n\u201cBrom's art is in a constant stage of evolution. In his early work his subjects tended to exemplify strength and power. Brom\u2019s recent work draws more from the pre-Raphaelite vein\u2014darkly romantic and classical. In \u201cThe Art of Brom,\u201d we focus not on a single viewpoint, but encompass the growth of a career; the ongoing evolution of an artist. Furthermore, Brom the person is a delight. Even though he categorizes himself as a \"dark\" artist, he is far from dark in person. He has a passion for life and is fun to work with.\u201d\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\u201cKickstarter is a wonderful way to have a personal connection with those supporting my work,\" says Brom. \"As well as a chance to offer an array of unique personalized items that won't be available in stores. On a more personal note, it's a heck of a fun platform to promote on.\"\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t agree more,\u201d adds John. \u201cKickstarter is an exciting way to get back to my roots of being a fan, the very thing that pushed me to get started publishing, and build a connection with other like-minded people and reward them with bonus material for supporting us early on. Brom and I are basically looking to reward the fans and give them a stunning book--the very thing we would want for ourselves.\u201d\nA final message from Brom:\n\u201cMost importantly, regardless of whether you contribute to this project or not, I would like to take this opportunity to thank any and all of you that have enjoyed and shared my work over the years. Painting can be very solitary endeavor at times and I am continually moved to discover that my work touches others. I would also like to say I am forever grateful to be able to pursue my muse for a living -- something I could not do without your support. Again, thank you.\"\nSample Brom Art Included in \"The Art of Brom.\" This book will house an assortment of Brom's art covering his entire career.\nSample Brom Art Included in \"The Art of Brom\"\nFor more samples of Brom's artwork, please visit www.bromart.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Flesk Publications at the LA Ultimate Comic Art & Collectibles Show and SDCC", "update_content": "Hi All,\nFlesk Publications will be at the LA Ultimate Comic Art & Collectibles Show on Sunday July 15th, 2018 at the LAX Hilton.

But you\u2019re not here to build, you\u2019ve come to destroy!\nYou\u2019re one of the Great Old Ones \u2013 beings of ancient and eldritch power. Cosmic forces have held you at bay for untold aeons, but at last the stars are right and your maniacal cult has called you to this benighted place. Once you regain your full powers, you will unleash your Doom upon the world!\nThere\u2019s only one problem: you\u2019re not alone. The other Great Old Ones are here as well, and your rivals are determined to steal your cultists and snatch victory from your flabby claws! It\u2019s a race to the ultimate finish as you crush houses, smash holes in reality, and fight to call down The Doom That Came To Atlantic City!\nThe Architects of Your Doom...\nThe Doomis a labor of love and terror from three exceptional talents. It is the brainchild of artist Lee Moyer, inspired by his love of the Cthulhu Mythos and disdain for a certain board game that shall not be named. Game designer Keith Baker is best known for the Origins Award winning card game Gloom, and he brings the same dark sense of humor to the devastation of Atlantic City.\nKeith and Lee have enlisted the help of their friend Paul Komoda to design some of the more eldritch visual elements of the game. His talents can be seen on-screen in the prequel to John Carpenter's The Thing and Cabin In The Woods. He brings that vision and long association with H. R. Giger to his designs of the Great Old Ones.\nPaul intensely focused on Juliette for the 2011 prequel to The Thing\nIn the box: \n1 Game Board\n2 Dice\n4 Reference Cards\n8 Plastic figurines of Paul Komoda's sculpts\n8 Mythos Role Cards\n16 Dooms\n24 Gate Cards\n40 Gate Markers\n45 Chants Cards\n45 Providence Cards\n50 Wooden Cultists\n60 Wooden Houses \nAnd now also included thanks to your help in reaching our stretch goals:\n8 Wooden Hotels\n16 Tome Cards\n8 Wooden Claws to track Doubles Rolled & Gates Opened\nBackers who invest at least $75 receive a set of eight playable pewter miniatures sculpted by Paul Komoda in addition to the base game.\nBe Rewarded for Your Sacrifice...\nBy backing this project you'll be bringing The Doom That Came to Atlantic City to retail shops, game tables and frothing cultists around the world. With your contribution we'll be able to go a long way towards the development of an expansion or two.\nWe have fantastic rewards for our backers:\nCopies of the game\nPewter Paul Komoda sculpted game pieces\nMonochrome Inkodye shirts and hangable pop art style canvas prints\nSigned Lovecraftian art packs by Lee Moyer\nOriginal concept art by Lee Moyer\nAn afternoon of gaming with Lee and Keith\nA custom, playable Old One role card based on your likeness\nShirt sizes, art preferences and shipping details will be sorted out via a post-campaign survey.\nHow The Old Ones Roll...\nWhile elements of Doom are reminiscent of a certain real estate trading game, the gameplay is completely different. Instead of playing a puny mortal building a city or closing gates to save the world, you play one of the Great Old Ones, seeking to tear down the city, open gates, and destroy the world.\nAs an Old One, you have mutable traits reflected by Providence cards. So Hastur begins as The King In Yellow, but as the game progresses he could gain Flabby Claws and Membranous Wings. When you begin the game, your primary resources are your cultists, who keep you anchored to the world; however, certain actions call on you to sacrifice your cultists, and you can beat up other Old Ones to steal their cultists. Should you lose your last cultist, you will be banished until you can build up enough followers to return. \nThe second resource in the game are houses. As you move around Atlantic City, you destroy houses. The power you gain in this process allows you to perform the rituals known as Chants. When you destroy the last house on a space, you open up a gate on it. Gates add additional movement options and also grant their owner an additional power (though using this power requires the sacrifice of houses or cultists). Beyond this, opening gates is the key to victory. When you open your sixth gate, you win the game.\nImage is of a prototype board and does not represent quality of final product.\nHowever, every Old One also has a unique path to victory: Their doom. This is a strategic shortcut you can take that gives you a reason to use specific tactics in your choice of Providence and Chants cards, and something that adds replay value to the game. So there are houses on Boardwalk - but your goal is to destroy them, open a gate to Yuggoth, and ultimately to pull off the Ultimate Sacrifice.\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: $55,000 HAS BEEN HIT!\nCthulhu without the Necronomicon is like Boardwalk without a hotel. Our first stretch goal solves both of these problems by adding hotels into the game. Hotels are more difficult to destroy than houses, but destroying a hotel carries a considerable reward: a tome. These books hold secrets no mortal was meant to know, and they enhance the power of your existing gates. What terrible truths will you unearth from the ruins of Park Place?\n\nThe Shadow over Boardwalk goal went into effect when we reached $55,000. The components of the base game have been expanded to include 8 wooden hotels and 16 tomes.\nSTRETCH GOAL #2: $75k HAS BEEN HIT\nFor our next trick we announce The Gate and The Key, a stretch goal for $75,000. In the original base game all doubles rolled and gates opened were tracked using a spare wooden house at the top of your role card. Now that this new goal has been reached we'll add custom wood \"Claws of Doom\" to help you keep track of the destruction.\nTo top it off we're also including shiny custom dice with our Beauty & The Tentacle logo where the single pip would be. All backers (of a tier including the base game) will receive the gate counters, custom dice, plastic figurines and our previous stretch goal, The Shadow Over Boardwalk.\nSTRETCH GOAL #3: $100k HAS BEEN HIT\nWe thank you for your ongoing involvement in your Doom and we are pleased to announce your selections from the dusty Archives!\nFor everyone backing at $100 or above, you will receive these three stickers of DOOM!\nAll backers at 200 and above will additionally receive this signed and numbered limited edition print of The Call of Cthulhu called 'Cthulhu Rising'.\nYou can declare your love of the game right now on BoardGameGeek.com.\nWith twenty years of gestation, play testing and reworking, The Doom has become a sharply honed work of fun-to-play satire. \nHuge thanks to Coilhouse, io9, Wired's GeekDad, Quarter to Three, The Gaming Gang, Geek.com and Nerd Approved for notifying the masses of their impending Doom!\nThis card is not included in the game. It's an example of our custom playable Role Cards, from the $1k tier, as a \"thanks\" to Nadya Lev of Coilhouse!\n\"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Refund Update", "update_content": "As of this evening I've begun refunding backers along the terms I initially outlined in the Terminus update.

There's An Axe In My Head from Chris and I back in 2008 but never produced it. We worked with them to create the artwork and were told over and over again\u2014along with everyone who wanted the game, that it was coming out soon, but that date kept being pushed back. After two years of waiting, we took back the publishing rights and went our separate ways.\nAnd then what happened?\nOh My God! There's An Axe In My Head was under consideration by another game publisher who gave us some valuable feedback on streamlining the game, but were uncomfortable with its title. We've taken some of their advice to heart and edited the game to make game-play faster and more exciting. \nWe're keeping the title.\nSo now what?\nInspired by the successful game projects on Kickstarter, Chris and I thought a Kickstarter project would be ideal to make Oh My God There's An Axe In My Head available and publish it on our own. We've published the C\u00baNTINUUM: Roleplaying in The Yet\u2122 and Chi-Chian role-playing games previous to this (and worked on many games for other large publishers), so we've got the experience to handle creating and publishing a quality game, but the high cost of manufacturing a boardgame was beyond our means until Kickstarter came along as an option.\nThat's where you come in, dear potential supporter. We've put over six years of work into designing Oh My God! There's An Axe In My Head, spent months on the artwork and graphics, and playtested it hundreds of times at conventions since 2004 (and enjoyed the hell out of it every time). \nPre-order your copy, get a great deal on a fun game, and enrich the creativity of the boardgame community by supporting indie publishers.\nWhat about the people who ordered the game from Bucephalus?\nWe are not associated with Bucephalus Games. I've offered Bucephalus the opportunity to purchase copies of the game in bulk, at cost to fulfill any yet-unrefunded pre-orders they took. They've been unresponsive so far.  Edit 8/30/11: We've been in touch with Bucephalus, and there may be a possibility of working with them to fulfill their old pre-orders. If there's any more info than that we'll be sure to post it here.\nIf the Kickstarter project exceeds its goal and receives over $30,000 in pledges, we can afford to extend that at-cost offer, plus shipping, to individuals who placed a valid, unrefunded pre-order of Oh My God! There's An Axe In My Head with Bucephlaus Games.\nWhat people are saying about Oh My God! There's An Axe In My Head. The Game of International Diplomacy\n\"I love this game. I played it at a con a couple years ago and I've been hoping for another opportunity for a while. It's all the fun and strategy of something like Catan, with the flavor text and kill-your-friends joy of Munchkin.\"\n- Warriorsmurf (aka Susan G), commentator on reddit.com\n\"A lot of detail went into every aspect of the game, and every rule and minor element fits the humorous theme, as well as the vintage-style art. This is a quality game that is light enough to appeal to casual gamers, with enough strategic elements to interest the more competitive such as myself.\"\n- Ashley Cook, Giant Fire Breathing Robot\n\"The positional play on the board, with the probability curve, push your luck mechanism, alliances & treaties, and special card play all blend themselves in a wonderful mix. \u2026if you get a chance to play it then do so, but set aside some cash beforehand because you're going to be picking it up right after you play it. It is REALLY good. \"\n- Bryce Lynch, Fortress Ameritrash\n\"The artwork looks a lot like what would happen if John Kovalic and Winsor McCay made an art baby, which is to say it looks really cool. So check it out, pre-order a copy, and seriously, who wouldn't want to play a game called Oh My God! There's An Axe In My Head?\"\n- Cindy Au, Kickstarter Community Team\n\"This is a really great game, both in theme and execution.

I originally sponsored this when I was diagnosed with cancer which had a 90% cure rate (squamous cell carcinoma, obtained through the HPV virus, not drinking/smoking). It appeared to be cured, but then came back in early 2013, as I noted on March 24. My statement then was somewhat incorrect as I was able to have radiation therapy a second time to attempt to cure it. This appeared to be successful right up until September 2013. The tumor in my neck has become active again and I have now been told, without any question, that I fall in the 10% bracket and am terminal. (Surgery, which I've had 3 times previously, could also cure it, but now it's wrapped around my carotid artery and part has moved towards my spine making the success of surgery highly unlikely and would leave me horribly disfigured to boot - though I still plan on getting other opinions just to make me a liar about being terminal). I began weekly chemo sessions earlier this week in hopes of extending my life and improving the quality of what is left. Without treatment, the doctor figures I have 3-6 months. With treatment, could be months, could be years. Doubtful that I will come close to living another decade. With that in mind, I'd just like to say I am not seeking empathy or sympathy. I just would like to play this game before my time on this planet is through. Mr. Fooden, you seem to be extremely close to having this game wrapped up to be delivered in close proximity to Christmas this year. Please, please, please. I hope that you don't disappoint me this year as my opportunity for trying this game that has been on my radar for 6+ years is running out. I know this is your baby and you would like it to be as perfect as possible, but sometimes you just need to get the product out the door to start some word of mouth. Once it hits the market, flaws will be uncovered and if the game is a success, you'll be able to improve the overall quality of the game going forward. I don't think any of your backers are looking for sheer perfection in the product, just quality. It sounds as if you are giving us that and I appreciate it.

Also, I suggest that to stem some of the anger that is building, you should supply an additional exclusive Kickstarter bonus, i.e. double the exclusive cards, a custom first place coin, etc(you may want to poll the backers on this).
