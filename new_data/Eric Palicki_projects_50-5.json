The first of a proposed comprehensive trilogy ('SILVER' and 'BRONZE') of art books, featuring a huge selection of work from over thirty five years in the comics industry by artist and writer Liam Sharp. Backers will also receive an all-new creator-owned 25 page comic, 'The Chronicles of Lib LaRoche', written and lavishly illustrated by Liam, completely free! And on top of that they'll receive an exclusive collectable card from a planned Tarot deck used in the Lib LaRoche universe.\n\nENCORE: GOLD features an incredible introduction by legendary writer Grant Morrison, a creator profile by renowned journalist and interviewer Geoff Boucher, and is a showcase of some of Liam's all-time favorite pieces.\nENCORE: GOLD - THE ART OF LIAM SHARP\nENCORE: The Art of Liam Sharp hardback cover mock-up\nBIOG\nLiam recently wrapped his ground-breaking and acclaimed epic 24 issue run on DC's The Green Lantern with Grant Morrison, and is currently working on Batman: Reptilian with superstar writer Garth Ennis. But before that, and before his award-winning six issue limited series 'The Brave and The Bold: Batman and Wonder Woman' (which he also wrote) and before the wildly successful 'Wonder Woman: Rebirth' with fan-favorite writer Greg Rucka, Liam had a long and distinguished career as an artist and also a writer of both comics and prose fiction. He has also been a well-regarded boutique publisher, co-founding both the Mam Tor imprint and the ground-breaking digital company Madefire. \nLiam has worked for Marvel, DC,Vertigo, Wildstorm, Image, Darkhorse, Fleetway and Dynamite, producing a huge range of eclectic work in every imaginable genre. Encore - The Art of Liam Sharp  is intended to celebrate this long, creatively restless and innovative career, and will be a must-have book for collectors, fans and new-comers alike. As Grant Morrison writes in his introduction -\n\n'Knowing the standards (Liam) sets for himself, witnessing first-hand the constant striving for new goals, new achievements, I\u2019d hazard a guess he has barely begun the latest phase of his artistic journey, is only now stretching his peacock wings as we his audience are invited to sit back and applaud the dazzling display\u2026'\nENCORE: The Art of Liam Sharp book with dust jacket mock-up\nABOUT THE BOOK\nAvailable with or without the Conan dust jacket, ENCORE 'GOLD' showcases work from across Liam's extensive career, presenting much of the hyper-detailed art in it's black and white unlettered form for the first time in print - from the spectacular high fantasy of THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD: BATMAN AND WONDER WOMAN, to the incredibly intricate sci-fi realms of THE GREEN LANTERN. \nWithin these pages you will also find many examples of Liam's full-color work - both traditional and digital - which pays homage to the masters of the past whilst also pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in the industry.\nThe cover to Liam's 'THE BRAVE AND THE BOLD: BATMAN AND WONDER WOMAN' series. Colors here by Romulo Fajardo JR.\nCatwoman Cover\n'MOULDERING STONES' featuring Red Sonja. A personal piece that ended up being a cover for Dynamite Comics.\nJudges Dredd, Death and Anderson from a poster produced for a feature on the artist in the Megazine.\nPromotional art for Liam's Manthing series with writer J.M.DeMatteis for Marvel - a favourite series for both creators\nEASTER EGGS!\nThe book also promises to contain a host of un-lockable Easter Eggs, linking to (amongst other things) a film shot by Liam's son, Lorcan, where he talks about his career, techniques and life-lessons. \n There will also be a unique opportunity to receive one of Liam's huge (18\" x 24\") original black and white pages (see below) from his iconic Green Lantern run with Grant Morrison for the first person to break a hidden code within the pages! \nSeason 1, page 10, issue 10 of THE GREEN LANTERN - unlock the code hidden in the pages of ENCORE 'GOLD' to win this page!\nABOUT THE COMIC\nAs the first stretch goal was unlocked, along with the book backers will now receive a free 25 page comic, featuring all-new material, and telling the origin of Liam's character Lib LaRoche - a gothic female Conan in a new-weird world of sci-fi and fantasy elements (previewed below!) \nLib LaRoche: Jubileumboek preview art\nPage from Lib LaRoche - placeholder lettering only\nLib LaRoche sample page - placeholder lettering only\nOFFERS\nENCORE 'GOLD' comes with multiple options:\nPDF only\nWithout dust jacket\nWith Conan dust jacket\nDust jacket and signature only\nDust jacket, signature and remark\nDust jacket, signature and exclusive bookplate \nDust jacket, signature with remark and exclusive bookplate\nDust jacket, signature, exclusive bookplate, original head sketch (3 options) \nDust jacket, signature, exclusive bookplate, original torso sketch (3 options) \n50% off for retail orders of 10X basic hardback and dust jacket edition\nExamples of previous torso sketches by the artist.\nFUTURE VOLUMES \nENCORE 'GOLD' 'SILVER' & 'BRONZE' box set mock-up\nENCORE 'SILVER\", the second volume, will be a celebration of the intricacy of pure black and white comic art.\nENCORE 'BRONZE\", the final volume, will feature a complete retrospective of Liam's career, from assisting the great Don Lawrence, through 2000ad, Marvel, Image, DC, and beyond. Over a series of interviews Liam talks to writer and teacher Dave Gillette about the trials and tribulations, good times and bad, and about the masters of the past that inspired him, and the artistic heroes that eventually became his friends. For comic historians it promises to be a goldmine, for aspiring artists there'll be a chance to hear first hand what it is like having a long career in comics and the visual arts.\n'SILVER' & 'BRONZE' are slated for publication late 2021 and 2022 respectively. \nThe slip case will be available for purchase with the third and final volume.\n\nBOOK SPECIFICATIONS\nENCORE - THE ART OF LIAM SHARP 'GOLD\"\nHardback with optional dust jacket\n144 pages\n7.5\" x 11\"\nFIRST STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nNow everybody who buys ENCORE:GOLD also gets the first ever 25 page Lib LaRoche comic free with the book, and what's more it will be signed by artist/author Liam Sharp!\nLib LaRoche comic #0 cover mock-up - not final art.\nSECOND STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nNow included with the book and comic will be one of a set of six cards, of increasing rarity! Five of them will be picture cards from the world of Lib LaRoche. The sixth will be a simple gold design with a QR code on it that will gift the owner something completely unique! \nOnly FIVE of the GOLDEN CARDS will be sent randomly into the world with the books, for you to discover!\nMock-up of the Lib LaRoche card set\nA brand new set will also be available with both ENCORE:SILVER and ENCORE:BRONZE.\nHuge thanks, as always, from Liam and all of us in Team Sharpy! \nTS\nFINAL STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED!\nAfter asking around we decided on the final stretch goal, and it's going to be a great one for everybody who has backed this campaign. \nUltimately the free comic is fun, and the cards will be collectable and beautiful (more on that shortly!) but those things often get lost over time, and what's left is the book.\nSo with that in mind -\nTHE BOOK\nHaving hit $110K the book will have a page-holder ribbon, an embossed cover, and the dust jacket will have an added metallic ink. It already has heavy, high-end paper of the finest quality, and will be stitched and not glued. It will truly be a beautiful product!\nTHANK YOU ALL so much for the incredible support!!!\n\nBut also-\n\nUPDATE ON THE CARDS\nWhat I didn't say before, and what you are now just learning, is that Lib LaRoche uses cards as part of her character trait - no spoilers! There will only be two hundred copies only of each of the first five cards that will have a gold surround. So everybody who buys this book will automatically get one rare collectable card that will never be reproduced with the gold border again! ENCORE:SILVER will do five more new cards in silver, and ENCORE:BRONZE another five in (you guessed it!) bronze.\nAfter that we are planning to create a deck of cards, the tarot set of Lib's realm, that can be used as regular tarot cards, or traded. These will feature the same cards that come with the three books, but without the gold, silver and bronze surround.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs most of the art already exists and the majority of the book has already been compiled, there is very little that could delay the production of the book(s), baring production issues, and the unforeseeable happening to Liam that might prevent him completing the all-new content promised. \nAt the very least there are already five original unpublished pages, and the book can be filled out with other material from his career in the event of an accident or illness.

That's why, when Chris Moreno (Zombie Dickheads, World War Hulk: Front Line) decided to follow up our beloved The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling, we developed Stoned Master, a blend of stoner comedy, kung fu action, and sun-drenched Los Angeles vibes chockablock with anti-gentrification rumination.\nStoned Master #1 is a 32-page, full-color comic book, the first of a planned five-part series cocreated by Chris and me, with letters by Taylor Esposito and logo by Tim Daniel.

And the only ones standing in their way? Burnout kung fu savant Frankie Wong, his drunken master, and his pals from the local cannabis dispensary. \nImagine Kung Fu Hustle meets Pineapple Express. Or, for the old heads, Drunken Master meets Cheech & Chong. It's all the intense, artful fight scenes you expect from a martial arts epic, combined with gut-busting stoner comedy laughs, then fully baked in the Southern California sun.\nWhile working together on The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling, Chris and I found ourselves jonesing for an opportunity to cut loose, free of the restrictions that come with nonfiction work. We wanted space and freedom for big, intense, outlandish action and hilarious visual comedy.\nStoned Master is our opportunity to show off, demonstrating all our strengths on a truly gonzo comic, all in service of actual good politics. With your help, we're going to make it happen, with any additional money raised spent how it rightfully should be: Paying the team more.\nCHARACTER DESIGNS\nAs part of his efforts to make Stoned Master's Chavez Heights setting feel real, authentic, and lived in, Chris put in a ton of design work, creating characters that feel unique and visually distinct while remaining authentic and familiar.\nREWARDS!\nSlap it on your bong\nDare you to hang it up at work\nSample Chris Moreno commission\nSample Chris Moreno commission\nWHAT IF YOU RAISE MORE MONEY?\n$25,000: Everybody gets raises\nIn order to make Stoned Master happen, everyone's agreed to a lower rate; Aubrey isn\u2019t taking a page rate at all!

Rose, Poppy, and Violet Hawthorn had an unusual upbringing. Their mother, Jasmine, was the daughter of Nazi hunters and indoctrinated into La R\u00e9sistance after WW2. After moving to the United States, Jasmine settled down and had three daughters, but her hard-lived past caught up with her.\nThe Deadliest Bouquet explores the relationships these sisters have with each other and their complicated bond with their mother.

Poppy\u2019s husband, Derek, is oblivious to her family\u2019s history and Poppy\u2019s training. He just thinks she\u2019s a stay at home mom and part-time bookkeeper. Poppy is a Cancer.\nArt by Carola Borelli\nRose feels obligated to help Jasmine run the flower shop since she's the oldest and most responsible. She resents her sisters for leaving and having lives of their own. Rose is a Capricorn.\nArt by Carola Borelli\nJasmine was trained in the art of espionage and assassination by her parents who were part of La R\u00e9sistance in WW2. She lived all over the world hunting down escaped Nazis with her family but left after her brother's death on a particular mission.

In a creative endeavor of this size, possible challenges could be delays in production or printing depending on the current situation with the quarantine, considering we ship overseas. However, we have successfully Kickstarted multiple projects before as creators AND as a team, which has given us the utmost confidence that we'll meet and exceed your expectations, no matter what is happening in the world. When hiccups are hit, we send updates. When we receive our shipment, we get them our to backers immediately without delay. I mean, why would we want to hold onto the books when we're so eager for YOU to read them?\n\nOne thing that we can't control is customs charges and the price of international shipping. We pay more for international shipping than we charge, but some countries will charge an extra customs fee based on the prices of the items included.

And we certainly hope you finished all the grimoires and spell books on your summer reading list.\nYou only skimmed them? Oo, too bad, because we're starting out with a pop quiz. First question: If you summon a demonic familiar, how far away from you can that frustrating little imp actually go? Not as far as you thought? If you'd done the reading, you might've realized how difficult that limited range would be to work with on school grounds, where the strict ban on demonic familiars may leave you suspended before first period's even over.\nSecond question: What are three short-sighted teens and their terrible imp to do?\nIssue 2 Cover\nCreated by Jordan Alsaqa and Ray Nadine, the second issue of Raise Hell! brings school back in session with even more haunted hijinks and coming-of-age comedy. Because even in a world of demonic curses, witch covens, and literal human soul food, high school remains a proving ground of messy emotions, dorky teachers, and trying to just make it out alive.\nIssue Two follows Victor, Miri, and Reeves dealing with all that and more as they struggle to find a way to hide their troublemaking demon Alistair from staff and student alike. With Ali unable to venture more than 100 feet from any of the teens, the day becomes a gauntlet of near-misses and desperate searches to find a permanent solution to their problem.\nOh, and Victor can't wait to finally join the paranormally inclined Spectral Science Club! He... may not be as focused on the task at hand as he should be. It's going to be a long first day...\nWith this campaign, our goal is to raise funding to complete and print physical copies of Raise Hell!: Issue 2. As a thank you for supporting the project, we have a number of reward levels, including digital and physical copies of Raise Hell!: Issue 2, a brand-new mixtape pin, script edits from Jordan, and physical commissions from Ray. At the top level, you can even appear in the book as a student or staff member of Eklund High School! And for new readers, we've got numerous catch-up reward packages and add-ons that'll let you grab everything you may have missed out on in the first campaign.\nIncluded below is a special preview of the issue!\nAnd if you're new to the party, you can get a look an even more art with a preview of the first issue below!\nClick through for that first issue goodness!\nPRAISE FOR RAISE HELL!\n--\"Raise Hell! is a fresh, whimsical take on teenage life combined with what we've always wanted - blood sacrifices, demon spawns, and a wicked fun time.

High school can be one of the toughest times in your life, but this book is sure to remind you of the great friends who got you through it. Nerd.\u201d - Mark Stack (Young Offenders!)\n--\"Raise Hell! returns for issue #2 featuring another ingeniously funny script from Jordan Alsaqa and more vivacious neon-soaked art from Ray Nadine. The attention to detail the team puts into Victor, Miri, & Ali pays dividends big time by giving us one of the most charming and engaging cast of friends in comics. Back Raise Hell! with extreme confidence!\" -Frankee White (20 Fists, Starless Daydream)\nBACK-UP STORY\nIn addition to the main story, issue two of Raise Hell! is foregoing the stretch goal entirely and adding in a guaranteed eight-page back-up! The story will be written by Jordan and drawn by our first guest artist, Kelsi Jo Silva!\nWhereas the first issue's \"Demon King of Ska\" put Victor's musical passion in the spotlight, it's Miri who'll take the stage for this issue's \"Clothes Make the 'Mon\". Dissatisfied with every piece of clothing she makes for Ali, Miri realizes to make the best demonic clothing, she's going to need some demonic materials. The pair sets out for a special market that exists between realities, where one off-handed comment is all it takes to set off a rivalry between tailors of the insectoid and arachnoid persuasions.\nThe back-up story's rival tailors, designed by guest artist Kelsi Jo Silva\nTake a look below at the first page of inks from the story, and see more at her website!\nAli experiencing all the lows of mid-00s fashion.\nWriter Jordan Alsaqa (he/him) is an N.C. State graduate with a degree in Creative Writing. He\u2019s successfully funded numerous comics through Kickstarter, including Terminal Protocol, Finding Peace, and We Have to Go Back, as well as the first issue of Raise Hell!. His rural horror comic, Welderkin, co-created with Joni Miller, was published digitally by Comicker Press. His work can also be found in numerous anthologies, including Alloy Anthology: Electrum from Ascend Comics and You Died from Iron Circus Comics. Jordan\u2019s junior year of high school was spent doodling stick figures, helping run a Creative Writing Club, and failing to appreciate all the bottomless wells of energy that youth has to offer. You can keep up with Jordan's other projects on Twitter and at his website.\nArtist Ray Nadine (they/them) has been drawing since they could hold a pencil, and has been making comics since 2013. They're currently working on a graphic novel for Dark Horse that they're contractually obliged not to say much more about, and also illustrated Messenger on Webtoon. They've had stories featured in a handful of anthologies, notably Everything Is Going Wrong (edited by Mark!) and Local Haunts, edited by Kara Lais.  Ray's also created the webcomic Dollhouse, and several short comics including Anchored, The Collector, The Ties That Bind, and Something Had Changed. When Ray isn't working, they're playing too much Final Fantasy XIV, watching anime, or rough-housing with their cat. Their favorite band is My Chemical Romance and they still listen to all the same crap they listened to in high school. Keep up with their art and projects on Twitter and their website.\nEditor Mark Bouchard (they/them) is a non-binary writer/editor in Chicago, by way of New England who has been self-publishing comics since 2016. They are the editor and creator of EVERYTHING IS GOING WRONG: Comics On Punk & Mental Illness, and their writing has been published in a number of comic anthologies including A Wave Blue World\u2019s Dead Beats. They are currently writing a horror graphic novella due out in early 2021. Outside of comics, Mark enjoys curry and black coffee, often at the same time. They also write satire for The Hard Times and Hard Drive. You can follow them on Twitter for updates on their work and their dog, Juicebox. To read their short comics, and learn more about their past work, visit their website.\nGuest Artist Kelsi Jo Silva (she/her) is an artist and illustrator based out of Denver, Co. She has been muddling her way through the process of getting a creative career off the ground since graduating from the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design in 2014. Kelsi has worked on a number of odd projects and jobs but is most notably the illustrator for the Ela Cat series of children\u2019s book published by Good Luck Black Cat Books\u2014the first of which won both a MoonBeam award and a CIPPA EVVY award for illustration. In the last three years, Kelsi has shifted her focus from Children\u2019s books to comics, which are her true passion. She's self-published a few short stories and had the opportunity to pitch a multitude of projects with an array of talented writers. Kelsi revels in the fact that she gets to spend her days drawing and her evenings re-watching Star Trek. It's truly a dream. To see more of her work, check out her Twitter and website.\nFor funding, approximately $1500 will go towards paying the remaining page rates for Ray and Kelsi Jo for  drawing, coloring, and lettering their respective stories. Roughly $1000 will go towards printing the book itself, with an additional $300 going towards producing the new campaign rewards, and potentially reprinting some of the old ones. Finally, another $1000 will go towards shipping and fulfillment costs, while the final approximate 10% will go towards Kickstarter fees. Any additional funds will go towards reimbursing Jordan's initial investment before any possible stretch goals. These rates are based directly on our final totals from the previous campaign, so we are confident they should accurately reflect what we'll need for fulfillment.\nBelow, you can get the full rundown of all the various reward levels available for the campaign. As always, we've done our best to make sure that every backer, however big or small, is getting plenty of bang for their buck, in addition to our eternal (infernal?) gratitude.

At this level, you'll receive all five mixtape pins (Ska, Pretentious, Anime, Retrowave, Study Vibes) at a discounted overall price.

However, the current campaign estimates are built with a significant buffer to account for this possibility, and our goal is to begin printing rewards as soon as the funding hits our account. These estimates have also been updated based on final totals from the previous Raise Hell! campaign.

But unknown to the league of heroes who protect the innocent, this world has a cancer growing at its heart. A pantheon of elder gods is starting to awaken. These timeless forces of supernature once claimed dominion over a primordial Earth\u2026 and they have returned to reclaim what is theirs. Super-powered heroes\u2014and villains\u2014find themselves struggling against unimaginable horror to save the planet. It is a hopeless battle.\n\nIn BEYOND MORTAL--written by Cullen Bunn, illustrated and colored by Danny Luckert, and lettered by Simon Bowland--the superheroes (and villains) of a new comic book universe will collide with a new pantheon of alien deities from beyond our understanding of reality. \n\nThe unstoppable force of the Leviathan will collide with the immovable object of the world's most powerful superheroes in an unflinching tale of ultimate horror and ultimate sacrifice. \n\nSuperheroes versus elder gods.\nCover A\nOur heroes include COMMANDER COMET, the cosmic defender; MOTHER NATURE, the avatar of Gaia; TORPEDA, the queen of the undersea kingdom of Abyssia; DEVILX, the masked vigilante from the streets of Empire City; and THE SECRET, the master of mysticism! They are the members of the fabled ALLIANCE, a group of heroes who have banded together to face the most impossible challenges.\n\nBut the heroes aren't working alone! They can't face ultimate darkness by themselves! In order to stand against the Leviathan, they must make allies with their greatest enemies--villains like VALDERI, SPLIT-SECOND, SPRIGGAN, TOXIC, KRAKEN, and many more!\n\nAn entirely new superhero universe will be springing to life in this comic! Over the course of the campaign, we'll be introducing you to the characters through regular updates!\nConcept Art for Commander Comet, DevilX, Mother Nature, and Torpeda\nThe Leviathan are a pantheon of alien elder gods that have set their many baleful eyes on Earth. THE UNWANTED WHISPER, THE CRAWLING PESTILENCE, THE FACELESS PROPHET, THE CHATTERING MAW, THE HORDE MOTHER, THE UNDONE CHILD, THE CALLER FROM THE VOID, and many more terrible beings are rising from the darkness between the stars!\n\nInspired by the Cthulhu Mythos, the Leviathan are a new group of awful deities to inspire the most horrific of nightmares!\nThis is a story that Danny and Cullen have been developing for years, and they are thrilled to be able to bring it to you in this format! All artwork for this issue is COMPLETE! By the time the campaign wraps up, all pages will be lettered. By the time funds are transferred, final designs will be completed and the book will be ready for the printer. That means digital versions of the book go out as soon as funds are transferred!

Especially C\u00e1ssia Costa.\nAn ancient cult and their army of demons have stolen C\u00e1ssia\u2019s home, Apex City.  When a magical dragon bracelet rockets into her life and affixes itself to her arm, C\u00e1ssia\u2019s the only person equipped to stop the cult from offering the entire city to their dark lord.\nThere's just one catch...\nInferno Girl Red by Nicola Scott (w/ Annette Kwok), left, and Valeria Favoccia, right\nThe magical bracelet is powered by belief, and C\u00e1ssia \u2014 an intensely pragmatic, rational girl \u2013 doesn\u2019t have much to spare. She\u2019ll have to find something to kindle her faith, though, and fast \u2014because she has a secret legacy to live up to. Because her mother's life is on the line. And because Apex City needs Inferno Girl Red.\nHi! My name's Mat Groom. And this story, INFERNO GIRL RED, is one I\u2019ve been working on for about three years now. I\u2019ve always thought it was worthwhile, but I was never certain it would work\u2026 until I met Erica D\u2019Urso. Erica is just wickedly talented. You can see that in her work on JAMES BOND, CAPTAIN MARVEL and XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS. But it was her energy, her tremendous passion, that made me believe. Erica loves C\u00e1ssia, and C\u00e1ssia\u2019s world\u2026 and that love infuses every part of this project. There\u2019s nobody I would rather be co-creating this world with.\n\nInferno Girl Red Character Design\nTogether with colorist Igor Monti (who has a ultra-modern and vibrant style you'll recognise if you read MEGA MAN: FULLY CHARGED), letterer Becca Carey (a real star-in-the-making) and design agency For The People (a Top 10 Global Agency, according to D&AD), Erica and I are so excited to bring you this all-new 100-page superhero graphic novel.\nINFERNO GIRL RED Creative Team\nKyle Higgins is editing this book. Kyle and I have been friends for half a decade, at this point. He has mentored me, in many ways (he edited my first comics series SELF/MADE), and more recently we\u2019ve worked as a writing team on ULTRAMAN for Marvel Comics. We share a passion for the Japanese tokusatsu genre (which was a big influence here, along with British boarding school dramas and American superhero comics). And there\u2019s little coincidence that C\u00e1ssia was first introduced to the world in the back of the first issue of Kyle\u2019s series, RADIANT BLACK. In fact, the connections between RADIANT BLACK and INFERNO GIRL RED may run deeper than you think\u2026\nC\u00e1ssia\u2019s not shy\u2013 but bouncing around from city-to-city as her Mom bounced from job-to-job meant it was hard to make friends... and any friends she did make disappeared pretty quickly once they found out who C\u00e1ssia\u2019s mother was. So instead of socialising, she focused on learning\u2013 showing a particular aptitude for science.\n\nC\u00e1ssia Costa Character Design\n \n                     Now C\u00e1ssia has a chance for a fresh start in Apex City. Her impressive test scores have earned her an invitation to the world-famous entrepreneur Doctor Janine Caro\u2019s prestigious boarding school for promising young minds. There, C\u00e1ssia starts to settle in. She starts to make friends. She starts to see a future for herself.\nBut when a magical bracelet blasts through a window while C\u00e1ssia is studying late one night, everything changes. C\u00e1ssia's quickly drawn into a strange war that she previously only heard about from her mother... \nConcept Art \u2013 The Griffin and Other Manifestations of Darkness\nConcept Art \u2013 C\u00e1ssia's Mom, and Other Mentors\nConcept Art \u2013 New Friends\n\nReady to experience some of the story?

In Sparrow, we follow the story of an 18 year old high school senior, Alaina Yuen. Alaina is the daughter of legendary heroes Red Falcon and the Sentinel, founding members of a superhero team once known as the Knight Guard. When catastrophe struck, the team found themselves disbanded, the world no longer had heroes.  Present day, Alaina finds it increasingly difficult to obey her fathers wishes and ignore her legacy.  When a new threat comes to her city, Alaina finds herself in the middle of a dark mystery. She'll have to go at odds with her father as she becomes Sparrow and fights this new wave of villainy.  \n\n  Thank you for checking out our page! Like I said before, I've been developing this universe since 2011! It's a huge passion project for me to bring this new take on superheroes to the world! SO, our kickstarter is going to printing and getting this book to you in a high quality, and paying for some awesome variant covers! I hope you all will come along on this journey with me to see how Alaina balances high school life,  crushing on the coolest girl in school, and continuing her parents legacy as... SPARROW!\n\nFUNDED!! stretch goals time!\n So we hit our goal! It's stretch goal time now! Our first stretch goal is going to be an awesome prequel comic starring Red Falcon, the Sentinel and the Knight Guard! The goal is 4750! For this epic story I wanted equally epic artists to help me out! So, we've got @FellHound_ from Commander Rao doing an incredible cover and our amazing variant cover artist @Cemiroz doing 6 awesome pages! Both are on Twitter with those @'s! You don't wanna miss out on this awesome bonus story!\n\nSTRETCH GOAL #2\nTrading cards, stickers, and bookmarks! The cost looks like $850 for the printing and paying my artists. So we're going to need to get to $5850 I reckon!  Here\u2019s the first card for our villain Mystery Man! It is badass! This was illustrated by the incredible @cemiroz on twitter!\nMystery Man trading card\nVariant cover #1\n\nPREVIEW PAGES\nWhat an opening! We hope that got you eager to read more! So, here's a little info on our characters, starting with our leading lady!\nAlaina Yuen, AKA Sparrow is your average high school girl. Except she can bench press a car! Alaina inherited some of her mothers ( The Sentinel ) powers.  She's super strong, super fast and pretty much always super late for class. \nFor years, Alaina followed her fathers rules, that she were not to pursue the life he once led. As we come to find out in issue 1, though, this rule is becoming increasingly difficult to follow. With new dangers emerging, Alaina will have to disobey her fathers wishes and drive a wedge between them doing so. \n\nJames Yuen, AKA Red Falcon. A broken man after the loss of his wife, James retires the Red Falcon mantle and effectively the Knight Guard.  Years after the incident, James would go on to find a new way to help people, as old habits are hard to break. He establishes the Sentinel Security Organization. A new government department dedicated to protecting the world from its largest threats.  When James learns of a new vigilante, he finds his organization at odds with the person closest to him...\n\nAh, the villain of our story. No one knows who this up-and-comer truly is. He's dubbed the Mystery Man by the criminal underworld and the police. He's got a sense for flair and elegance in his crimes, but that doesn't mean he's afraid to get his hands dirty.  All people really know is that he's a force to be reckoned with since coming into town, and it seems like he's got very big plans. \n\nTHE TEAM\nI'm Kal Huset, a 23 year old artist and writer. Simply put, the team is mainly myself on writing and art, along with some script and editing help from my wife Alex Payton-Huset and friend Jordan Davis. I've been drawing and creating stories as long as I can remember.  And ever since I got gifted my first comic, it was one of the Tim Drake Robin one-shots before getting his ongoing, I've wanted to create my own! So to be here is extremely humbling.\n\nWHY THIS STORY?\nSo, I know superheroes is probably the least indie thing you could probably do, but it's one of my passions and missions to bring something new to the scene.  And I feel somewhat obligated to get this universe started, as I have been building it since 2011.  But this initial comic has gone through a whole lot of changes throughout the years! What was initially a pretty standard superhero story starring the Red Falcon has now evolved into a legacy story about the relationship between father and daughter. \n      See, in the last few years I became the father to three awesome kids. Two are adopted and recently we had our newest son.  I started thinking, would if Red Falcon had a child? Fatherhood had such a profound effect on me, I could only imagine if these epic heroes I created had children . So was born Alaina/Sparrow! Going through just as many designs and iterations to get to this point. Alaina is softly modeled around my daughter, sharing the same name even! When Alaina(my daughter) was born, she was months early and had to spend months in the NICU recovering. This little girl has overcame so much and is the strongest little girl I've ever met, she inspires me. And that's the kind of feelings I put into writing Sparrow and the kind of feeling and response I hope to evoke in others.\n\nREWARDS\n $1 -Thanks!

With guidance from a mysterious tribe of \"lost people\", Rebecca rises from the ashes as the bloodthirsty vigilante \u201cMia\u201d, hellbent on revenge.\nComplete DIY Experience with about 3 person total crew yet able to deliver stunts, horses, & multiple locations.\n DID YOU KNOW?\n*\"Vengeance Turns\" is OVER 2 Hours long!\n*UNRATED-- but would be \"Hard R\" for Violence, Language & Nudity\n*Features a Diverse Cast and Female Lead?\n*Has an Original Graphic Novel coming in Winter 2021?\n The Genesis of \"Vengeance Turns\" ! \nWe started working on this over four years ago! Robert Christopher Smith, a lifelong fan of spaghetti western movies like \u201cA Fistful of Dollars\u201d, \u201cA Few Dollars More\u201d, and \u201cThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly\u201d, wrote the basic story in late 2016. \nCo-writer Amanda Fry was originally going to also star as \"Rebecca/Mia Falcon\"!\nThe first person he ever discussed that story with was David Ruano, whom he met at a Thanksgiving party where neither really wanted to be. Ruano also had thoughts of making a western film. They sat and discussed Western movies, stories and what it took to film one, deciding that they should work together. This partnership would remain in place over time, and despite whatever else they might have worked on independently or as collaborators, \u201cVengeance Turns\u201d grew and grew. \nBecause Smith wanted a female lead, it was decided that the screen story and rough first draft of the screenplay would wait until a FEMALE co-writer was brought on board.\nA Strong Female Lead, A FEROCIOUS Female Co-Writer: Meet Amanda Fry\nAside from various creative pursuits, co-writer Amanda founded and remains active with \"The Borderland 100 Club\" supporting families of fallen first responders.\n Meeting former El Paso Police Officer, Amanda Fry, proved to be exactly what the story and script needed. Instead of simply shoehorning a \u201cmale story\u201d into one that is female-led and driven, it was important to all involved that the VIOLENCE, especially, should be considered and executed as it would by a female. When Fry was originally brought on board, it was with the idea that she would both co-develop the story and star in the leading role as Rebecca/Mia Falcon. \nNeedless to say, Smith and Fry had a blast writing all this mayhem together! Some of the most brutal scenes in the movie sprang directly from the mind of Amanda Fry, on occasion even shocking Smith himself! (Wait until you see the fate of a bad guy named Bronson-- and what made it to the screen is only a fraction of what Smith and Fry originally put to the page based on Fry\u2019s ideas for the sequence!) She directed her first  short film,  \"CUT\"  (and this  BTS Video ), alongside Smith and Ruano when originally scouting locations. While there, Smith shot this original  \"Vengeance Turns Sizzle Reel\"   with Amanda as \"Mia\" in Bandera, TX in 2017.\n \"Vengeance Turns Radio Show & Podcast\"\nFour years of development led to many opportunities to refine the story, as well as exposing it to a growing number of people. Not ones to be deterred, Smith and Ruano treated the lockdown during the COVID-19 Pandemic in California as an opportunity, and revised the story again. This time, the  \"Vengeance Turns Radio Show & Podcast\" was born. \nThe print on the right was painted by Ken Meyer, Jr. as a promotional print.\n The \"Vengeance Turns Radio Show & Podcast\" was a pleasant surprise! We had a lot of fun recording it over four weekly livestream shows, then RCS edited over about another month. The shows were very well received after going live, causing the largest surge of interest in \"Vengeance Turns\", even causing our  IMDB Page  rating to reach levels reserved for films with much larger budgets and/or \"name-brand stars\". This surge led to the movie being made. \nSHOT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC & Other Challenges!\n Strangely, it was only while the world was falling apart for so many that Smith and his collaborators would finally be approached with an opportunity to get the movie on film! The budget would be far less than any of them had ever dreamed but under the circumstances, the decision was an easy one.\nChallenges pursued the whole team throughout the production. The producer who got the ball rolling bailed on the project, literally sneaking away into the night only about a week before principal photography was starting! Smith, in his relentlessness, found another producer who stepped in and made promises of replacing the locations and securing funds that had evaporated with the disappearance of the previous producer. The second producer failed to live up to their word as well, also fleeing the project. This left Smith, Ruano and collaborators with a movie IN PRODUCTION, partly filmed and suddenly having all its budget and locations again ripped away.\nThe enthusiasm for the project from ALL involved on the cast and crew resulted in a synergistic tenacity that continued to compel the film forward. Every single person involved began to scrape up what they could, calling everyone they knew, and begging anyone who would listen to help get the movie finished.\nThat group effort worked and the movie was shot over 17 days during October 2020.  Even with every curveball thrown at them, the entire cast and crew even made it through in a COVID-safe manner as well. The group developed their own protocols. Each member of cast and crew was tested and provided a negative test result before filming, then stayed in their own bubbles while on call. Everyone wore masks everywhere except in front of the camera and had their temperatures taken and recorded each day. Following wrap, everyone was tested again and provided us with negative test results as they received them.\n SUCH Wonderful Locations!\n We shot the movie in Lake Elsinore, DTLA, Koreatown, Gardena, Littlerock (Old West Town), and Big Bear, CA.\nLake Elsinore, DTLA, Koreatown, Littlerock CA, and Big Bear all on a shoestring budget!\nIn the PICTURE above: \n Sept 17 in Lake Elsinore. 1st day also shot opening sequence!\nDTLA Warehouse-- Building our \"barn\" for the climactic scene.\nKoreatown-- This house was built in 1912 and the Falcon's was supposed to be 1876. Just one of many compromises.\nMalibu Horse Ranch-- A big part of our budget went to spending 2 days to get our shots on and around horses.\nLittlerock, CA-- We also shot two days in Littlerock at an \"old west town\" for the general store, the saloon and the chapel (you will LOVE the chapel).\nGardena, CA -- We spent one whole day shooting all the scenes that are internal shots for the Ewa'as and tents/teepees.  All of this was in the backyard of our Director of Photography David Ruano's parents!\nBig Bear, CA-- This was the most beautiful two days of the whole shoot. A lot of the external wooded scenes around the \"Lost People\" camp were shot here. We even shot an entire nighttime sequence with a fight scene!\nOur Progress & Why We Need Your Support!\nSince November, the movie has gone through two edits, and is currently undergoing its third for detail work. We really have nearly EVERYTHING done! There are two key sequences that are heavier with VFX, though and additional SFX and sound details to be completed as well.\nWe want you to JOIN US in submitting \"Vengeance Turns: The Motion Picture\" to Film Festivals, and we are very focused on making \"South by Southwest (SXSW)\" our Premiere!  We want to be at these events with \"Vengeance Turns\" and we want your name on the screen at every single one--YOUR HELP MATTERS!\nDIVERSITY IN CASTING\nWhile the intent was to produce an epic, action-filled western and never to make a \"message movie\", the concept of diversity in gender, ethnicity and belief has been built into \"Vengeance Turns\" from its inception.  The lead character \"Rebecca/Mia\" is of partial Kumeyaay heritage and female, played by Paola Luelmo who was born in Mexico.\nAs \"Rebecca/Mia\", Paola is joined by her co-star Azeem Vecchio who plays Simon Coletrain. Once they are among the \"Lost People\", they are joined by an intentionally mixed group, led by \"Delicate Poison\" and \"Ghost with Silent Knives Protects\" who are children of a Kumeyaay mother and a father born in India; they are played by Kelsey Jaffer and Nevin Millan who both have parents born in Pakistan.  The character, Gloria, is of unknown Asian ancestry-- having been kidnapped into slavery as a child; she is played by Catherine Bo-Eun Song, a Korean-American female actor.\nThe rest of the cast is heavily populated by females, and individuals of about every background and orientation. Smith's feeling has always been \"the right person for the role is the right person for the role\" going so far as to rewrite characters entirely (from gender to ethnicity and more) to better suit the actor playing them, consulting with them in the process.\nMEET OUR STARS! \nPaola Luelmo plays Rebecca Falcon who after being left for dead finds new life as \"Mia\", a bloodthirsty vigilante hellbent on revenge!\n Paola Luelmo plays \"Rebecca/Mia Falcon\". Rebecca Falcon starts as a woman with strong opinions but who is somewhat reluctant to express them. In particular, she is partly of Kumeyaay heritage which she admits to knowing little about due to her father having \"whitewashed\" her thoroughly. This was as much for her protection as it was out of his own racial ignorance-- The Old West was a very dangerous place for Natives during the late 1800's. As is mentioned by characters in the movie, they are basically considered and treated as vermin to be exterminated. When Rebecca hears the gossip that it is Kumeyaay killing the families in their town, she tries to defend them but is so upset that she runs away. Later, we meet the murderous marauders masquerading as natives and they certainly are not Kumeyaay. After her attack, Mia is taken to a group believed to be Kumeyaay where she is healed and trained.\nPaola did almost all her own stunts, and trained  (See Paola train!) for two key scenes that take place in the \"Warrior's Circle\" during her training.\nAzeem Vecchio remarkably transforms his character, Simon Coletrain, from a victimized child to a man of honor throughout \"Vengeance Turns\"!\n Azeem Vecchio plays \"Simon Coletrain\". Simon experiences quite a transformative arc of his own in \"Vengeance Turns\". When we first meet him, he is so weak in the presence of his father that he literally can barely stand. However by the end of the movie, the character has grown to such a degree that he not only loses his fear of his father but confronts him unflinchingly. Simon will have audiences cheering before they leave the theater!\nNevin Millan embodied the role of \"Ghost with Silent Knives Protects\" through and through, learning specific spear and knife moves just for the role!\n Nevin Millan plays \"Ghost with Silent Knives Protects\". Ghost with Silent Knives Protects is one of the most fascinating and enigmatic characters in the film! He is half Indian/Half Kumeyaay, as is his sister \"Delicate Poison\" who is played by Kelsey Jaffer. Ghost with Silent Knives Protects plays a few very important roles in the movie, and will not be what viewers expected before it is all over!\n\nJamald Gardner will terrify you and break your heart in his role as the ultimate villain in \"Vengeance Turns\", Jefferson Coletrain!\nJamald Gardner plays \"Jefferson Coletrain\". Jamald Gardner has been involved in the project longer than any other person than Robert C Smith who he met when both worked as background actors for a Disney show! The two actors got to know each other and began discussing westerns and the fact that Smith wanted to write one-- Gardner said he had always wanted to be the \"bad guy\" in one... and the rest is history! Developing the character with Jamald along the way through the writing process created one of the deepest, most complex while still TERRIFYING villains ever to show up in any western movie! \nMoriah Hart has a sneaky role and plays a very SNEAKY Hester Blake-- she will draw you in early and make you feel so sorry for her, but have you seething before the movie ends!\n Moriah Hart plays \"Hester Blake\". Moriah Hart gets to throw one of the biggest curveballs of the whole movies at audiences as \"Hester Blake\"! She had one of the ultimate challenges in the movie: To present her character as somewhat weak, if not a little \"Karen-y\" early in the film only to return at its climax as transformed as Rebecca/Mia or Simon! Moriah Hart will leave audiences reeling as they  see her performance with Paola Luelmo as Mia Falcon in the last minutes of the movie.\nSteven Ciceron brought Sheriff Cartwright to life, and brings both peril and humor to the screen!\n Steven Ciceron plays \"Sheriff Cartwright\". Steven Ciceron was also part of the project very early on, with Smith developing the character of \"Sheriff Cartwright\" specifically for him. As with Jamald Gardner and \"Jefferson Coletrain\", Smith worked with Ciceron over the years to build out the exact character they both wanted to bring to life on the screen. As with Moriah above, no matter what you are thinking about this sheriff right now, you are DEAD WRONG, so be ready to be surprised a few times by this character and this actor!\nAside from Writing, Directing and Producing \"Vengeance Turns\", RCS also found the time to play the villainous \"Frank Effing Ford\"!\n Robert C Smith plays \"Frank Ford\" (and wrote/directed). Smith said from the very beginning of writing and developing \"Vengeance Turns\" that there would be a saloon shootout scene and he would play a character who dies a bloody death getting shot to hell and back in it! Well, he was close! He plays \"Frank Ford\" and ends up spending more time on the screen than originally planned and does not get shot at all-- but DOES DIE A BLOODY DEATH at the hands of the vengeful Mia who stabs a claw straight up through his chin and out his face! Smith was careful about everyone he brought on board with this project, wanting them all to feel more like partners and true collaborators than simply pieces he moved around on a board. The results show on the screen, as you will see soon!\nMORE About the Plot and Story in Vengeance Turns: The Motion Picture!\nRebecca Falcon is happily married in 1876 Blaketon, CA where her husband, Michael, works as an attorney for the primary business, Blake Industrial Gold Mining, Inc. Together, they have two beautiful, vibrant children-- one girl, Emma and her little brother, Edward.\nWhen the movie opens, we find out that families around this small community have been murdered and there is active gossip about local Kumeyaay being involved. Unknown to anyone outside her family, Rebecca herself is part Kumeyaay with a full-blooded grandmother whom she only barely knew.\nSO MUCH of \"Vengeance Turns\" is about the characters, and we really chose some rising stars to bring them to life in this film. Seen here, Azeem Vecchio in FX/Makeup as Simon Coletrain; Nevin Millan as Ghost with Silent Knives Protects; Stacy Marie Turner, Kate Comstock, and Moriah Hart as \"The Biddies\"; Steven Ciceron as Sheriff Cartwright, Nicholas Freedson as his deputy, and Robert C Smith as Frank Effing Ford!; Finally, Jess Be (who also produced and worked as script supervisor) played Mrs. Cartwright and Frank Vavounas as a bad guy named Buck!\nThe treatment of all natives during the late 1800\u2019s was atrocious to an extent that they were often shot on sight, treated as and referred to as \u201cvermin\u201d. From his own ignorance combined with paternal thoughts of safety for his daughter, he meticulously \u201cwhite-washed\u201d her.  Rebecca laments to her husband that she \u201cbarely knew her, but picked up what she could here and there\u201d, and cries that they are a \u201cPeaceful People\u201d, collapsing into his arms sobbing, after hearing some local biddies outside the local market bragging about their children killing Kumeyaay on their property.\nOn that very night, the murderers crash into her life, and her feelings are verified when we meet Oscar Gomez, Frank Ford, and their boss Jefferson Coletrain who brutalize the entire family, even partially scalping Rebecca before leaving them all for dead. Indeed, all are dead\u2026 except Rebecca.\nShe wakes bloody, broken, and vacant from the severe head injuries she suffered, crawling out of the debris and dead bodies that was once her life on autopilot and feral. In one of the first and primary twists of \u201cVengeance Turns\u201d, it is Simon Coletrain (the son of Jefferson Coletrain) who finds her, rescues her and helps her escape only to run into a strange tribe full of various races who refer to themselves as the \u201cLost People\u201d.\nBoth Simon and Rebecca find themselves at peace and at home among this enigmatic group who seem to be run by a young woman who is half Indian/half Kumeyaay named \u201cDelicate Poison\u201d and her brother \u201cGhost with Silent Knives Protects\u201d. (Their father was from India and their mother was Kumeyaay, which is another whole story we would love to tell you!). It is here that viewers also meet Gloria, who likes to take the teeth of those she vanquishes\u2026 for a snack!\nTop left, Mia is unimpressed when she first meets Gloria. Top right, Oscar Gomez reacts to Mia's method of questioning. Bottom left, Gloria has her own way of getting information. Bottom right, Delicate Poison and Gloria move through Blaketon.\nRebecca, who has been christened \u201cMia\u201d by Simon for reasons you will discover in the film, is healed and trained before setting out on her quest to rediscover exactly who she really is and for revenge on the men who took everything from her. Her uncontrollable bursts of rage and the hallucinations she suffers insure a wild ride for her companions and for viewers alike.\nWhile certainly a revenge western at its core, \u201cVengeance Turns\u201d twists nearly everything you thought you ever knew about these movies almost completely inside out! Everyone involved on this film feels viewers will be right on the edge of their seats until the final credits roll! \n Check out the TEASER TRAILER! \nPLAY\n\n  EXPANDED UNIVERSE-- not just an indie film! The \"Explosions of Truth OGN is coming in Winter 2021!\n\n\nSupporters of this film may be surprised to learn they are NOT supporting just a single film but the launch of an entire world! As Robert C Smith and Amanda Fry wrote the original story and first draft of the screenplay, they would often stop to discuss the motivations for certain characters which would lead to longer conversations. This resulted in their decision to do more than capture any important moments in their \"Story Outline/Bible\", and chose to compose short stories that would be told as comics at a later date. \nOne major advantage of the story taking longer to get to the screen than anticipated was having a lot of artwork completed over the past four years. Some stories such as \"Growing Pained\" featuring the character Simon Coletrain are 100% complete and ready to go! Kurt Belcher is working right now on the main story that will appear in an Original Graphic Novel being released in Winter 2021 (with story and OGN) called \"Explosions of Truth\". This story acts as a DIRECT SEQUEL to the film, while the other shorter stories like \"Growing Pained\" serve as glimpses into key moments of our characters lives leading up to the events in the film. \nThis will be a DOUBLE-PAGE Spread in the featured story in an Original Graphic Novel called \"Vengeance Turns: Explosions of Truth\"!\n We have developed so much material, and even have other writers now approaching us to pitch stories about the characters, that we know there are years and years of other exciting \"Vengeance Turns\" stories to tell in other films, short films, comics, graphic novels, podcasts and much more!\n REWARDS \n IF we break our modest goal, we have some awesome stretch goals and rewards ready to go!

Read on for details!\nCome join us, won't you?\nFront Cover\nThe Volume 1 re:VISION of The God Machine series sets the stage for an ongoing epic!\nGuy Salvatore is stricken with sadness and guilt. His world no longer makes sense. His girlfriend has died and he\u2019s seeing monsters. Are they manifestations of grief or something more? A strange man in a graveyard tells Guy that his girlfriend is indeed alive, floating in and out of the \u201cDream Worlds\u201d and that only Guy can save her! However, the Gods stand in his way of happiness. Could this be the uniting of young lovers, or the end of everything else?\nWelcome to The God Machine, a dark comedy that delves into one boy\u2019s struggles with depression and the supernatural. Populated with crazy Gods, terrible monsters, and offbeat goth friends, let us take you on a trip, around the world and back\u2026\n:::For mature readers. Strong sexual content, nudity, and language:::\nBack Cover\nWho's that creator girl?\nHi-o everyone, it\u2019s me, Chandra Free, creator of The God Machine! I am an artist/writer/creator who\u2019s worked with SYFY, Jim Henson, Archaia, Image Comics, Storm King Comics, and many more! I\u2019ve done numerous album covers, storyboards, character designs, and I was the art director for BLAM! Ventures. Pronouns: she/her.\n\nBackstory! The God Machine was originally published in late 2010, but it\u2019s origins date back to 1999, my senior year of high school. I have been formulating this epic for decades, maturing it from a high schooler\u2019s tale to a science fiction-horror-fantasy epic full of mystery, conspiracies, and deep lore.\nOriginal Cover for the Graphic Novel Published in 2010\nThe God Machine had its first outing as a preview comic in 2009, followed by a hardbound graphic novel in late 2010, then-published by Archaia. After a slew of publishing changes in the years to follow, I finally procured the rights to my creation in 2019. With The God Machine back in my hands, I decided to bring it to Machina Corpse, the spooky new comics company I formed with my partner, Stephen Emond. Here I plan to relaunch the series with The God Machine Volume 1 re:VISION and follow it up with volume 2 and beyond!\n\nWait, who are these new characters?!?\n\nThe God Machine is now back in my hands, allowing me to give you a whole new experience, a definitive version of the book with new content throughout! I'm calling all the shots! Whoa!\n\nBUT! Not only will this be a tasty treat to original fans of the book, but a perfect entry point to new readers! \n\nI started with a bold new logo for a new era, created by Phil Balsman (Eisner and Harvey Award winner for logo and book design for Attack on Titan, Akira 35th Anniversary, Magic Knight Rayearth, All-Star Superman, Witch Hat Atelier).\n\n\n I then hired prolific comic book letterer Taylor Esposito (DC Comics, Marvel, Vertigo, Vault, IDW and more!) to bring new life to the pages. \n\n\nPersonally, one of the most exciting things that I've included is all-new text and refined dialogue throughout. The entire volume has a new level of polish to it. There\u2019s stronger characterization, removal of some poorly aged content, and more overall clarity in the writing.\n\n\nScenes have been extended, new pages have been drawn, new characters debut. A new prologue sets the tone for the series. This truly is a re:Vision. In addition to all this, there\u2019s a new forward, and a new intro from myself.\n\n\nThe breakdown of what's in the book:\n\nNew covers front & back\nNew logo by Phil Balsman \nre:Lettered by Taylor Esposito  \nNew foreword by mystery person extraordinaire!\nre:Vised text - questionable content gone, stronger story & characterizations!\nre:Vised art assets\nExtended scenes \nNew comic pages \nNew prologue \nArt galore \nAuthor\u2019s intro\nOriginally 160 pages, now 180!\nWhat\u2019s not included from the original graphic novel? Character bios and pin-ups from guests.\nReturning, however, is the original foreword by Venture Brothers\u2019 own Doc Hammer.\n\nGet yo' coin purse out!\nMoney raised for The God Machine Volume 1 re:VISION kickstarter will be going toward the printing of the book in hardcover with some bells and whistles, as well as prints and reward items. It will also go towards paying for new lettering, for shipping, materials, taxes and Kickstarter fees, as well as bonus rewards and stretch goal production.\nNote! Credit Cards are ONLY charged if the project succeeds on the last day of the campaign. This is an all or nothing campaign. Meaning if we do not make our goal, this project cannot move forward, and you will not be charged. \n\nIt\u2019s full steam ahead though if we make our goal! God Machine is a go!\n\nNOTE: Please keep an eye out for updates and backer surveys after the campaign is funded. If you do not fill out your backer form within 6 months of its issue you will not receive your rewards and your pledge will count as a donation. \n\nSHIPPING: Shipping on all reward tiers is free in the United States. Add-ons have shipping, as do territories outside of the US.\nMagic... well, not really!\n\nThe book is 90% finished.

Thanks for taking a look at \u201cTales of the 399.\u201d \nWe\u2019re students at Moravian College, a small liberal arts school in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. We are a class of English majors and minors, and we all have passion for writing. Some of us have made comics before, while others have not. Throughout this semester, we\u2019ve learned a lot about the creative process of comic-making in our Comics and Graphic Storytelling class, or English 399. This collection showcases our new skills.\n\u201cTales of the 399\u201d is a collection of memoirs, each written by one of us. When choosing a personal experience to illustrate, we focused on the theme of family. Some of our stories are lighthearted, while others are more serious, but each of our unique views of family bind them together.\nWe\u2019ve never attempted to publish a book on this scale before, and we\u2019re excited for others to see and read our work! We\u2019d greatly appreciate your support, as this means a lot to us as students and as authors. Our ultimate goal is to be able to print full-color copies of our collection, to distribute copies directly to you, and to gain meaningful experience in promoting and publishing our creative labors. Putting our work out into the world for the first time is scary and exciting at the same time, and we would greatly appreciate your contribution to our journey.\nPreviews\nHere's a look at some of the eight stories included in this inaugural issue:\n\"The Art Kids\" by Grace Gilbert\n\"Luke 15:20\" by Sam Riley\n\"The Half-Beating Heart\" by Evan Yandrisovitz\n\"Same Old New Year's\" by Anna Litofsky\nRewards\nOur best reward, we hope, is the book itself! We've got both digital and print options available. In addition, we're working on making pins, stickers and prints to offer for something extra. We're also offering a limited number of signed and remarked editions. If you choose this reward, you'll received a signed book with a small head sketch on the cover from one of the artists!\nIf we reach our initial goal, we'll have a few stretch goals, too!\nAbout the creators:\nCaroline Flora (\u201cDistant Whistle\u201d) - Caroline is a senior majoring in English.

This is an incredibly personal project that spun out of a realization I had years ago: There are some days that the most horrific thing I could think of would be to sit, quietly alone with my own thoughts. I live with depression and anxiety on a daily basis and it took me a long time to get somewhere that I felt somewhat comfortable with that and started learning how to not feel like I was always alone. It took friends to help me get out of that way of thinking. Now I want to be your friend by making this awesome zine to show you that you're not alone either.\n\nWho Am I?\nI'm Justin Richards, writer of the critically acclaimed comic book series Finger Guns from Vault Comics. I spend my time writing comics, trying to be a good family man, playing video games and giving my dogs too much affection.\n\nTL/DR:\nIt's a 16 page, variety, comic zine featuring:\n Five (5) page comic story written by Justin Richards with art by Gavin Guidry (Going to the Chapel, Deadly Living) and colors by Val Halvorson (Finger Guns, The Sequels)\n Five (5) pinup images from some of the best artists in the industry today!

As a comic fan, there are so many cool design elements and visuals in golden age stories that always capture my attention- but sometimes the stories aren't quite up to 2021 expectations. I wanted to find a way to dust off all the good stuff there and bring it into a modern story... and hopefully throw in a few twists that will surprise!\nCover to We Are Scarlet Twilight #1\n\nEnter the story's hero-- Captain Lancet. He's a 1930's All-American crime buster* who accidentally creates the world's greatest villain before waking up a century in the future. He'll need to adjust to a strange new world-- Fritz Lang's Metropolis with some cyberpunk dystopia sprinkled in-- if he wants to overthrow the totalitarian vampire cult that now dominates the future.\n\n*some of these things are not, strictly speaking, the truth\n\nThe Team for We Are Scarlet Twilight \u2026 is well, just me- a jack of all trades commercial artist who loves putting together comics.  My previous comic,  August: Purgatory Underground is completed and coming out soon from Action Lab\u2019s Danger Zone imprint. While it\u2019s great having a publisher and team to work with, it seemed like the time was right to get into crowdfunding- the freedom of being able to control my book and schedule, through pandemics and other chaos, was a huge draw.  And there are so many great looking books from indie creators coming up now in the Kickstarter comics community... I wanted to be a part of it!\n\nThis campaign is my first, so I\u2019m trying to keep it my goals modest- enough to cover producing the 24 page comic, an alternate cover and a few fun extras that are a cool way to support production! Being as it\u2019s my first time out, I want to keep things simple as I find my crowdfunding sea legs, so I\u2019m printing these on demand at KaBlam, who'll ship them to you in a Gemini mailer. If this is a success- and I hope with your help it will be- for the next campaigns I\u2019ll have a better idea of what to expect, and can get these printed up in bulk and get the physical issue cost down! That all said, I'm a newish creator, We Are Scarlet Twilight is a new book, and you have a lot of other cool options for your entertainment dollar! I want my book to get out there as much as it can, so I'm keeping my digital prices at $2.\nVariant Retro Cover for We Are Scarlet Twilight #1\nWhile I want to keep a few of the plot points under wraps... I'm sure you want to see what the interior pages look like! Pages 1-5, and a few out of sequence extras that give an idea of the atmosphere but don't give away the story can be found below!\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 1\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 2\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 3\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 4\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 5\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 14 (Unlettered)\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 16 (Unlettered)\nWe Are Scarlet Twilight #1 Page 24 (Unlettered)\n\nIf you're a fan of Buck Rogers and Flash Gordon serials, Fleischer Bros Superman cartoons, Golden Age Comics or old school horror and crime stories, We Are Scarlet Twilight is made for you!  I hope you'll check it out!\n\nOne more thing... I guess it wouldn't be a good kickstarter without some kind of fun reward option. Did some research. I've seen some things you people wouldn't believe: apparel, pins... something called a waifu pillow I cannot unsee. \n\nBut that's not cool.

The funds raised through this campaign will fund the production and printing of the graphic novel and rewards. We have scheduled a realistic production timetable of the book that will allow the creators to produce top notch work while also delivering the final product to our backers in a very reasonable amount of time.\n\nAlex Segura, Sean HusVar, and everyone on the team understand the trust that it takes for you to back our work. We will do everything we can to complete and ship the project on time. However, several of our recent projects have run into unanticipated delays, specifically related to the Covid-19 pandemic, and we need to acknowledge that the pandemic continues to provide a degree of unpredictability in the day-to-day production of projects. In case of delay, we will always strive to be transparent and keep our backers updated throughout production.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "The Sidekick", "descp": "Cap had Bucky.

Most of you know us as the mighty vegan food truck that could, with a small crew. After almost 4 years as a food truck, it's time for us to take the next leap and become a restaurant, or Cycle Dogs can\u2019t live on.\nCycle Dogs Hot Dog Cart\nThe Story\nPicture this: Keaton (CD Owner) working a corporate desk job at an architectural firm, many steps removed from seeing anyone tangibly enjoying his work. He then decided to parlay his love of cooking, commitment to a vegan lifestyle, and knack for bicycles, to start a food business. Cycle Dogs was born, as Seattle\u2019s first all-vegan hot dog stop. (A vegan diet has nearly half the carbon footprint of a traditional omnivore diet, and for many it\u2019s also about compassion and personal health.)\nCycle Dogs Food Truck\nKeaton was on his way, living the dream of sharing his experience of delicious vegan food with fellow vegans, and with vegetarians and vegan-curious alike. Two years after starting the cart, he made the big move onto the food truck, with regular staff, and a larger menu. Through lots of hard work and dedication in the three and a half years since, Cycle Dogs has gone through growing pains, triumphs and setbacks, learning and improving along the way. We\u2019ve tried some crazy things from veganizing entire chain copycat menus to German Oktoberfest fare - working fairs and corporate events, and our amazing recent run of trying out some chick'n sandwiches.\nCycle Dogs Food\nWhen you make something in the food services world, you get to see the impact of your work. At Cycle Dogs, we love bringing happiness to people through food. We\u2019ve been blessed with an amazing expanding family of customers, who have motivated us to keep getting better (and more creative!) at what we do. We always feel excited and privileged when Cycle Dogs is a customer\u2019s first touchstone of vegan choices.\nWith our successes of the last few months, it has become clear that we've outgrown the truck. We have busted our rumps, but have sometimes really struggled to keep up with demand at peak times.\nCycle Dogs Food\nWhy should I help? \nThe next chapter for Cycle Dogs to grow would be to serve out of a restaurant, with a larger kitchen, to offer broader menu and service options to a wider audience, and to be able to introduce veganism and vegan food to even more people! The Cycle Dogs community is vast, filled with amazing customers who are extremely supportive of our food, our journey, and who share our passion for vegan fare. As a person who loves food and/or vegan food, we would LOVE your help and support as we try to bring and widen our passion in the greater Seattle area. \n\nWhat will I get out of helping Cycle Dogs?\nYou will get our many many thanks for supporting our small business and helping to bring our dreams to life!!! In terms of Kickstarter rewards, you have the options for the following depending on the reward level you choose: (Please see Rewards options; it's a top menu item on a mobile device, or it's on the right on the desktop version)\nOur thanks and appreciation, expressed via email and social media!\nCustom Founder Tile on the wall of the restaurant\nCycle Dogs face mask\nA dozen bottles of any of our house-made sauces\nCycle Dogs T-shirt or apron\nPhoto(s) you take, installed on a tiled photo wall for our 1-year anniversary\nMeal and Masks for Two\nPrivate Dinner for Two\nCommemorative Investor Tile on the wall of the restaurant\nPrivate Party for up to 35 at the restaurant\n\nWhat will my contribution bring Cycle Dogs?\nWe\u2019ve signed a lease, but need your help to equip the kitchen:\nGas range + install\nFryers + install\nPrep fridge\nWorktop fridge\nPrep tables\nShelving for the walk-in\nKitchen shelving\nGrease trap cleaning\nIce machine\nCommercial mixer\n8 tap draft fridge\nReach-in freezer\nHeat lamp w/ shelf\n3 compartment sink and faucet + install\n1 prep sink + install\n1 hand wash sink + install\nFire extinguishers \nFire suppresion system adjustments\nCycle Dogs will cover:\nFurniture\nPermits\nPatio\nDecor + Renovation\n  OK, I\u2019m with you so far. But I have to know, where will you be located?!\nNew restaurant space in Ballard\nThis part is truly exciting for us, for several reasons. We\u2019ll be moving into a little place in Ballard, right off NW Market Street, on 17th Avenue NW. You might know it as the former home of the No Bones Beach Club! There's something extra special about moving into this space.\nAs many of you know, the Cycle Dogs food truck was once the No Bones truck, where they got their start!! It feels right to maintain the vegan legacy of that restaurant space.\nWhen will you open?\nOur target date for opening in the new space will be April 12th!  We will of course send updates to all backers and post important updates on this page.\n\nWhy, and why now?\nKeaton and the team - and our families - are deeply thankful for how far Cycle Dogs has been able to come, with the support of our amazing customers.\nThe food business is hard work! Food truck life brings with it a whole list of additional hurdles to jump on a weekly or daily basis. Emptying and filling the water tank, getting propane, frequent shopping runs, tight work spaces, weather extremes, dead batteries, you name it.  The things that could have gone sideways, did and it was always when we least expected it. \nThe core crew stuck it out through the adjustments needed to keep us going during the pandemic. Some of them have been along for the adventure for tours of one, even two years.  They\u2019re thrilled at the idea of being able to show up to work in a predictably dry and warm building with reliable plumbing and electricity, with more space for food prep/service and to work. We hope it will be a better experience for everyone.\nCycle Dogs Food\nLet\u2019s unleash the full potential of Cycle Dogs in Seattle!\nWe understand we\u2019re still in a pandemic, and that times are still weird and uncertain. There\u2019s no \u201cbest time\u201d to make this move, but this is where we're at. This is what we need. And we're turning to you guys for help getting us there because we\u2019ve already availed ourselves as much as we can sustain with loans and reliance on bank capital.\n\nWhat next?\nA big part of Cycle Dogs is capturing that nostalgic feeling of having a good fast food or comfort meal, and offering it in a vegan context. We know we will continue in that spirit, anchored in what you know as \u201cCycle Dogs.\u201d A restaurant space will enable us to get even more creative with what we can offer you, and to try new things for you to enjoy with us.\nWe\u2019ll provide regular updates!\n\nWhat will you do with the extra money if you exceed your goal?\nWe will go for a stretch goal! There is a lot of renovation work we need to do in the dining area and outdoor patio. A stretch goal could help us reduce our loan amount to finish the space!\n\nWhat happens if you fail to meet your goal?\nIf we don\u2019t make our fundraising goal, Cycle Dogs will not live on. The bottom line is that being a food truck isn't sustainable for us and down the line we will probably have to close.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven that we are in a pandemic, we understand that challenges lie ahead.

It is 8-pages long, but that's just the comics part.  There's also a cover and a back cover and some other words my Dad told me to write on the inside so everyone knows I'm the one who made it.  \n5.5\" x 8.5\", 8-page, black and white, comic book +cover\nIn the story, there's this guy with a horn, his name is Honk, and he has some friends named Pig and G.  \"G\" stands for goat, but he doesn't exactly look like a goat.  And there's also a bully when they go to this school.  He's not very nice, but the story kind of shows what to do in a situation like that.\n\nI'm a 7-year-old boy and I'm good at Math and I like to draw.  It's nice to draw.  And also I'm a tall kid in my class.  My name is Owen.  \n\nWhy I'm sending this out is because it's not a good thing to be bullied.  You should stand up to that bully if they are bullying you or someone else.  If you see a bully bullying someone else, then you are a bystander and you should report the bullying, the same as if someone was bullying you.\n\n\nHonk and Freands - \"Jungle Gym\", full-color, limited-edition, 5.5\" x 8.5\", print.\nAuthor with Original Artwork (8.5\" x 11\", marker and crayon)\n\nMe and my dad are printing Honk comic books so we can send them out to people.  My dad has some experience making and giving comics to people.  He's a comic artist, he makes watches, and he even has some comics classes that he teaches.\n\nMy parents asked me how much money I would be happy with.  $20 sounds like a lot to me, so that's what my dad put as our goal.\n\nAfter we make the books, then we will send them out to people who would like the Honk comic.  My dad has this weigher thing just for mail, so we can weigh it and then we will know how much it costs to mail it.  Then we can just mail it to people who want it.  \n\nThis is the way we think our plan will happen:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHm...well, some risks and challenges that I might include are that the comic we send off to you in the mail might come a little bit late, because our mail service is a little behind these days because a lot of people don't want to go to the store. So, the mail people have a lot on their shoulders. Like me, I had to wait for a remote control stunt car that took 3 more days than what they told me. So when we mail the books it might take a little while. But to help that, me and my dad are saying, \"Maybe it'll take one or two weeks longer,\" just so we have enough time. He says this is a contingency. \n\nSomething else I wanted to say is that the entire comic book is already drawn, so you won't have to wait for me to finish that.\n\nAnother risk could be, you know, what if our printer doesn't have any printing-out stuff. But to make sure that doesn't happen, we have an extra load of that stuff that helps the printer print stuff out. \n\nMy dad is also helping me a lot by printing the comic and typing what I say here. My mom said she would help, too, but I don't know with what part. Maybe stapling the comics and packing them up. So, it's not just me working on this.

Jaded after millenia of destruction and death, Xolotl hid away and watched his family sacrifice themselves in the name of hope for life beyond themselves.\nXolotl, alone and ashamed, became racked with guilt, causing him to weep so intensely that his eyes fell from his head and descended to the center of the newly forged universe: the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.\nSeeing an opportunity to redeem himself, to honor the sacrifice of his family, Xolotl guided the Aztecs to forge two macahuitl, imbued with a piece of his own godhood. The Left and Right Eye of Xolotl, entrusted to twin siblings to wield together in defense of the Fifth Sun, became known as...The Twin Blades.\nArt by Julio Suarez and Rocco Langg, logo by Andrea Rosales\nNow in the year 2108, the blades are entrusted to twins Xiomara and Basilio Gutierrez who inherited them as children. Xiomara is strong willed, determined, and believes in herself. She's committed to her role as wielder and her sworn purpose of defending the Fifth Sun...but Basilio? Well, there isn't exactly a bunch of threats to the Sun running around and he's ready to move on with his life. Leaving his role as Wielder behind to pursue his goal of becoming a teacher, Basilio strains his relationship with his sister. \n\nUnfortunately, things are rarely so simple. The Lord of the North himself TEZCATLIPOCA sees a distracted pantheon and a set of divided Wielders as an opportunity to mobilize his pawn YAOTL: a resurrected traitorous Jaguar Warrior now obsessed with never returning to Mictl\u0101n, the land of the dead. Yaotl is bestowed with a blade forged from the primordial Black itself and sets out to destroy the Fifth Sun and create a new universe for Lord Tezcatlipoca.\n\nCan Xiomara and Basilio stop arguing long enough to stop Tezcatlipoca's champion? Even if they can...will it be enough?\n\nTHE TEAM\nThe Twin Blades is a latine story and is proudly produced by an entirely latine team of creators:\nWritten by Jarred Luj\u00e1n: Jarred is a Mexican-American comic writer from the promised land of Texas. A 2019 Mad Cave Studios winner, he broke onto the comics scene with the four-issue mini-series Dry Foot. He likes the Wu-Tang Clan and existentialism. \n\nArt by Julio Suarez: Julio Suarez is a Mexican illustrator, having worked his whole life towards becoming a comic book artist, his passion for drawing has allowed him to work for companies such as Upperdeck Ent. and Cryptozoic Ent. as a sketch card artist, working with licenses such as Marvel and DC Comics, as well as freelance illustration work the last couple of years, now making his debut in the comic industry with \u201cThe Twin Blades\u201d as an artist, he is ready to show the world what he can do!\n\nColors by Rocco Langg: Based in Mexico City, she has worked on several comics ranging from commercial work for Mexican companies to her interactive IG comic Goodbye and Fuck You! She has a passion for sci fi and vibrant colors.\n\nLetters by Gabriela Downie: From California, Gabriela has been in the comic industry for 7 years. She's done a little bit of everything including production art, cover art, and lettering. Her work includes Harleen, Beast Boy Loves Raven, Punchline, and Batman '89.\n\nTHE SWORDS\nThe LEFT EYE of XOLOTL, wielded by main character XIOMARA\nThe RIGHT EYE of XOLOTL - Wielded by main character Basilio\nThe blades of THE TWIN BLADES\nTHE PREVIEW PAGES \nTHE PRONUNCIATIONS\nWhile you wait for THE TWIN BLADES to hit your eyeballs, learn to pronounce some of the more intimidating words for English speakers:\nXolotl\nTezcatlipoca\nMacuahuitl\nXiomara", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks are minimal.

Dance is something that is seen as beautiful, but many don\u2019t think about the pain that is done to one\u2019s body to truly be a dancer. Martial arts are thought of as violent because it\u2019s a form of \u201cfighting\u201d, but there\u2019s also a dance like quality to this work of art.\nBut once you dig deeper, the reader will quickly realize that The Dancer is actually a story about mental health. Mia is forced to face her own childhood trauma of witnessing her parents\u2019 murder when she becomes the enemy that she once dedicated her life to fight against.

He's a heroic firefighter, father of five, SWAT trainer, amateur MMA champion and armored combat enthusiast. Daniel is also a former military sniper, with combat, security, rescue and recovery experience in the middle east and Tibet. Frankly, Daniel is as close to a superhero as there is! \nBut SOLDIER is about much more than him. In the past 8 years, he's lost 9 of his close friends to suicide. And that\u2019s the reason he's partnered with me to tell his story. \nPLAY\n\nThis is a story about getting back up.\nDaniel wrote this to me early on, and it's worth repeating here. \"This isn\u2019t just a story about war\u2026 or being a veteran. This is a story about suffering through trauma. This is about a world of people who silently struggle through the pain of PTSD. It\u2019s about those of us who get up, focus our sights on the horizon\u2026 and soldier on.\" \nWe're going to be getting into this stuff. I'll be interviewing family, friends and coworkers. We'll all be talking about loss and fortitude... straight up and honestly. And we'll be filming a lot of awesomeness! For example: one of Daniel's current pastimes featured below.\nPLAY\n\nThis is a story about action.\nI\u2019ve been making award-winning films for almost 20 years, and I\u2019ve never been more focused on a project. I have a largely volunteer team of incredible creators working with me to record all aspects of Daniels\u2019 life, and we\u2019ve received permission to capture some of the most amazing things you\u2019ll ever see on film. We're talking everything from SWAT courses to one-on-one armored combat trials in a literal ring of fire.\nI've also gathered - and am working with a team to professionally scan - thousands of pictures, along with archiving countless hours of old footage of Daniel's life and travels. \nDaniel's favorite photograph.\nThis is a story that deserves to be told. \nI've spent almost half a year building the team, outlining the 2021 schedule and shooting tests for SOLDIER... and we are ready to launch! Our budget includes everything to make the film I want to make: multiple field and interview days, storage drives for an extraordinary amount of 4K footage, archival still and video clean-up, editing, audio mixing, an original score, color correction sessions... and even an initial round of film festival submissions. It ALSO includes the 10% that goes to Kickstarter and charge fees, as well as taxes. Come join us on this adventure.

Absent for centuries from the far-off galaxy of the Morrigen people, the Solavore had disappeared into the realm of myth. But now, with one of their solar systems facing a cosmic loss, the Morrigen are learning that the Solavore is not only real... but hungry.\n\n WHO IS HUNTING IT? \nFor years, the Galactic Kingdom of the Morrigen had been protected by its latest ruler, the brave and brilliant KING THEOSIS. Committed to the freedom and safety of his people, King Theosis has lead the Morrigen through decades of darkness, striving toward a future of progress and peace. But after so many battles, Theosis's beard has gone white; the grip on his sword has grown weaker.  And after a devastating personal loss, Theosis must summon a strength he's never known to defeat the worst threat the Morrigen have ever seen.\nFortunately for Theosis, his husband ABBINOIR will be there to help. Wise and compassionate as any ruler his people have served, Abbinoir is Theosis's personal strength. While the king is looking out for the kingdom, Abbinoir looks out for its king. And though he's been doing it for all of Theosis's reign, every new threat weighs more on his mind, none more so than the Solavore. After all, how can you protect a man who must protect a kingdom?\nNot that he won't have help. In facing this unheard-of crisis, Theosis will have at his command some of the best warriors in the entire galaxy: his own royal guard and the elite female warriors known as the VALKINAE. Together, they make up the best defense the Morrigen have.\nBut will they be enough?\n\nSNEAK PREVIEW\nCheck out some of the (not finalized) pages of HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE.\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n WHO IS CREATING HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE? \nLANE LLOYD - Creator of the weird and zany, Lane is an up and coming artist with an energetic, off the wall style. After being featured on Comic Book Yeti, Outright Geekery, and The Driving Creators Network, Lane's comic GOD-PUNCHER smashed its way onto Kickstarter, receiving more than double the projected amount of funding.  With HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE, Lane uses their skill of designing strange, larger-than-life characters to tell a story that's both firmly planted in the horror genre and stretched to the outer limits of science fiction.\nGRANT DeARMITT - Grant's tales of the sinister and strange have been published at Haw Creek Horror, Crystal Lake Publishing, and Black Hole Entertainment.  A lifelong fan of weird fiction and fantasy epics, Grant hopes HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE will present the human side of cosmic terror; an otherworldly story that hits home.\n\nWHY ARE THEY CREATING IT?\nKing Theosis's ship. For interplanetary travel... and beyond.\nLane and Grant have spent two years developing the shocking showdown of Theosis and the Solavore. They made this Kickstarter to bring that story to life in the form it deserves: the comic book format.  But there is another reason. \nHUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE is just one story of thousands set in this all-new universe that Lane and Grant have cooked up. Getting it created, printed, and into the hands of readers like yourself is the first step in telling those tales. We believe that comic fans are hungry for new worlds and new terrors, and we believe we have some great ones to offer.\nSo by backing this project, you're not just helping us make a comic.

See the new stretch goals in the Rewards section below!\nLondon, 1914 - Major Sheffield Holmes, nephew to the great detective, and his mysterious American partner Capt. Imogen Watson have uncovered a secret society known as \"The Moriarty,\" a dark cabal that has vowed revenge on the Holmes family. Joined by the gruff Det. Inspector Agamemmnon J. Brick of Scotland Yard and the resourceful mechanic Juliette McKinnon, the new Holmes and Watson must defeat the zealot known only as \"The Scholar\" and prevent Europe from descending into war!\nMAJOR HOLMES & CAPTAIN WATSON #3-4 picks up right where we left off and completes the first arc of the series, known as \"The Adventure of the Vengeful Scholar.\" Having discovered the existence of the villainous cabal known as \"The Moriarty,\" fanatical followers of the long-dead Napolean of Crime, the new Holmes and Watson must rely on their friends and their skills to uncover their nefarious plan and rescue someone very important to Sheffield Holmes.  But will the dark secrets in each of their pasts unravel the nascent 6th Special Intelligence Service? Issue 3 is a 24-page thriller that continues the tale, and the jam-packed 36 page Issue #4 brings the shocking conclusion to life. That's 60 pages of comics, what a deal!\n\nMajor Holmes & Captain Watson is a true labor of love for me, as a writer. I've wanted to tell this story since I was 9 years old when my Grandmother gave me a copy of The Complete Sherlock Holmes. I fell in love with the Great Detective then, and have reread his adventures over and over.  When (most of) the Holmes canon became public domain, I decided I wanted to put a new twist on the old tales, to create a new Holmes and Watson that shook up old ideas. Sheffield Holmes and Imogen Watson are equals, more than anything else, real partners and friends who rely on each other. They are both great detectives and skilled spies as well, and England will soon need them. They also each old dark secrets about themselves...\nCheck out a preview of Issue #3 below. \n\u201cI could tell from the first page of the preview art that I'd be into this\u2026 take(s) well-worn characters and remix(es) them in surprising ways\u201d - SYFY Wire.\n\n\"Stepping out from the shadow of giants is hard, but Jeff and Ismael have done a tremendous job in doing just that. A story that feels Sherlockian, but steps onto its own path with its own characters in its own story\" - Jarred Luj\u00e1n, writer - DRY FOOT (Mad Cave Comics)\n\n\u201cMajor Sheffield Holmes is not the Holmes you\u2019re expecting\u2026 Like his famous uncle he\u2019s intelligent, inquisitive, and quick-witted. Also like his Uncle his secrets run deep\u2026 Ismael Canales makes excellent choices regarding character expressions and level of detail.\u201d - WhatchaReading.com \nissue #3 cover by Ismael Caneles and Roger Sorruca\nIssue #4 cover, by Ismael Canales and Roger Sorruca\nSTRETCH GOALS ADDED!\nWe breezed past the goal so quickly we barely got time to tease these, but they have been added now! \nTHIRD STICKER DESIGN / PHONE CALENDAR WALLPAPERS ADDED!\n We'll be adding the third sticker to every tier that gets the pack. Every physical tier that doesn't include the whole pack will get at least one random sticker! And the digital tiers will be getting very cool digital phone wallpapers as well.\nThe NEW Major Holmes Sticker pack. Check out that Brick sticker!\n\nTHIRD NEW INTELLIGENCE PRINT ADDED, ALL PRINTS INCREASED TO FULL 8\"X10\"\nIn addition to intel on the villain known as \"The Scholar\" and Holmes & Watson's famous motorcycles, we'll add the detailed file on the Armaments of the 6th S.I.S. to the Special Dossier.  We're also increasing the size of these prints to full 8x10!\nWe're adding two VERY LIMITED EDITION Artists COMMISSION TIERS to the campaign. \nSeries artist Ismael Canales will provide FOUR one-of-a-kind 8x10 Commissions for lucky collectors! Each will feature one character of the backers choosing, be it a favorite from Major Holmes & Captain Watson, or any other character you're a fan of. Each Commission will feature ONLY a single character and, to quote Ismael \"I always add something in the background, to add context; I don\u00b4t like the character to be \"floating\" in the blank of the paper.\" Check out the image below to see something similar Ismael did for me personally!\nClick the image to see a higher-resolution version. It's really quite something.\nThese tiers have a slightly higher shipping cost, as all the commissions have to be shipped from Spain to Florida to be added to packages and then shipped on to backers. They will also deliver a little more slowly, as Ismael will wait to ship them to me until they are all complete. We'll keep backers updated on shipping dates, we think we've overestimated so as not to disappoint.\nAt this level, we're upgrading all the physical books to an upgraded 80# Premium Covers Stock. This will give every issue a premium look and feel beyond a typical floppy comic and make these Kickstarter Editions true collector's items. This is the same grade cover stock we upgraded to for #1-2, but we MAY go with a less glossy page and more of a matte to make them easier to sign! THESE BOOKS WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE in this format from us!\n This is really something special. At this level, we're unlocking PHYSICAL printing of the 2nd Major Holmes & Captain Watson prose short story available in our top TWO tier sets. This will come in a collectible 5.25\" x 8\" booklet with a 10pt gloss cover with special cover! But we're not just giving cool things to the top-tier folks. The DIGITAL PDF of the short story, written by series writer Jeff Rider, will now also be available in EVERY DIGITAL REWARDS PACKAGE. That's right, every single backer will get some version of this story now! In addition, every package that includes all 4 issues will get the digital version of the FIRST Sheffield Holmes prose short \"The Adventure of the Errant Slipper\" by Jeff Rider. \nCheck out our latest update for all the details on Add-Ons, now available directly on the Kickstarter platform!\nNew Swag!\nWe've got some really great stuff planned, both for folks who've already read our first two issues and newcomers who want to get hold of the entire first arc.  There are also early bird tiers and some special add-ons and new stretch goals coming.  Here's a quick peek at the prototype 6th S.I.S. pocket notebooks! \nThe 6th S.I.S. Officers Field Notebook, lined on the inside (pen for scale only, final product may vary)\n The \"Brick Series\" alt-covers return!\nWe're excited to have two new alt-covers featuring fan-favorite character Agamemnon J. Brick, Scotland Yards biggest, baddest Detective Inspector! With art once again by Michael Dorman, these rare editions will feature colors by Anthony Lee. They'll be previewed here and added as stretch goals and add-ons once the campaign is live. Here's a  preview of the Alt Cover for #3, it's a work in progress, and we'll update this as it develops, but this is pretty close to the final version!\nBrick got SHOT, and he is NOT happy about it!\n Check out the Special Dossier packaging and print sets, with new prints for this campaign.\nPLAY\n\n Here's the full list of Rewards! Plus we'll open the Add-On store with more awesome stuff like the Alt-covers once the campaign has funded!\nJeff Rider - is a writer living in Orlando who publishes his comics in print and digitally at CloudwranglerComics.com and on ComiXology. Jeff has been telling stories since he could talk and loves collaborative art in all its forms. In addition to Major Holmes & Captain Watson he\u2019s the writer of the urban fantasy series The Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast with artist Davide Puppo (successfully funded via Kickstarter), the sci-fi adventure Gravity Matters with Sean Dillon (also a successful Kickstarter), and many more comics to be collected in an anthology of shorts coming this year.\nIsmael Canales - Ismael has worked with independent publishers both from the USA and Spain (ECV Press, Diabolo Ediciones, NowEvolution, Marauder Film), mainly in comic book anthologies with short stories. He started collaborating with Butxido Agency, and since then he has worked in the comics Athena Voltaire (ActionLab) and The Catch (Kickstarter) and is also currently working on a graphic novel for Dolmen Editorial (Spain). He lives in his hometown with his lovely girlfriend and their little (and evil) bunny, Guantes.\nRoger Sorruca - Roger Sorruca is an Illustrator, digital artist, and comics colorist living and working in Barcelona, Spain. In addition to Major Holmes & Captain Watson, he is the colorist for Athena Voltaire (Action Lab.)\nJustin Birch - Justin Birch is a  2018 Ringo Award-nominated letterer born and raised in the hills of West Virginia. Lettering comics since 2015, he is a member of the lettering studio AndWorld Design and has worked with DC, IDW, Dynamite, Lion Forge Comics, Mad Cave Studios, Action Lab Comics, DMC Comics, Source Point Press, Z2 Comics, and numerous indy publishers. Justin still lives in West Virginia, only now it\u2019s with his loving wife, daughter, and their dog, Kirby.\nEveryone knows that comics don't get made cheaply. When I created these books, I wanted to make sure that the artists got paid for their work upfront, and at a fair market rate. The majority of the money raised during this campaign goes to cover those artistic costs, cash that goes straight to Ismael, Roger, and Justin plus all the talented artists making art for Alt-Covers and stretch goals. They're the folks who made this story so awesome to read and look at. The rest are costs associated with the physical production of the books and other rewards like packaging, prints, etc. As the creator of Major Holmes & Captain Watson,  I don't take a page rate for myself on these books. Rather, as with every other campaign, any money raised beyond our goal goes to fund future issues of Major Holmes & Captain Watson! Rest assured, while these books are the end of this story arc, this is only the beginning of their adventures. \n (This is subject to change, and we'll update this section as the campaign progresses.)\nFeb 16\n\u2022 The campaign launches, with issue #3 already complete. \n\u2022 Issue #4 writing and line art also already complete.\nGoal reached\n\u2022 Orders for swag and other non-book rewards go out to suppliers as SOON as we hit our funding goal! These are sometimes slower than printing, so we don't want to wait.\nBeginning of March\n\u2022 Coloring work on issue #4 begins.\nBeginning of April\n\u2022 Issue #4 lettering begins.\nMid-April\n\u2022 Issue #3 and #4 go to the printers.\nEarly-Mid May\n\u2022 Rewards begin shipping!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo far the risk and challenges to Major Holmes & Captain Watson #'s 3-4 are very few. As you can see from the timeline above, the books are already very nearly complete. Coloring and lettering of issue #4, back matter creation, and layout are the only things left to complete before the books go to the printer. Some additional digital and comics perks like prints, custom packaging, and stretch goal rewards will be the only items to be created after the project ends, due to needing to know the total number of backers and so forth.\n\nThese orders will come while we're still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we're working with a printer we trust, and they assure us delays are unlikely. This is our second time with this particular printer and they were great back in Nov 2020, so we expect more of the same.\n\nThis is also my fifth Kickstarter and the second for the Major Holmes series and is similar in scope to our previous projects. Those projects funded quickly, and all digital and physical rewards were shipped within the promised deadlines, less than three months after the end of the campaign. I've learned the value of making sure that the comic is almost entirely complete before launching a campaign means a really quick turnaround time and rapid rewards delivery. The few hiccups from our earlier endeavors became teachable moments for this one, so I expect even more smooth sailing. As always, should the unexpected happen, we'll keep everyone updated.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "See, and Observe", "descp": "Get a DRM free PDF of Major Holmes & Captain Watson #3 and #4.

We\u2019re thrilled beyond belief that so many of you joined us in White Ash to get to know Glarien. If you missed this kickstarter, we\u2019ll be back again soon with more White Ash.\n\nHello everyone, we're thrilled to be back on Kickstarter for the 8th time to launch GLARIEN, an all-new comic book miniseries for mature readers set in the White Ash Universe. \nWritten by Charlie Stickney, with art by Romina Moranelli, colors by Fin Cramb and letters by Conor Hughes, the 40 Page first issue of Glarien follows the early days of White Ash's most dangerous elf, as told through the eyes of Rachel, a young woman living in 1970's New York City.  Think Red Sonja meets Taxi Driver... but with Elves and demons.\nGlarien: Chapter One cover by series artist, Romina Moranelli\nIf you\u2019re returning to the White Ash Universe, THANK YOU so much. We owe everything to our Kickstarter community. If you're new to White Ash, WELCOME.  Glarien is a stand alone miniseries where you don't have to be well-versed in White Ash lore to enjoy the ride. But, if you want to get caught up on all things White Ash, we'll have tiers for that, or you can grab the single issues directly from Scout Comics. \nSo beyond the tagline, what's Glarien about?  \nGlarien follows the stories of two women and the different paths they take to overcome life-altering tragedies. Jumping from the elf realm of ancient Alfheim to the gritty streets of New York City circa 1971, two seemingly-unrelated tales will slowly weave together to reveal a critical piece of White Ash's complicated past. Oh, and because Glarien is involved, expect carnage... lots and LOTS of carnage. \nFor those readers coming from White Ash, we do want to reiterate, Glarien is a more MATURE book.  White Ash follows Aleck and Lillian, two PG-13 characters in an R-rated world.  Glarien is an R-Rated character... in an R-rated world.  And as such, to appropriately tell that story, there are themes that are intrinsic to her character that need to be explored. But perhaps the best way of showing you all what Glarien is all about is to jump right into an...\n EPIC 15 PAGE PREVIEW \n That's a good question.  And you'll find that answer inside...\nWe appreciate the motto, \"Go big or go home.\" All of our books are solid reads.  Not wanting to buck that trend, Glarien: Chapter One clocks in at --  FORTY-FREAKING-PAGES.  And that kind of content deserves a premium paper weight.\nWe print DOMESTICALLY (so you get your books quicker) on a heavy 80 lb glossy paper stock with a cover on 100 lb glossy cover stock. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the  difference.\nTo help introduce Glarien to a larger audience, we've brought in a slew of talented women (and White Ash's Conor Hughes) to do variant covers for us to showcase her stylings. \nThe first variant cover is a virgin variant from Rosi K\u00e4mpe (Spider Gwen, Extraordinary X-Men, Destiny NY) focusing on the dual worlds narrative of the Glarien storyline. \nRosi K\u00e4mpe Variant Cover\nOur second variant comes from the jaw-dropping color pallet of Liana Kangas (Star Wars Adventures, 2000 AD, TRVE KVLT, She Said Destroy).\nLiana Kangas Variant Cover\nUp third, we have a haunting, Rachel-centric cover from White Ash's Conor Hughes. \nConor Hughes Variant Cover\nAnd last, but certainly not least, from Yishan Li (Hellboy, Buffy, Swing), a virgin variant of Glarien in action.\nYishan Li Variant Cover\nJUST UNLOCKED.  A COVER BY IVAN TAO\nIvan Tao Variant Cover\nThis stretch goal cover is even more limited.  We only have 35 available to backers as a reward tier.  However it CAN be selected as part of the Pick Two reward and comes as part of the ALL FIVE (now six) COVERS reward.\nWe love packing our campaigns with extra goodness.  IN ADDITION to Glarien: Chapter one, our reward tiers are filled with goodies.  Here's what you can get this time around.\nAll backers receiving physical rewards will get a 6\" x11\" print of our kickstarter page banner image on glossy card-stock.  On top of that, Conor will sign & number copies for the first 300 print backers.\nGet to know Glarien.  All backers will receive this digital bundle of Glarien's previous appearances (White Ash 1/2, Glarien 1220, and Glarien 1880).\nHeads, NYC. Tails you're in Alfheim. No matter how it lands, you win, as ALL physical backers in the Variant Cover Tier (or higher) will receive this limited edition, 1.5\" commemorative Two Worlds Coin. It can also be added on to any physical tier.\nNew to White Ash?  Catch up in style with our 200 page, oversized (7.75\" x11.25\") hardcover collecting the first arc of White Ash.  That's over 2lbs of White Ash goodness delivered straight to your door.  This is a beautiful book you'll be happy to have on your coffee table or adorning your shelf. \nGet a sketch cover of Glarien: Chapter One  drawn by White Ash series artist, Conor Hughes.  Conor will take (reasonable) requests as to the subject mater. There are ONLY 20 of these available. A must have for collectors.\nWe know what it's like to open up a package and find a mangled Kickstarter comic inside. We pack our books with the care that we used in making the comic and the love that we have for our backers.\nEach comic is bagged, boarded front and back and sent in stay-flat packaging. Multiple issue orders will be mailed in our custom-made, comic boxes. Made in White Ash means everything from the content, to the mailers we use, meets our standards of quality.\nWe LOVE stretch goals.  And if we're lucky enough to reach our initial funding goal, we'll unlock a slew of really cool mystery extra rewards for our backers.\nStretch Goal #1 ($15,000) Thank you, thank you very much UNLOCKED\nEvery physical blacker will receive a 6x9, custom Glarien Pin-up by Yasm\u00edn Flores Monta\u00f1ez commemorating the campaign reaching its funding goal. \nStretch Goal #2 ($20,000) Stuck though you UNLOCKED\nEvery physical backer will be receiving a contour-cut sticker based on Glarien as she\u2019s featured on the cover of the Scout one-shot.\nStretch Goal #3 ($25,000) Step by Step UNLOCKED\nThis one is for all the process junkies. Every backer will receive a behind-the-scenes PDF showing the different stages of 16 curated pages from Glarien as they go from script, to layout, to inks and finally to color.\nStretch Goal #4 ($30,000) Might I Have Some More, Sir UNLOCKED\nEvery backer will receive an extra, all-new, digital Glarien short story drawn by the incredible Emily Pearson. This will be added to the haul you\u2019re already taking home. \nStretch Goal #5 ($36,500) Cover Upgrade, UNLOCKED. \nWe are adding a spot UV finish to to the main Romina Moranelli cover.\nStretch Goal #6 $40,000 Get to know us faster UNLOCKED\nIf you back at a catch up tier, we will be mailing those books out first.  That way, you can dive into the White Ash universe and have something to read while we're getting Glarien ready for print.\nStretch Goal #7 $46,000 Who wants another cover UNLOCKED\nA new cover by Ivan Tao has been unlocked.  You can select this as a reward.  It also can be selected as part of the pick two package.  And our ALL FIVE covers is now our ALL SIX.  Anyone who pledges at the ALL FIVE COVERS Tier will automatically get this one as well. \nStretch Goal #8 $52,000 MYSTERY STRETCH GOAL\nWill This Series Be Available Through Stores?\nYes!  But not for a while (at least until mid-2022).  We LOVE our partnership with Scout Comics.  Scout has expanded the reach of White Ash, putting us into shops across the country.  In fact, we're betting some of you reading this now, may have just picked up the Scout Glarien one-shot last week. (NOTE: THIS SERIES is all new) But we also have a very loyal audience here on Kickstarter that's been with us since the beginning.  And we want to honor that legacy by bringing new White-Ash related content to you first.  \nThrough limited-runs and exclusive-editions on this platform, we're able to put together the high-quality content that our fans are used to, and make sure our collaborators are paid wages commensurate with their talent.  Simply put, without Kickstarter, we (and many other creators working today) couldn't afford to make these issues at the level of quality the story deserves.  \nMeet the team.\nCharlie Stickney is Co-Publisher of Scout Comics, and writer of comic books like White Ash, The Game and The Adept.

My name's Jeff McClelland, and I write books like The Tick and the Kickstarter-funded Black Terror: Social Insecurity. In 2020, I funded the just-shipped Planet Comics #1 right here on Kickstarter. That was such a blast that we're here to do it again with the all-new Planet Comics #2!\nPlanet Comics pays homage to the original 1940-'53 title from Fiction House, which featured futuristic stories of daring heroics with a mid-century design. This new series is presented in an oversized, magazine format, with lots of room for high adventure!\nThe book\nSome talented friends and I have gathered back together to share some new stories with you. Issue #1 led off with \"The Bulwark\" from Andrea Schiavone and myself, and we continue this story in our second issue! Here's a preview of the new story:\nThe Bulwark preview\nThe Bulwark preview\nIn this issue: an original Grumble story!\nThis issue also features a very special original \"Grumble\" story from the entire crew - Rafer Roberts, Mike Norton, Marissa Louse and Crank! This story is all new and has never been published anywhere else!  \nGrumble preview\n Continuing from issue #1 is \"The Old Man and The Sea of Love\" by Jeff McComsey!\nThe Old Man and The Sea of Love preview\nAnd debuting this issue is a story about the coolest dog you've ever met, \"Badges O'Keefe, Canine Time Thief\" with Dani Grew and Larry Franks!\nBadges O'Keefe preview\nThis issue also features another in-depth article by Diana Krueger on the life of Matt Baker, Golden Age artist and designer, plus a few more items that I hope to add if we get past our initial goal!\nRewards\nThe biggest reward for this campaign is, of course, the book itself. Whether you go in for the physical copy or digital, I hope you'll feel that your pledge is well spent on these new sci-fi tales.\nThis issue comes with two covers: a regular cover with art by Adri\u00e1n \"Bago\" Gonzalez, and a Kickstarter-exclusive variant cover by Andr\u00e9s Mu\u00f1os Setz! You can order just the regular cover, or both at the same time.\nIn addition, everyone who pledges at the $8 level or above will get a copy of an electronic \"making of\" publication, with a behind-the-scenes look a the creation of this issue. You'll also get your name printed in a \"thank you\" section in the book, and you'll get a digital copy an original Planet Comics issue from the 1940s!\nThere are some other, limited, physical rewards that you can get from this campaign. Here are a few!\nThere'll be a short run of hand-screened shirts that'll look something like this:\naccessorize!\n There are also some acrylic pins to be had!\nit's a pin!\nYou can also stock up on some other book that I've been involved with!\nGet a bunch of comics!\nThere's a limited crochet alien reward that goes well with the last campaign's rocket ship!\nI mean, look at this guy.\nBulwark artist Andrea Schiavone is drawing a limited number of social media profile images as a special, limited reward!

The thief who became a detective who became a thief, \nonly this time she steals from crooks.\n Mia Raven: swarthy, strong-willed woman who cares less about the law than she does recovering stolen items. Mia Raven: gun-toting feminist icon with a troubled past, bad attitude and tattered psyche. Mia Raven: CEO and founder of Recovery Incorporated, a company that will help you get your (valuable) stolen item back when the police can't. Or won't. For a hefty price, of course.\nRecovery Incorporated is a 24 page, over-sized 9x12 inch European formatted comic, part 1 in a 4 issue mini-series.\n My name is Michael Penick and I've been a professional artist and writer for over twenty years now, a freelancer in the advertising, film, illustration, comic book, motion graphics, and interface design industries. A jack of all trades, really, but my first love has always been visual storytelling, and at 51, I'm tired of letting all the stories I've been developing and writing languish alone in my imagination and on my computer. \nThanks to all the wonderful and generous support I've received so far, its time to interrupt this regularly scheduled kickstarter page and introduce some stretch goals! If so many stretch goals seem generous, then you're just going to have to live with it! \ud83d\ude09 I'm so grateful for how my campaign has gone so far that I want to help you get as much extra stuff as I can!  \n Recovery Incorporated - Another Day At The Office marks the beginning of my journey to bring those stories to you. It's the first of a four issue mini-series. I've been working on issue 02 since the beginning of the year. If you'd like to keep up with my progress, you can sign up for my newsletter here.\nThe first issue of Recovery Incorporated is finished. In fact, it's been finished since 2012! I was hired, at the time, to create a story for a British magazine. I brought my long time friend and writing partner Dean Deckard along with me to help in the creation process. The story would unfold in eight page increments each month. \n Unfortunately, the financier of the magazine, who lived in Eastern Europe, had trouble getting funds to the UK, which meant the editor there couldn't get funds to me! In light of that, I felt i had no choice but to stop my comic from running in the magazine. It was only a few months later that the entire magazine folded. It was a sad, but not uncommon affair, in the comics world.\nI \"shelved\" the story at the time because, well, I really needed to find work and make up for the months I had just spent working for no pay, but I also felt it wasn't really something American comic book readers would be into. In the time between then and now, however, the independent comic book market in the US has truly flourished, as has the Kickstarter platform. So here I am.\n Because I've been around. Ive seen what the publishing world looks like and what the contracts look like. I think, more and more, that Kickstarter is the future of comics and, potentially, publishing. I think this is the place to be. Even with an industry publisher I'd have to do my own marketing if i really wanted my book to be successful, so why not just do the rest of the work while I'm at it? And if I'm really, brutally honest with you, my ADD makes it easier for me to work for myself than under the deadlines imposed by the comic book industry most of the time. I'm a self-motivated guy - I don't require artificial stimulation to motivate me. Kickstarter provides me with the one link that was missing in my ability to complete my own production chain.\nTo answer that, let me ask yet another question: what makes Mia Raven different from all the other Femme Fatales you've seen in recent years? A lot of things. \n First off, she's a thief, not a spy. \n Second, she's into using her brains far more than she is using guns or sex. \n Third, unlike other people in the modern world of storytelling (think storytellers whose names rhyme with Bay Bay Haybrams), I like to plan ahead - I know what happens to Mia through each of the 4 planned story arcs. I know her character arc from before issue 01 begins through where we leave her on the final page of her saga. \n     You know what allows me to do? It allows me to put clues in issue 01 for which you won't see a payoff for another 10 issues. Those are the kinds of stories I love reading, so those are the kinds of stories I endeavor to write. \n I also like to do my research. Everything you'll find in these stories - every piece of tech, every security system or vehicle or any other such thing - either exists or is technically plausible. I love science, so I love to get it in wherever I can. I also hate when stories do ridiculous stuff I know is impossible - I don't write 80s Bond films, okay? \ud83d\ude09 \n     To up the ante even further, I served in the army, in the infantry, for a little over 4 years. I fast-roped out of Black Hawks, skydived out of all manner of military aircraft (even at night), trudged through the jungle on moonless nights wearing NVGs with an IR laser attached to my rifle - I got to do a lot of high speed stuff in my 4 years, stuff that not only allow me to bring a lot of knowledge and accuracy to my stories, but authenticity to my characters and the things I put them through.\n I've just shown you the first eight pages of my comic. Why? Because this is like the opening scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark - it introduces you to the character and the kind of thing she does, but the actual plot of this story doesn't begin until the next page.\n     One thing you might notice about Recovery Incorporated is that it's not drawn to typical American comic book proportions. It was commissioned for european standards, which I love, so that's the way I plan to print it. That means Recovery Incorporated will be printed at 9x12 inches, making my comic as wide as typical American comics are tall. I want the work to be presented the size it was intended to be shown. Not only will you be getting a larger comic than normal, but you're getting more story per page than typical American comics. There's plenty of story left in 16 pages, and I plan on having issue 2 ready to go once you get issue 01 in your hands. \n     A word of caution, however...\n     While there's no nudity in Recovery Incorporated, there's adult language and reference to adult situations. This isn't for kids. It would be irresponsible for me to not let you know that up front.\n     So what are early readers saying about the first issue of Recovery Incorporated?\n Andy Jenkins - \"It's a polished book with some really fluid dynamic art and well thought out panel and page structure... it's exciting, builds up the characters well and has enough little twists and turns to keep you reading and looking forward to the next issue.\"\nRandy Stone - \"I knew going in that with Michael Penick's art, this would be a great looking book, but I was equally impressed with the story he did with co-writer Dean Deckard. The ideas were fun and the pace was exciting. This is a blockbuster on the page!\"\nMark Freeman - \"Recovery Incorporated is everything I love about independent comic books. The story itself is fresh and different. The characters are written as real people with real-world issues. The artwork is crisp, clean and easy to follow, while the writing has layers of complexity. This makes for a fun and engaging read. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next.\"\nDanny Gorny - \"The action is compelling. It's a pleasure to read a globetrotting heist story with such an elegant setup. The art and colouring are great - featuring excellent use of dramatic shots during the exposition scenes, and the backgrounds and setting are exciting. The colouring choices, especially during the flashbacks, is inspired.\"\nGabriel Hernandez - \"Recovery Incorporated starts strong and gets stronger with each page. It's a refreshing update to  the 'Gentleman Thief' legend for the 21st Century.\"\nI'm not asking for a lot. I'm keeping it simple because I want this to succeed. If i can pass my funding goal, I'll shoot for some simple stretch goals like a nicer cover stock and a couple of other things I'll introduce later in the campaign. What I am asking for is covered in the graphic here:\nAs you can see, there's nothing fancy here. No thrills, no frills - nothing outside what it costs to run this campaign, print the books, and get them to you.\nHere's what you can expect from me once the campaign has ended. You can see the plan right here; I'll keep backers up to date as each step here comes to pass so you'll know everything is going as scheduled. If there are any hiccups, I'll let got know immediately and tell you how that will affect the schedule.\n2/11 - Campaign ends \n2/26 - Receive funds from Kickstarter \n3/1 - Place ptint order\n3/15 - Receive print order at my house \n3/29 - All orders packed and shipped\n5/23 - Domestic orders received by mail\nMedia mail can take 8 weeks to arrive - that's why the long shipping window. Many packages may arrive quicker than that, but I'd rather have you're package arrive earlier than I told you than later. During this time I will be busting my hump to get issue 02 pencilled, inked, colored, and ready to go so that I can launch the campaign for issue 02 right on the heels of you getting issue 01 in your hands. If you want to follow my progress along the way, my newsletter is the best place to do it! If you missed it before, you can sign up for it here.\nI'm offering three covers for my first issue of Recovery Incorporated. The main cover, drawn by me, will be used everywhere. The two alternate covers will only be available here on Kickstarter, possibly only during this one campaign. I will never offer them anywhere else - that's a promise. So let me show you the covers:\n     As I mentioned before, my longtime friend and co-writer Dean Deckard helped me create Mia Raven and the story that covers this first mini-series. We\u2019ve been the closest of friends for 30 years now. We challenge each other over everthing, make each other think, and work well as writing partners because neither of us care about ego. All we care about is story.\n     My only other collaborator on this issue was the Eisner award winning colorist John Rauch. I can't begin to tell you what a joy it is to get pages back from John. I've worked with him on several projects and never once have I had to fret over a single thing. Its like he reads my mind, but more clearly than I can. My biggest hope for this campaign, in fact, is that I can raise enough funds to hire him to color issue 02 for me as I get the pages ready - that will allow me to get issue 02 to you in the shortest time frame possible. That's one of those stretch goals I mentioned a second ago.\n     Now let's take a look at the pledge levels I'm offering up. I've tried to keep them as simple and easy to understand as I could. \n Update: Funding goal bonus reward - all backers at every level will now receive free access to an audio commentary of me talking my way through issue 01 as both a writer and an artist \nAllow me to take a moment and explain the \"Prior Work Bundle\" limitation. I don't have 10 bundles in reach of the three tiers I'm offering it in, I have ten total. If a person pledges for one in one tier, it reduces their availability in all three tiers together. To reiterate: I only have 10 Prior Work Bundles in total. \nOn top of these support tiers, you can add any of the following items to your pledges (in case you're wanting to build your order in a way I haven't thought of in the tiers, want more of one thing, or even two forms of original art):\nFor the sketch cards, pin-ups, original pages of art, and covers, I will contact each person in the order that they pledged to choose which piece of art they want from the available choices. \nThank you so much for your time, and, if I get your support, for helping me get this ball rolling. You are an essential element of my future and I value you more than I can say. Every day when i get up and work, I will endeavor to make sure i have given you more than your money's worth.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs far as risks and challenges go, the book is ready to go to the printer, which I've already chosen, and is here in the US, so turn around time will be quick. I'll pay for insurance on the shipping so if anything were to happen, I'll be covered to get another print run done. That just leaves getting your packages to you. I've taken lessons from the most experienced kickstarters and have gotten the best materials to make sure your books reach you as safely and perfectly as possible, and while this is only my first kickstarter, I've been a professional artist and writer delivering jobs on time for over 20 years now - you don't stay in business if you don't communicate well, get your work done, and delivered on time.

It tells the story of high school senior Elliot Morgan: a massive comic fan with graduation and Major Voltage Adventures on his mind, when he's astonished to discover he has superhuman abilities of his own. \nWhen he almost immediately goes out and makes a public display of his new superheroic abilities, he's amazed to be confronted by his favourite comic book characters staring him down in the real world. As if that wasn't crazy enough, they reveal the truth about themselves - they're his parents and they reveal that they are refugees from the world of his favourite comic book escaped to this world when he was just a baby. \nWhat follows is revelation after revelation, after more and more of the family's secrets come to light. Just how many secrets can one family be keeping?\nThe Miracle Family by Luciano Vecchio\nElliot Morgan aka Miracle design by Vince Underwood\nElliot Morgan a.k.a. Miracle - Elliot is an average teen boy, and a bit of a geek. He\u2019s an outward optimist but harbours within him some anger. Elliot's anger seems to revolve around the idea that so much about himself was kept secret from him, but there's more that he's keeping inside himself. He is a believer in taking a responsibility for his home with his new capabilities, and with those newfound reality-warping abilities, there's little that he can't do.\nAyden Morgan a.k.a. Empath design by Vince Underwood\nAyden Morgan a.k.a. Empath - Elliot\u2019s younger in age but bigger in size brother, Ayden is much more quiet, introverted and sullen than Elliot. Ayden has been dealing with intense mental health issues, that may be connected to his empathic abilities, and he has to learn to come to terms and learn to live with them.\nEvan Morgan a.k.a. Major Voltage design by Vince Underwood\nEvan Morgan a.k.a. Major Voltage - Elliot\u2019s father, Evan was his world\u2019s leading superhero. Proud, tough, but with a warm, open heart, he\u2019s always been troubled by the fact he and his wife kept their kids\u2019 true nature from them. Defending his family has been his sole purpose since taking refuge in this world, so he now has a less ostentatious profession than 'superhero' to help stay hidden. However, he holds some pride in his son taking up his old line of work.\nKate Morgan a.k.a. Ms Phantom design by Vince Underwood\nKate Morgan a.k.a. Ms. Phantom - Kate is Elliot and Ayden\u2019s mother, and is the one responsible for hiding their true natures from them using her telepathy. She\u2019s almost the opposite of Evan in that she\u2019s quieter, seems sadder, and the escape to their new home and what it led to took its toll. However, she is fiercely protective of her family, and would go to any length for them.\nJessica Lectron a.k.a. Superia design by Vince Underwood\nJessica Morgan a.k.a. Superia - Elliot\u2019s cousin, Evan\u2019s niece, Superia was another great hero of their home reality. She was bright, bushy tailed and brash, but in the \u2018real\u2019 world has become more serious, grimmer and reserved. Much of this comes from the trauma of the move over to the new world, and she has withdrawn from the main family significantly, implying there might be more to her pull away from both the family and from her previous life as a superhero than is known.\nElliot Morgan is your average teenage outcast, keeping his head down as best he can to get through High School. One thing that's been a source of comfort to him all his life has been his love of comic books, particularly one comic book: the mysterious final issue of Major Voltage Adventures. An issue written by a reclusive British comics writer, that sees the heroes in a tense stand-off with their arch-nemesis Maestro during a reality-shattering Catastrophe. The story is left unresolved and is a major topic of debate and theorising for decades. Elliot doesn't know why he's so obsessed with it, but it's the one comic he comes back to read again and again. \nThen one day, the strangest thing happens: Elliot starts exhibiting unnatural, superhuman abilities. From there, Elliot's world is turned upside down, with revelation after revelation, not least of which being his parents are Major Voltage and Ms Phantom, and his family came to this world from the fictional world of his favourite comic book. \nSuperia designs by Andrew Sebastien Kwan\nNow deciding to use his great gifts for good in the 'real' world, just how will that work for a superhuman refugee from a comic book? And what other skeletons are the Morgans keeping in their closet?\nWe're going for a mix of soap opera drama and large scale superhero action adventure. Think The OC crossed with The Incredibles. Fantastic Four mixed with 13 Reasons Why. This Is Us meets X-Men, by way of Invincible. \nEmpath/Ayden design by Zoe Thorogood\nThe Miracles is a story I've been working on and wanting to tell since I started writing The Pride. The Miracles has been a comic series, a book, a mini-series, and over the years I've worked with numerous artists to develop the idea including Gavin Mitchell, Kris Anka, Zoe Thorogood and Andrew Sebastian Kwan. Now, having found the perfect team to finally make this project a reality, we'll bring it out as an Original Graphic Novel so everyone can finally have this tale of families, broken realities and the secrets we keep. While we touch on a number of issues including refugees, the role of a hero in the world, personal responsibility to one's home, whether born there or found, the main core remains family and secrets. \nOriginal Character Designs/Sketch by Kris Anka\nJoe Glass - Writer\nJOE GLASS - Writer - Joe is the writer and creator of LGBTQ+ superhero team series, The Pride. Originally self-published, The Pride was the first ComiXology Submit title that got upgraded and continued as a ComiXology Originals series. He's also released superhero political thriller Acceptable Losses and glitter noir, queer grindhouse revenge fantasy, Glitter Vipers. A staunch advocate for inclusion and representation in comics, Joe does whatever he can to make that happen. Joe lives in South Wales, UK with a belligerent cat named Oliver. You can follow him on twitter and YouTube. \n\nVince Underwood - Artist\nVINCE UNDERWOOD - Artist - Vince is an American comic book artist. His credits include Elk Mountain and Page Turn (both available on Comixology). He has also done comics work for transmedia horror company Cold Room Entertainment and illustrated for NBC Sports and the San Francisco Giants. Vince lives with and by the grace of his wonderful wife Hannah, their two dogs Cassie and Millie, and their cat Derek. You can follow him on twitter. \n\nHARRY SAXON - Colours - Harry is an illustrator and comics colourist from Greece. He is currently 38 years old and irreversibly trans. You might know his work from titles such as Vault Comics\u2019 Vagrant Queen and its successor Vagrant Queen: A Planet Called Doom and Test and Black Mask\u2019s Sex Death Revolution. If you don\u2019t know his work, this is an excellent way of getting started. You can check his website and follow him on twitter. Friendship and discounts offered if you\u2019re into Doctor Who.\nHASSAN OTSMANE-ELHAOU - Letters - Hassan is a British/Algerian letterer of comics. He's worked on things like Quantum & Woody, Undone by Blood and First Knife. He's also the voice behind Strip Panel Naked, and the editor of the Eisner-winning PanelxPanel magazine. You can follow him on twitter and YouTube. \n\nWe'll also have a cover by amazing artist, the fabulous Kevin Wada, and the logo has been designed by the incomparable Dominic Xavier Crewe.\nCover Artwork by Kevin Wada\nThe book is still being made as we speak and raise funds, and we are planning/expecting to have it ready for release and posting to backers for the third quarter of 2021, looking at October 2021. We're about 10% complete as of now, and are on schedule to hit this goal. \nWe want as many people as possible to be able to get and read The Miracles. As such, we are keeping a cheaper digital option available for those on a budget who still want to read our action-packed, amazing superhero family story. \nMock-up for the Kickstarter Exclusive Hardcover edition\nWe also want collectors to feel like there's something extra special for them too. As such, there'll be a very limited edition hardcover version of the book, for those that want something a bit more special to sit on their shelves, that will be exclusively available to Kickstarter backers. Containing the 120 pages of story, plus further behind the scenes pages and designs, creating an overall book size of 160 pages!\nSPECS:- 282 x 185mm hardcover, 160 pages plus end pages and cover, matt lamination outer cover, 170GSM uncoated endpapers, 130GSM silk main pages, full colour throughout\nMock-up for trade paperback edition\nOn a larger print run, we'll have a trade paperback version available too, filled with the 120 page story, plus extras and more, such as design work and sketches making for a 140 page book. \nSPECS:- 282 x 185mm trade paperback, 140 pages, 300GSM silk and matt laminated cover, 130GSM silk internal pages, full colour throughout\nSticker\nWe'll also be making a sticker of the main The Miracles logo, so this will be available on a number of rewards tiers.\nEnamel Pin\nThere's also an enamel pin, of a stylised version of the series' emblem. A nice, shiny little mark of being in The Miracles Family. \nThere are also a couple of retailer tiers too, so if you are a store and would like five or even ten copies at a discount price, please check out those tiers! NB: It will be the TPB version of the book in those tiers, the hardcover is Exclusive to the Kickstarter only. \nWe even have been given access by Kickstarter to allow ADD ONS, which will include some of my back catalogue of titles, including superhero political thriller Acceptable Losses; glitter noir queer grindhouse revenge fantasy Glitter Vipers; and the last few copies of the original, limited edition self-published The Pride collection, collecting the first ten comics made before the series was picked up by ComiXology Originals. \nThis is a BIG project, possibly one of the biggest I've ever done, and so we need all the help we can get to cover this. The total of this campaign goes to paying the creative team to make the art and design, and to cover printing costs and delivery. It's a high goal, but with enough support, we can do it.\nWe're also teaming with a fulfilment company in the US to help bring down costs for international backers, and speed up fulfilment too! White Squirrel will be helping us deliver speedily and cost effectively, handling the US backers. I've found that the largest part of my audience is based in America, so I've taken this measure to help keep postage costs as low as possible for the region, as well as helping me keep costs down for all other regions too.\nA rough breakdown of how the funds are distributed\n\nMost of the money raised is going on production on the book, specifically the art team. The next biggest chunk will be for printing and postage. These are big expenses, and always increasing, but with your help, we can do it. \nIf we manage to surpass our goal, we'll look into Stretch Goals too, but for now, our main focus is hitting our goal. \nI am so excited about this story and bringing it to you all, I think it's one of the strongest stories I've ever created. \nBut don't just take my word for it! Check out some early pages below!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third campaign run during the pandemic, as well as my ninth campaign overall, so by now I have a lot of experience with running these things. \n\nThat being said, postage/shipping is something that can often catch people out, myself included in the past. So, for this campaign, being my biggest campaign to date, I've partnered with a fulfilment company to handle the US backers, which will also mean we can keep the price down for those international backers that are the most expensive to ship from the UK too. \n\nLife factors can sometimes delay production, even in the midst of lockdowns and the like. I've done my best to factor those in, but as always, some things can never really be planned for. However, if and when anything like that happens that will cause a delay in production or delivering rewards, me and the team will communicate that to you right away. \n\nUltimately, barring any huge, sweeping changes to postage costs or with the pandemic situation itself, this will all be handled on time and with professionalism.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Support Tier", "descp": "At this tier, you're just showing your support and drive to help us make this project you happen.

With stylish storytelling and gorgeous rendering, he makes a genre that has in recent years been relegated to the back shelves of entertainment fun and compelling again. I can't wait to see what he and Athena have in store for us.\" \u2014 Mark Schultz, creator/writer/artist, Xenozoic Tales  |  writer,  Prince Valiant  |  illustrator, Conan of Cimmeria \n\"Athena Voltaire is a wonderful pulp throwback. A return to the heady days of the adventure comic. Swords, guns, airplanes, sand, jungles, dens of villainy, conspirators, cutthroats, treasure, and all 36\"- 24\"- 36\" of the most dangerous woman in the genre.\" \u2014Tim Bradstreet, cover artist, The Punisher, Hellblazer\nIn the knuckle-dusting style of classic pulp adventure comes Athena Voltaire, the globetrotting aviatrix who takes on Nazis, secret societies, zombies, and unspeakable occult creatures! From sunken galleons to haunted mountain-top lairs to hidden jungle temples, our heroine faces peril at every turn as she races to save the world!\nLaunched online in 2001, the series has earned an Eisner Award nomination, a Russ Manning Award nomination, and three Harvey Award nominations, and has had a publishing home at Ape Entertainment, Dark Horse Comics, and, currently, Action Lab Entertainment. \nAthena Voltaire and the Terror on the Orient Express finds the heroine reconnecting with an old friend during a personal trip on the famed train line. When an old foe sets a plan in motion, the voyage turns deadly, as Athena must find the source of horrific slayings that are terrorizing the passengers!\nPlanned for issues 9\u201312 of the Action Lab Athena Voltaire ongoing series, the prologue follows Athena on a mad dash to the train station. This sequence serves as a framing sequence to tell tales of the adventuress' past.\nOnce onboard, it's apparent that something is wrong, as passengers begin to perish at the hands of a creature who stalks the train. \nObviously, someone has to do something...\nLike every other volume in the series, Athena Voltaire and the Terror on the Orient Express works as an excellent introduction to Athena and her world. Each volume tells a self-contained adventure. Of course, when combined with the other volumes in the series, a larger story begins to take shape. \nBest of all, Athena Voltaire and the Terror on the Orient Express is already written, drawn, and lettered, and the colors will be completed by the time that funding is completed! \n LET'S LOOK AT THE REWARDS! \n\n\nMoney raised will go toward artist and colorist fees, printing, backer rewards, and shipping.\nSHIPPING AND PACKAGING\nIf you support a Kickstarter campaign, the last thing you want is for your books to arrive damaged! With that in mind, all of our physical packages are being shipped in Gemini Comic Mailers. These things are practically nuke-proof, insuring that your comics arrive in great condition!\nThe Collector's Box and the Mystery Box will each be shipped, bubble-wrapped, in Priority Mail boxes.\nAnd oversized original art rewards will be placed between 2 sheets of masonite, bubble-wrapped, and shipped in 12x18x2\" corrugated boxes, to insure they won't be bent.

Where young Mattie Moore has always had many friends, including the renowned Captain Terrific, the world\u2019s greatest superhero! Because of this close shared friendship, Mattie is always the first man at any crime scene they call Captain Terrific to. He records the captain\u2019s acts of heroism for the world to see on a channel lovingly called \u201cSUPER BEST FRIEND.\u201d These videos have garnered Mattie fame, celebrity, and friendships with all the superheroes in the world. However, it\u2019s Mattie\u2019s friendship with Terrific that means the most to him. \nCaptain Terrific chats with his best friend, Mattie.\nHowever, everything changes when Mattie makes a grave mistake! He records Captain Terrific during a personal moment, accidentally revealing his secret identity, Calvin Cobb, to the entire world!\n\nHORRENDOUS!

It wasn\u2019t until 2018 that I started writing this story and convinced George to draw the adventure of Mattie and Captain Terrific. My time hosting DC All Access inspired this idea of online media consumption and superheroes.

Thank you for supporting Thirsty!\n\nTHIRSTY is a graphic novel made up of four sexy stories that overlap in fun, exciting ways.\n\nImagine a date that ends with an enlightening discovery behind your date's closet door...\nImagine a sex shop of the future, where you can customize your desires...\nImagine a woman setting out to create her own sexy videos, on a quest to find just the right partner for the job...\nImagine a late-night drive in a car designed to read your deepest fantasies...\nThese four comics, drawn by some of comics' top talent, make for the spiciest graphic novel you'll read this year. If you're a fan of comics like Sunstone or Smut Peddler, you'll love THIRSTY's hilarious, emotional, exciting, character-driven erotica.\n\nTHIRSTY is a 56-page graphic novel from the team that brought you DESTINY NY, PRISON WITCH, and more. We are writer team and married couple <3 Pat Shand and Amy Shand, and this is our 17th Kickstarter. \nHere are normal, everyday pictures of us.\n\nWe think that stories about sex can be every bit as nuanced as stories about love, stories about fantasy, any kind of story, and we are excited to bring these new ideas to you with THIRSTY.\n\nWe will be writing THIRSTY specifically for four incredible artists:\n\n CHIARA COLASANTI: After working together on DESTINY, NY Chiara's delicate but strong style made us excited to tell more stories with her.\n\n DAPHNE RED: A newcomer to erotica comics, she will be delivering a lush, soft, romantic style to a funny tale about how sex and anxiety can collide.\n\n KELSI JO SILVA: Kelsi submitted some of the spiciest sample pages we have ever seen and we fell in LOVE with her art. We can't wait for you to see her take on an online entrepreneur! Kelsi has also supplied the artwork for our two SWEET and SPICY prints.\n\n ELENA OMINETTI: Elena takes on a story about how the customization of a sex shop in the future leads to a real-life romp.\n...and JIM CAMPBELL, who has lettered and designed every book we have done to perfection from the start!\n\nThat's not all, though. In addition to our standard cover by the incredible Romina Moranelli (pictured above), we have a Kickstarter-exclusive version of THIRSTY with an incredible variant cover by superstar artist JENN ST-ONGE.\n\nJENN ST-ONGE VARIANT\n\nAnd we have TWO prints by the amazing KELSI JO SILVA who also does the interiors.\n \"SWEET\" PRINT\n\"SPICY\" PRINT\nPREVIEW PAGES!\nHere's a preview of each story in \"Thirsty\" with certain areas *~*~*~*flower emojied*~*~*~* for Kickstarter. \n\"Art Dolls\" illustrated by Elena Ominetti\n\"Only Friends\" illustrated by Kelsi Jo Silva\n\"Cascading\" illustrated by Daphne Red\n\"Automatic\" illustrated by Chiara Colasanti\nIn addition to the main tiers, you can manually adjust your pledge to add these awesome items. \n\nNow, add-ons have been added officially through Kickstarter, so you can do this ON YOUR PLEDGE with a new menu!\n\nHere is everything we have available.\nFirst, is the main series I fund through Kickstarter, my long-running Destiny, NY graphic novels. This series follows Logan McBride, a girl who was the subject of a prophecy as a child. She completed this prophecy when she was just 13, and now she's entering her 30s trying to find meaning in her life post-Destiny. That's when she meets Lilith, the last surviving daughter of a mystical crime family... and from this point on, their lives will never be the same.\nYou can see more about each volume through the original campaigns;\nDestiny, NY Volume 1\nDestiny, NY Volume 2\nDestiny, NY Volume 3\nDestiny, NY Volume 4\nDestiny, NY Short Stories Collection 1\n Gangster Ass Barista (A Destiny, NY Spinoff)\nAnd now, earlier this year, we funded a new spinoff, Cherry Gilbert: Necromancer.\nAll of these can be added to your order!\n\nIn addition to Destiny, NY I have funded two other series along with a few standalone graphic novels on Kickstarter. In doing this, I have formed the company Space Between Entertainment to produce these comics, a podcast, video content, and more. Here's our current slate of available graphic novels that you can add to your order:\n Prison Witch: A mystical thriller about the magic that happens behind bars at a women's prison. Two volumes so far, with more to come. Volume 1 has a cover by Jenn St-Onge, and Volume 2 has a cover by Natasha Alterici. Written by Amy Shand & Pat Shand, illustrated by Erica D'Urso.\n Afterglow: A post-apocalyptic epic about a girl and her giant, radioactive cat. Written by Pat Shand, illustrated in full color by K. Lynn Smith.\n Spooky Girls: A full-color, graphic novel made up of 4 new monster comics, each written by Pat Shand and illustrated by different artists: Jenny the Werecat, Vicky Slime, Punk Teen Demon Queen, & Tarantula Twins.\n Modern Dread: A horror anthology about modern anxieties. Created by Ryan Fassett & Pat Shand, including contributions from ARMY OF DARKNESS artist Larry Watts, THE WALKING DEAD (TV Series) writer LaToya Morgan, & more.\n Clonsters: A young Earth Nugget attempts to find her lost Splat in this all-ages adventure about monsters made out of clay. Written by Amy Shand & Pat Shand, with illustration by Vanessa Cardinali. Two Volumes so far!\n Vampire Emmy & the Garbage Girl: In this horror/rom-com, a vampire falls in lover with her sanitation worker who has a secret of her own.\n\nAnd you can also add-on any of the items from the campaign:\n\n\n $13,000 (UNLOCKED!): Now, each story will get its own illustrated cover page in both the digital and print versions of Thirsty.\n $16,000 (UNLOCKED!): Major upgrade! Now, the standard cover of Thirsty will be treated with spot gloss so it really pops in your collection.\n $20,000 (UNLOCKED): NOT FINAL ART IN GRAPHIC. All print backers will receive a saucy bookmark illustrated by KATE KASENOW! \n $25,000 (UNLOCKED): Finally, our ultimate stretch goal... a brand new comic. DESTINY, NY: THIRSTY will be a digital-only, full-color (for the first time) exclusive featuring our Destiny, NY characters made specifically as a Thirsty tie-in! In this story, Logan dreams of the... memorable early days of past relationships.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween this and the projects I've funded over at our collaborative Space Between company page, this is my 17th Kickstarter campaign. In a creative endeavor of this size, possible challenges could be delays in production or printing depending on the current situation with the quarantine, considering we ship overseas. However, we have successfully Kickstarted multiple projects before as creators AND as a team, which has given us the utmost confidence that we'll meet and exceed your expectations, no matter what is happening in the world. When hiccups are hit, we send updates. When we receive our shipment, we get them our to backers immediately without delay. I mean, why would we want to hold onto the books when we're so eager for YOU to read them?\n\nOne thing that we can't control is customs charges and the price of international shipping. We pay more for international shipping than we charge, but some countries will charge an extra customs fee based on the prices of the items included. Our advice there would just be to be aware of that.\n\nOur backers deserve the absolute best, and we promise to deliver the highest quality, the best communication, and all questions answered quickly -- ALWAYS!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "THE BOOK - Digital", "descp": "A PDF of \"Thirsty\" for our digital readers.

So let your favorite retailer know that they can get JON SABLE, FREELANCE Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus Volume 1 before anyone else!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nRETURN OF A CLASSIC FOR A NEW GENERATION\nMike Grell's JON SABLE, FREELANCE was a trailblazing comic book in the 1980s. \nJON SABLE, FREELANCE, the story of a former African hunter in the concrete jungle, was one of the earliest successes among independent comics of the 1980s.  A top seller, SABLE often saw higher sales and critical praise than Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Avengers, and many other mainstay titles. It was one of the comics of the era that helped redefine what the medium could achieve.\nAfter successful Kickstarter campaigns to revive Mike Grell\u2019s MAGGIE THE CAT and his collaboration with actor/writer Mark Ryan on THE PILGRIM, Grell\u2019s Masterstroke Studios imprint is giving one of his most popular creations a massive new release: JON SABLE, FREELANCE.\nIt is notable that SABLE has never gotten the Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus treatment it deserves. IDW released a series of trade paperbacks in the early 2000s, and Comicmix published smaller sized paperback omnibus editions in the last decade. Masterstroke is upping the game by going for over-sized editions that will be definitive versions of the legendary series.\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\n\nHERE'S THE PLAN:\nOver the next couple of years, Masterstroke Studios will be releasing JON SABLE, FREELANCE, the definitive omnibus collection in 5 volumes, with the final volume being launched in time for Mike Grell's 75th birthday in September of 2022.\n\nEach volume will consist of approximately 400 pages of content, including all of the issues, all of the covers, and heaps of bonus materials (some never before seen). These editions will be over-sized (think DC Absolute Editions), showing the pages bigger than they have ever been seen before. Each volume will have a dustjacket with new art by Mike Grell. Key issues will have commentary from Grell about the story and behind the scenes insights. And there will be lots of other goodies thrown in as well (including a companion book of original letters column pages, old house ads, and other rare bits and pieces from the history of JON SABLE, FREELANCE!)\n\nVOLUME 1 covers issues #1 - #13, completing the first major story arc of Sable, from his origins as an Olympic athlete, to his life and lose living with his family in Africa, to his personal death wish as a gun-for-hire upon his return to America. The first volume concludes with Sable's return to Vietnam to find a man missing in action.\n\nGrell's gritty, yet emotionally grounded tales are a slice of mid-1980s current events, politics and intrigue, blended with action and adventure. The entire series is a unique time capsule of an era, while also remaining relevant and fresh for a new generation. \n\nTHIS KICKSTARTER\nThis is where it all begins. This Kickstarter is to fund the creation and production of Volume 1 (and possibly Volume 2 if we cross $100K on this campaign) of the Deluxe Hardcover Omnibus series.\nWe've spent months planning every detail of this campaign to make it as efficient and straightforward as possible.\n\nWe've set the price point at a comparable retail market price for other similar volumes rather than elevate the price point on Kickstarter, as so many projects do.  It is not uncommon to pay upwards of $30 for a single issue of a comic on Kickstarter (which is based on the cost of creation for writers and artists. Comics are not cheap to create and publish, no doubt about it). But since this material already exists, the costs are a bit lower for us. This means we can focus on making the presentation of the material the best it can be. We can also begin advance work on the next volumes, as we prepare to launch them in the coming months.\n\nWe see fans who contribute to projects get frustrated when they see the same books available months later for a fraction of what they pledged. And while these editions will be made widely available later on down the line, you will pay the same price to support it here that you would to buy it next year in your local comic shops and other retailers. AND... these editions will contain Kickstarter exclusive aspects that those others won't. These will be the first, and rarest versions of the omnibus set, guaranteed. \nA unique page of art in the front of the book will be exclusive to this Kickstarter, and some copies of this Kickstarter backed volume will come with an exclusive bookplate that will be signed and numbered. As well, the names of backers of this project will be listed in the back of the book, thanking them for their frontline support of Mike Grell's work. As well, some fans can get special recognition, including sketches of their likenesses being used for an exclusive trading card set! \nThere are many perks beyond just getting the book. You can get a limited number of original Grell commissioned sketches (some of them inside the book itself, making your copy all the more unique).\n\nThis is a massive project that we're breaking up over two years and five volumes, that, when complete, will be the final word on the original JON SABLE adventures.\nEarly bird pricing saves you even more. If you pledge in the first 48 hours, you end up saving an additional $25 on the book, which will retail for $100 down the road when offered for Local Comic Shops.\n\nWhat you get: \nJON SABLE, FREELANCE Masterstroke Edition Volume 1.\nThere are many other pledge levels that include sketches, other Masterstroke publications you may have missed, and a whole host of other unique opportunities to be backers at higher levels and get even more out of this amazing project!\nAs we surpass our funding goal, and unlock Stretch Goals, there are even more great surprises in store, from trading cards, a Sable poster, a feature length Mike Grell video interview, trading cards, art portfolio prints, and even a chance to get Volume 2 of the omnibus set at a discounted rate after we pass a certain funding goal.\nLots of cool things await! And this is just the beginning.\n\nEARLY BIRD BACKER BONUS!\nThe first 100 Backers will get an exclusive Sable art print by Mike Grell that will be exclusive to this campaign! A one of a kind (well, one of one hundred) piece, this will be a great bonus for fans!\n\n DID YOU MISS THE OTHER MASTERSTROKE KICKSTARTERS?\nFear not! You can catch up on everything Grell right here with this campaign.\nThat's right. You will be able to get Maggie The Cat, The Pilgrim, Jon Sable black and white bonus comic, Rules of The Hunt, The Mike Grell Sketchbook, The Legion of Super Heroes Sketchbook and Sketch Cards, and more!\nThere's a pledge level that catches you up, but we will also be announcing ways to add on individual items you may have missed along the way!\n\nSOME OTHER SURPRISES AWAIT\nWorking from original plates of the page art, Mike Grell will be able to go back into select issues and pages, and clean up some of the art, making it sharper, clearer, and better looking than ever before.\nWe're mindful of not altering the original art, but rather we are planning to lovingly improve the art, colors and pages where needed to make this the best looking, and most definitive version of Sable.\nIn future volumes of the set, there will new color added to some issues, as well as new artwork. (Keep reading...)\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nEach of the planned five volumes will clock in at around 400 pages. They will be larger than we\u2019ve ever seen SABLE, measuring approximately 8.5 by 12.25 inches (the same size as the DC Comics Absolute Edition releases) with glossy interior pages, rare materials (including never before seen artwork), all new covers, and dust jackets that will line up to form a complete image when placed in order on a shelf. Each volume will retail for $100.\n\nJON SABLE'S Back!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\nThat's right! Mike Grell's classic is making a triumphant return in a deluxe hardcover format for the first time!\nImages are shown for representation effect. Final art for the cover will be revealed in the near future.\n\nThe original cover to JSF #1 from First Comics back in 1982!\nA gallery of original covers for the issues that will be contained within Volume 1\n This two page spread from Jon Sable, Freelance #1 has been lovingly preserved, while also increasing the quality from the original newsprint pages to a bright glossy finish! This is the best Sable has ever looked!\n The original cover to the SABEL novel from 2000. It has been revised and re-edited for an all new release, and you can get it digitally though this campaign!\n\n But it shouldn't scare you, the fans! It should excite you! Jon Sable's triumphant return will be a FAN driven publication! By the fans, for the fans! This is the ultimate presentation of JON SABLE!\nThis is how the original series stacks up. Now, imagine it bigger, bolder, brighter, and more badass than ever before! \n\n THE FUTURE\nWith 5 total volumes needed to collect the entire run of 56 original issues, 12 additional issues, and other bonus appearances (anyone remember Mike Grell's 5 page in \"Word Warriors\" literacy awareness comic in 1987? How about that 5 page Hero Initiative benefit comic in 2014? The black and white \"Rules Of The Hunt\" bonus comic from the \"Maggie The Cat\" Kickstarter? Yes, we will have it ALL!) of Jon Sable, each volume will be approximately 400 pages in length, with extensive bonuses.\n\nAstute fans will recall that late in the original run of JSF, Mike Grell left the art chores behind, bringing in a host of talented artists to draw the issues. They were all great artists in their own right, but it just wasn't the same without Grell at the pencil.\n\nWell, we're about to make an announcement that will blow the minds of fans:\nVolumes 4 and 5 of this omnibus series will feature issues of JSF, redrawn by Mike Grell himself!\nWe've got Stephen B Scott along to assist with finishes to Mike's pencils for some of the backgrounds and some of the issues. Mike will be fully drawing several of the key issues, and providing pencils for the rest. This will be like seeing 13 issues worth of JSF the way that they were meant to be, for the first time in over 30 years! This is a unique opportunity for Mike to go back and do those issues the way he envisioned them from the start!\nI'm excited just typing that. Honestly, as a fan (and editor for the project) I feel like we're going to discover a lost treasure of Mike Grell art! And I don't know of any other instances of artists reaching that far back and redrawing whole issues of comics.\n\nBut it all starts here, with Volume 1. We need to fund this project, and get the printing presses rolling on this set of omnibus editions. In many ways, this campaign will be the foundation upon which all future Mike Grell Masterstroke Studios projects will be built. So, we need you, the fans, now more than ever! The more successful this initial campaign is, the more poised for bringing you the absolute, ultimate, best SABLE possible.\nThis is the moment all Grell fans have been waiting for!\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL #1: $56,000! When we hit this goal, we will include an exclusive JON SABLE Omnibus collection bookmark, and an exclusive Kickstarter JON SABLE sketch card from Mike Grell!\nSTRETCH GOAL #2: $58,000! When we hit this goal, we will include a digital video file of a nearly 2 hour live filmed docu-interview with Mike Grell, filmed in 2018!

This \"Inside The Actors Studio\" type interview is a perfect companion to the Eisner Award nominated \"Life Is Drawing WIthout An Eraser\" book from TwoMorrows Publishing! A must for Grell fans. (If we cross $100K, look for this film to go from downloadable, to a full DVD!)\nSTRETCH GOAL #3: $60,000! When we hit this goal, we will include a JON SABLE Companion, volume 1. This will include reprints of all the original letters pages from the issues within this volume, as well as a Who's Who style section of characters, and a guide to guns as seen and used in the pages of this volume, plus more bonus content like rare in-house ads from the original run, etc. A unique companion to the omnibus collection! 24 pages of color and black and white images!\nSTRETCH GOAL #4: $65,000!  When we hit this goal, we will include the first set (in 5 total sets) of JON SABLE FREELANCE trading cards! Unique collectibles, with characters from the series. By the time we produce all 5 volumes, you'll have a full set of  25 cards, but it all starts with this initial set of cards.\nSTRETCH GOAL #5: $70,000! When we hit this goal, we will include a brand new Mike Grell Jon Sable art print that will have a classic cinema poster look to it akin to classic James Bond film posters!

Once all 5 volumes of the omnibus are finished, there will be a full portfolio (in a unique slipcase) of 10 art prints. \nAND WE HAVE EVEN MORE STRETCH GOALS PLANNED, SO KEEP AN EYE OUT....\nWe have some MAJOR plans for Stretch Goals that go up to $100,000, and include some amazing items! So help us get funded, and we will reveal a new Stretch Goal each day over the next 5 days following hitting our funding goal!\n* Note: Stretch Goal rewards are only available to backers who pledge on physical levels, not digital.\n\nMILESTONE GOALS:\nBe sure and keep an eye out for bonus items being offered when we hit certain milestones along the way!

Now, to make ends meet, Jemele takes an offer from a mysterious person named Spencer Avery.\n\nSpencer needs he and his special cargo driven from Dayton, OH, to Las Vegas within a small time frame to satisfy his client, Mr. Wolf. And no one denies Mr. Wolf.\n\nFor Jemele, there's no turning back, and what seems to be a high-speed job could end up being even more than she ever imagined. Get ready for a ride of a lifetime. \n\nWelcome to IGNITION: ISSUE #2!\nIGNITION is a comic book mini-series written by Shawn Pryor & Jenna Lyn Wright, with sequential artwork and lettering by Kelly Guillory.

With your support, we can be successful and continue to give you all more for your money. IGNITION: Issue #2 will be printed in a 5.5\" x 8.5\" digest-sized format, on a nice 80 lb matte laminated paper stock, with a 130 lb matte laminated cover.\nWHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING\nThe money raised for the IGNITION: Issue #2 campaign will go towards paying our series artist, Kelly Guillory, printing costs, backer rewards, and shipping costs. If we end up smashing our initial goal, all additional funding will be used to produced awards from our campaign stretch goals, additional content for the series, per-page-rate bonuses for the creative team, possible future content, and more. We'll give you the best that we have with every issue, always.  \n\nREWARDS & STRETCH GOALS\nIf you missed IGNITION: Issue #1, don't worry because we're offering a 2nd Printing of Issue #1 for this campaign!\nAnd you'll also be able to add-on additional items to your pledge during this campaign!

So, essentially, you're now getting about 16 different comic issues and a print for this one pledge. \nTHE PEACEKEEPERS is a new comic book series from writer Rylend Grant, artist Davi Leon Dias, colorist Iwan Joko Triyono, and letterer HdE... the same twisted team that brought you 10 rip-roaring issues of Action Lab: Danger Zone's critically-lauded political action thriller ABERRANT.  Aberrant won a Mike Wieringo Comic Book Industry Award (for BEST VILLAIN) in 2019 and was nominated for two others (BEST WRITER & BEST SINGLE ISSUE).\nThis campaign will fund a gorgeous 64 pg perfect-bound comic book collecting Issues 1 & 2 of THE PEACEKEEPERS and hopefully we'll hit a few stretch goals along the way so we can give you more bang for your Kickstarter buck.\nAll hell breaks loose in a quaint northern Michigan community when a team of in-over-their-heads bank robbers kills a beloved Sheriff\u2019s Deputy. In a small town with BIG secrets, local detective Richard Holton races to peel back the layers of a depraved down home conspiracy before the bungling Federal Agents assigned to the case send everyone involved to ground. \nFROM RYLEND: I\u2019m a screenwriter by trade. For over a decade, I\u2019ve made my living writing smart, mind-bending thrillers for directors like JJ Abrams, Ridley Scott, Justin Lin, John Woo, Luc Besson, and F. Gary Gray, so I can\u2019t help but think of things in cinematic terms. The Peacekeepers is a dark, quirky crime drama in the vein of Fargo or No Country for Old Men. It\u2019s a love letter to case-a-season police dramas like True Detective and The Wire, to Elmore Leonard novels, and to comic masterpieces like Criminal and 100 Bullets.\nNow tell us that doesn't sound cool!\nNot ready to dive in just yet? Well, then check out this pu pu platter of wicked and wild previews!\nMEET THE ROBBERS... \nMEET THE COPS... \nMEET THE WRESTLERS...\nMEET THE GIRL NEXT DOOR...\nI know what you're all thinking now. \"That was TONS OF FUN, but what do we get if we pledge?\" Well, I'm glad you asked. First, there's--\nWe're looking to print THE PEACEKEEPERS on a heavy 80 lb paper stock with a 100 lb glossy cover. This thing is perfect bound. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the difference. This is very much a Cadillac. A heavier stock and perfect binding also makes the comic less likely to be damaged in transit.\nHere is the \"regular\" cover by Davi Leon Dias and Iwan Joko Triyono: \nWe're also offering three UBER-limited variant covers you'll only be able to procure here on Kickstarter. Feast your eyes on these:\nTHE HEAT HOMAGE VARIANT - Dias & Triyono\nFor those who sometimes just have to get it on. For those who will rock 'n roll at the drop of a hat. For those who are prepared to walk out on anything in 30 seconds flat if they feel the heat around the corner.\n\nTHE FARGO HOMAGE VARIANT - Dias & Triyono\nOh Geez... this is a good one, don'tcha know... a no-rough-stuff-type deal.\n\nTHE POINT BREAK VARIANT - Dias & Triyono\nHere's one for the reader who only lives to get radical. Admit it... you want this one so bad, it's like acid in your mouth. Vaya con Dios, compadre!\nGREAT covers, right? Having trouble choosing just one? Well, why not GRAB THEM ALL?!\nNOTE: Special \"Early Bird\" tiers are available for ONLY the first 48 HOURS of the campaign.

BEST SINGLE ISSUE and BEST WRITER (alongside Jeff Lemire, Scott Snyder, Brian K. Vaughn, and Brian Michael Bendis).\nAnd here's what the critics had to say:\n\u201cGo home, other comics people. Rylend Grant and Zsombor Huszka just killed the game\u2026\u201d (Charles Pulliam-Moore \u2013 i09)\n\u201cABERRANT offers an intense, near-cinematic reading experience that incites excitement and inspires interest for issues to come.\u201d (The Brazen Bull)\n\u201cAberrant flat-out works. You have visceral action scenes. Personalities practically ooze out of the page. Honestly, this is the kind of storytelling that the big publishers are missing.\u201d (Big Comic Page)\n\u201c\u2026a bleak, dangerous and serious story with a lot at stake\u2026. If you like revenge tales, military thrillers, and superheroes, \u2018Aberrant\u2019 has it all.\u201d (Spartantown)\n\u201cABERRANT #1 is a game-changer at Action Lab: Danger Zone. You\u2019ll become captivated almost immediately\u2026 The creative team put together one of the most seamless, cohesive, and dynamic collaborations I\u2019ve seen this year on the indie scene.\u201d (PopCultHQ)\n And ABERRANT was quickly optioned for television by 24 & FELICITY Executive Producer Tony Krantz! \nRylend's last book - the dark and decidedly wicked superhero noir, BANJAX - was just nominated for FOUR 2020 Ringo Awards including BEST SERIES.\nIt made over a dozen ten-best lists and the critics raved:\n\u201cThis is the most amazingly well done first issue of a series I have ever seen. Point blank. Period\u2026 You cannot read this and come out if the same way you went into it\u2026 So effin\u2019 good.\u201d (Steven Leitman, Reading with a Flight Ring)\n\u201cBanjax has all the action, violence, grit, and heart of a classic.\u201d (David Pepose, Creator of Spencer & Locke)\n\u201cQuality, engrossing material embedded with a cinematic feel. Gifted storytelling and breathtaking artwork. Banjax will instantly have you screaming for more!\u201d (Jason Bennett, PopCultHQ)\n\u201cBanjax hits incredibly hard. Intense, thought-provoking, wildly entertaining. It\u2019s near perfect. For those looking for something unique, Issue #1 is a must-read.\u201d (Charlie Chipman, The Brazen Bull)\n\u201cRiveting. Refreshing. Heart-breaking. Ultra-violent. Honestly, a bit unsettling. The artwork of F\u00e1bio Alves is everything a dark and gritty comic should embody. Edson Ferreira\u2019s color work adds an extra punch to really emotional panels. Don\u2019t miss out on this bloody good time! A+\u201d (Andrew Huard, You Don\u2019t Read Comics)\n\u201cHoly crap this is good. This book hits all the right notes. It\u2019s marvelously done, such a compelling story. It\u2019s the best comic I\u2019ve read in a long time. Honestly? Bendis could take some notes here.\u201d (ComicCast Podcast)\n\nAnd our last Kickstarter effort, THE JUMP, took the site by storm...\n\u201cOut of this world. Grant delivers another cinematic thrill-ride. THE JUMP is a beautiful medley of fascination and wonder, filled with engaging characters, sprinkled with humor and heart, a healthy dose of intrigue, all wrapped up with a compelling premise.\u201d (Jason Bennet - PopCultHQ)\n\u201cTHE JUMP is a massive good time. The pacing is phenomenal. The line work is superb. The color work is brilliant. The is fresh, new, and unique. This is why we love comics.\u201d (Steve Leitman - Reading with a Flight Ring)\n\nMUCH MORE LOVE TO COME ON THE PEACEKEEPERS!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHE PEACEKEEPERS is brought to you by a team of steadily working professionals that has collaborated previously and delivered an exceptional, critically-acclaimed, Ringo Award-winning book.

Murder books typically include crime scene photographs and sketches, autopsy and forensic reports, transcripts of investigator\u2019s notes and witness interviews. They chronicle the life of a case, from the time the murder is reported until an arrest is made.\nCATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is an original graphic novel about crime and consequence. It\u2019s written by me, Ed Brisson (Old Man Logan, Uncanny X-Men), and lusciously illustrated by Lisandro Estherren (Redneck, Strange Skies of East Berlin). This stand-alone graphic novel will be published in an exclusive hardcover edition for Kickstarter backers.\nCover by Lisandro Estherren\nAfter nearly half a decade away from writing crime comics -- a genre I love more than any other -- I\u2019m making a return with the Kickstarter Exclusive Hardcover edition of CATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY. This book is near and dear to my heart, and probably the most pure distillation of the kind of book that I want to write.\n\nCATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is about a thief who concocts a plan to sell a stolen car not once, but several times, by luring unsuspecting buyers to a remote location and robbing them at gunpoint. His plan hits a snag when he encounters a student, who needs a fresh set of wheels to travel to his new life out West. When things go south, they go south hard, and now our car thief stands on a precipice where he has to make a choice that will affect not only his life, but that of his co-conspirator and their two victims. The story is an examination of one man\u2019s guilt and how far he\u2019s willing to go to stay out of jail. \nArt by Lisandro Estherren\nWhen I started writing the script -- the longest MURDER BOOK story to date -- I knew that there was only one artist who could do it justice: Lisandro Estherren. He and I had previously worked together on THE LAST CONTRACT for BOOM! Studios and have been looking for an excuse to team up once again. Thankfully, he was into the story and happy to come aboard to breathe life into this story about a deception and redemption.\nArt by Lisandro Estherren\n\nTHE TEAM\nEd Brisson has been creating comics in one form or another since 1994. He\u2019s best known for his work at Marvel on books such as UNCANNY X-MEN, IRON FIST, GHOST RIDER, OLD MAN LOGAN and X-FORCE. He also has a long history of writing creator-owned books such as COMEBACK (Image), SHELTERED (Image), THE LAST CONTRACT (BOOM!) and THE VIOLENT (Image).\n\nEd first started to gain recognition from his self-published series MURDER BOOK, which was collected and released by Dark Horse in 2015.\nLisandro Estherren is a comic artist based in Argentina. His work includes graphic novels, series, and illustration for publishers and magazines such as Editorial Pictus (Argentina), Aurea Editoriale (Italy) Di\u00e1bolo (Spain) and Mojito (Uruguay). In the US, he has produced series for Red5 Comics (Spook) and BOOM! Studios (The Last Contract). He is currently working on REDNECK for Skybound Comics.\nHassan Otsmane-Elhaou makes Strip Panel Naked, a YouTube series focusing on breaking down comic art. He also does this a lot on his twitter (@HassanOE). He might make films that you'd like.\nLinney Incorporated is run by editor/writer/producer Nate Cosby, who's worked on Cow Boy, Thor The Mighty Avenger, Red Sonja, Jim Henson's The Storyteller, World War Hulk, Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, James Bond, The Wonderful World Of Oz, Flash Gordon and sooooooooo many more books.\n\nWHY KICKSTARTER\nI\u2019ve been a fan of the Kickstarter publishing method for years now and have always wanted to bring a project here, where we can cut out the middleman and create a book for readers, backed by readers.\n\nKickstarter allows Lisandro and I to maintain complete control over the story and production of the book, creating a work that is as purely a product of our love for the genre and medium.\n\nThe money raised through this campaign will be used to pay the creative team and for printing of the hardcover book.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN GET\nWe are delighted to print this stand alone story in a Kickstarter exclusive deluxe hardcover, as well as a digital edition of the book. CATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is a 72 page book, printed at standard comic size (6.625 x 10.25 inches).\n\nAside from the book itself, we have plenty of fun rewards including commissions from Declan Shalvey and Micheal Walsh; script reviews from Matthew Rosenberg and Kelly Thompson; original artwork; and even a chance to appear in the book yourself!\n\nA NOTE ON SHIPPING\nBecause of how quickly shipping rates can change and the unexpected nature of the world, shipping costs will be added on later, when we ship the book out to you in 2021. You will get a survey from BackerKit where you will be asked for your address, and shipping costs will be calculated at that point. We will do the best we can to make shipping as affordable as possible. Our current shipping estimates are as follows (but these may change if shipping rates increase): $4 US  / $10 Canada / $25 EU, GB and elsewhere. \nCanadian orders will ship from Canada, all other orders will ship from the US.\nTHANK YOU!\nThank you to our families and readers for getting us this far!\nKickstarter Campaign Manager: \nLaser Malena-Webber lasercampaigns.com\nMusic credit for video:\nDoomsday Clock by Rafael Krux\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/5402-doomsday-clock-\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny project has its risks in creation, manufacturing delays, and the unexpectedness of the world.

The purpose of this campaign is to finance the completion and printing of  the Menagerie: Declassified Anthology.  The core of this science fiction anthology contains ten original stories by some of the BEST voices in comics.  From Marvel and DC to IDW, Zenescope, and yes, Kickstarter, these writer and artist teams have never worked together before, but have been paired up to bring unique corners of the Menagerie Universe to life.  Brandon Easton (Transformers: War for Cybertron - Siege, Agent Carter, Judge Dredd: False Witness, Thundercats), Geoffrey Thorne (The Avengers: Black Panther's Quest, Black Panther [MARVEL], The Librarians, Leverage), Bryan Edward Hill (Batman & The Outsiders, Killmonger, Zone 414, Postal, The new unnamed Power Rangers movie) and MORE contributed to this book.\nSo, yes, this anthology is the main event and you don't have to read the series to follow along or understand the meanings of these powerful, subversive and often cautionary tales.  \nMENAGERIE: Declassified Anthology - Main Cover (REWARD TIER 3)\nThe very first issue of Menagerie was funded on Kickstarter just a few short years ago and since then, you have helped us bring to life over 100+ pages of that story, set in a world of endless wars and the struggle to establish freedom. The Menagerie Universe has been a lot of fun to build.\nMENAGERIE: Declassified Anthology Cover D --> (REWARD TIER #3D)\nIF YOU'RE ONLY HERE FOR MENAGERIE #5 \nWell, first we think you're missing out on the best series of prequel stories we could have put together by top talent that is writing for Marvel, DC, and the major movie studios.  BUT we totally understand if you want to finish the first \"season\" of the series before you get to that or you're on a budget.   So, we definitely want to accommodate return readers by including these new Reward Tiers (since launch) under the [REPEAT BACKER] designation.  So you can get either a Digital or Physical copy of Menagerie #5 with either of those two Reward Tiers.\n\nHERE'S THE COVER ART FOR MENAGERIE #5:  \nMenagerie V: Main Cover by David Monge Bautista (Now Available by selecting \"Here for the Add-Ons\" Tier and then choosing Menagerie #5 as an Add-On (for $8 + Shipping) when prompted at check out.\n\n We've had so much positive feedback, and with our epic conclusion to the first arc here, we wanted to address a question that constantly comes up:\n\"When will you be bringing in outside talent to write for Myth Division?\" \nWell, the answer is: NOW!\n\nFor the first time, Ram\u00f3n, the writer, creator and editor of the Menagerie series has put together this Anthology, a series of eight page sci-fi stories set in the Menagerie Universe. He asked some friends who work in the comic book, film and television industries if they'd contribute a story. \nThey agreed and each of their stories features one of the main characters we've already met in the first four issues of Menagerie.\nSo who are these characters again?\nThe Mutineers are all ready to start over.... but who were they before they deserted the war? Find out in this Anthology.\nSince the fifth issue is the final issue of this introductory arc, we decided to ADD it along with this campaign!  So whether you've got all four issues and have been waiting for the fifth or if you've never read an issue and want the whole set, you can catch up with ease.  All of this is in addition to the 100+ Page Anthology.\nThe only catch is we currently aren't offering is the DIGITAL COPY OF MENAGERIE ISSUE #5!!  *GASP!* \nWe know!! It's a heartbreaker for a few loyal backers, but we assure you, this isn't meant to slight anyone especially our supportive readers!!  It's more of a necessary effort to combat future piracy, so we're actively looking for a better way to deliver these rewards & protect the future sales of these stories.  (After all, we want your Kickstarter Exclusives to be WORTH SOMETHING down the road). \nThe good news is that the digital conclusion to the five issue arc WILL be found in the printed collection of MENAGERIE: Volume 1 (REWARD TIER #2) and we hope you'll pick up a copy of that, which will include some sketches, notes and other cool behind the scenes content in the back of the book!!.\nMENAGERIE: Declassified Anthology Cover A --> (REWARD TIER #3A)\nNow, that's just the first nine stories.  There are up to fourteen stories in total to UNLOCK, each taking place BEFORE the events of our first Menagerie Series Arc (#1-5), which is available as a Trade Paperback (REWARD TIER #2) or if you're lucky you can still snag one of the rare add-ons compiling the 5 individual issues.  These stories are a prelude or mini-prequels to the ongoing series, really.  It's a great way to finish up the first arc.\n\n9 STORIES COLLECTED INTO ONE: \nTHE ANTHOLOGY\nWe've invited many of our recurring collaborators to participate along with a few new creators that we've wanted to collaborate with for some time.\nThese stories are the \"Declassified\" tales of First Contact with non-human, intelligent life throughout the explored Galaxy, featuring the people we meet in Menagerie #1-5. \nMENAGERIE: Declassified Anthology Cover C --> (REWARD TIER #3C)\nA lone wolf searches for a pack in the frozen wasteland of an outlier planet.\nTHE GLUTTON by Omar Morales & Erwin Arroza\nThe Glutton Interiors.\nA man wrestles with his decision to disobey his father's wishes when he is asked to do the unthinkable.\nLOST ONE'S by Robert Jeffrey II, Bruno Lima, & Fahriza Kamaputra\nLost One's Interiors.\nSometimes we're reminded that what we want isn't remotely close to what we might need. Brandon Easton's other Comic titles and Television Series include: Transformers: War for Cybertron - Siege, Judge Dredd: False Witness, Marvel Action Spider-man, Thundercats, Agent Carter, Miracle Man (DC Future State), Incidentals, and more...\nEclipse Interior Art by Ricardo Arreola, Juan Castro & Sean Lee.\nEclipse Interior Art.\nIn the face of certain death, it's not often we learn more about the Universe than ourselves.\nINFINITY TREE by Madeleine Holly-Rosing & Edgy Ziane\nINFINITY TREE Interiors.\nViolence isn't usually the answer, but sometimes it can even spell total destruction for all involved.\nBREATH OF A PREDATOR by Carrie Tupper, Abel Cicero & Edgy Ziane\n\n\n\nInvasion isn't always a cut and dry formula. Sometimes, the enemy is not what you think.

We were blessed to have raised approximately USD $11,000. Thank you again to all of you who supported THE RESURRECTED, even it that meant simply sharing our campaign with your friends. \nBut now, it's time for MURKY WATERS!\nCover by Tula Lotay\nMURKY WATERS is a full-colour 56 page anthology. The creative team hails from across the globe, making this a truly international project. All stories are complete and the electronic file is just about ready to send to the printers. The next step is to print and distribute the anthology; which is where you guys come in. With your support, we can take pre-orders and print the book soon after.\nOur goal of \u20ac3,000 will cover the printing, and a chunk of the packing and shipping. Also included in this amount are the fees that Kickstarter and Amazon take for using their services, and of course, domestic taxes...\nTHE RESURRECTED's writing/editing/lettering team and cover artist are back!\nWriter/Creator: Christian Carnouche is an Australian working at an international organisation in France. He wrote all eight stories in the anthology and is also the writer/creator of The Resurrected mini-series.

Digital tier backers will receive a digital version of the print. I'm not sure what drawing Lucy has up her sleeve yet, but I'm 100% certain it will be something special :)\nLucy is from the UK and is the writer/artist of the smash-hit graphic novel 'Barking.' Not only is Barking an incredible piece of work, but it's themes and atmosphere tie in closely with those of Murky Waters. I absolutely recommend you read it. Lucy is also the artist on the upcoming comic IND-XED (with Fraser Campbell - a sincerely brilliant writer - check out his comics here - https://alexautomaticblog.wordpress.com/) and is currently drawing a short story for the hit anthology series Razorblades.\nCheck out some of Lucy' work here - https://lucysullivanuk.com/\nAnd some samples of her work: \nSECOND STRETCH GOAL ACHIEVED!\nWe've hit 5000 euros, so all physical backers will receive a Carnouche Productions fridge magnet! \nTHIRD STRETCH GOAL ANNOUNCED!\nWe're now aiming for our third stretch goal of \u20ac6000, which is that all physical backers will receive a mini-print of Tula Lotay's stunning Murky Waters cover. Digital backers will receive a digital version. I've had several people mention they'd like Tula's cover as a poster and I really can't disagree.\nIMPORTANT NOTE ON ORDERING ADDITIONAL REWARDS\nOnce the Kickstarter is finished, all backers will be sent email surveys to confirm what they ordered. YOU MUST FILL OUT THE SURVEY TO RECEIVE YOUR REWARDS.\nWe will also be using 'backerkit,' which will allow you to add rewards to your initial order, even after the Kickstarter campaign has finished. If you do choose to add to your order, postage costs may increase based on the parcel weight.\nYet again, we will be using high-quality offset printing to produce our books.

The series follows a group of children cast aside by their families and society\u2026until they were possibly the only ones capable of saving it.\nStandard Kickstarter Edition Cover by Emma Kubert\nVariant Cover by Emma Kubert\nSpecial Limited Bleeding Cool Variant Cover by Emma Kubert\nYears in the future, a virus has been weaponized by a Russian government hell-bent on destroying America from within. This deadly new strain has been perfected to kill within 24 hours of contact, and only small groups of children carry an immunity to the effects. They are the Foundlings; a diverse group of children under the age of 16, who alone carry the hope for a possible cure, and a solution to extinction.\nFoundlings centers around one very special group of kids, all who still dream of the families that long ago abandoned them, and instead find family in each other in order to survive and find a way to save the Earth from destruction. The story is inspired by The Foundlings Hospital in New York City, which is a real-life home to children, many of whom are challenged with physical and emotional issues. The story is rich with themes of empowerment and inspiration for teenagers and adults alike, in a fun adventure story that recalls some of the most beloved films and television series.\nJohn Stanisci is a New York Times best selling artist and writer for DC, Marvel and IDW Comics having drawn such characters as Spider-Man, Batman, Constantine, Justice League Dark, Judge Dredd,  X Files and many more. In 2011, John's book for DC Comics, Batman Beyond: Hush Beyond, premiered at #1 on the New York Times bestseller list for graphic novels. John\u2019s original graphic novel, Lifedeath, received a major announcement in The Hollywood Reporter and is under development for film/tv. John\u2019s published work has appeared throughout the world in many countries including Germany, England, France and others. John is also a Broadway/Off Broadway playwright, actor and producer. John\u2019s original plays have been named as finalists for the prestigious Woodward/Newman Award for drama as well as the Eugene O\u2019Neil Playwrights Conference and others. www.johnstanisci.com\nEmma Kubert is a freelance comic book artist, writer and graduate of the Kubert School (2018). She has freelanced for various companies such as DC Entertainment, Dynamite Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, and Image Comics. Emma recently penciled, inked and colored for DC Entertainments\u2019 DC SUPERHERO GIRLS and TEEN TITANS GO!, and drew layouts for the company\u2019s young adult graphic novel RAVEN. She is currently working on her Image Comics\u2019 creator-owned series INKBLOT with Rusty Gladd and developing sci-fi fantasy FOUNDLINGS with John Stanisci.\nAdditional Credits:\nLettering: Rusty Gladd\nDesign: Jason Ullmeyer\nVideo: Olivia Oguma\nWe decided to go direct to Kickstarter comics supporters because we have seen such a strong statement from this platform\u2019s users in favor of diverse content from both well-known and up and coming creators. We see the opportunity to make the case for Foundlings to see publication as a full graphic novel, and eventual graphic novel series with the community we can create here. We also needed to help pay for the continued development and creation of this story in lieu of other paid work for hire comics work. We have plans for not only the Foundlings graphic novel, but possibly developing this story to other media and you will help us shape those decisions, and have an exclusive window into the process and the journey of Foundlings.\nThe story of Foundlings is inspired by the idea that heroes aren\u2019t always the people we might expect, and must rise above their own struggles to meet the challenge presented to them. In that same spirit, you can be the co-founders of tomorrow\u2019s pop culture. By backing Foundlings, you not only support the creation of this independent comic book, you help us send a message to the industry that you want more stories that explore heroes of all kinds and their journeys of trial and triumph.

We\u2019re incredibly thankful to our Kickstarter community and we're going to do our best to pack each campaign with as many cool exclusives as we can for you.

(We have some exciting ones lined up that we\u2019re dying to tell you about.) If you were with us for issues 1 and 2, the story continues here. If you're new to THE CATCH, both issues are available in this campaign, and here's a quick overview ...\nWhen super-villains like Galactoid, Dron the Conqueror, or Professor Kill are defeated, they're sent to a government maximum security facility. But what about small-timers like Phileas Frost, The Grappler, or the random jump-suited agents of H.A.R.M.? What happens to the bank robbers, jewel thieves, and anonymous henchmen?\nThey post bail.\nAnd sometimes, they skip town afterward. That's where Lucy Chase comes in.\nLucy comes from a family of law enforcement folks, but spends her days working for bail bondsman Leon Tilman, chasing down costumed criminals who jump bail. Keeping super-powered lowlifes in line is a dangerous job; especially when you don't have super-powers yourself. Bounty hunters who specialize in supers are few and far between, keeping Lucy in high demand.\nDeputy U.S. Marshal Jack Devlin is Lucy\u2019s on-again, off-again love interest. Jack\u2019s assigned to the Federal Powered and Supernatural Crimes Joint Task Force, but he sometimes provides unofficial backup when Lucy has a bounty.\nSo far, Lucy and Jack have crossed paths with some colorful folks who are very interested in their activities.\n And now everyone\u2014criminals, the authorities, and Lucy & Jack\u2014are all on a collision course.\nMoney raised will go toward artist and colorist fees, printing, backer rewards, and shipping. If we're lucky enough to exceed our goal, all additional funding will be put directly back into the book in the form of additional rewards and production of the next issue.\nIn English...\nAnd in Espa\u00f1ol (digital)\u2026\nMain cover by Ismael Canales and Mireia Girbau.\nVariant Cover by Steve Bryant and Jason Millet.\n\"Movie Poster\" Variant Cover by Ismael Canales and Jason Millet.\nWe have a wide variety of rewards lined up, from digital comics, to physical comics and variant covers, to \"Catch-Up\" combos that  bring new readers up to speed, to Collector Boxes, to original art, and more!\nIf you support a Kickstarter campaign, the last thing you want is for your books to arrive damaged!

You\u2019ve probably seen his work go by in a pixelated blur on your DVR.\n\"THE CATCH is the kind of gleeful, clever deconstruction of a genre that can only be pulled off by creators who secretly love it. The freshest take on super-heroes and super-villains in the \"real world\" since POWERS. I'm mad I didn't think of it myself!\" \u2013 Phil Hester, cartoonist\n\u201cTHE CATCH is a superhero crime caper that blends the best of both genres to create something wholly new, engaging and memorable. Bryant, Canales, Surroca, and Murrin expertly weave a story that evokes greats like Elmore Leonard, Greg Rucka and Ed Brubaker without feeling like a carbon copy. As someone who enjoys all things noir and super-powered, THE CATCH is a perfect match.\u201d - Alex Segura, acclaimed author of BLACKOUT\n\u201cTHE CATCH is a great looking book with a fun premise. The team of Bryant, Canales, Surroca, and Murrin have a winner on their hands.\u201d \u2013 Jamal Igle, co-creator of THE WRONG EARTH from Ahoy Comics.\n\u201cA little bit sci-fi, a little bit superhero, and a little bit good-natured procedural on top of it all, THE CATCH is such an obvious idea, I'm mad I didn't come up with it myself! Engaging, fun, and with a ton of potential -- you're gonna like spending time with Lucy Chase.\u201d \u2013 Erik Burnham, IDW\u2019s GHOSTBUSTERS\n\"Lucy Chase is a new era Karen Sisco in this action-packed and thrilling take on bounty hunting super-villains. Full of finesse and suspense, you won't be disappointed reading THE CATCH!\" \u2013 Shawn Pryor, CASH + CARRIE\n\u201cTHE CATCH is a fun, sexy caper in the style of 70s classics like THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR. Sleek and slick.\u201d \u2013 Wendi Freeman, DOUBLE PAGE SPREAD", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter campaign comes with risks and unforeseen issues.

I mean \"Hack Slash\"\nAt the end of every horror movie, one girl always survives... in this case, Cassie Hack not only survives, she turns the tables by hunting and destroying the horrible slashers that would do harm to the innocent! Alongside the gentle giant known as Vlad, the two cut a bloody path through those who deserve to be put down... hard!\nCreated in 2004, Hack/Slash has now corrupted the minds of thousands upon thousands of readers, horror fans, aspiring comic book creators, cosplayers, and people just looking for a good time, but it has NEVER been presented in a prestige format like the BIG HACK ENERGY edition. \nAs for Comic Shops - YES this will be getting a release from Image Comics. \n \u201cWhy Kickstarter?\" \nAre people still asking \"Why Kickstarter?\" Just in case, here\u2019s the basic rundown. Sure, this comic has built up this huge cult following over the years, but it still takes a lot to put it together, it all has to come out of the creator\u2019s pocket up front, and even with all of the love we get from fans, it\u2019s still an indie comic. So when it comes to doing something really big like this hardcover edition (like, literally, it\u2019s a really big book), it only made sense to come to Kickstarter to help make it happen. The other reason is why wouldn\u2019t we? This has become such an amazing community for cultivating independent comics, and a place to find our most hardcore fans with something beyond social media. Plus, we get to offer some really fun extra perks that wouldn\u2019t be possible to do otherwise.\nWill This Book Be Available Through Stores?\nYou bet! Like all of the other Hack/Slash comics, this will be available from the one and only Image Comics some time early next year. BUT... it will not include a lot of the cool unique swag you can get here, nor the signed book plates from Tim Seeley himself. We also may be adding some fancy glossy accents to the cover depending on what we decide to do with stretch goals. \nBy supporting this kickstarter you help us get this book done so that the stores CAN have it. You're actively playing a part in making it a reality, whereas without you, it likely just wouldn't happen. You may receive it before the stores, or slightly after, because it takes time to sign everything and pack and ship. That's not the point of the campaign. If it's SUPER important to you to get it ASAP, though, we understand, in which case please place pre-orders at your local comic shop or book store.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile everything in this campaign is set to move forward very quickly after the campaign ends, we understand that circumstances out of our control may happen. It is always possible that printing and manufacturing delays can happen, product can get lost in the shipping process, global pandemics, currency collapse, alien invasions, robot rebellion, or human error may cause something to not be sent. That's why we've worked so hard to create an iron-clad system to cater to Kickstarter backers. We use the latest state of the art software along with an awesome warehouse team to track everything.

He has created a wide range of short subjects, such as the Spike Jonze-endorsed parody, Being Ozzy Osbourne (with Christy Stratton Mann), the L.A. Indie Film Festival Winner Come and Knock: The Other Ray Charles and many more.\nSchrader\u2019s first comic book work, Baby Badass, published by Action Lab Danger Zone in 2018, quickly became a cult hit, with Volume 2 set to be released in 2021. He is also the co-writer of Rafael Garcia: Henchman, which recently funded on Kickstarter.\nFollow him on Instagram and Twitter @schraderopolis and @thebabybadass\n\nCLAY ADAMS has acted in two feature-length horror movies, BLOODLINE and THE SHADOW WALKERS, both released by LionsGate.

He also has funded and fulfilled eight projects on Kickstarter with FRIED Comics. His feature script, THE ECLIPSE, placed second in the horror category of the FADEIn Awards, and ELECTRIC YOUTH, co-written with Kyle Roberts, was recently featured in the LA Times.

A gas station attendant with 3rd degree burns all over his body. I thought about what could have caused this to happen to him, what life did he lead before, what life could he lead after? \nOriginal Character design by Rossano Piccioni\nThis is the story of Willy Boyd, a one time high stakes gambler who now lives life as a mild mannered gas station attendant... \n\nPage 1\nPage 2\n\nOne night while going back and forth to the pump to serve customers a car pulls in to his station driven by one of the men who lit Willy's body on fire years before.\nPage 3\n In the back seat of the car is a woman, gagged and bound. As the car rides off into the night, Willy must decide if he\u2019s ready to be some sort of hero...or at least get his revenge. \nPage 4\n BURN RESIDUE is what is left in this world. Everything that happens is an aftershock from the moment the flame ignited Willy\u2019s body and left him scarred forever. It is about how in every one of us there is a beast of rage that only needs permission to take over. Burn Residue is about the dark and brutal world that lies inside the human heart. The world is bleak and the characters are chewed up by life. This is the dark side of noir, the side that never makes it to the sunlight. \nBURN RESIDUE will be presented as three 32 page issues and is the culmination of what comics mean to me, the importance of the page, the page turn, and giving the reader a substantial reading experience.\n\nYou can back BURN RESIDUE in a few ways. \nThere is the single issue format that you will come right to your door monthly (first issue shipping shortly after this kickstarter ends) the other is an exclusive Graphic Novel version of the story with bonus content topping off around 100 pages.\nThe Collected Edition of BURN RESIDUE will feature a cover by Eisner Winning artist Jacob Phillips (THAT TEXAS BLOOD, PULP, MY HEREOS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN JUNKIES)\n\nOGN cover by Jacob Phillips\n\nWe will also be raffling a one of a kind piece of original art from STRAY BULLETS creator David Lapham who called the first issue of BURN RESIDUE \"Twisted...\"\n\nA glorious piece of art of Willy Boyd by David Lapham\n\nOne of the most important things to me when creating any project is having it finished and ready to go. Issue 1 is completely done and ready to send out to the printers. By the time this campaign ends Issues 2 and 3 will be pencilled, inked, and colored.\n\nThe only risk you have backing this project is if your stomach can handle what you find in it's pages. If you are horrified of it, you should be... \n\nBURN RESIDUE is ready to melt into your hands.\nNow with an ISSUE #1 review by  Monkeys Fighting Robots \n\nTHE TEAM\nJonathan Thompson - Writer of the sci-fi anthology TALES FROM THE DEAD ASTRONAUT and the serialized sci-fi short story MULTI-DIMENSIONAL TIME BOX. My first major comic influence growing up in the 2000s was 100 BULLETS by Brian Azzerallo and Eduardo Risso, which then esclated with STRAY BULLETS and CRIMINAL...so that should tell you a lot right there. I've always been drawn to noir crime fiction so it was only natural that I came to this place. \nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/cmdrofzed\nINSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/spacestationzed/\n\nRossano Piccioni - Artist for Edizioni Inkiostro, famous in Italy for his book THE CANNIBAL FAMILY...Rossano's art immediately jumped out to me when I first saw it and I knew that I had to get him with the right project. What has developed between us is a great working relationship. His pages energize me and push me in directions with the story that I wasn't prepared to at the start. His work is dynamic and perfectly suited for the world we are building.

Coping with loss, responsibility, command, addiction, withdrawal and more. It also features social commentary, PTSD, corporate interests and much more, in a Dark Fantasy setting \u2013 all of that, in a striking visual package.\nIt is Asterix \u2013 Mister Robot \u2013 Samurai Champloo - The Witcher books, Promethea and the game GRIS, rolled into One.\nIts as if the harsh reality of real life problems were informed by a world with Dragons and Spell-casting. Sometimes this can be the solution to all our problems and sometimes it can be the sole cause for them. In this particular case, we're stuck in the middle, with Astrid, our protagonist, not knowing where to turn.\nFinished Page 01 - Acrylics on 11x17\" paper - Notice the layout attempts and process ideas, on the border ;)\nFinished Page 02 - Acrylics on 11x17\" paper - sequence progression and process ideas, at the top ;)\nFinished Page 03 - Acrylics on 11x17\" paper\nFinished Page 04 - Acrylics on 11x17\" paper - More sequence process progress at the top ;)\nYet another page finished - all in glorious 11x17\" Traditional Acrylics\nRdw is also a story about a journey. A journey of acceptance, and how the world reflects our inner behavior. And while the journey will take us to dark places and subjects, it will also feature a world ripe with stories and folklore not often seen, like Mozambican, Brazilian, First Nations of the Americas, and much more. It is my opportunity to shine a light one these, as much as I do the protagonists story. \nThe book follows Astrid, a free-company commander, a Leader currently without an army, her struggle with addiction to the enhancing drug that makes her Free-Company unique and the burden of leadership.  \nThe drug acts as some sort of juiced-up methamphetamine - the story will be delving deep into the effects the drug has on the body, the mind and the social circles, of those affect by it.\nAlong the way she\u2019ll interact with different characters, settings, ideas and views and it is THAT interaction \u2013 how the world and her companions react to Astrid \u2013 what this story will be focusing on.\nAs the story goes  and  develops, on further books, we will navigate issues of mental health, discrimination, corruption, neo-colonialism, to name a few. \nThe World, this setting, is as much a protagonist as Astrid. Riddled with Living Forests, Mythical creatures (from African, South-American, European Lore), Magic-lead Corporations and warring Nations, we get a glimpse of all that and more, through the eyes of a troubled addict.\nThe initial idea behind \"Tales of Lost Fantasy\" is to create a world a living, breathing world in which Fantasy and folklore walk together with \u201creal life stories\u201d and through which we use metaphor, humor, different cultures folklore and pop-culture to tell stories about past, current and future society, about escapism, about friendship true and false, about love, true and false and focusing that nothing is ever so black-and-white as it seems. No love is truly immaculate and no evil is without reason or sometimes evil, at all.\nThis initial volume is but the beginning of our adventure.\nWhile Volume One of RDW serves as a good entry point to the story  being told - it is a part of a bigger story, one i hope to continue, once this first volume is released. Our main character is a product of many realities, that of an Army officer, A leader, A friend, a child of an interracial couple, and an addict, in recovery. All these elements, and more, are discussed as the story goes, even if for this first volume we are introduced to her immediate quest: what happened to her troops, specifically what happened to Menhir - a rock Troll/Berserker - and just what Is happening to her.\n Kickstarter, as well as funding dreams and making ideas into realities, allows creators the opportunity to shed inhibitions about those ideas and put them to practice. In this particular case, shape a story in any way we chose to and grow our audience in a catered fashion, in complete and direct communication between creator and audience. I am beholden to you and no other interests and that suits me just fine.\nThis campaign will fund the execution of the project, editorial staff, Lettering, all the production, printing and shipping. This will allow me to fully dedicate myself to it and make it the best and most visually stunning it can be, without gig for bills distractions.\nSo far, this Volume One has its 40 pages of story fully written, with all of them pencilled and partially painted (4 pages finished). Further volumes are already in production, Vol2 fully written and pencilled (with 5 pages already painted)and Vol3 halfway through - 130 pencilled and written pages - with Lots more, to come. But our focus here is Volume One. I am spreading the production of the book in the span of a full year, which allows me to fully commit to Each page and Each step of the production, and you will be tagging along with me, with each step, with constant updates EVERY WEEK.\n\n My name is Marco Rudy and i need a cup of Tea.\nRight, i am Marco. I am a Mozambican-turned-Canadian Comic Book Artist, Painter, Illustrator and off-beat Storyteller. I have been working in the comics industry, for the better part of 13 years now, with longer tenures at DC (Swamp Thing, Action comics, The Shield) and Marvel (Marvel Knights: Spiderman; Bucky Barnes: The Winter Soldier, Avengers, Uncanny X:Men), among others. I am mostly known for my use of traditional medium (watercolors and acrylics) and a very Non-traditional way of visual story-telling, in which the Layout, Design and Color palette of a page and sequence, tells the story in equal amount as that of the action in Each panel. I take my influences in my sleeve and i finally have the chance to tell a story which involves my reality as a Mixed-Race person, as Mozambican out of place, a creature of the world and a child of conflict, mixed in with the Art and folklore of those not often featured or seen, in these types of books.\n\nA page from the Short Story that preceeds RDW - in this sequence both the action In the panels is interacting with the layout and panel bordering, with the action heating up and the layout not only made of the blood, resulting from the panle to panle action, But the this very layout somewhat being a Result of this very same action. The layout And the action in the sequence, both interacting, inviting the reader to see thee story, in a more dynamic way.\nI've always been a storyteller. I grew up reading whatever book I could find and always re-imagining that very same story or creating similar stories, on paper, afterwards. I'd even go as far as retelling that very same story to my friends, or better yet, the one Friend, and family.\nI'd create atmosphere and embellish everything I could, trying to make the most mundane things become fantastical.  And when power outages would happen in Maputo, where im from, it was my time to shine, by the candlelight and share in my weird adventures with them. On of the particular effects is that I would invite my captive audience to participate in the story being told. Interactivity in storytelling.\nThroughout my years in this industry, i've developed a particular way of visual storytelling, in which a page, is much more than a sequence of panel, in which the action happens. The page layout, the color palette In the layout is conversing directly with the action In the panels and Inviting the reader to somehow participate in it. That interactivity in storytelling I mentioned.\n\n Taylor Esposito Words and VFX Merchant - Taylor Esposito is a comic book lettering professional and owner of Ghost Glyph Studios.

I have slowly accumulated 7 stories ranging from hellified to sci-fi that will shock and horrirfy. We have a diverse and talented team that hails from all over the globe that I am very proud of. We even have been fortunate enough to have had the Bram Stoker estate accept our \"Dracula: Lord of the Future\" story as actual Count Dracula cannon, thanks to our talented colorist/writer Chris McAuley!! \n\n\nThis is absolutely an adult book, with graphic violence, and adult themes/language. There is a comedic horror story and several that are much more grim, making it a perfect Halloween Anthology purchase! \nA lot of people have worked very hard to get this volume ready for publication and I think you're going to be pleased with the end result. If we get the funding we need for this Volume, then expect #2 to be ready by October 2021!!\n\nLuci & the Doombringers\nThe cover story was written, drawn & colored by Bayron Calderon, with script assistance & lettering done by Phoebe A. Xavier. It follows one of the Devil's daughters on her quest to break free from her cell in Hell and arise as a heavy metal guitar goddess on Earth. This one has both action & comedy with incredible art!\nInexorable\n\"Inexorable\" is a tale of a thief who has crossed the wrong people at the absolute worst time. It was written by Vesa Vltlkalnen and drawn/colored by Juho Sivonen. They both hail from Finland! The story is a twisted one like many in this collection are.\n\nOne Way Ticket\nBoth \"One Way Ticket\" and \"Patient Xero\" were done by the same creative teams: Phillip Butehorn as writer, Juan Manuel Almiron on Lineart, Chris McAuley as colorist and Phoebe A. Xavier on letters. The first is a tale of a demon and his host on a train destined for Hell. The other is a one page pandemic tale that hits very close to home in 2020.\nThe Damned\nWritten by Juan Bertazzi , drawn by Hernan Gonzalez & colored by Chris McAuley, \"The Damned\" is another quick story that packs a werewolf clawed punch. Hernan & Juan hail from Argentina, while Chris represents Ireland & Canada.\n\nESC POD\nWritten and lettered by Phoebe A, Xavier, drawn by Renan Balmonte and colored by Chris McAuley, \"ESC POD\" is a karma slap sci-fi horror short.\nDracula - Lord of The Future\nOur other sci fi horror short \"Dracula - Lord of the Future\" is the debut of a chapter in Dracula's epic that takes place far in the future, in a dystopian starscape. It is written and colored by Chris McAuley and drawn by the incredibly talented Collin Maxwell. This pair of Irishmen will continue the story in a one shot in the future! \n\n123GO!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt this point the book is 80% done , with mostly just some coloring and lettering to be done.

Wild adventures I could get lost in as I followed the heroes along on their journey. Middle Earth, Hyboria, The Young Kingdoms, The Dying Earth. To me, it's not escapism to want to dwell in worlds like that for a little while. The wonderful thing about fiction, especially genre fiction is that it gives you a taste of the impossible - a window into another world. And that feeling, that exhilarating feeling of cracking open a book and getting lost in it, even for a moment, is something that I've always wanted to create for someone else. And I believe that Wailing Blade is a book that will.\nIt's often said that you should make the comics that you want to see in the world. In that respect, Wailing Blade is everything we've ever wanted to see in a comic. It's got action, it's got adventure. Compelling characters, and a lush, vibrant world for them to inhabit.

This my first webcomic, and it's been both more fun and a bigger success than I've ever imagined.\n\nIf you're new to Urban Animal, and given that a lot of people know me from my work at Image Comics on things like Luther Strode, Spread, Dead Body Road and Reaver, it's about a normal kid who finds out he's not so normal when he turns into a sabertooth tiger. Things just get stranger for Joe from there. Much, much stranger.\n\nUrban Animal is fun, funny, action packed, and I think if you dig my other stuff you'll dig it too, since I think it's one of the best things I've ever done. You can check it out online at Webtoon but now we're bringing it to print.\n\nI wanted to thank everyone for reading the book and for checking out this Kickstarter. We're super proud and very grateful to be able to finally bring our little beast to print.\n- Justin\n\nMeet Joe Gomez. He\u2019s got high school on lock \u2013 good grades, a cool band, and girls digging his vibe. But just when he\u2019s got the world figured out, he goes and turns into a saber-toothed tiger. A shape-shifting nature spirit known as a Chimera, to be specific. Now Joe needs every single one of his new powers to help save the human race \u2013 whether he wants to or not.\nUrban Animal is an ongoing webcomic on LINE Webtoon with nearly half a million subscribers. This is your chance to be the first to get your hands on the reformatted print edition of volume 1, which collects chapters 1 through 27 of Urban Animal - approximately 200 pages of content!\nThe goal of the Kickstarter is to get the comic into your hands as quickly as possible! The more we raise, the more content goes in the book, the more stretch goals are unlocked, and the more add ons we can offer. We'll reveal the stretch goal that's available to hit next, and when it unlocks, we'll reveal the next one. Ditto with the add ons, and we think everyone will be pleasantly surprised with each!\n\n\nSo, what am I getting for my pledge? First, all backers at the $24 Urban Animal Volume 1 Graphic Novel level will get the collected edition, printed at 5.7\"x8.2\" with a matte finish wrap around cover. Each page of the comic will be carefully reformatted to provide the same quality of reading experience many of you have already had online. \n\n Scroll down for more pages! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the full announcement here!\nRead the full announcement here!\nRead the full announcement here!\nRead the full announcement here!\nRead the full announcement here!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Please note that shipping costs are not included in your pledge. We are working with CRWN on fulfillment services and you will pay actual shipping depending on your region and the size of your order during the BackerKit survey phase.\nPlease see our FAQ for more details around shipping costs.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is little risk in that this book is being published and the art has been completed. The team running the Kickstarter have worked with the vendors and printers before and have confidence in the quality and timeline we've outlined. However, during production mistakes can happen and some of the vendors are overseas.

As a young deputy, Percy walked its halls, he saw the mysterious Fisher King within whose mystical wound makes the West a Wasteland...and he saw the Grail. It changed him forever.\nNow: it's 1886. A deadly winter that went down in history as \"The Big Die Up\" ravages the country. Percy is no longer a lawman, but a disgraced gunslinger who has hunted the castle for decades. He longs to return there, to see the Grail again, to heal the Fisher King where he once failed. And to restore the West from the wintry Wasteland it has become.\nBut Percy isn't the only one after it. An ex-Union, Colonel Kurtz-like war criminal known as The General leads an outlaw army in his holy war for the Grail. Percy nearly dies dueling him...but is saved by three new unlikely allies. Grant, a deputy sheriff who's as noble as he is naive. Fire Eyes, a Sioux bounty hunter hellbent on killing the General. And Rosa, a devil-may-care Mexican outlaw who double-crossed the General.\nPercy, Fire Eyes, Rosa and Grant embark on a quest across the Old West for the Grail. The General and his outlaw army hunt them every step of the way. The deputy, bounty hunter, and outlaw must overcome their differences and learn to work together with Percy who's played all three parts in his time. Or die in the vast frozen Wasteland of the West. \nHoly West is an adaptation of the quest for the Holy Grail. It's loosely based on Parzival, but draws from all of chivalric romance, from Grail stories which involved pursuing the highest spiritual ideal: compassion. It's also a love letter to Westerns, to those cowboys and gunslingers who are the American equivalent of Britain's Arthurian knights.\nHoly West explores the bloody history of the frontier and how we made it a Wasteland. The West is where the American soul was forged, for better or worse. At the same time, we drape a veil of magic over the West, just as medieval romance mythologized British history.\nHoly West is magic realism meets Spaghetti Western. Sergio Leone meets David Lynch. It's an action packed, psychedelic odyssey through the Old West; a visionary quest across the vast wilderness, all to heal the spiritual Wasteland of 1880's America. All for the Grail.\nThe Grail calls to you. Come find it with us. \nHOLY WEST #1 PREMIUM EDITION\nVariant cover by Simon Roy for Holy West #1 Premium Edition, colors/design by Daniel Irizarri\nHoly West #1 Premium Edition has a variant cover by Simon Roy, Image Comics writer and artist (Protector, Prophet). Simon's original art for this cover is available as a reward.\nThe premium edition comes with over 10 extra pages of bonus material. Including: a back up comic with art by Vlad Legostaev, a short prose story with a Dime Novel cover by Goran Gligovi\u0107, and even more narrative content that enriches the story of this issue while revealing new clues to the mysteries of Holy West and what we'll see in future issues.  \nDime Novel cover by Goran Gligovi\u0107, included in Holy West #1 Premium Edition, colors/design by Daniel Irizarri\nThis is Goran Gligovi\u0107's cover for a Dime Novel story that will be included in Holy West #1 Premium. It'll be written in the style of an authentic, 1880's Western themed dime novel, and uncover new secrets behind the occult phenomena that surround the Grail Castle and the wounded Fisher King who dwells there.\nIf some generous high roller backs the \"Good, Bad, and the Grail\" reward tier and our funding exceeds 6K, I will write a novella length, 25,000 word version of this short story that will come with this cover and go out as a print copy to every backer above the digital tier.\nHOLY WEST: T-SHIRT EDITION\nMOCK-UP version of the T-shirt, design by Daniel Irizarri\nMOCK-UP version of the T-shirt, design by Daniel Irizarri\nTHE SEEKERS\nWriter: That's me: Seth Jacob.

He illustrated Judge Dredd at IDW, a short story in IDW's Star Trek: Waypoint Special 2019, Cloudia and Rex at Lion Forge, and the back up story Greetings from Verde Luz which appeared in the Image Comics series Prophet.

He'd be more game for the case if he didn't suspect the man he's sweet on\u2014Johnny \u201cPlink\u201d Plinketts\u2014has been keeping secrets from him and might be mixed up in all this somehow. \nArtwork by Delia Gable\nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\nWhen Zita is tied to the scene of a shocking murder, Dash begins to see that the seemingly unrelated parts of his life are connected in ways he never anticipated. The pieces to a much larger puzzle come into focus that could spell the end for Dash and everyone involved! \nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\nAided by his wise-cracking secretary, Cindy Crenshaw, and his pal on the police force, Sal McGillicutty, Dash must confront the monsters of the past and \ufb01nd the only thing capable of stopping a terrifying future! \nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Vinnie Rico\nThe Case of the Mysterious Zita Makara  \nThe gay, noir detective comic series DASH was written by Dave Ebersole and drawn by Delia Gable and Vinnie Rico. Northwest Press is shipping issue six to comics stores at the end of this month to close out the first story arc, a love letter to noir crime and classic horror pictures.\nNow we're collecting that first adventure, \"The Case of the Mysterious Zita Makara\", into a deluxe, 224-page graphic novel with a cover by Tana Ford!  \nCover artwork by Delia Gable\nIn addition to the main story, the collection will also include three brand-new stories:\n\"The Case of the Man Behind the Mask\", a 20-page story drawn by Sean Von Gorman. Dash takes a case in which he has to dig into the life of Hollywood\u2019s biggest up and coming stars, and finds a piece of his past there.\nFrom \"The Case of the Man Behind the Mask\", art by Sean Von Gorman\n\"The Case of the Best Friend on the Police Force\", an 8-page story drawn by Vinnie Rico. Officer Sal McGillicutty discovers his best friend has been hiding a huge secret from him, what will he do with the truth?\n\"The Case of the Wisecracking Secretary\", an 8-page story drawn by Vinnie Rico. Cindy Crenshaw broke and about to give up on LA, finds a car pulled over on the side of the road in the middle of the night, which could be just the opportunity she\u2019s been looking for! \nFrom \"The Case of the Wisecracking Secretary\", art by Vinnie Rico\nWe're proud that DASH will be the 20th book published by Northwest Press, and a great way to celebrate our tenth anniversary publishing great LGBTQ comics!\nMore About the Cast  \nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\nDash Malone was a rising star in the LAPD before he was outed in headlines on every paper in L.A. Managing to elude jail, Dash fought back by becoming the only thing lower in society\u2019s eyes than a homosexual, a private investigator.\nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Vinnie Rico\nNow, spending his days looking through other people\u2019s dirty laundry, Dash has developed a shield of cynicism and a gumshoe's jaded attitude. When a new tragedy strikes unexpectedly, Dash starts to think there's nobody in this world he can trust.\nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\nDash must somehow put his trust in a fantastical mythology in order to stop a killer, and will have to lean on the people he\u2019s closest to in order to get to the truth\u2026 and he's never been good at leaning on anyone. \nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\n Zita Makara attempts to hire Dash to make an exchange for her. Zita has an ancient, stolen artifact she's looking to sell, but Dash sees right through her. Concerned she's just another femme fatale in need of a sucker, Dash finds out he already knows the man he's supposed to meet.\nZita knows more about Dash than she's letting on, and she's involved in something far more dangerous than just dealing in antiquities.   \nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Vinnie Rico\nCindy Crenshaw, Dash\u2019s feisty secretary, has been with him since he opened his firm, after he was kicked off the police force and outed to the world. She\u2019s determined to help Dash make the business succeed in the face of all the hate thrown their way. (Maybe she's even more determined than Dash, himself. Where else will she get paid to hate-read Gone with the Wind all day?)\nWith a mind even sharper than her quipping tongue, Cindy often catches on to the secrets bubbling under the surface long before Dash does.\nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Vinnie Rico\nJohnny \"Plink\" Plinketts is a former crook who Dash caught conning rich, elderly people into buying fake antiques from his \u201ccollection.\u201d But when he nabbed him, before him down to the station\u2026 Dash ended up taking him home. \nArtwork by Delia Gable\nDash doesn\u2019t know that Plink is a smuggler of antiquities, mostly stolen, who's determined to make one final score. Plink wants to use the money to get himself and his lover far away from the seedy underbelly of L.A. But can he get Dash to trust him long enough to make his plan work?\nWritten by Dave Ebersole, Art by Delia Gable\nMore Great Rewards!\nThe main rewards in the campaign feature copies of the graphic novel itself, in print and digital, but there are some other great rewards you can choose.

Holden's cover image\nMadius Comics and Mad Robot Comics are proud to present Hell In Stalingrad - the first collaboration between writers Rob Jones (Griff Gristle, Tragic Tales of Horrere, Paperbacks and Inkstains) and Matt Hardy (Murder Most Mundane, Cadavers, Last Exit to Brighton).\n With an eye catching cover by 2000AD and BattleTanks artist P.J. Holden - and gritty, realistic art from Horrere alumni Russell MacEwan. \nHell in Stalingrad is an 80-page pulp horror graphic novel, in the vein of classic war story comics such as DC Thomson's Commando.\nIt is a complete story - told in one A5 sized, softcover or hardcover collection - utilsing black & white and single colour artwork. \nSet in the midst of the Battle of Stalingrad - with the Soviet Kessel slowly engulfing the German forces. We follow the story of a German soldier, Ernst, andVassily, his Russian counterpart, as they must set aside vast ideological differences in a bid to thwart an otherworldly threat. \n UNCOMICMAS - \"The story is highly addictive...[the] art is certainly daring and risky...\"\nFANDEMONIUM - \"Like Commando Comics, but viewed through a blood-smeared lens.\"\nTHE DREAM CAGE - \"It says War Is Hell on the cover but rest assured the comic looks absolutely heavenly.\" \n BIG COMIC PAGE - \"what you\u2019d get if Event Horizon was set in the middle of one of the bloodiest most horrific battles in the history of modern warfare.\"\nAP2HYC - \"anachronistic horror makes [Hell in] Stalingrad colourful and twisted and brutal...\"\nTHE VALKYRIES - \"The writing, along with the artwork is gritty and just as dark. Full of dark humor and characters that feel both well rounded and fully believable...I\u2019d be amiss if I didn\u2019t mention the frankly immense artwork from Russell McEwan. It\u2019s so multi-layered and intense, each page shows so much horror, movement, and energy.\"\nCan these two men from such radically different backgrounds, caught up in one of the bloodiest battles of the Second World War, prevent a demonic force from crossing over and plunging the world into the fires of Hell?  \nComplete with lettering by Jones (his lettering credits include 24 Panels for Image Comics, Nicnevin and the Bloody Queen for Humanoids and multiple issues of Commando Comics - including the reissued Ramsey's Raiders) - this is a must have for fans of horror and war comics alike. \n *NOTE* - Just for clarification, we would like to take this moment to say that none of the creators involved support the oppressive ideologies which are prevalent in this book, such as Nazism or Stalinism. The context of the story came about due to the ferocious nature of the battle in and around Stalingrad, which is why we felt it would be a good setting to choose for our story. The idea of War breaking down the barriers between our reality and the kingdom of Hell seemed most apt in the theater where Nazism and Stalinism clashed so brutally. The idea of two men on either side of such atrocious ideals, thrust into a war they did not wish to wage, at the behest of those with such extreme viewpoints, seemed like an interesting story to explore.\nBOOK PREVIEW \n\n'Vassily' print by Russell MacEwan\nInterior artist Russell MacEwan's variant cover.\nA DRM free Digital copy of the comic.\nDigital artbook of process work from Russell MacEwan\nA physical copy of the graphic novel.\nGUEST PIN UPS FOR STRETCHGOAL PRINT PACKAGE (ALL UNLOCKED!)\nPrint by guest artist Lucy Sullivan (Stretchgoal Print Package)\nGuest Pin-Up Print by artist Iain Laurie (stretch Goal Print Package)\nGuest Pin-Up Print by artist Russell M.

Technology was advancing at an unparalleled pace, the world was becoming more connected than ever before, and demons were finally becoming accepted as a regular part of society. Hmm? You don\u2019t remember the demons? No, trust me, they were everywhere. It\u2019d been a rough few decades since the portals opened, what with the supernatural suddenly unleashed upon the mundane world, but it had gotten so much better! Lesser imps were little more than brimstone pigeons, old superstitions were suddenly a lot scarier, and an untold number of hell dimensions had become just another series of exciting vacation spots. Truly, the world was a much more magical, if infernal, place!\nBut being a broke teen is the same in any reality, so what good are cursed relics and ancient evils when you can barely afford gas money? Desperate for any opportunity to bring some devilish delight into their lives, best friends Victor, Miri, and Reeves buy a cheap, do-it-yourself summoning circle from a mall kiosk. Their goal? To call forth their own personal demon and bind it to their souls. Because really, what better way is there to end summer vacation in style than a blood sacrifice between friends?\nCover Art\nCreated by Jordan Alsaqa and Ray Nadine, Raise Hell! is a coming-of-age comedy about the confusing emotions, messy relationships, and strange explorations that come with the last few years of high school. Also, demons. Oh, so very many demons.\nRaise Hell! follows the adventures of Victor Beck, Miriam Elrahal, and Ashley Reeves, a trio of high school juniors just trying to survive to graduation in the city of Eklund. Victor is an excitable goof around his friends and mom, but he's riddled with social anxiety and easily embarrassed in class and on his own. That doesn't stop him from rambling on for hours about his love of ska and the infernal, or from Naruto-running everywhere unironically. Reeves is skeptical of just about everything, and her temper has a way of getting the better of her, especially around her seemingly unflappable stepmom, Karen (UGH... Karen...). Call her by her first name at great risk to your personal well-being. And Miriam is a voice of reason among the insanity, a keeper of the peace within her friend group and in the world at large. That doesn't make her any less quick to freak out over a rare anime import DVD or at the possibility of her devoutly religious father learning about her occult interests.  \nOur lovable teens\nThis unlikely trio of punk teens think they're ready for whatever the underworld has to throw at them, but nothing can truly prepare them for the mischievous imp Alistair that the hellfire spits up...\nWith this campaign, our goal is to raise funding to complete and print a physical copy of Raise Hell!. As a thank you for supporting the project, we have a number of reward levels, including digital and physical copies of Raise Hell!, previous books from Jordan and Ray, stickers, an enamel pin, art prints, script edits from Jordan, and physical commissions from Ray. At the top level, you can even appear in the book enjoying a meal at the Eklund Park Mall's food court!\nIncluded below are several preview pages from early in the book as our heroes head to the mall to make their fateful purchase!\nClick the image to better read the pages!\nWriter Jordan Alsaqa is an N.C. State graduate with a degree in Creative Writing. He\u2019s successfully funded numerous comics through Kickstarter, including Terminal Protocol, Finding Peace, and We Have to Go Back. His current comic, Welderkin, is published digitally by Comicker Press. His work can also be found in numerous anthologies, including Alloy Anthology: Electrum from Ascend Comics and You Died from Iron Circus Comics. Jordan\u2019s high school years were spent playing video games, creating a ridiculously complex stick figure comic mythology, and listening to way more third-wave ska than any teen probably should\u2019ve in the late 2000s. You can keep up with Jordan's other projects on Twitter and at his website.\nArtist Ray Nadine has been drawing since they could hold a pencil, and has been making comics since 2013. They're currently working on a graphic novel that they're contractually obliged not to say much more about, and also illustrated Messenger on Webtoon. They've had stories featured in a handful of anthologies, notably Everything Is Going Wrong (edited by Mark!) and Local Haunts, edited by Kara Lais.  Ray's also created the webcomic Dollhouse, and several short comics including Anchored, The Collector, and The Ties That Bind. When Ray isn't working, they're playing too many video games, cooking, or rough-housing with their cats. Their favorite band is My Chemical Romance and they still listen to all the same crap they listened to in high school. Keep up with their art and projects on Twitter and their website.\nEditor Mark Bouchard is a non-binary writer/editor in Chicago, by way of New England who has been self-publishing comics since 2016. They are the editor and creator of EVERYTHING IS GOING WRONG: Comics On Punk & Mental Illness, and their writing has been published in a number of comic anthologies including A Wave Blue World\u2019s Dead Beats. They are currently writing a horror graphic novella due out in early 2021. Outside of comics, Mark enjoys curry and black coffee, often at the same time. They also write satire for The Hard Times and Hard Drive. You can follow them on Twitter for updates on their work and their dog, Juicebox. To read their short comics, and learn more about their past work, visit their website.\nFor funding, $500 will go towards paying Ray's remaining page rate for drawing, coloring, and lettering the story. Roughly $800 will go towards printing the book itself, with an additional $300 going towards producing the additional campaign rewards; got to get those swanky stickers, pins, and art prints! $700 will go towards shipping and fulfillment costs, while the final approximate 10% will go towards Kickstarter fees.\nBelow, you can get the full rundown of all the various reward levels available for this campaign. Each backer is taking a chance on this very personal passion project, and we plan to give it our all to show our thanks at every level. Domestic US shipping is included in each total, with international shipping costing an additional $15. And for the first 48 hours, the Physical Copy and Enamel Pin levels are available for a special early bird price!\nAt the Supporter level, in addition to our personal thanks, you'll be included in the Thank You section at the back of the book. You'll also have access to any behind-the-scenes material posted for backers in the campaign updates.\nAt the Digital Issue level, you'll receive a PDF copy of Raise Hell!. The digital copy will include all the same material as the physical book, including all pin-ups and stretch goals.\nWith the Digital Collection level, you'll receive additional PDFs of stories either written by Jordan or written/illustrated by Ray: Finding Peace by Jordan Alsaqa & Marie Enger, We Have to Go Back by Jordan Alsaqa & Sally Cantirino,  A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing by Jordan Alsaqa & Kacee Navarro, Dollhouse by Ray Nadine, Anchored by Ray Nadine, and The Ties That Bind by Ray Nadine.\nAt the Physical Issue level, you\u2019ll receive the print edition of Raise Hell!, signed by writer Jordan Alsaqa. You'll also receive a Raise Hell! sticker!\nAt the Art Print level, you\u2019ll get a special 8.5\"x11\" riso print of the Raise Hell! cast, designed and printed by Ray Nadine!\nArt not final\nAt the Enamel Pin level, you\u2019ll get a special 1.5\" hard enamel pin of Victor's GREATEST SKA MIX OF ALL TIME cassette tape.\nAll horns, all the time\nAnd now that both alternate pins have been unlocked, EVERY TIER that includes an enamel pin will now be able to choose which of the three pins (Victor, Miri, or Reeves) that you want included in your reward package. For the current Enamel Pin tier, if you should want two or three of the pins, we've added two new reward levels, the Double Pin tier ($40) and Triple Pin tier ($50), so you can simple upgrade your reward tier to assure you receive all the pins you want.\nFor all higher level tiers, as well as the Early Bird Enamel Pin tier, you just need to add an additional $10 to your pledge total for each pin. For early birds, this will maintain your initial savings while still allowing you to receive all three pins.\nThe Art Print tier and below WILL NOT be eligible to add pins on. You'll need to at least pledge at the initial Enamel Pin tier in order to receive any pins.\nLastly, given the popularity of the pins themselves, we've added a Just the Pins tier ($30) \nAt the Back Issues level, you'll receive physical copies of several past works from Jordan and Ray, including Finding Peace by Jordan Alsaqa & Marie Enger, We Have to Go Back by Jordan Alsaqa & Sally Cantirino, Flame & Flood Atop the Mountain by Jordan Alsaqa & Christine Skelly, Dollhouse by Ray Nadine, Anchored by Ray Nadine, and The Collector by Ray Nadine.\nAt the Editor level, Jordan will work with you to help edit and refine either a comic script (max. 24 pages) or pitch document that you\u2019re working on. This includes two rounds of edits and the option for an hour-long web or phone call. Jordan has eight years of previous editing experience, including numerous comic script and pitch edits, as well as work-for-hire rewrites. \nWant a Ray Nadine original to add to your collection? At the Art Commission level, you can do exactly that, commissioning an original 5\"x7\" traditional art piece from Ray. The artwork will be pen, ink, and spot color Posca. When you back at this level, you\u2019ll be contacted to make sure Ray is comfortable with the subject you\u2019d like to have drawn. You can see an example of this level right below!   \nFinally, why not enjoy a meal of\u2026 middling quality with your comic? At the Food Court Cameo level, you can appear in the book as one of the customers of the Eklund Park Shopping Mall! In addition, you'll receive a social media icon drawn by artist Ray Nadine.\nThis could be your face\nThe initial funding goal has been reached! Time for... STRETCH GOALS! \nUNLOCKED! - Stretch Goal #1: At $4000, we'll be producing an additional six-page story that'll be included in both the print and digital editions of Raise Hell! The short will follow Victor as he works his part-time job at the local used bookstore and ends up having a chance encounter with... the Demon Lord of Ska!\nUNLOCKED! - Stretch Goal #2: At $4500, we'll include a variant pin design! This one features Reeves's mixtape to go along with Victor's. Just some bands you've probably never heard of. When we send out the backer questionnaire, we'll ask which pin you'd like. If you'd like multiple pins, just add $10 per pin to your pledge! \nUNLOCKED! - Stretch Goal #3: At $5000, we'll include a second variant pin design! This one features Miri's mixtape, full of her favorite anime openings. Same as the other pins, we'll ask you which pin you'd like in the backer questionnaire, and if you'd like multiple pins, just add $10 per pin to your pledge!\nStretch Goal #4: At $6500, we'll be including two additional guest illustrations from artists Skylar Patridge and Vivian Truong in the book!

Presented exclusively as a deluxe format oversized hardcover, it's a dark, atmospheric tale set at the dawn of the Ottoman Empire -- a rich, grisly world of dazzling arts and brutal massacres, opulent palaces and bloodthirsty kings. \nDRAGON tells the story of Adil, a fallen old Muslim warrior, and Marjorie, a zealous young Christian nun, two scarred heroes who must overcome inherited bigotries and mutual distrust to hunt a demonic creature that wears the skin of a prince -- Vlad the Impaler, known to history as Dracula. \nA NOTE FROM AUTHOR SALADIN AHMED\nI can't tell you how excited I am about this! \nDRAGON is the Dracula story I've wanted to tell for years, full of everything that matters to me -- horrific creatures, rich history, wildly different characters coming together to confront evil. It's a story centered on the sorts of heroes that are usually pushed to the margins -- heroes who must reach across gulfs of culture and faith to face down the world's most terrifying monster.  \nCertain stories scream for certain artists, and as soon as this tale began to form in my head, I knew I wanted Dave Acosta to draw it. The way he goes from period details through pulp horror and classic comic influences is just breathtaking. He's outdoing himself with DRAGON, bringing to life Ottoman palaces and haunted forests in a way that will completely immerse the reader.  \nWhat you see here is just a taste, and I can't wait for you to experience his art -- along with Chris O'Halloran's dazzling colors and Hassan Otsmane-Elhaou's brilliant letters and design -- on massive, gorgeously printed pages. \nA STUNNING BOOK, A SIMPLE CAMPAIGN\nFor years readers have been asking me to launch an original story on Kickstarter, and I've finally taken the plunge! DRAGON is a story that demands total control by the creative team and begs to be rendered as a beautiful physical object. And Kickstarter is the ideal  way to maintain that control and get such an object directly into fans' hands.\nThis will be a lavish book, published as a Kickstarter exclusive. An oversized, slipcovered deluxe format hardcover printed on high quality paper and crammed with extras from creators' notes to concept art to script and pencil pages.\nThere are currently no plans to release DRAGON in trade paperback or digital. For now, this special event hardcover is the only way to experience the story! \nWe're offering a discounted early bird reward tier for those who support the project in the first 24 hours, but our campaign for DRAGON is deliberately very straightforward, with no bells and whistles. It's all about making a jaw-dropping book that showcases an intense story, and getting that book straight to readers.\nOUR TEAM  \nSALADIN AHMED won the 2017 Eisner Award for Best New Series alongside Christian Ward for Black Bolt. His short fiction has been anthologized by George RR Martin and performed by LeVar Burton. His novel Throne of the Crescent Moon was nominated for the Hugo Award and was cited in the Dungeons and Dragons Player\u2019s Handbook. Abbott, his creator owned comic with Sami Kivela, was nominated for the Bram Stoker award. Saladin currently writes Miles Morales: Spider-Man and The Magnificent Ms. Marvel for Marvel Comics. \nDAVE ACOSTA is a sequential artist from Metro Detroit, known mostly for his work on Elvira: Mistress Of The Dark for Dynamite. Dave has also illustrated Vampirella, The Shadow, Doc Savage, and the serial killer-thriller Twelve Devils Dancing.\nCHRIS O'HALLORAN is a colorist from Cork, Ireland. He colors Ice Cream Man from Image and has worked on books for Marvel, Dark Horse, Boom, Dynamite and others.\nHASSAN OTSMANE-ELHAOU is a comics letterer, half from Algeria and half from England. He's lettered cool comics like Red Sonja, X-O Manowar, and Protector. He's also the voice behind Strip Panel Naked, and editor of the Eisner-winning PanelxPanel magazine.\nNATE COSBY is an editor and writer, that's worked on Thor The Mighty Avenger, Red Sonja, Jim Henson's The Storyteller, World War Hulk, Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, James Bond, The Wonderful World Of Oz, Flash Gordon and sooooooooo many more. \n**A VERY IMPORTANT NOTE ON SHIPPING**\nShipping fees are not included in your pledge. Rather, all shipping will be charged after the campaign ends, just before the book ships.\nThis allows us to make sure you are paying the lowest possible shipping fees.

This anthology title featured futuristic stories of heroic adventurers with a mid-century aesthetic, and it is well-loved to this day, often for its lush, high-quality, imaginative covers. Just look at this winner from issue 71: \nPlanet Comics #71 from 1953\nHey everyone! My name\u2019s Jeff McClelland, and I write comics like The Tick and the 2019 Kickstarter-funded Black Terror: Social Insecurity. With this new iteration of Planet Comics, I\u2019d like to tell fun, imaginative stories under a sci-fi umbrella. To that end, I\u2019ve asked some of my friends to help out and I\u2019m really happy with the result. If you agree, then I hope you\u2019ll help us send this issue to print! If the campaign for this first issue is successful, I\u2019d like to publish a total of four issues on a (roughly) quarterly schedule.\nAs an added throwback, this issue will be presented in an oversized, magazine format, leaving lots of room for wide landscapes and immersive action!\nThe book\nSo what\u2019ll be included in this first issue? First, we\u2019ve got \u201cThe Bulwark\u201d, from myself and artist Andrea Schiavone. This story will be the book\u2019s continuing feature, told in serialized chapters along the way. Here\u2019s a quick preview!\nThe Bulwark preview\nThe Bulwark preview\nNext up is \u201cThe Old Man and the Agean Sea\u201d from my good friend and frequent collaborator, writer/artist Jeff McComsey (Honcho; Grendel, Kentucky). Jeff brings an aesthetic to this tale that is somehow both foreboding and warm, and this complete story features some of his best work yet.\nThe Old Man and the Agean Sea preview\nThen we\u2019ve got \u201cThe Night Tanya Tucker Uncancelled Earth\u201d from Jennie Wood (Flutter; A Boy Like Me) and Duane Redhead (2000AD; The Tick), both wonderful, creative people. I\u2019m thrilled that Planet Comics will be the venue for their first collaboration, and this complete story is so wild \u2013 I can\u2019t wait for everyone to see it all! \nThe Night Tanya Tucker Uncancelled Earth preview\nAlso included is an article by Diana Krueger on one of the pioneers of the original Planet Comics: Lily Ren\u00e9e! Diana highlights the life and times of Ren\u00e9e, one of the most prominent female artists from the mid-century run.\nI\u2019ve got a few more (secret!) plans to add some pages to the book if we get past our initial goal!\nREWARDS\nIt's a space ship!\nThe biggest reward for this campaign is, of course, the book. Whether you go in for a physical copy or electronic, I hope you\u2019ll feel that your pledge is well spent on these new sci-fi tales.\nThis first issue comes with two covers: a regular cover with art by Pietro, and a Kickstarter-exclusive variant cover by Matthew Dow Smith! You can order just the regular cover, or both at the same time.  \nPlanet Comics #1 Kickstarter exclusive cover by Matthew Dow Smith\nIn addition, everyone who pledges at the $8 level or above will get a copy of an electronic \u201cmaking of\u201d publication, with a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of this issue. You\u2019ll also get your name printed in a \u201cthank you\u201d section at the end of the book, and you'll get an electronic copy of an original Planet Comics issue from the 1940s!\nThere are a few additional, limited, physical rewards that you can get in this campaign. The first is a neat vinyl sticker of this updated Planet Comics logo, designed by Alan Gallo!\nI\u2019m also offering up prints of Matthew Dow Smith\u2019s variant cover image, sans logos or other text.\nAnd you'll have a chance to get one of the last few copies of Black Terror: Social Insecurity and maybe a few other books I've written!\nThe Black Terror: Social Insecurity\n*Also! The first 30 backers - at any physical level - will receive a signed copy of The Tick 2020 FCBD Special!* \nFree to the first 30 physical backers!\nTHE CAMPAIGN GOAL\nMy first goal with this campaign is to be able to pay the creators a decent rate for their work. After that, I hope to offset some of the printing and shipping costs that otherwise might be prohibitive.\nIf this campaign exceeds its initial goal, all of the extra funds will be funneled directly back into the book, adding pages and helping us get started with issue #2!\nFollow me online!\nIf you\u2019re looking for more content, progress reports or just to see pictures of my dog, you can always follow me online by clicking the images below:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re currently about 75% finished with the art for this book.

I'm Daniel Kalban, and I'm the creator/writer of AmericanDreams. Now you may ask yourself \"What the heck is American Dreams?\" American Dreams is a superhero comic set in New York City at the turn of the Twentieth Century. With my publisher, Short Fuse Media Group, LLC., I have released two issues of this series. Working with me on this book is the amazing art team of Dody Eka (pencils), Tebe Andry (inks), and Warnia K. Sahadewa (colors), with Matt Bowers (letters). Netho Diaz (GI Joe) provides the variant cover, and Tommy Shelton colors both the main and variant covers. \nToday, we're bringing you the opportunity to get all caught up on this amazing series while also offering issue #3 for the very first time. Short Fuse Media Group helped get the issue #1 released after some issues with a previous publisher and we released issue #2 direct at Baltimore Comic Con last year!!! With comic conventions shut down due to Covid-19, I decided to hop into the driver's seat and bring the entire series to Kickstarter. If you like superheroes, alternative history, or both, you are in for an exciting read.\nGreetings From American Dreams!\nTHE STORY SO FAR\nJake Gold is a poor Jewish immigrant living on New York's Lower East Side with his parents, siblings, and grandfather in 1900. He's a worker in a sweatshop by day; by night, he's fighting as part of a never-ending turf war between rival ethnic gangs for whatever scrap of the territory they can get. For him, the American Dream is a fairy tale; one a poor immigrant can never live.\nPage from American Dreams issue 1\nThomas Edison, however, truly believes in the American Dream; and he's made sure to get his way to the top by any means. He has found an old design by his old employee-turned-rival, Nikola Tesla: a machine to harness the energy from the stars. \nPage from American Dreams issue 1\nWith JP Morgan's financial backing, Edison sets up his machine in Central Park and throws the switch.\nPage from American Dreams issue 1\nThat, of course, is when everything changes for Jake, Edison, and the rest of New York City. And dark forces will do anything to take power in the midst of chaos.....\nPage from American Dreams Issue 2\nSurrounding Jake is a cast of characters with names both unfamiliar and world-famous. This is the time of Harry Houdini, Emma Goldman, and other characters from this turbulent time in American History.\nSet against the backdrop of the Gilded Age, American Dreams is superheroes-meets-historical fiction in an action-packed adventure. It also speaks some harsh truths of the realities of that seemingly long ago era...and how things might not have changed as much as we have liked.\nA SNEAK PEEK INTO THE PAST\nLet's take a dive into American Dreams, shall we?\nPage From American Dreams Issue 3\nPage from American Dreams Issue 3\nPage from American Dreams Issue 3\nPage from American Dreams Issue 3\nSO WHY KICKSTARTER?\nYour Kickstarter contributions help fund future issues of American Dreams!

Example: If you're interested in an enamel pin ($12), a tote bag ($20) and a banner ($55), choose the banner ($55 + $8 shipping) reward tier to start.\nSTEP 2: Now you'll be adding the funds needed for the rest of your items. The guide shows each item and their cost + shipping. Add the necessary funds for each item you choose to pledge for. Example: An enamel pin is $12 and shipping is free. A tote bag is $20 + $5 shipping. $12 + $20 + $5 = $37 gets added.\nSTEP 3: Add all your numbers together. Starting reward tier + additional item total + additional shipping total = PLEDGE TOTAL. Example: $55 starting (+$8 shipping) + $32 (added item cost) + $5 (added shipping cost) =  $100 TOTAL.\nHave any questions? Do the numbers not quite add up, or does your shipping seem off?

So they strap up, hit the streets and are ready to fight back against bigotry with a sequin baseball bat and some bad ass righteous fury! \nThe fabulous Bi Phallicia\nFollow the most fabulous street gang in the world as they patrol the Gay Village, step up to bigoted politicians and bash down the bashers. And in the midst of it all, they discover there's a conspiracy behind it all!\nThey're sick of being seen as victims! Sick of having crimes against them ignored! The Glitter Vipers are here to fight back!\nThe story is a brisk 60 pages, with a few behind the scenes extras thrown in too to give you a great little package in a glitter grindhouse revenge fantasy!\nThe gang's all here! Art by Katie Fleming\nWho Are the Glitter Vipers?\n Bi Phallicia  - Bi Phallicia, real name Jason Filson, is a Manchester drag queen of some repute, who as well as her weekly shows runs a support group for those that have been victims of abuse, bigotry or hate crimes. Unfortunately, she finds herself becoming not just the organiser but also one of the members. She takes on the lead in the Glitter Vipers gang when they decide to fight back. \nJesus Moretti - Jesus is a Colombian immigrant living in Manchester, UK and close friends with Bi and her group. He's dating Anton Bakunin. He's a broader, tougher looking man who came to the UK to live a more open and free life as a gay man. \nAnton Bakunin - Anton had a rough upbringing, finding it a lot harder to hide who he is as a gay man. An Eastern European immigrant who fled his home where being gay can result in being 'vanished', Anton came to the UK to try and find peace. Unfortunately, homophobia isn't just something that happens 'somewhere else'. \nMelissa 'Mel' Carter - Mel is a garage worker in Manchester, and is dating Bri. They are attendees of the support group after the pair were attacked by homophobes on a tram.  Mel is very tough, and has been harbouring a lot of anger over the surprise attack they suffered, and is eager to make sure nothing like it ever happens again.\n Bryony 'Bri' Stonehouse - Manchester born and bred, Bri has been dating Mel for nearly two years now. She also felt more anger than anything else after they were attacked, but she abhors violence entirely. Instead, Bri uses her smarts and community spirit to build the community support group stronger than ever before. \nCallum 'Cal' Wilkes - Cal came out much later in life, as his life in a biker gang didn't feel like the safest place to be openly gay. In fact, it turned out he was right when he did get outed to his gang and he wound up kicked out and alone. Struggling at first to find his tribe after this rejection, Cal is now a regular of Manchester's leather scene and brings his gruff, take-no-guff attitude to the local queer community. \nQueenie Iwobi - Queenie is a trans woman from a Nigerian family, she moved from her home in London to Manchester for council work years ago. Now, she takes part in the support group as a way of managing the daily micro-aggressions she faces as a proud trans WOC in this world, and to help support others like her. Also not a fan of violence, she joins Bri at the homebase, creating a helpful, safe space for the community and using her skills as a community support worker. \nAlbert 'Alby' Prince - a 16 year old trans masc kid, Alby has been sneaking out to the gay scene for a while to find a safe space to be their authentic self, away from their home where they are not out. Alby became a big fan of Bi's shows, and Bi took them under her wing so she could make sure Alby was having a safe experience. Alby prefers he/him or they/them pronouns, but is not yet out to their family.\nPage of inks by Katie Fleming\nContent Warning\nWe are aware that the topic of hate crimes, bigotry and assault are sensitive topics, that we as a queer community often face far too often. Sensitive to this, the book will contain content warnings so that readers can be aware going in what to expect. \nWe are also aware that it can be annoying to be seen as just the victims all the time. And while there can be a lot of emotions that are discussed after these kind of things, one emotion is often overlooked or swept-under-the-rug: anger. \nPage of inks by Katie Fleming\nSometimes when we see these things happen, or when they happen to us, there can be a strong sense of justified anger, and we look at that through the medium of revenge fantasy grindhouse action and explore what sense of resolution or satisfaction can be found there. \nAll the while telling an entertaining, thoughtful action story in a very modern world. We'll have fun, but won't be making fun. \nWho's It For?\nHave you ever seen the news and just felt so angry? Then you, for sure. \nBut seriously, I think anyone who has felt that kind of strong reaction to things that happen in the world, whether it be a story of injustice they've seen in the news, or an article of a hate-fuelled attack, or worse, have had personal experience with that; I think anyone who relates to that will find something to relate to in Glitter Vipers. \nQueenie Iwobi by Katie Fleming\nAnyone who has stood up to or is aware of organised hate, systemic violence and bigotry in this world can maybe find something in Glitter Vipers that speaks to them. We've all felt angry: this is about our right to that rage, and finding an outlet for it.\nWe all get told that we should not let that anger rise, that we don't have the right to our anger or how lashing out is wrong, but see the same things happen again and again. Glitter Vipers will explore that anger, it's justification and how it too can have a role in recovery, for good or ill.\nGenerally suitable for teens aged 16 years of age or older, the book has some light use of course language, violence, and as mentioned, sensitive topics around bigotry, hate crimes and assault. If you are buying for someone else, please do bare that in mind. \nCover by James Gifford\nWho's Making It?\nOne thing that we wanted to achieve with this book was the keep the whole creative team as queer identifying people. It's an LGBTQIA+ focused story, so it only felt right to have it be made by LGBTQIA+ people. \nThe team is as follows:-\nJoe Glass - Writer\n Joe Glass - Joe is the writer and co-creator of popular LGBTQ+ superhero adventure series, The Pride, now a successful ComiXology Originals series. He's also the writer of Acceptable Losses, a mature, political thriller with a dark edge. Most recently, he's worked with RuPaul's Drag Race star Manila Luzon on a countdown Instagram comic for her single, Robbed! Joe lives in South Wales with his family, and a petulant cat named Oliver. You can find his website here. \nKatie Fleming - Art\n Katie Fleming - Katie Fleming is a queer artist from Dublin, Ireland.  She began creating comics with her Partner with their LGBTQ+ comic '100 Times' and '100 More Times'.  since then she's worked on numerous anthologies and comics, such as 'Heart of Steal', 'The Black Rubric' and the webcomic, 'Ship Wrecked'. Glitter Vipers is her first graphic novel and she's super excited. When she's not making comics she's spending her time as a Werewolf. Her work can be found here. \n Kelly Fitzpatrick - Kelly Fitzpatrick is known for her work on books such as: Bitch Planet, Supergirl: Being Super, Wonder Woman: Tempest Tossed, Shade the Changing Girl, DC: Bombshells, Archie, and Josie and the Pussycats. Nominated for the esteemed Hugo awards, she is also a past nominee for Autostraddle, Ghastly & Prism awards and has worked on titles nominated for the GLAAD and the Harvey awards. Her client list is available on her website and includes such prestigious publishers as DC Comics, Archie Comics & Dark Horse Comics. \nLucas Gattoni - Letters\n Lucas Gattoni - Lucas Gattoni is a seasoned graphic designer and typesetter now pursuing his dream job of comic book lettering. He has lettered GLAAD nominated Liebestrasse for ComiXology Originals, Twin Worlds for Action Lab, Eskimo Kisses for Scout Comics and is currently lettering the Spanish version of Sonic The Hedgehog for IDW. He lives in his home country of Argentina with his husband and their three unnamed goldfish (oops, make that two now). His website is here.\nTed Brandt - Editor\n Ted Brandt - Ted Brandt is best known as an inker, working with his partner Ro on the Eisner- and GLAAD-nominated CROWDED from Image Comics. He likes long walks on the beach, and eating too much pizza. Ted is using his editorial hat on Glitter Vipers to help make the book the best it can be. \nJames Gifford - Cover Artist\n James Gifford - James Gifford is a cis gay illustrator and storyboard artist who lives in London. He's a wayward pirate, plundering whatever illustration jobs he runs ashore on, never resting in one spot for long. A lone creative, a side-spitting gunslinger. The moment you think you have him pinned, he slips through your fingers like smoke. He's earned coin from Cartoon Network and Marvel comics and is currently creating content for Dungeons and Dragons in his spare time. You'll chip your teeth on his tough exterior, but deep down his heart is gold. His website is here. \nSpire Eaton - Spire is a graphic designer, artist, animator and comic creator based in Florida. He designed the Glitter Vipers logo for the book. That fabulousness is all down to him! You can check out his work here.\nHow Far Along Is It?\nAt time of launching the campaign, the book is entirely written, final inks are done for about roughly 20% of the book, with a further dozen pages ahead prepped too, and colours and cover work is starting in conjunction as the rest of the pages are drawn.\nAlby Prince by Katie Fleming\nWe estimate that by the end of the campaign the book will be half way or more complete, and have allowed a roomy space of months between campaign end and delivery in an effort to ensure prompt delivery of the finished product. \nBy following and/or backing the campaign, we will keep you updated with new pages and art as they happen, so you'll be the first to see more as it comes!\n How is the Money Spent?\nA Breakdown of How the Goal Amount is Split\nThe majority of the goal amount is to pay for the art production of Glitter Vipers: this includes the drawing/inking, the colours and the design elements of putting the book together. \nThe next biggest elements are the printing costs (currently based on a modest-to-large print run) and the shipping costs of sending copies out to those who back for physical reward tiers. Costs of shipping have been worked out based on impending Royal Mail price changes taking effect on July 1st 2020. Due to COVID-19 and changes in legislation for USPS in America, international shipping will be rising significantly, but we are baring this in mind in the planned goal amount and postage prices. \nThe smallest element is to go on extra rewards elements, like the stickers. \nAs such, the greatest overall chunk of the the goal amount we are asking for is to cover the production cost and to make sure our art team get a good, speedy payment for their hard work. \nSample colours by Kelly Fitzpatrick\nWhat Can I Get?\nWell, naturally we are looking to provide both digital and print options of the book as reward tiers. In this day and age, there's no excuse to not offer both options to backers, so both will be readily available. \nThere is also a tier to get multiple copies of the book, at a discounted price! This is primarily for comic stores that would like to support and stock the book, but also libraries and heck, if a group of friends all want to support but are on a budget, or you think you know a group of friends or family who'd all be interested in a copy, you can back at that level to get multiple copies at discount. This level is limited.  \nThere are options to get signed copies of the book, signed by writer Joe Glass, but again these are limited due to the time and energy taken in signing a lot of books can take.\nWe also have Glitter Vipers stickers available, so you can grab reward tiers with those included. \nSample of the Embroidered Patch\nOr, why not grab an embroidered Glitter Vipers patch! This is a very limited reward tier, so once it's gone, it's gone. Get it while you can! \nPlus, there's just the positive energy of knowing you've supported a great, queer focused comic project by queer creators, and that's worth everything, right! \nFinally, we have been sure to include the price of postage so when you back, you'll know exactly how much it will be in total. We've based the postage prices on the updated Royal Mail pricing coming into effect on July 1st, 2020, based on the planned sizing of the book and estimated weight.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSometimes life gets in the way, and unforeseen obstacles pop up causing a delay in getting the products shipped in time. In this campaign, we have estimated a lot of time for completion and printing, so all things being equal there shouldn't be a delay to the books going out, but as ever, it is an estimate. \n\nLikewise, as far as postage goes, we have sourced good, strong, tough packaging that should withstand any handling from delivery services. Similarly, we have taken into account the new postal rates for sending to the United States from the UK, and have priced accordingly. This does mean International postage costs are higher, but with the changes in USPS and increases in general post costs due to COVID-19, it is worked out to be as fair and cheap as possible, while still maintaining a relatively speedy and well-handled delivery. \n\nThe biggest challenge is the goal amount: while it can seem large, the goal is what it is to allow for making sure the team are all paid fairly for the books production, the printing of a good sized print run and shipping. The biggest help to overcome this challenge is to share and spread the word of the campaign, so for all of you deciding to support, we hope you can help us in spreading the word too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Our unending thanks for helping us on our fight back!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a36 or more", "title": "Digital Copy", "descp": "A digital copy of Glitter Vipers\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}], "stat": ["195 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "Print Copy", "descp": "You'll get a print copy of the book and a digital copy too!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy\nPrint Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["165 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a314 or more", "title": "Sticker!", "descp": "At this level, as well as your print and digital copies of Glitter Vipers, you'll be able to mark your membership to the GV gang with a shiny holo-sticker!

We are grateful to walk this path with you.\nTHE ADEPT is a new comic book series written by Tasha Huo and Charlie Stickney from an original story by Peter Shiao and featuring artwork and colors from Yishan Li and letters from Gabriela Downie. The 42-page first issue tells the deep and personal story of a young woman who begins a journey to become the adept to an ancient martial tradition which has been lost to the ages. It is a story of action, transformation and mystery, but at its core it is about homecoming. And what\u2019s homecoming without a chance for redemption?  And you know what ALWAYS comes with redemption\u2026?\nKUNG-FU - ok not always. But ours does! \nWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to kick off this limited series, the first in the Immortal interconnected Wuxia content universe.\nIt might sound unfamiliar, but Wuxia has influenced contemporary pop culture's most impactful stories from Crouching Tiger to The Matrix to Star Wars.  Wuxia is a fantasy genre of romanticism and poeticism from the East. It is the realm of the outsider, the wandering hero, who is compelled by circumstance to stand against injustice and champion the common person.\nWelcome to... \nTHE ADEPT is about Amy, a young Chinese-American who runs away from an abusive home, destined to be another orphan street thug. \nBut then she is visited in her dreams by a Shaolin Kung Fu Master, who begins to train her in the wilds of this Dreamscape, preparing her to face an unnamed evil that he'll never speak about.  The dreams give her meaning \u2013 purpose \u2013 the training empowers her \u2013 and she learns to cope.  But why her?  \nThen, with no warning, the dreams just stop. And just as suddenly as he came into her life, he's gone.  Was he just a figment of her imagination?\nIt\u2019s now been ten years and Amy comes home again, hoping to rekindle the relationship with Ali, the younger sister she once abandoned. Ali has had her own trauma and pain in that time, but she covers it up with a carefree, carpe-diem attitude.  If you don't think about your pain, did it ever really happen? \nAmy scores tickets too a benefit concert for Ali's favorite singer - Sasha True. An international sensation, famous for catchy lyrics, flashy dance moves and a beat with a killer hook.  (Sasha is more than what she seems, and when the going gets tough her \"true\" colors will be revealed)   \nWhat could possibly derail the reunion of the estranged sisterhood?\nBad guys. When a kidnapping attempt targets Sasha, Amy has no choice but to break out her Shaolin skill learned from her dreams.  But this is no amateur kidnapping, it's a well-organized attack from a shadowy operation. \nAnd then, among the commotion\u2026a surprise. She comes face to face with the Shaolin Master from her dreams. Wu-what indeed.\nWe can\u2019t wait to introduce you to Amy, Ali, Fa Sheng, and Sasha and we\u2019ve got much to unpack over this series. Where has Amy been? Why did the dreams choose her? What is this shadowy organization and how is it connected to the Shaolin Master? And hold up, the Shaolin Master is real?  \nStandard Cover by Adept #1 Artist Yishan Li\nTHE ADEPT is the first project from Immortal Studios, a new comic-first content studio.  We are creating an interconnected universe of modern and elevated Wuxia stories. Ours are stories of transformation, a content ethos built on empowerment, self-discovery, and connection with the world around us. We are setting these stories in today's world - full of diversity, modern concerns, and reflective of the moment. Our \u201csuperhero\u201d stories are guided by one core principle: in each of us is a hero of our own choosing.  Let's Awaken the Hero in Everyone. \nIt\u2019s fitting that our ambitions get, well, kicked off with a Shaolin story. Shaolin is the birthplace of kung fu as we know it today and really grounds us within this world where physical combat and spiritual enlightenment are one in the same. This is what makes it different from mixed martial arts, boxing, or a street fight. \nIt is a 1500 year old tradition that has been carried right into modern day as the source of contemporary pop culture fascination with martial arts \u2013 from Bruce Lee to the Last Airbender. We are excited to be adding to that tradition with our own take that really goes to the transformational roots of this legacy.\nWhat we hope will really set this series apart is the attention to the authenticity of Shaolin forms depicted in our panels.  To recreate the intricacy of the forms, we learned from Gene Ching, a 32nd generation layman disciple of the Shaolin Temple and master of martial arts, who worked with Conor Hughes to meticulously plot and layout the action sequences. \nWe are proud to present here fourteen pages of Adept #1.  These pages are the result of a lot of life experience, hard work, and collaboration from a talented bevy of artists and teammates, old friends and new friends, and now hopefully you - our community.\nUm, do you want to be a rockstar?\nWe\u2019ve got some awesome things lined up. Variant covers from two amazing guest artists, collector\u2019s items, and\u2026you know whenever you\u2019re like ready to be world famous we hear there are some openings in Sasha True\u2019s Band.\nFirst, the variant covers...\nTHE KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE is brought to you by the imaginative hand of guest artist Zi Xu.  We love this perspective from the baddies as they charge Amy and Fasheng, poised in their martial stances.  And with that look in their eyes, I think I'd sit this one out.  Zi Xu is an illustrator, concept artist, and matte painter who has worked in film, advertising, and games.  Check out more of her work at https://www.zixu.co/ \nThe Adept Kickstarter Variant Cover by Zi Xu\nOur 2nd Variant hails from a little town called White Ash.  We were gobsmacked by the work Sam Beck did on White Ash #5 that we didn't think we could pull her over to our corner of the universe.  And oh, does she have a doozy of a concept for you.  Starts with a DIE and ends with a HARD.  The cover is still in the works, but you can see that aforementioned White Ash cover below.  Check out more of Sam's work right here - https://sambeck.ca/ \nVariant Cover by Sam Beck\nIn addition to these hot variants, we've cooked up a few other tricks to pull you into the world of The Adept. \n All of our backers receiving physical rewards will receive a commemorative Sasha True Benefit Concert ticket, the most exclusive ticket in town and a major setpiece featured in Issue #1. For the first 100 print backers, the ticket will be signed by one of our creatives.  And...who knows...what\u2019s a ticket if it can\u2019t eventually get you into something\u2026 \nYeah, essentially our bat signal.  This collectible pin of the Immortal logo is molded in hard enamel and will be at least 7/8th inches long.  Wear it proudly.  Who knows,  if we ever cross paths and you\u2019re wearing your pin and we're wearing ours\u2026well what a meeting that could be. Each pin comes with a laser etched number.  Someone out there is getting #1.\nWe are super proud of this set of Adept Trading Cards featuring authentic Shaolin forms. We have tried really hard to make Shaolin tangible, meticulously researching and integrating real forms into the pages of our issues. This set of three cards will feature authentic Shaolin forms that are featured in Issue #1. On the front of the card is the move in its dynamic form from actual panel art. On the back will be a step-by-step progression of the form and a introduction to the history and significance. We hope we can convey the intricacy and history of this ancient martial art. New trading cards will be issued with each issue. Collect them all.\nWould you like a piece of original art?  Yishan Li will create by hand a 6x9 fully colored and inked exclusive just for you.  Choose from one of your new Adept friends - Amy, Ali, Fa Sheng, or Sasha.  Want to see yourself in art?  No problem.  Want Yishan to do a character from ANOTHER universe?  We won't feel too hurt.  Speaking of Yishan...\nThe Sasha True Benefit Concert Package.  This is essentially our everything package. You get the book, you get the variants, and the pin and the trading cards. But also some exclusive items. We're making a poster and a t-shirt out of this fabulous depiction of Sasha by Yishan.  It\u2019ll feel just like you spent a sweaty night at a Sasha True concert...minus the kidnapping attempt from a nefarious global organization...spoiler alert.  We\u2019re only printing a limited number of posters and t-shirts and we have very big plans for Sasha, so let these items prove you were on the Sasha train from the beginning. \n Well, there is only one other way you can get closer to Sasha. Join the band. In this most exclusive of packages, we will draw your face on one of the band members for Sasha True. You got to be ok with us taking a bit of a pop rock interpretation of you, but we promise that you'll be recognizable to all the Sasha fans in your life. What\u2019s more Sasha and her band are in line to play quite a roll throughout the Adept series, and there you\u2019ll be for the full of it.  We apologize in advance: music agents can be quite the annoyance.\nOur final last most exclusive can't get it anywhere else premium-est reward.  We'll gather together Peter and Charlie and (schedules permitting) any of the other creatives for a video conference chat about the making of Adept #1.  You will have unfettered access to the creative minds behind the story as we go page-by-page through the issue reminiscing about the inspirations, choices, and kung fu that went into making The Adept.  Learn how the team translated the intricacy of Shaolin form to comic panels.  Hear about the beginning of Immortal Studios and the future of the martial arts storyverse.  Have your own questions about the biz?  Launching your own project?  We're happy to share our experience and advice.  \nWe are so grateful for this all-star lineup of incredibly talented creatives who have brought this project to life.  Allow me to gush.  (Starting with Conor Hughes, who did these sweet portraits) \n You might know Charlie Stickney from White Ash, the astoundingly successful independent comic book that started right here on Kickstarter (prob with the help of many of you). He is a writer/producer residing in Los Angeles who\u2019s been fortunate enough to work for companies including: Sony Pictures, Revolution Studios, Universal Pictures, Hulu and Scholastic Productions. He\u2019s developed and created animated shows like Cosmic Quantum Ray and Horrible Histories. While in college, Charlie interned in the editorial offices at Marvel. \n This was Tasha Huo's first big dance in the comic book world, and boy did she learn the steps and teach us some as well.  Tasha was an assistant at Universal when her spec script DARKNESS was chosen as the first project for a Warner Bros / Black List partnership.  Tasha has written for EuropaCorp, Gaumont, and Ubisoft where she adapted CHILD OF LIGHT for television.  And ooooh, if I could just utter one little word about her next movie project...  \n If someone can explain how we were able to pull Yishan Li, please end the mystery - email contact@immortal-studios.com We're bowled over by this match of style and content.  As you can see, this entire page is a paean to her style and finesse and you haven't even seen the issue-ending boss sequence.  She has worked for DC and Dark Horse (something called Duffy or maybe Buffy the Vampire Slayer, perhaps you've heard of it).  She also wields the creator pen, having summoned Sugar  for Top Cow and Paradox Girls for Image. \n Peter's vision infuses everything we do.  Peter Shiao is Founder and CEO of Immortal Studios and career-long innovator in entertainment and media ventures between East and West.  Peter spent his childhood reading Chinese Wuxia novels and took to core those transcendent martial knights.  Steeped in the sphere of politics, Peter pivoted to a new career in media as a means of expressing his mission for social transformation through stories.  He founded and built the US-China Film Summit, founded the first Hollywood-China investment fund, and produced the first US-China film co-production.  He was chosen by the Shaolin Temple to be their brand builder and has worked with Shaolin on content development.  His original idea was developed into The Adept.\nImmortal is committed to authentic depiction of Shaolin, and Gene Ching brings the authenticity.  He is a 32nd generation layman disciple of the original Shaolin Temple.  He was the publisher of Kung Fu Tai Chi, the largest newstand magazine devoted to Chinese martial arts until it ceased printing.  He is also a military Provost master at Fencing and the author of Shaolin Trips. Gene served as a weapons expert for the TV show Man at Arms: Art of War, appearing alongside Danny Trejo and Robert Rodriguez.\n Another steal from the town of White Ash, Conor Hughes translated the intricacy of Gene's choreography into layouts for the martial.  Conor's breakout work has been the popular Kickstarter comic White Ash. Previous to that he was one of the winners of the Millarworld art contest as well as being published in the Anthology Graphic Canon and Twisted Savage Dragon Funnies.\nYou can troll him on twitch at twitch.tv/conorhughes where he can often be found making comics as well as a home in Hopewell NJ, with his amazing wife and giggle monster baby girl.\nOur letterer, Gabriela Downie, was born and raised in Los Angeles, daughter to Central American immigrants, and is at the helm of diversity and inclusion in the comic book industry. Her skills range from print production, digital illustration, world-buidling development, writing, graphic design and lettering. There\u2019s not a component in comic book crafting she hasn\u2019t tackled. Her name can be seen on the shelves of every comic book store, and even listed on the New York Time\u2019s Best in Comics. Her goal is to spread the message of love, forgiveness and inclusion, for all artists, of every color, background, age or gender. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWell, what a moment we\u2019re in. Certainly when we started this journey, we had no inkling of what would hit us all by March. And while on the day of this writing, life begins to nudge towards normalcy, it is uncertain what the future brings. We urge all of our family \u2013 artist and vendors and you readers \u2013 to return to your own normal at your own pace. That being said, we have some really dedicated people behind us who want to see this thing breathe as much as we do. We will continue to monitor the situation and will communicate at every step of the way.\n\nOf course this is our first Kickstarter. And though we are learning a bit as we go, we couldn\u2019t have a better Kung Fu Master in Charlie. This will be Mr. Stickney\u2019s eighth Kickstarter campaign and he has been an absolute champion in teaching us all the moves. (But any mistakes are ours alone!)\nThe script is finished because Tasha is a PRO and Yishan is already well into the art. We\u2019ve got our rewards vendors lined up and Charlie has walked us straight into some of the most reliable printers in the biz.\n\nWhatever goes down, we\u2019ll keep you informed. We overcommunicate (honestly, how long have we been scrolling here?). We are available to answer questions and concerns. We want you to be with us for the long haul. We feel so strongly about what we can create together and we are poised to do what we can to earn and keep your loyalty. Really, we just see this as the beginning of loooong relationship.

The key to it all is hidden in their basement...can they unlock eternal life before it's too late?\n\nAeonian 3 picks up where issue 2 left off. After learning the struggle the family is going through and their wish to live forever by any means necessary, we dive deeper into the dynamics that drive the children and the parents' relationship.

Thus begins their quarantine. \nPortraits by Chris Matthews\nThey are kept in their apartment by Guard-Bots that patrol the halls. All their food comes courtesy of the Goo dispenser in their kitchen (purple is tastier than blue). They can watch one channel on the TV and they have no way of contacting anyone back on Earth. Tempers flair and Peter swears he saw a giant space slug fly past his window. However, all this soon becomes the least of their problems as their bodies start to change and they become a lot closer as a family than they've ever been before... \nBenjamin Filby wants you to stay inside\nAndy W Clift revels in red\nWe are also incredibly excited to have DARICK ROBERTSON (THE BOYS, PUNISHER:BORN, TRANSMETROPOLITAN and HAPPY) providing the cover for the book. \n Darick is also kindly allowing us to sell his original cover art as part of the campaign.\nExamples of some of Darick Robertson's previous covers - spectacular!\nCREATORS' BACK CATALOGUE\nMost of the creators on the comic have released numerous previous comics, a large bunch of which we're excited to be able to offer you in our CREATORS' BACK CATALOGUE reward tier. Get 22 amazing comics previously released by our wonderful creators as well as the new QUARANTINE comic for \u00a345-50 - that works out at less than \u00a32 per comic. \nAll the back catalogue digital comics are ready and waiting, so they can be with you as soon as the funds clear to keep you going through the rest of the lockdown.\nHere's a selection of what you'll get - one hell of a bargain\nWHAT IS PRESTIGE FORMAT?\nPrestige format is most famously associated with the original run of Frank Miller's Dark Knight Returns. It's higher quality than a standard comic with a stiffer cover and a perfect bind more or less like a trade paperback or OGN - basically, it's going to be really cool. \nEdward bentley hopes you have a lovely day\nHOW DID THIS MADNESS HAPPEN?\nIt was a strange time. Me (Jordan) and just about everyone I know was in self isolation. The planet was in lock down. I needed something to do to keep occupied. First I grew a sweet beard. Once that was complete I spent a bit of time on Twitter and noticed that a lot of my wonderfully talented artist friends were also looking for things to do.\nRory Donald warned you about standing too close to the glass\nThen it hit me. A comic where a different artist draws each page of a script. And we could get the whole thing completed during the lock down period - a comic conceived and drawn in less than two months. \nRussell Mark Olson is available for family portraits\nI fired off a message to a group of these artists. Thinking they'd tell me to 'get lost - we're busy with our own super awesome projects'. But they didn't. They all said 'yes'. That's when the panic struck. I really had to make this happen. Now here we are. It's happening. I've even manged to beg, blackmail and badger many other incredible artists to be involved and they're all delivering spectacular art. \nNow we just need you to help us get it into print. \n\n\u00a32,500 - GARY ERSKINE INTERIOR PAGE ADDED TO THE COMIC - UNLOCKED\nSome examples of Gary Erskine's incredible work\nIf we hit \u00a32,500 then a page of the story drawn by the one and only Gary Erskine (Dan Dare, Hellblazer, Sabrina The Teenage Witch) will be added to both the physical and digital versions of the comic.\n \u00a33,000 - SHAKY KANE INTERIOR PAGE ADDED TO THE COMIC - UNLOCKED \nSome examples of Shaky Kane's amazing work\nIf we hit \u00a33,000 then a page of the story drawn by the legendary Shaky Kane (Judge Dredd, Elephantmen, Image Comics' The Beef) will be added to both the physical and digital versions of the comic. \n\u00a34,000 - IAIN LAURIE ART PRINT - UNLOCKED\nIf we hit \u00a34,000 then all backers of the book will receive this beautiful art print by Iain Laurie in either physical or digital form depending on whether they backed a physical or digital tier.\n\u00a35,000 - AN ADDITIONAL 4 PAGES ADDED TO THE COMIC - UNLOCKED\nIf we hit \u00a35,000 then we will extend both the physical and digital versions of the comic by 4 WHOLE PAGES. These pages will be filled with a bunch of the incredible designs and sketched created by the artists whilst making the comic, giving you even more insight into how their stunning art work came to life.\n\u00a36,000 - WARWICK FRASER-COOMBE ART PRINT - UNLOCKED\nIf we hit \u00a36,000 all our backers will receive an art print by the awesome WARWICK FRASER-COOMBE commissioned especially for Quarantine in either digital or physical form depending on whether you backed a physical or digital reward tier. \nAnd here is the print!\nThe original line art by Warwick is also available to buy!\nHere is the original Line Art by Warwick which is available to buy!\n\u00a37,000 - JOHN McCREA ART PRINT - UNLOCKED \nIf we hit \u00a37,000 all our backers will receive an art print by the legendary JOHN McCREA (Hitman, Judge Dredd, Superboy, Spider-Man, The Boys) commissioned especially for Quarantine in either digital or physical form depending on whether you backed a physical or digital reward tier.\nJohn is also kindly allowing us to sell his original pin-up artwork as part of the campaign. \n\u00a39,000 - BONUS 3 PAGE COMIC STORY W/ ART BY LUKE PARKER, J FRANCIS TOTTI & CRIMINAL AND HELLBLAZER ARTIST SEAN PHILLIPS - UNLOCKED \nIf we can make \u00a39,000 then we will add a bonus story to the book in the form of a 3-page comic. Like the main story this comic will have each page drawn by a different artist. Luke Parker (Merrick the Sensational Elephant Man),  J Francis Totti (Prey For Us, Big F#@k Off Worms) and Marvel Zombies, Hellblazer & Criminal artist Sean Phillips will be providing the art for this story.\nSean is also very kindly going to donate his original page of artwork to the campaign which you can buy now as the 'QUARANTINE WITH SEAN PHILLIPS' reward tier.\nAs part of the campaign we're also offering you lucky people the chance to own some of the original inked pages of art work from the comic as well as some very cool pencil art and rough sketches from the planning stage. Each artist has only done one page so this is an especially unique chance to own something special.\nFor the most part, we're not sharing the whole of anyone's page so if you are interested in a specific artist's original page but want to see it before purchasing, just message me directly and I can share it with you. Below you can see a few examples to understand what you will receive.\nDarick Robertson's original cover artwork available to own!\nHere's a section of what to expect from Gustaffo's original page\nHere's a section of Russell Mark Olson's original page available to purchase\nHere's what you can expect in your Packwood Pack\nHere's what to expect from Clara Meath's beautiful original pencils and rough page layout\nWe're also very excited to have Gary Erskine selling his original page and process and character sketch pages as part of the campaign.

As all the merch will feature art from the comic in some form or other we can't give you the finished versions currently (some is still being finished, some is just too darn spoilery) but we can promise they will look awesome and if you like the art you've already seen posted on this page then you will be thrilled with what you receive.\nThese will be covered in amazing art from the comic\nTHE ARTISTS\nThis amazing group of talent is why you're all here: \nAhmed Raafat is an Egyptian artist based in the UK known for el3osba and Gorilla My Dreams.

BLACKING OUT also showcases the amazing talents of colorist Giulia Brusco (Scalped, Django Unchained), letterer Ed Dukeshire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers), and designer Tom Muller (X-Men) .\n Kickstarter rewards include a print Lobby Card set from acclaimed artists Francesco Francavilla, Eduardo Risso, Jamal Igle, Emma R\u00edos, Mirka Andolfo, Jacob Phillips, Dan Panosian, Ryan Kelly, Patric Reynolds, Elise McCall, and Peter Krause. \nBottom line for backers: \nThe graphic novel is complete and the Kickstarter is looking to raise the last bit of funds needed for printing to get this book in your hands.

Connie follows a lone clue\u2014a discarded crucifix\u2014to unravel the death of Karen Littleton, whose body was found amid a blaze that scorched 10,000 acres. The search leads Connie to clash with the victim's father and prime suspect, Robert Littleton, as well as hostile former colleagues on the local police force. All the while, Conrad combats his consuming alcoholism and fading faculties.\nWe're confident that you'll love this book as much as we do. But why take our word for it? \n \u201cBlacking Out is as dark as the smoky California skies that fill its pages. And like smoke, this noir clings to you. Redemptive, surprising, & bleak.\u201d - Brian Azzarello, 100 Bullets, Moonshine \n \u201cA tasty comics noir for your lockdown reading. A fast-paced page turner that really delivers.\u201d - Derf Backderf, My Friend Dahmer, Kent State \n \u201cA compelling story that moves like a rocket and artwork that\u2019s stunning. When is award season, again?\u201d - Mark Waid, Kingdom Come, Irredeemable \n \u201cStart with the inky atmospheric drawings. Take the narrative familiars: bad cop seeking redemption, small town with big secrets, people wanting what they can\u2019t have. Toss them in the spin cycle.\u201d - Betsy Willeford\nWhy the oversized hardcover format?\n(Case cover proof direct from the printer. Check out the spot gloss! SoCal foliage in the background not included.)\n\nHaving the privilege to attend the Angoul\u00eame International Comics Festival in France this past decade, writer and co-creator Chip Mosher has not only fallen in love with the oversized European hardcover format (~12.5\" x 9.5\"), but also the creative aesthetic of what the French call bande dessin\u00e9e or BD. Whereas American comics release on a monthly basis and demand tight deadlines, the standard 48 page BD album is drawn over 6 months or longer, allowing the creators to spread their wings and put their best work forward. \n \u201cBlacking Out is a hard drinking, hard boiled mystery with a finale that lands like a ton of bricks\u2014do not miss it.\u201d  - Gerry Duggan, Dead Eyes, Deadpool, Marauders \nWith this approach in mind, co-creator and artist Peter Krause worked on BLACKING OUT over several years, toiling over each page to create a tight 56-page graphic novel. (Note: Chip needed some extra pages, so not keeping it to the standard French 48-page standard is his fault! - Pete.) Working \"Marvel-style\" (the writer providing the artist a script with no panel breakdowns), Peter was able to exercise complete artistic control over the pacing of the story, a rarity in American comics. Chip then followed with a final lettering draft after Peter finished drawing all of the pages. This creative process ensured a deep collaboration between writer and artist... true co-creators in every sense.\n \"Blacking Out is a taut, nasty thriller about people you don't want to know, but will love watching. The slow burn (pun intended) leads to a gut punch that will leave you reeling. Well-done.\u201d -Marc Andreyko, Supergirl, Manhunter, Torso \nEd Dukeshire then lettered the project with Scalped alumnus Giulia Brusco providing colors. Finally, Tom Muller designed the logo and the cover, working directly with Peter. In the spirit of the project, each contributor was guaranteed as much time needed to provide their best work.\nIn total, the team spent more than three full years creating this graphic novel. No expense was spared, no shortcuts were taken. This graphic novel was crafted without compromise; an unrushed, immaculately sculpted book with few peers. \n( Letterer Ed Dukeshire crafted hand-drawn, custom balloons and manipulated fonts for word mood and emphasis.)\n \u201cHardcore characters in search for what they can\u2019t name on a road they shouldn\u2019t travel. A gut punch of crime fiction by Mosher and Krause.\u201d -Gary Phillips, The Be-Bop Barbarians \n(Giulia Brusco's amazing color work on one of Chip and Peter's favorite pages.)\n \"A rural crime tale with more twists and turns than a backcountry road.\u201d - Ed Brisson, Sheltered, Old Man Logan \n(Tom Muller's distressed logo for the graphic novel.)\n \u201cThe writing is sharp like a razor, the sort of sharp that you don\u2019t feel when it cuts you. It\u2019s only when you see the blood begin to pool that you realize that you\u2019re reading a really good book.\u201d - Shannon Wheeler, Too Much Coffee Man, The New Yorker \nDigital Rewards\nWith the book completed, a PDF of BLACKING OUT will be immediately available to those who backed tiers including a digital copy of the book; all backers who receive any digital reward will immediately be able to read BLACKING OUT as soon as the Kickstarter is funded and complete.\n(Cover for PDF version of BLACKING OUT ready to send to backers once the Kickstarter ends.)\nThere are two additional digital items available: the Blacking Out Photo Reference PDF and a PDF of Chip's previous graphic novel, Left On Mission, co-created and drawn by Francesco Francavilla.\nWhile writing BLACKING OUT, Chip Mosher took numerous pictures to serve as inspiration for the book. Traveling around Southern California, Chip took pictures of active forest fires in and outside Los Angeles and he then created collages of places that he imagined would serve as the setting for BLACKING OUT. This PDF served as inspiration for the art and coloring of the final work.\n(Photo collage by Chip Mosher for inspiration in the making of BLACKING OUT.)\nAs a special bonus, Chip Mosher\u2019s previous graphic novel with co-creator Francesco Francavilla, Left On Mission \u2014which debuted in 2008, and is currently OOP \u2014 is included digitally within certain most tiers. Left On Mission recently reverted to co-creators Chip and Francesco, who are excited to get this critically acclaimed, but little seen, work in the hands of more people. \n(Title page for LEFT ON MISSION co-created by Chip Mosher & Francesco Francavilla. Colors by Martin Thomas. Letters by Marshall Dillon.)\nChip and Peter wish to thank Francesco for letting them include Left On Mission as part of this Kickstarter.\nThe Lobby Cards\nThe BLACKING OUT Kickstarter allows Chip and Peter to celebrate the traditions of film noir by offering 12 cinematic lobby cards from today's most acclaimed artists, with a special card drawn by Peter himself. Lobby cards are miniature movie posters used to promote films in the lobbies of theaters in Hollywood's golden era. Noir films historically offered some of the most vivid imagery of the medium, inspiring this reward tier. Chip and Peter reached out to some of today's greatest comic artists to provide their interpretations of scenes within BLACKING OUT. These artists include:\n Francesco Francavilla (Afterlife with Archie), Eduardo Risso (Moonshine), Mirka Andolfo (Mercy), Dan Panosian (Slots), Emma R\u00edos (Pretty Deadly), Jacob Phillips (That Texas Blood), Patric Reynolds (The Mask), Ryan Kelly (Saucer Country), Jamal Igle (The Wrong Earth), Elise McCall (Spy Island) and Peter Krause. \n Our lobby cards will be a smidge smaller than the book (~12.5\" x 9.5\").\nUPDATE: Since hitting $29K we've added an additional card by Peter Krause, inspired by Robert Fawcett. See below.\n(Lobby Card by Francesco Francavilla)\n(Lobby Card by Eduardo Risso)\n(Lobby Card by Jamal Igle.

At the same time, Source Point Press was starting to grow and make a little bit of noise in the independent publishing and convention circuit.  Bob first approached me over Facebook messenger.  I assumed he wanted me to take on SALVAGERS for distribution.\nNope.\nBob had a completely new idea.  He pitched me a story about monsters and corruption and the desire for anonymity in a cool science fiction/mystery shell.  I was intrigued.  It had great art from Francesco Tomaselli.  We decided to move forward with the book as a webcomic, publishing one page per week.  It was a cool book with an interesting premise and great art.  It slowly started to pick up a following and we launched a small Kickstarter to print the first issue in a very limited edition when it wrapped.  Everyone was really happy!\nIn the meantime, Source Point had signed a deal with Bob on SALVAGERS and had him hard at work finishing the second volume for a wide release and the next planned issue of Shelter Division fell to the wayside.  One thing led to another.  One pitch led to another.  From OGRE to OGRES to STARLIGHT TAVERN, Bob kept bringing new and exciting projects to the table.  SHELTER DIVISION kept hitting the back burner.  \nEnter Ken Perry, a Massachusett's fireman who had done the art for a book called WRETCHED THINGS (written by Devon Wong) that we loved.  He was looking for something new.  Ken read the first issue and was immediately on board.  Now that we had a dedicated artist cranking out pages,  SHELTER DIVISION was back and all of us at SOURCE POINT PRESS are thrilled to be able to offer KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE printings of the first 3 issues individually and in a beautiful HARDCOVER collection.  Thanks for checking this campaign out and getting behind SHELTER DIVISION!  \nREWARDS!!!\n **Shipping will be charged during the pledge manager of the campaign!!**\nLIMITED TO 30 - EXCLUSIVE HARDCOVER WITH BOB SALLEY'S BROKEN GARGOYLES #1 FIRST PRINTING!!\nCREATORS!!!\nWith a love of comics and storytelling, Bob embarked on his journey to combine the two with his Science Fiction adventure SALVAGERS. With the scripts written, and waiting for the art to be completed, Salley started getting an itch and began writing SHELTER DIVISION. Mixing his love for mystery, spies and horror into a Men In Black like adventure series.\nKen is a professional firefighter and artist which allows him to use some of the crazy things he sees at the fire dept in his art. He also works in painting and sculpture and has works in public installations and private collections.  He lives in Massachusetts with his wife and Frisbee stunt dog Jack.\n Source Point Press publishes books, comic books, and graphic novels. Working with both industry legends, and new talents on the rise, we strive to bring you the best storytelling in horror, sci-fi, pulp, true crime, the occult, and supernatural.\n\n\nSYNOPSIS\nIssue 1 - Agents of a secret government organization stumble upon a heist of scientific technology with the possibility of opening portals between other dimensions. An organization that uses the abnormal to hunt the abnormal. As we see the son of Bigfoot, the Roswell alien and Emrik Chaplin, a man who has been alive since the 17th century have no place among us, they have dubbed this government project SHELTER DIVISION.\nIssue 2 - As Emrick and Biggs make their way back to headquarters, time is running out for the evil genius Ramos and his plot to build a bridge between his world and ours. No one is safe from his rage and there is nowhere to hide.\nIssue 3 - With Emrick captured and separated from his bionic limbs, Ramos now has the power to bring his army into our primitive world. Time is running out and no one will be able to take shelter from the storm Ramos\u2019 army will bring!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSource Point Press has successful fulfilled many past campaigns and regularly publishes monthly comics and graphic novels.

Each member of this elite unit must wrestle with their role in the power structures of earth as they are pushed to their mental and physical limits.\nPREVIEW:\nHere's a preview of ERIS to give you a taste of the insane world we've built:\nWe designed ERIS to capture the energy of 90\u2019s comics, the thought-provoking formalism of alternative comics, and the excess of 80\u2019s sci-fi action films. \nERIS is 100% complete and ready to print!

Logan is an actor and writer, bringing his penchant for awesome movie lines to the ERIS script.  Tyrell is a comic artist and illustrator who has been making comics for over 15 years.  He is known for creating the ground-breaking sci-fi anthology Speculative Relationships, cover art for comics like Murder Falcon, as well as his own comics Victus and Gary.   Most recently, his DOOM-inspired inktober comic IDKFA lit up the internet with it\u2019s brutal demon-killing action.\nThere is a lot of uncertainty in the world right now, especially in the comics industry.

Having myself experienced what can happen when a screenplay becomes a graphic novel, to say I'm excited by this Kickstarter is very much an understatement!\u201d \u2014 William Gibson\nMADI is a 260-page road trip graphic novel set in the near future, by film director Duncan Jones (MOON, SOURCE CODE) and writer Alex de Campi (BAD KARMA, BLADE RUNNER), and drawn by some of comics\u2019 most exciting artists including Glenn Fabry, Simon Bisley, Duncan Fegredo and Pia Guerra. Each artist tackles a 8-30 page section of the story, bringing to life one location.\nSee for yourself: Download the first 19 pages of MADI here! Includes both the Fegredo/Phillips and Shimizu covers.\n This project is EU/UK shipping friendly! We are drop-shipping to a UK distributor so shipping is affordable to our huge and beloved European fanbase. Estimated maximum shipping costs for a single book are: US: $10 / Canada & Mexico: $15 / UK: $20 / Mainland Europe: $25 / Rest of World: $55. Shipping costs will be collected at checkout (after the campaign ends) via Backerkit, where you\u2019ll also have the chance to add on additional books or upgrade to a higher-tier book. \nMadi Preston, a veteran of Britain\u2019s elite special operations J-Squad unit, is burnt out and up to her eyeballs in debt. She and the rest of her team have retired from the military but are now trapped having to pay to service and maintain the technology put into them during their years of service.   They're working for British conglomerate Liberty Inc as  mercenaries, selling their unique ability to be remote controlled by specialists while in the field, and the debts are only growing as they get injured completing missions. We meet Madi as she decides she\u2019s had enough.  She will take an off-the-books job that should earn her enough to pay out her and her sister, but when the piece of tech she\u2019s supposed to steal turns out to be a kid, and she suddenly blacks out... she finds herself on the run from everyone she\u2019s ever known. \nIn a globe-spanning adventure from Shanghai to Soho, Madi has to stay one step ahead of the giant corporations closing in on her from all sides. \nMADI is the third and final story in the \u201cMooniverse,\u201d an anthology of independent stories that take place in a shared future. You don\u2019t need to have seen MOON or MUTE to fully enjoy this standalone book.\nThe full roster of line artists are: Dylan Teague, Glenn Fabry, Duncan Fegredo, LRNZ, Ed Oca\u00f1a, Andr\u00e9 Ara\u00fajo, Simon Bisley, Rosemary Valero-O\u2019Connell, Tonci Zonjic, Pia Guerra, James Stokoe, RM Gu\u00e9ra, Chris Weston,  Rufus Dayglo, Annie Wu, David Lopez and Christian Ward. Our amazing colour team includes: Matt Wilson, Nayoung Kim, Chris O\u2019Halloran, Adam Brown, Jacob Phillips, Ra\u00fal Arnaiz, Giulia Brusco, Sergey Nazarov and Kelly Fitzpatrick. Lettering is by Alex. \nEvery artist has been paid their full asking rate and is also getting royalties on the project. As freelancers ourselves, we believe in being the change we want to see in the industry.  \nThe book is almost finished being drawn and is currently being lettered. It will be sent to backers in early November, and comes in your choice of a luxe 7\u00bc X 10 \u00bd\u201d paperback, a 8.3\u201d x 12\u201d hardback (the original art size), or an oversize 10 x 14\u00bd\u201d cased hardback with over 40 pages of back matter. The paperback cover is by Duncan Fegredo & Jacob Phillips, and the hardback cover is by Yuko Shimizu. \nDuncan Fegredo and Jacob Phillips' beautiful wrap cover for the paperback edition\nBecause both Duncan and Alex have big fanbases in Europe we are doing our damnedest to make sure shipping is as inexpensive as possible while maintaining safe and careful mailing of these extremely nice, high quality editions. We're working with drop-shipping to UK distributors so European buyers won't have to pay airmail from the US.  Backerkit is handling all our pledge management and will be charging shipping at the end, once the campaign is over (you'll also be able to add on books or upgrade your pledge at that time, if you want). Z2 has its own warehouse, so US fulfillment can be handled easily and professionally in-house. \nNo digital version of MADI will be made available at this time, or indeed maybe ever.\nStores, you will be able to order MADI for retail sale at your fine shops a few weeks after Kickstarter fulfillment.  \nYuko Shimizu's luscious cover for the hardback edition\nA model of Yuko's cover on the hardback, without logos (why interrupt the pretty until you have to)\nThe deluxe slipcase edition is truly a magnificent book, with the art reproduced at luscious 10\u201d x 14.5\u201d size (a 20% blowup on the book\u2019s original art size of 8.3\u201d x 12\u201d) and with over 60 pages of extras, process, and essays from Duncan and Alex, along with surprise bonus art from friends like Colleen Doran and Jeffrey Veregge! See a scene go from original screenplay through Alex\u2019s handwritten breakdowns to comic script, pencils, inks, then colours! Pore over the thumbnails and rough layouts of masters like Duncan Fegredo and RM Gu\u00e9ra! Enjoy all the character sketches and development work that went on behind the scenes (there was a lot, this project was super complex to produce) such as Annie Wu\u2019s amazing Kitty Cop concept art, below! (The whole Kitty Cop origin story is pretty great, too, it basically involves Alex + too much sugar.) \nThe Madi deluxe edition with diecut slipcase\nThe slipcase edition features Yuko\u2019s gorgeous wrap cover without logos, inside a diecut slipcase that allows Yuko\u2019s illustration of Madi to show through. This slipcase edition will not be available for retail sale; if you miss it here, maybe we might have a few at the Z2 Comics table at a convention, but maybe not. \nAnnie Wu\u2019s concept art for our Kitty Cops, or: \u201ckawaii, but make it fascism\u201d\nDuncan Fegredo's lovely wrap cover for the softcover edition, before its colours by Jacob Phillips!\nA Simon BIsley warmup sketch, as you do; another of the sort of extras that only come in the deluxe slipcase edition\nAlso, neither Duncan nor Alex have ANY chill so we'll probably post lots of lettered pages in the updates.... but only for backers.  \nDuncan's last \"Free the 156\" stickers from MUTE, for the first 50 hardcover backers\n Who we are:\nMan; made Moon & more\nDuncan Jones is a British advertising and film director, best known for his BAFTA winning film MOON, epic game-based fantasy movie WARCRAFT and his other science fiction films SOURCE CODE & MUTE.  He is presently staying safely locked up at his home, waiting for it to be safe to go out and make ROGUE TROOPER of 2000AD fame with Rebellion Studios.  Duncan is answerable to his wife, Rodene, his two kids, Stenton 4 and Zowie 2, and his dog, who takes her privacy very seriously after a scamming incident, and wishes to remain anonymous. \nWoman; made books\nAlex de Campi is a novellist and comics writer, best known for her noir graphic novel BAD GIRLS and her love anthology TWISTED ROMANCE, both of which were nominated for three Eisner awards last year. She has also written some episodes of Shinichiro Watanabe\u2019s BLADE RUNNER anime (on Toonami next year) and worked with Masamune Shirow on a GHOST IN THE SHELL comic for Kodansha. Her debut novel, medieval suspense thriller THE SCOTTISH BOY, comes out at the end of the month and you can preorder it here in the UK or here in the US. You can read her action-thriller comic BAD KARMA anywhere in the world right now, as it is pay-what-you-wish on lovely webcomic site Panel Syndicate. Alex is answerable to her daughter Lorelei and her deafblind pit bull Tango, and they\u2019re all answerable to the darn cat. Her little family is currently enjoying being the only people left in Manhattan. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are very few risks, the book is already paid for and most art is finished.

This is the definitive edition of CURSE WORDS, and my oh my it is pretty. Look for yourself!\nWHAT IS CURSE WORDS? It\u2019s a beautiful, hilarious, action-packed, magical comic, a 768-page epic which tells the story of an evil wizard named\u2026 WIZORD, sent to Earth from a hellish dimension called THE HOLE WORLD to destroy our existence. Wizord, being fickle, decides he likes Earth better than where he came from, and disobeys his boss, the demon SIZZAJEE. Instead of ending our world, Wizord reveals himself to humanity, telling everyone he\u2019s a good wizard. (He\u2019s lying. In a big way. And things go straight to hell.)\nCURSE WORDS was originally published across twenty-eight single issues by Image Comics from 2017 through late 2019, telling the full story of Wizord, his talking koala assistant Margaret and their pals. Created by superstar creators Charles Soule (Darth Vader, Death of Wolverine, Undiscovered Country) and Ryan Browne (God Hates Astronauts, Quantum & Woody), the series debuted to enormous fanfare and fabulous reviews. Over its run, it garnered a devoted fanbase, a cross-country Wizard Van tour to promote the book and a television development deal. IT IS TERRIFIC STUFF. But don't take our word for it - listen to NY Times bestselling author Joe Hill:\n\"Terrific, terrific stuff.\" \u2013Joe Hill, NY Times Bestselling Author\n\"Overall fantastic and tons of fun\u2026 Harry Potter can suck it, Wizord is the wizard we need.\" \u2013nerdist.com \nMassive two-page spreads from Curse Words!\nAll 28 issues of the hit Image Comics series are in The Hole Damned Thing Hardcover!\nOne other great bit - we are fulfilling all orders through our friends at Challengers Comics + Conversation in Chicago.

In the world of Electropunk, this fire never happened. So, by the beginning of our story in 1910, Nikola Tesla is one of the wealthiest and most influential men in the world. As a byproduct of his wealth and scientific progress, he makes a shocking discovery: there are, in fact, things that go bump in the night. He discovers that there is some truth to most of the world\u2019s myths and legends, and there are all manner of creatures preying on an unsuspecting humanity.\nSo, Tesla takes matters into his own hands.\nHe starts by raising his orphaned niece and nephew, twins Ruthie and Chuck, to be mankind\u2019s sword and shield. Tesla designs suits of enhanced armor to protect both their bodies and their identities. In short, they have to become monsters to combat monsters.\nPLAY\n\nOur goal of this project is to produce a full-color 8.5 x 11 graphic novel with more than 100 pages of beautifully detailed illustrations.

Wrestler and mercenary-for-hire WARHORSE encounters a local wrestling champion with terrifying hypnotic power, and must enlist unpredictable demon Danhausen and his former partner Allie Kat in order to save reality.\nWARHAUSEN core cover by Lauren Moran\nBreakdown of Base Goal:\n50%  Remainder of Art Costs \n50% - Reward creation and campaign fulfillment\nAny overrun from the base goal will go toward expedited fulfillment of rewards and recouping the total production cost.\nThe demon within Danhausen emerges at the Devil's behest.\n The Story:\nMetalhead warrior WARHORSE only has two goals in his life - to bang heads and rule ass! Following a successful mission saving the world from a nuclear threat, Warhorse receives a mysterious message requesting he be present for \"bookings and signings\" at a pro wrestling event at an iconic Southern California arena.\nHis opponent is no ordinary tomato can, but instead the mighty Mr. Impressive, the only pro wrestler approved by the Comics Code Authority. The devil himself, recognizing that WARHORSE is outmatched by this cosmically powered grappler, dispatches his unwilling apprentice Danhausen to even the odds. However, Danhausen discovers that WARHORSE must resolve his issues with former tag partner Allie Kat, or this plane of existence may be lost forever.  \nWhy was WARHAUSEN Created?\nI (Jason) am a lifelong wrestling fan, first falling in love with it during the classic WrestleMania VIII event and becoming a fan for life during the Bret Hart vs. Owen Hart feud in the mid-1990s. I have written for multiple wrestling websites, including  socaluncensored.com and the now-defunct thesmartmarks.com as a reviewer and interviewer, but have always been looking for a more creative way to give back to the community that has provided me with so many memories and friendships.\nI was inspired to do a character profile comic by recent works like Chido Comics' Joey Ryan: Big in Japan and Luchaverse series, but had not found the right muse until I came across the trio of WARHORSE, Danhausen, and Allie Kat. These three are tireless creatives, and are at the forefront of bringing larger-than-life, colorful characters back to independent professional wrestling. Plus, they are genuinely good people and I wanted to reward the bright lights in the industry. My longtime friend Mr. Impressive, a Southern California-based wrestling champion, was a natural Silver Age foil to \"wrestling's wildest renegades.\"\nA new meaning to the term \"splash page.\"\nI am thrilled that Megan Huang was so enthusiastic when I pitched this idea to her, and equally delighted that Lauren Moran, who has created so many incredible pro wrestling illustrations, joined this project as the cover artist. Rob Jones, one of the top letterers in UK comics, has also joined the comic and is currently doing a fantastic job making the dialogue pop! We hope you enjoy what we're putting together, and that you feel it does justice to WARHAUSEN!   \nWarhose enters the Gateway to Oblivion\nWho Will Love WARHAUSEN?\nPro wrestling fans who love the independent scene\nAnyone who has enjoyed genre parody films like The Naked Gun, Hot Shots!, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, and Spaceballs.\nComics readers who enjoy off-the-wall humor series like Gwenpool and the classic Justice League International  \nThe grandest stage of them all!\nCreative Team  \n Jason Doring, Co-Creator/Writer: Jason is a member of the North Shore chapter of the Boston Comics Roundtable, and holds a Bachelor's degree in Film and Television from Boston University as well as a MA in Integrated Marketing Communication from Emerson College.

His anthology contributions include Little Heroes Comics Charity Anthology Vol. 3 ,and the upcoming STARBOUND and Boston Powers series from the Boston Comics Roundtable. \nMegan Huang, Co-Creator/Interior Art: Megan is an accomplished Toronto-based sequential artist whose credits include the upcoming Jia and the Nian Monster from Dark Horse Comics, Double Jumpers and Princeless from Action Lab Entertainment,  a backup story in the Image Comics series Tartarus, titled Life, and a backup story in IDW's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles spin-off series Jennika.

There is a joyous lightness to the art that never softens the impact of anger or violence, it places it firmly in its context. - Conor Carton, Dancing with Skeletons\nRewards\nThis project plans to offer unique rewards for fans of WARHORSE, Danhausen, and Allie Kat.

We had a call set to do the same thing, just essentially work out the rough shape of how we'd do the ending... but basically, we were so HYPED about what we're doing in the end that we essentially verbally wrote it on the phone together.

Meanwhile, friction between Dr Frederick Treves and his friends comes to a head over his disastrous dabblings in the dark arts, and old enemies make an unwelcome return.\nAs always, thanks to our returning backers for your continuing support, we couldn't do this without you. And if you're new to our comic, a warm welcome to the sensational adventures of The Elephantman, the most remarkable human being ever to draw the breath of life! \nPuppets is a perfect jumping on point for new readers, but you can also check out the series from the beginning by downloading issue #1 for FREE.\nISSUE #9 PREVIEW\nCheck out the cover for issue 9, and the opening pages, all drawn by Luke. If you love them as much as we do, the artwork is available as pledge rewards.\nISSUE #10 COVER\nISSUE #11 COVER\n\nTHE WORLD OF MERRICK\nMerrick: The Sensational Elephantman is a Victorian penny dreadful pulp adventure comic set in 1880s' London. Based on a fictional version of the life of Joseph Merrick, it steps between historical facts and turn of the century folklore juxtaposed with the superhero comic conventions of super powers, masks, secret identities and fantastic adventures.\n\n\n\nQUALITY COMICS\nIf you've encountered any of our physical issues of Merrick I'm sure you have noticed the print quality and the nice distinctive feel they have, it's something we feel really passionate about.\nWe're striving to make every issue of Merrick something special, an item that you will want to keep. These are not disposable comics.\nBoth issues are beautifully presented, full colour, standard US size comics printed on heavy stock 120GSM uncoated bond paper. Issue #9 is 24 pages, #10 is 20 pages, #11 is 28 pages, all plus covers.\nAs with all single issues of Merrick, issue's #9 - #11 will be limited numbered runs of 500 never to be reprinted with the same cover.\nA maximum of 2 print runs for each issue.\nAll single issues are shipped bagged and boarded to ensure they reach you looking as great as they went out.\nWe'll also send you digital versions of each issue in .pdf and .cbr formats so you can enjoy issues of Merrick on the move on your tablet, smartphone or PC.\nAlthough issue #1 of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman is completely sold out, there is still a chance to build an impressive collection of single issues by picking up copies of #2 - #8 with less than 60 copies of Merrick #2 left!\nDon't worry about missing any of the story, you can download issue #01 in .PDF/.CBR absolutely free. \nGetting up to 11 issues is a huge achievement for any comic series. We're super excited to be making more books. Everything we've published to date is available on this Kickstarter.\n\nTHE TEAM\nTom Ward: Writer and creator of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman. Tom is also co-creator and writer of Doc Dino and has been published in Comichaus, The Grime, British Showcase Anthology and has a story in Rum Row later this year. @highbrowtrash  \nLuke Parker: Artist, colourist, designer and co-creator of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman. You may have also seen his work on SEX, or The Winternational (Image Comics), or Halloween Eagle (Dark Horse Comics). @artofparker www.artofparker.com \nMicah Myers: As a freelance comic book letterer, Micah has lettered a host of comics for Image, Dark Horse, IDW, and many more. @micahmyers\nClare Lenton: Freelance editor and senior content designer, with a Masters degree in English Literature, specialising in Gothic literature. @ClareLenton\nTHANK YOU\nThanks to the amazing Kickstarter community, we have been able to create and release the first 8 issues of Merrick, a one-shot spin-off; Treves: A Restless Night and a special cross-over issue; Merrick & Crowe: Birds of Prey. \nWe love making this comic, and we think it keeps getting better as a series as we learn and improve as creators, and we have you guys to thank for that for giving us these opportunities.\nNow it's time to continue Joseph Merrick's story so we've returned to Kickstarter to hopefully fund the fourth arc.\nAll our books, plus prints and t-shirts, are available at our webstore www.merrickcomic.co.uk or digitally over at Comixology. \nWHAT THE REVIEWS SAY\n\"In each issue, you can feel the love, sweat, and tears the team put into their work. Although the art and some story beats take inspiration from Mike Mignola and some Hellboy, it stands apart creating its own history in indie comics, and it'll carve out its own slice in your heart and brain, making you crave more of the world.\" - www.comicbookyeti.com\n\"the art and story in Merrick grows with confidence in every issue and with each arc Ward and Parker find their voice more and more \u2013 as well as feeling free to experiment with where the story is heading. The artwork also becomes more imaginative and iconic (and less derivative), with Parker creating this dark and angular style which manages to perfectly evoke Victorian London, but also has a modern edge to it at the same time. A book that really definitely deserves the use of the word sensational!\" -www.pipedreamcomics.co.uk\n\"Merrick started off as a character surrounded by myths who I felt I had half an idea of where this adventure could go \u2013 but the creative team have surprised me time & again and that\u2019s made me come back to the title to re-read, rediscovery and enjoy.  A great character that has been filled up with endless potential thanks to Tom & Luke and eight issues in there\u2019s still so much more for it to give.  Can\u2019t wait for issue nine and beyond.\" - ComicsAnonymous", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not my first, second, or indeed third rodeo, this is my EIGHTH Kickstarter.\n\nI have delivered on all my previous projects, and things are a fairly well oiled machine at this point.

If you backed our previous campaign, thank you very much! We\u2019re incredibly thankful to our Kickstarter community and we're going to do our best to pack each campaign with as many cool exclusives as we can for you. If you\u2019re new to the book, thanks for checking us out!  \nThis campaign is to raise funds to print issue #2 and hopefully hit a couple of Stretch Goals. (We have some exciting ones lined up that we\u2019re dying to tell you about.) If you were with us for issue 1, the story continues here. If you're new to THE CATCH, both issues are avilable in this campaign, and here's a quick overview ...\nWhen super-villains like Galactoid, Dron the Conqueror, or Professor Kill are defeated, they're sent to a government maximum security facility. But what about small-timers like Phileas Frost, The Grappler, or the random jump-suited agents of H.A.R.M.? What happens to the bank robbers, jewel thieves, and anonymous henchmen? \nThey post bail. \nAnd sometimes, they skip town afterward. That's where Lucy Chase comes in. \n Lucy comes from a family of law enforcement folks, but spends her days working for bail bondsman Leon Tilman, chasing down costumed criminals who jump bail. Keeping super-powered lowlifes in line is a dangerous job; especially when you don't have super-powers yourself. Bounty hunters who specialize in supers are few and far between, keeping Lucy in high demand. \nDeputy U.S. Marshal Jack Devlin is Lucy\u2019s on-again, off-again love interest. Jack\u2019s assigned to the Federal Powered and Supernatural Crimes Joint Task Force, but he sometimes provides unofficial backup when Lucy has a bounty. \nSo far, Lucy and Jack have crossed paths with some interesting criminals who are very interested in their activities.\nIssue #2 finds new adversaries crossing Lucy and Jack's path.\nAnd now everyone\u2014criminals, the authorities, and Lucy & Jack\u2014are all on a collision course. \n Money raised will go toward artist and colorist fees, printing, backer rewards, and shipping. If we're lucky enough to exceed our goal, all additional funding will be put directly back into the book in the form of additional rewards and production of the next issue.\nIn English... \n And in Espa\u00f1ol (digital)\u2026\n Main cover by Ismael Canales and Mireia Girbau.\n Variant Cover by Steve Bryant and Jason Millet.\n \"Movie Poster\" Variant Cover by Ismael Canales and Jason Millet.\nWe have a wide variety of rewards lined up, from digital comics, to physical comics and variant covers, to\"Catch-Up\" combos that  bring new readers up to speed, to Collector Boxes, to original art, and more!\n If you support a Kickstarter campaign, the last thing you want is for your books to arrive damaged! With that in mind, all of our physical packages are being shipped in Gemini Comic Mailers. These things are practically nuke-proof, insuring that your comics arrive in great condition!\n The only physical reward levels that won't come in these mailers are the Collector Boxes which are wrapped in bubble-wrap and shipped in Priority Mail medium boxes, and the original art & \"Draw Me In\" rewards, which are shipped flat between multiple sheets of corrugated cardboard, insuring no bending.\n \u2022 Fans of super-hero crime comics, like Gotham Central, Jessica Jones/Alias, or Powers.\n\u2022 People who like heist or caper movies, or TV shows like Justified or Better Call Saul.\n\u2022 Indie comic collectors looking to get in on the ground floor of a new book, filled with action, clever dialogue, and great visuals. \n The Catch #2 is a 32-page standard-sized American comic, printed on high-quality paper.\nThe extra-sized first and second issues include 24 sequential pages of action, along with some great concept art. \nAll backers will also receive TWO digital versions of issue 2: digital versions in English and Espa\u00f1ol, as well as being listed in the digital edition of issue 2.\n Stretch Goals! If we exceed our funding target, these stretch goals are milestones where you, the backers, get even more stuff!\nStretch Goal #1 ($9,000) Stick Around!: A sticker logo with the awesome logo for The Catch will be included in all physical/print reward levels!\nStretch Goal #2 ($11,000) Keep In Touch! An oversized postcard featuring the \"movie poster\" variant cover art from The Catch issue 1!\nStretch Goal #3 ($13,000) An Irresistible Attraction!\nStretch Goal #4 ($15,000) Mystery Stretch Goal!\nBacker Goals! As more people back The Catch #2, we'd like to reward you with  additional incentives to reach our funding goal.

He has also completed projects for Dark  Horse Comics, IDW, Boom! Studios, Ape Entertainment, and others, as well  as extensive work in the roleplaying game industry.\nISMAEL CANALES (artist)  Ismael Canales was born in 1980 in La Roda,  a small town from Spain; he was graduated in Fine Arts in the  Politechnique University of Valencia, majored in Drawing and Animation.  He has completed work for Spanish horror anthologies and magazines, as  well as comics for U.S. publishers ECV Press and Action Lab  Entertainment. He lives with his girlfriend in his hometown and still  wears geek t-shirts.\nMIREIA GIRBAU (colorist)  Mireia Girbau was born in 1996 in Sabadell, a city near Barcelona (Spain). She was graduated in Illustration in Escola Illa and Graphic Arts in Escola Joso. Since 2018, she has designed book covers, board games, and worked in comic book projects for Planeta Comic, Paper de Ceba and El Huevo Eterno. She's currently illustrating a deck-building card game, Last Forest, and loves playing roleplaying games all the time.\nCHRIS MURRIN (editor)  Chris  Murrin has been writing and editing comics and prose for over  fifteen  years. In addition to working with Steve Bryant on both Athena Voltaire and Ghoul Scouts  for Action Lab, Chris edits numerous titles for both Arch Blue and  LawDog Comics. When he\u2019s not pestering authors with his notes, Chris  works with the marketing team at FX Networks, editing promos for both  movie presentations and shows such as Archer, It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,  The Simpsons, and You\u2019re the Worst. You\u2019ve probably seen his work go by in a pixelated blur on your DVR.\n \"THE CATCH is the kind of gleeful, clever deconstruction of a genre that can only be pulled off by creators who secretly love it. The freshest take on super-heroes and super-villains in the \"real world\" since POWERS. I'm mad I didn't think of it myself!\" \u2013 Phil Hester, cartoonist\n\u201cTHE CATCH is a superhero crime caper that blends the best of both genres to create something wholly new, engaging and memorable. Bryant, Canales, Surroca, and Murrin expertly weave a story that evokes greats like Elmore Leonard, Greg Rucka and Ed Brubaker without feeling like a carbon copy. As someone who enjoys all things noir and super-powered, THE CATCH is a perfect match.\u201d - Alex Segura, acclaimed author of BLACKOUT\n\u201cTHE CATCH is a great looking book with a fun premise. The team of Bryant, Canales, Surroca, and Murrin have a winner on their hands.\u201d \u2013 Jamal Igle, co-creator of THE WRONG EARTH from Ahoy Comics.\n\u201cA little bit sci-fi, a little bit superhero, and a little bit good-natured procedural on top of it all, THE CATCH is such an obvious idea, I'm mad I didn't come up with it myself! Engaging, fun, and with a ton of potential -- you're gonna like spending time with Lucy Chase.\u201d \u2013 Erik Burnham, IDW\u2019s GHOSTBUSTERS\n\"Lucy Chase is a new era Karen Sisco in this action-packed and thrilling take on bounty hunting super-villains. Full of finesse and suspense, you won't be disappointed reading THE CATCH!\" \u2013 Shawn Pryor, CASH + CARRIE\n\u201cTHE CATCH is a fun, sexy caper in the style of 70s classics like THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR.

For a full list of stretch goals, scroll to the bottom.)\n White Ash is an ongoing comic book series written by Charlie Stickney, with art and letters by Conor Hughes and colors by Fin Cramb. Thanks to our amazing backers and fans, we\u2019ve ridden the success of six amazing Kickstarters to a distribution deal with  Scout Comics and become a mainstay at some of the largest comic book conventions in the country. (Yes, we'll be back exhibiting at San Diego Comic Con again this summer).\nIf you\u2019re returning to White Ash, THANK YOU so much. We owe everything to our Kickstarter community and we're going to continue to make our campaigns packed with exclusive KS goodness just for you (Feel free to scroll down and check out the rewards). If you\u2019re new to our town, WELCOME.  We can\u2019t wait to show you the place.\nThis campaign is to raise funds to print the 40 page comic White Ash: Chapter Five and hopefully hit a couple of Stretch Goals along the way to give you even more bang for your White Ash buck.  \nNOTE: For those of you here off reading the Scout Comics version of White Ash, the KS numbering is different. This comic takes place directly after the first Scout arc concludes with #6 (in June). More on this below. \nWelcome to White Ash, a small smudge of a mining community in Western Pennsylvania, where the secrets are buried even deeper than the coal under the mountain. If you\u2019re a fan of Supernatural, Twin Peaks or Lord of the Rings, you\u2019re going to love getting to know our mysterious town.  \nIn Chapter One, we met Aleck who'd been counting down the hours till he could get the hell out of town and head off to college.\nBut an apparent accident at the mine stalled his exit, setting him down a life-altering path.\nOne that brought him into the orbit of the enigmatic Lillian Alden.\nAnd from there, things got CRAZY.  We can't really tell you too much without getting into heavy SPOILER TERRITORY.\nWhat we can do, is show you this spoiler-free \"get to know our town\" video, made by the White Ash Chamber of Commerce. \nPLAY\n\nAnd if after that, if any of you first-timers still need a little more convincing before you pledge, you can download a 25 page ashcan (a FREE comic book) of Chapter One HERE. so you can check White Ash out.\nNow, if you happen to like spoilers, don't worry, we've got you covered too.\n***HERE COME THE SPOILERS***\nShortly after the accident, Aleck discovered that nothing about White Ash or his life is what it seemed; and that there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s short, stubborn, and can grow a beard in a day \u2014 he comes from a family of...\nYep Dwarves.  And if that wasn\u2019t enough of a kick in the head, Lillian, the young woman he\u2019s just fallen for, isn\u2019t just the daughter of the owner of the White Ash Mining Company, she\u2019s also an elf.\nSo there you have it. White Ash is just a simple tale, old as time, of forbidden elf/ dwarf romance, set against the backdrop of the oncoming war with The Brood... which we kinda neglected to mention earlier.  The Brood is a race of dragon/human hybrids whose origins harken back to how the Elves and the Dwarves got here (White Ash) in the first place.\nSadly, if it were only as easy as overcoming a blood feud that started when the Earth was still young, an army of dragon/human hybrids, and some overly-opinionated relatives, Aleck and Lillian would already be on their way to living happily ever after. But as this is White Ash, bad things have a habit of happening to good people. \nBut we don't want to give away any more. For those of you who are new, we have plenty of ways you can get up to speed on White Ash. (See the catch-up tiers below).  \nAnd for those of you who have patiently waited for us to return, WE'RE BACK!!!  And it's time to kick this story into overdrive.  \nVRRRRRRROOOOOOM!  \nStay tuned after the campaign to find out how you can get the original art for Conor's cover.\nWhy is Katlyn speeding off into the night? Where is she going? You're still going to have to wait a couple of months to find out. But if you're feeling a little impatient, you can WATCH CONOR finish the book in real time on Twitch. FYI, MAJOR SPOILERS lurk.  (We here in White Ash, like to be upfront about everything).\nAnd speaking of being up front, you don't have to wait till Conor's streaming to see some of the book, we're happy to catch you up on the going ons in White Ash right now with a little peek from Chapter Five...\n Oh, and in case any of you had been wondering how's Seth's been doing..?\nTurn's out, he's had better days.  Let's not dwell on that and move on to... \nMoney raised will go toward artist fees, printing, backer rewards and shipping of the fifth issue. And if we're lucky enough to surpass our goal, any additional funding will be put directly back into the book in the form of cover upgrades, additional rewards, and production of future issues (Or paying for those extra shipping costs that always seem to hit). No one is looking to get rich here. (Otherwise we wouldn't be doing comics. Really, we wouldn't) We just want to ensure that we can produce an amazing high-quality comic book series that our backers will enjoy for years to come. \nWe LOVE our partnership with Scout Comics.  Scout is expanding the reach of White Ash, putting us into comic shops across the country.  In fact, we're betting some of you reading this now, only know White Ash from what you've seen in the shops. So let's clarify a few things. \nThe issues that we Kickstart will eventually be distributed by Scout Comics. (About a year later).  But there are a couple of differences.  The biggest is, we often Kickstart oversized issues on KS, (40-52 pages). These issues are then broken down and remastered for Scout.  So White Ash CHAPTER ONE (52 pages) on Kickstarter, eventually became Scout Issues #1 AND #2. To make this work, we added additional pages. So while 90% of the story is the same, these are not straight reprints.  We also have White Ash covers exclusive to Scout.  We're trying to make both experiences something special and unique.  \nSo when you're choosing a tier, if you're looking to catch up, you can do so either by grabbing the single Scout issues in your LCS or on their website Scoutcomics.com. Or if you'd prefer, we have a Hardcover option that collects all the previous kickstarter issues into an oversized volume filled with pin ups and additional content.  \nSpeaking of additional content, that's what our Kickstarters specialize in.  So let's get straight into the rewards, starting with... \nAs we've mentioned, these books are HUGE. Chapter One was a fifty-two page beast. Chapter Two and Three are both thirty-two pages long. And like Chapter Four, Chapter Five is --  FORTY-FREAKING-PAGES.\nAnd that kind of content deserves a premium paper weight.\nWe print White Ash DOMESTICALLY (so you get your books quicker) on a heavy 80 lb glossy paper stock with a cover on 100 lb glossy cover stock. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the White Ash difference.\nThis campaign we are beyond thrilled to announce that Sweeney Boo (Captain Marvel, Sabrina, etc.) took time out of her VERY busy schedule for a trip to White Ash so she could draw up this cover depicting the town's most complicated love triangle. \nWe will print a MAXIMUM (depending on interest) of 300 copies.  And this will be exclusive to Kickstarter.\nAnd we JUST unlocked a new variant\nClaudia Balboni (FairLady Image Comics, Star Trek IDW, etc.) created this jaw-dropingly gorgeous and sensual cover featuring Lillian. \nColored by White Ash's very own Fin Cramb, we will only be printing 150 copies of this variant.  This variant will  automatically included with the following tiers:\nUltra Pin & Deluxe HC Catch Uo\nOriginal Art\nSketch Cover\n Draw Me In. \nIf you haven't pledged at one of those tiers, we've just added two new reward tiers where you can get a copy.  Additionally, there will be a limited number of copies available post-campaign as add-ons in Backer Kit. \nWe know what it's like to open up a package and find a mangled Kickstarter comic inside. We pack our books with care that we used in making the book and the love that we have for our backers. \nEach comic is bagged, boarded front and back and sent in stay-flat packaging. Made in White Ash means everything from the content, to the mailers we use, meets our standards of quality.\nWe love packing our campaigns with extra goodness.  IN ADDITION to White Ash: Chapter Five, our reward tiers are filled with goodies.  He's what you can get this time around.\nWe're back, and to celebrate, all backers receiving physical rewards will get a 6 x11\"print of our kickstarter page image on glossy card-stock.  On top of that, Conor will sign & number the copies for the first 300 print backers.\nIn our Hardcover, we included an all-new story about the early days of White Ash that featured Thane and Glarien. A lot of you who'd just backed the single issues, had asked for a copy. So here you go, a PDF will be included with every pledge tier.\nOne of the most requested rewards, has been for a White Ash Sticker.  And we aim to please. EVERY print backer will also receive a 3\" glossy vinyl, logo sticker.  It's perfect for laptops, folders or covering up those small holes in your wall that somehow appeared after an evening of celebration.  \nWant to smell like White Ash?  We've got you covered.  We know it's a bit of a drive for most of our backers to get to our town, so we made the trip to the Double K for you.  Katlyn and Kyle cut us a deal on some of their signature air fresheners.  And even better, they've promised to discount their gas by 20 cents a gallon to anyone who pulls up to their pumps with one of these beauties hanging from their rear-view mirrors.\nThe White Ash air freshener is included with EVERY physical pledge tier.   \nThe most requested and (until now) unavailable reward, has been for us to mold a custom White Ash pin.  Well, BOHOLD this beauty.  Thanks to Conor's design skills, you can now get pinned to that special someone, White Ash style.\n(To clarify, the good White Ash style based on the warm, but gruff dwarf love, not the bad \"cut off your head and eat it,\" White Ash style).  These pins will be at least 1\" in length and molded with a hard enamel.  \n New to White Ash?  Catch up in style with our 200 page, oversized hardcover.  That's over 2lbs of White Ash goodness delivered straight to your door.  This is a beautiful book you'll be happy to have on your coffee table or on the shelf.\nWant a piece of original art? \nConor Hughes will sketch you a 6x9 drawing of a character from White Ash or The Game. Choose from Aleck, Lillian, Katlyn, Eli, Irs, Kimberly... or another one of your favorites. Conor goes above and beyond on these.  You don't want to miss out on a deal like this. \n We have never offered sketch covers before.  This campaign changes all of that.  Get a sketch cover of Chapter Five (more detailed than what's above)  drawn by Conor Hughes.   Conor will take (reasonable) requests as to the subject mater.  If you're a true White Ash collector, you have to have one of these. \n Under Conor's careful eye, a background character will be designed to look like you.\n(NOTE: These are probably not speaking roles, just cameos. But every now and then, if we find the right person, we'll make you an actual character in the comic. So be forewarned...)\nWe LOVE stretch goals in White Ash.  And if we're lucky enough to reach our initial funding goal, we'll unlock a slew of really cool extra rewards for our backers.\nStretch Goal #1 ($16,500) Thank you to the moon and back.\nAs a sign of our appreciation we\u2019re going send every backer who\u2019s getting a physical reward, a 6x9 print of this thank you illustration drawn by White Ash's own Conor Hughes.\nStretch Goal #2 ($18,000) Traded Again.\nWith Stretch Goal #2 in the dust, every print backer will now receive three a brand new White Ash trading card.  And every backer at one of our Print Catch Up tiers will receive 13 cards -- the original 12 + the new one. \nStretch Goal #3 ($21,000) We've Got You Covered\nUNLOCKED -- The Balboni cover is now available.  NOTE: It also comes as part of the Ultra Pin & Deluxe HC Catch Up tier.  (Even though it's not listed on the reward).\nStretch Goal #4 ($24,000) Glarien Returns\nUNLOCKED -- Every backer will receive an all-new, digital Glarien story drawn by the incredible Romina Moranelli. \nStretch Goal #5 ($26,500) Keeping you Posted.\nIf we hit $26,500, ever print backer will receive an all-new, White Ash post-card showcasing one of the many attractions our town has to offer.\nStretch Goal #6 ($29,000) Mystery Stretch Goal.\nMeet the team.\nCharlie Stickney is a writer/producer from Los Angeles who\u2019s spent the last 20 years creating film, television, animation and music videos.

Two women sort through the rubble of their relationship in the illegal fight league that runs rampant throughout their city. \nIt was desire at first sight, Billie saw Chel across the battlefield pummeling in Keelan's face. Chel's smile made Billie's heart skip a beat. It was right then and there that she knew she had to have her. For a bit things were good, but unfortunately it's hard to navigate a budding relationship and two crews who are constantly butting heads. Something had to give. Now, with their crews about to meet up for another battle, Chel & Billie need to decide once and for all...to make love or war?\nThis Kickstarter is to raise funds to reprint Issue #1 and print Issues #2 & #3 of 20 Fists. You'll be able to back the whole story and get three amazing issues (86 pages!!) of rough and tumble romance! \nCW: 20 Fists #3 contains strong interpersonal violence and is not intended for children.\nStretch Goals!\n(UNLOCKED) Stretch Goal #1 - At $1200 we\u2019ll be adding 8.5\u201dx11\u201d prints of Kira Okamoto\u2019s Round #1 variant cover & Kat Baumann\u2019s Round #3 cover for all physical tiers! Images shown below.\n(UNLOCKED) Stretch Goal #2 - At $1500 we'll be commissioning Kira Okamoto for variant covers for 20 Fists #2 & #3 that will be released as additional 8.5\"x11\" prints!\nStretch Goal #3 - At $2000 we\u2019ll be adding a four page backup all about everyone\u2019s favorite eternal mascot, FERRIS WHEELER!!!\nSTRETCH GOAL #4 - ($3000) ???\nOkay, Tell Me More!\nA note from Frankee White, writer and co-creater of 20 FISTS:\n\"20 Fists is a sparse book to put it mildly. It\u2019s 86 pages with a script under 12k words. Most of my script has 0-2 lines of dialogue per panel. I want the reader to be able to sit down and read the whole thing in one sitting. This is by design. A quick punch to the gut. It was a challenge to myself. How could I hook a reader emotionally while dropping them in the middle of a story & providing zero interior information? No narration, all info comes from what is seen & heard over the course of one night + two flashback interludes.\nThankfully, I have artist Kat Baumann & letterer DC Hopkins, who are exceptional visual storytellers. Kat completely understands the nuance of body language and how to maximize expression out of a gesture. Not only that but she is an amazing creative partner. Make no mistake, Kat HAD to do the heavy lifting on this book for it to work, but her pages constantly had me in me awe. DC\u2019s lettering perfectly meshes w/Kat\u2019s line work, but still stands on its own AS art. SFX are a huge part of the script. They are, in a sense, the sound design. You need to \u201chear\u201d the cracks, the crunches, the heavy breath for the action and emotion to come alive. Without either of these two fantastic creatives, 20 Fists wouldn't exist and I'm extremely grateful to them for their partnership.\nUltimately, 20 Fists is a story of independence & self-understanding wrapped in action, romance, & drama. We\u2019ve made a tough little book that I\u2019m extremely proud of & I hope Chel\u2019s overnight journey resonates with readers. Thanks for all the love & support along the way. xoxo\"\n20 Fists #1 (Cover Art by Kat Baumann)\nATTENTION: All single issues of 20 Fists are strictly LIMITED. These black & white copies WILL NOT BE REPRINTED once they sell out. With that in mind, Kat Baumann's original cover from 20 Fists #1 is limited to only 33 copies left from our previous print run. So you'll want to hop on our early bird special to ensure you get a copy!\nHowever, I'm pleased to announce that we we will be reprinting the first issue with a brand new cover by Kira Okamoto! Kira is an exceptional artist based out of Seattle, WA whose dynamic style is perfectly suited for 20 Fists! You can find more of their work at www.kiraokamoto.com!\n20 Fists #1 Variant (Cover Art by Kira Okamoto)\n\nMeet the Crews\nThe No Names (L-R: Chel, Wayne, Cory, Rei, Brian. Designed by Kat Baumann)\nThe No Names are new to the 20 Fists Fight League and are only beginning to cut their teeth when the worst possible thing happens: their leader Chel falls for Billie, the leader of their rival crew The Big Jackets. This creates tension among the inexperienced group as not everyone is a fan of this newfound relationship.\nChel - The defacto leader of The No Names even though she's not so good at leading. She's not as independent as the vibes she puts out, but she loves to fight and won't hesitate to knock you on your ass if you cross a line. \nWayne - Loves Westerns and not-so-secretly wants to be a cowboy. His real name isn't even Wayne. He also has not-so-secret crushes on two other members of The No Names. \nCory - The group's curmudgeon. Hurt his knee in the last battle against The Big Jackets so he takes pills to manage the pain. He's one bad day away from saying \"I'm too old for this shit.\"\nRei - Attached at the hip to her beau Brian. She's ultra competitive and a bit full of herself. While she's not opposed to Chel's relationship with Billie, she doesn't want to deal with any of the drama.\nBrian - An artist. Not much of a fighter. He loves Rei more than anything so he joined The No Names with her. \nThe Big Jackets (L-R: Billie, Keelan, Yuli, Mack, KT. Designed by Kat Baumann)\nThe Big Jackets are named after the big jackets that they wear (no one said they were clever). They've been around the block a bit and are an experienced crew within the 20 Fists Fight League. Due to how tight knit they are, they don't care much about whether Billie and Chel date as long as Billie can keep her business and personal life separate. \nBillie - The unquestioned leader of The Big Jackets. She loves to be in control of any situation. When she feels like she's losing her grip, she gets defensive and angry. Will do whatever it takes to get what she wants.\nKeelan - A major projector. Him & Chel have history. He acts hard because he's secretly a bit of a softy, but he doesn't want anyone to know. He's been known to dip in and out of fights, but even his own crew mates don't know why. \nYuli - Best friends with Mack. Strongly opposed to Billie & Chel's relationship because she's convinced it's going to get in the way of The Big Jackets rise in the 20 Fists Fight League.\nMack - They are the heavy hitter that tips the scale in any fight and the reason why The Big Jackets are building a rep as winners. They are business first and take fights very seriously. Despite this, they don't particularly like fighting. They just like hanging out with their friends and only try so hard because they don't want to let them down.\nKT - A bit of an enigma. Not much is known about her besides that she's always ready to go for a fight and most of the stuff she owns she's stolen. \nCovers & Excerpt\n20 Fists #2 (Cover Art by Kat Baumann, Logo/Lettering by DC Hopkins)\n20 Fists #2 (Page 1)\n20 Fists #2 (Page 2)\n20 Fists #2 (Page 3)\n20 Fists #2 (Page 4)\n20 Fists #2 (Page 5)\n20 Fists #3 (Cover Art by Kat Baumann, Logo/Lettering by DC Hopkins)\n\nTestimonials\n\"20 Fists is the sort of romance John Carpenter would direct. 20 Fists is the sort of comic each one of The Warriors would have on their pull list.

Paul Schiek, A.H.G., and LetterSquids that tells the story of one man\u2019s quest to avenge his murdered brother and how this affects the entire realm of Mercy after the death of one of its prominent leaders. \nWhen the King of the Northlands is assassinated and a note reading \u201cno more monarchs\u201d is left on his corpse, his best friend, an elderly monk named Aldus Berryann, must travel across the realm to deliver the news to the Queen of the Southlands. However, unbeknownst to him, his guide and bodyguard, Lamond Yohe, is also on a journey to avenge his brother by hunting down and killing all the former cultists who took his life.  \nTwo Swords Til Mercy is a five-issue miniseries written by Brentt Harshman with line art by J. Paul Schiek, colors by A.H.G., and lettering by LetterSquids. Imagine if Sergio Leone directed an episode of Game of Thrones, and you'll come close to what we picture with this book. \nWe are asking for $5,000 which will be split between production costs, kickstarter fees, printing, and shipping. \nWHO WILL ENJOY TWO SWORDS TIL MERCY?\n- Fans of Tarantino, Sergio Leone, and Game of Thrones.\n- Readers of Crone, East of West, and Once & Future.\n- People who enjoy high octane action and engaging dialogue. Strong characters...oh, and bloody revenge. \nThe point of this kickstarter is to raise funds to produce the first issue (of five) of a new comic book series. That's the main reward...but that doesn't mean there aren't other goodies outside of digital and physical copies of the books.\nWe will also be featuring original sketch cards, prints, pieces of art, other works by the creative team, short stories and watercolor sketches by EASTIN DEVERNA of SAMURAI GRANDPA fame, a custom printed map of Mercy, an alternate cover by J., variant covers by friends who also happen to be AMAZING artists, as well as stickers, shirts, buttons/pins, and coffee mugs as stretch goals if we surpass our goal of 5,000 dollars. \nOur first variant cover is an alternate cover by creators of the book J. Paul Schiek and Brentt Harshman!\nAnother variant cover comes to us from ANDY MICHAEL, friend of the team and artist on books such as sLAsher and Of Space!\n The third variant cover comes from SACHI EDIRIWEERA and colored by ELLIE WRIGHT. \nOur fourth variant cover is by Lane Lloyd (God Puncher)\nand our final variant cover is by Emily Pearson (The Wilds, Bonding, SnapFlashHustle)\nMainly, we just want to make our book. I'm a firm believer that the product should sell itself, not gimmicks, so that is what we are showcasing. For $5, you get a digital copy of the book. For $15, you get a print copy of the book. While there are other goodies, the book is DAMN good and DAMN deserving of your investment.\nI mean, who doesn't want to see a drunken mercenary stab a dude in the eye with a broken sword in the name of vengeance?\nCheers!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nComics are expensive to produce, so cost is the main hurdle we face.

Perhaps you enjoy anime like Ghost in the Shell or TV shows like Black Mirror? If so, Peace of Mind could well be for you...\nThe Human Cost of the Corporation's Greed\nHello to new potential backers and welcome back to those that helped make the first two issues a reality! This campaign is to fund the trade paperback printing run for Peace of Mind, totalling around 96 printed pages that are in full colour. \nPeace of Mind is a Sci-Fi dystopian comic book series set in the-not-too distant future where VR addiction is rife and consumers struggle with adapting to reality. As hyper-capitalism creeps in, poverty becomes epidemic as addicts struggle to pay for the Corporation's VR Service, for nothing is free... especially your peace of mind!\nJoin Mickey, Suzy, Leroy and 57762D in their journey from the depths of the sewers to the Corporate City, as they evade PMCs, combat their own apathy and flee from a sentient firewall... \nPLEASE NOTE: Due to Coronavirus and other things out of our control, we\u2019ve pushed the due date to August as a contingency. However, there was some miscommunication and not all the tier reward due dates reflect this. Please accept our apologies for this. \n We recommend Peace of Mind to readers who are young adults and older, due to some dark and suggestive themes, and strong language.\nPeace of Mind - The Complete Story\nPeace of Mind - Page One\nPeace of Mind - Page Two\nBelow are a collection of reviews for issues 1 and 2, see what reviewers have to say about the series so far!\n\"The book is a pretty breathtaking achievement...\" -2G1Review\n\"... well-chosen emotional moments, subtly told, that will stick with me...\" - Comics Worth Reading\n\"In just a few pages the reader is brought into the world of PoM and introduced to some intense psychological, emotional and logical ideas.\" - Super Serious Comics\n\"Writer Callum Fraser and artist Emiliano Correa have created a really slick and smart sci-fi thriller\" - Pipedream Comics\n\"Every page of Peace of Mind has at least a few things in it (and often many more) that are worth stopping and thinking about.\" - A Place to Hang your Cape\n\"...this is a really smart and ambitious piece of small press sci-fi that has the potential to be something very special\" - Pipedream Comics\n\"Dark but still with striking colors, Correa sets a visual tone that is at once ominous and paranoid as well as warm and hopeful \u2013 much like the characters\" - Comic Book Yeti\nCheck out the reviews from readers on the Comichaus app:\nUser Reviews on Comichaus\nCallum Fraser - Writer, story: Twitter, Instagram\nEmiliano Correa - Art (pencils/ink/colours): Twitter and Instagram\nRob Jones - Letters: Twitter and Facebook\nChrista Harader - Editor, Issue #3: Twitter and Website\nGrym Comics - Label: Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\nAngus Medford - Creator of Maya: Instagram\nHannah Baber - Illustrator: Portfolio \nThere are several reward tiers up for grabs, including digital, physical and a mix of both! Please note that postage will be applied via our pledge manager system, BackerKit, so there will be an additional charge when you fill our your surveys. At time of writing, we anticipate that they will be:\n\u00a32.00 for the UK | \u00a34.00 for the EU, US and Canada | \u00a35.00 Rest of the World.\nThe main reward is the Peace of Mind Trade Paperback - 96 printed pages long and contains the entire story arc, which is 2 standard issues and an extra long finale. \n\"Wait, but where's issue 3?!\" - We took the decision to save on printing costs by combining every issue together. Whilst pricing up Issue 3, we found that the sale price would not be much less than a Trade Paperback. Issue 1 will also have 'reduxed' artwork where Emiliano sees fit, as per his request. \nAdditional items and comics can be purchased via our pledge manager once the Kickstarter has run its course.\nWhat comic Kickstarter campaign would be complete without some A4 prints? We have up to four up for grabs. Our artists are Emiliano Correa, who is also the artist for Peace of Mind, Bristol based illustrator Hannah Baber, and Callum Fraser. Take a look at them below:\nPeace of Mind Trade Paperback Print - by Emiliano Correa\nJ.E.N.K.I.N.S. - by Hannah Baber\nDancing Under Surveillance - by Callum Fraser\n57762D - by Emiliano Correa | The cover for Peace of Mind #2 | Digital Heart - by Hannah Baber\nWhoa there, we were funded in less than 48 hours! That means we really need to think about them stretch goals. Here is our roadmap:\n\"What do you mean 'Callum gets paid'?\" \nTo keep costs down, Callum has not taken a page rate for writing Peace of Mind nor has he been paid for the admin behind the scenes. This stretch goal will mean he gets a \u00a35 per written page rate.\nFounded by Peace of Mind writer Callum Fraser in the embers of summer 2017, Grym Comics is a small indie label specialising in the weird and wonderful.  \nWe use Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, as well as a mail list to keep our readers up to date, so check us out!  We also go to Comic Cons across the UK, so if you see us, be sure to say hi!\nOur stall at Nottingham Comic Con - 2019\nFor full transparency: per unit (incl. the trade paperback, bagging and envelope) it will cost us \u00a36.44, at time of writing. This does not include labour costs (i.e. creator fees and man-hours for admin), which will be fronted by Callum, or postage. As mentioned previously, postage will be applied after we are funded via BackerKit. \nAdditionally, Kickstarter takes a 5% cut of the total project as well as a small % per pledge. \nNOTE: Tax is the responsibility of the recipient. From our experience, we sent the first issue all over the Americas (Argentina, North America and Canada) and Europe without issue. However, as we've grown, we've decided to open shipping up to more countries (South Africa, Russia and Japan for example). Please be aware that your country may apply an import tax to your pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nQuite small. The biggest risk stems from the fact that we are a small indie label, so lack the exposure of bigger names - this is our fourth crowdfunding campaign, so we're slowly gaining exposure! Second biggest is a delay - we are all human, and if the creative team needs to slow down a bit, then that's a decision we will make to safeguard the health of the creative team.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "~$ sudo chown -r \"PoM_Digital\"", "descp": "The digital volume for Peace of Mind, containing the whole works.

Get caught up here! Kickstarter Promo Cover. Not Actual Cover For Issue #3\nWhat Is Midnight Tiger About:  The story revolves around young high school senior  Gavin Shaw, a disillusioned teen living in the crime infested city of Apollo Bay, California who's lost faith in the heroes he admired growing up. After attempting to save the life of the gravely injured hero known as Lionsblood, Gavin finds himself waking up in a hospital bed days later with amazing new abilities. He becomes Apollo Bay's very own superhero, MIDNIGHT TIGER , and becomes an inspiration to his community!\nAwesome MIDNIGHT TIGER by Comics Legend Ron Frenz with inks by Marc Deering and colors by Ross Campbell!\nOverall Theme: At its core, it's a character driven series that is part coming of age story and part hero's journey. A fun teenage superhero action-adventure told in the Silver Age style of comics that chronicles a young hero's rediscovery of his childhood dreams versus the reality of realizing them in order to help the people of his city rediscover theirs.  MIDNIGHT TIGER will examine the idea that in order to truly save a life, sometimes you have to inspire people to live. In issue #3 we begin see how he plans to make that happen within the Apollo Bay community.\n\nPREVIOUSLY, AT THE END OF ISSUE #2: \nQUITE THE CLIFFHANGER!! Easy To See Why Fans Want To Know What Happens!!\n\nDESPITE THE HIATUS, OUR HERO STAYED BUSY:  During the time after issue #2 when production stopped on the mini-series, MIDNIGHT TIGER continued his adventures! Teaming up with Vito Delsante and Sean Izaakse's STRAY, Jamal Igle's MOLLY DANGER, Anthony Ruttgaizer's F1RST HERO, Shawn Gabborin and Chad Cicconi's VIRTUE from FRACTURE, and more to save the world in Action Lab's ACTIONVERSE crossover. Then, later coming back home to Apollo Bay in MIDNIGHT TIGER: STRONGER! Those events take place between the end of issue #3 and the beginning of the second half of issue #4.  That's why we have to get these issues completed!\nMIDNIGHT TIGER Helps Save the ACTIONVERSE and Comes Back to Apollo Bay to Some Big Life Changes!\nTHAT'S WHY THIS KICKSTARTER IS SO IMPORTANT: SInce the cliffhanger of issue #2, and thanks to ACTIONVERSE, Comixology,convention appearances, and local comic shops, MIDNIGHT TIGER's fan base has grown! Fans not only want to know what happened after issue #2, but wanted to make sure I came back to finish the story myself. After working as a freelancer the last 6 to 7 years...I'm now in a position to take the reins and tie up those loose ends!\n\nMIDNIGHT TIGER #3 TEXTLESS 5-PAGE PREVIEW: We're 5 pages into issue #3 already! Here's a preview...\nMIDNIGHT TIGER #3 PG1\nMIDNIGHT TIGER #3 PG2\nMIDNIGHT TIGER #3 PG3\nMIDNIGHT TIGER #3 PG4\nMIDNIGHT TIGER #3 PG5\nWHAT THE KICKSTARTER WILL PAY FOR: Though our Kickstarter's rewards are mostly digital the proceeds will pay for our Editor, Letterer, & Colorist, the shipping costs for the 18 physical deliverables (ORIGINAL ART!!) and convention appearances to promote the book with merchandise like prints, stickers, and other promotion items. As the Creator, Writer, Artist, and KS Campaign runner, despite the amount of time and effort needed to run a KS and produce a full comic, I've taken myself out of the base goal amount. Making sure the book is done and the creative team is paid is my number one priority.  Any additional proceeds past the goal will help pay for my own time away from freelance work, additional production costs, and if it's a significant amount...might just also pay for all the production costs of issue #4!! Killer stretch goal, right!? That would be awesome!\nJust to put things in perspective, the average production cost to produce a single comic issue is around $7000. That would pay for a Writer, Penciler, Inker, Colorist, Letterer, and Editor at a decent rate. All before printing, advertising, and distribution costs get added! This is my reason for going 75-80% digital. I can create great comics, pay my creative team a decent rate, which only consists of an Editor, Letterer, & Colorist since I'm taking up the Writer/Artist mantle, all for a base goal of $3000 per issue! If this succeeds, this will be the template for which I produce all my creator-owned content.\n\nOUR CREATIVE TEAM:\nRay-Anthony Height (Creator/Artist/Writer)grew up in Compton California. He's been freelancing at Marvel Comics for over a decade on titles like X-Men Blue, Miles Morales: Spider-Man, Marvel's Voices, and Moon Girl & Devil Dinosaur. In 2016 he also worked as a storyboard artist on Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Animated Series and more recently worked for Archie Comics on Archie 1955 with Brian Augustyn and Mark Waid. He likes to wear flatcaps.\nVito Delsante (Editor/Writer of MIDNIGHT TIGER: STRONGER) has written for DC Comics, Marvel Comics, Dynamite Entertainment, AdHouse Books, and Simon & Schuster, among others and his stories have been reprinted in other countries. He's also the co-creator of Tribute: The B.U.t14u7 1s (or, The Beautiful Ones) and STRAY. Both here on Kickstarter. He also lettered issue #2 of the original MIDNIGHT TIGER. He lives in Pittsburgh with his family and wears glasses. Find him if you can and say, \u201cHello.\u201d\nErica Schultz (Letterer) is a comic book writer and editor best known for writing Xena: Warrior Princess and Charmed for Dynamite Entertainment, her participation in DC Comics' first Talent Development Writers Workshop, and the award-winning, creator-owned crime series, M3 with artist Vicente Alc\u00e1zar. Her latest work includes the Daredevil Annual for Marvel Comics with artist Marcio Takara and Twelve Devils Dancing with artist Dave Acosta for Action Lab Danger Zone. She also lettered the FCBD issue of the original MIDNIGHT TIGER.

Though representation and diversity have been the strongest it's ever been, it's sad to say that MIDNIGHT TIGER is still one of the few comics out there with a Black teenager as the title character. Our goal is to still have Gavin be a positive character for any reader picking up the book, but it's so very important that young Black Americans see themselves represented not just as integral characters, but as heroes. Heroes inspires us to be better and nothing helps to get that point across stronger than someone who looks like you.  That said, peer pressure, parents, school, dating, the future, and finding one's place in the world are things all of us can relate to!\n\nTHAT'S IT, FOLKS! LET'S DO THIS!

Some of you have been asking if issues 0-2 would be available as part of a rewards tier and it was like you were all reading my mind! Guess you guys know me too well! You can't have issues #3 without the previous issue, right?!?! I HAD to do it! Figured it was the perfect benchmark of the campaign's progress, too. Thank you all for making DAY-1 great!!\nSo, what's our next goal? Glad you asked...\nIf we knocked out half the goal within 24 hrs....What could we do in a WEEK!?!\n  WE GOT THIS!!\nGreat question! I personally think we can get it done! Well, here is some incentive to help us get there:\nIf we manage to hit our goal by the end of this Friday I will give every Backer who pledges $20 or more a voucher for a FREE inked head sketch that'll be redeemable at any convention I attend! A $40 value!! That voucher works for large sketchbooks or sketch covers. As long as you have that voucher when you approach me for a sketch at a convention you will go IMMEDIATELY to the top of my commission list and I will redeem it. Here is a sample of what you get...\nLETS KEEP IT GOING & MAKE IT HAPPEN, FOLKS!!\n\n$3500 STRETCH GOAL\nJOHN'S BEAUTIFUL COLLABS WITH NICK BRADSHAW, JORGE JIMENEZ, RYAN OTTLEY, & SANFORD GREENE!\n$3500 STRETCH GOAL - ISSUE #3 COLORED BY JOHN RAUCH!!\nJohn is one of the best and most sought after colorists in comics!

JOE, Netflix's KULIPARI: Dream Walker, & Todd McFarlane's SPAWN...for which he won an Emmy.

Midnight Tiger has been my baby for more than 7 years and his first mini-series deserves to be completed. Which is why I've taken time off from freelance work just to make it happen. Also,we're already a quarter of the way done and with 75% of the rewards being digital, not only does it reduce production costs, but almost completely eliminates one of the biggest issues of most KS. Delivery of rewards! We only have 18 rewards that would require any physical shipping. \n\nWith weekly updates (if not more) all the way through the campaign and long after, backers will see the issue come to life every step of the way!\n\nThe production will be on a roughly 10-week schedule after launch. That will provide wiggle room for the creative team to juggle their other assignments, mishaps, & personal lives. We all want to do our best and give the Midnight Tiger fans new and old a quality product.\n\nTHANK YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR SUPPORT!!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "HIGH PAW!", "descp": "A hearty high five and huge thank you for your pledge!

But when she suffers a great loss in her personal life, and her father can't ignore the state of her neglectful home with her alcoholic mother any longer, Ariela is forced to say good-bye to the only life she's ever known. Uprooted to a new state, a new house and an estranged relative, Ariela is struggling to cope with the structure of her new home and the big, complicated feelings she has towards both of her parents.\nBut it doesn't take long for Ariela to realize there's something... special... about her new home.\nWhen old folktales spring to life around her, she learns to cope with the anger inside her and how to rely on others with a bit of supernatural guidance from an unexpected source.\nGranny Golem takes a little bit of influence from several folklore tales over the entire run but its main inspiration is Judaism. Ariela's maternal side is Jewish and the primary folklore in the story is derived from a version of their lore.\nBrian Middleton Jr, on the creation of Ariela.\n                                       | The Inspiration |\nThe writer and creator behind GRANNY GOLEM, CJ Pendragon, grew up in a broken home. Her parents divorced when she was young and it was not an amicable split. She and her siblings spent a few years with inconsistent visitation, an unreliable father figure and too much exposure to the world of adults. Her father did, and does, struggle with substance abuse and inherently selfish nature, similar to what we will see in Ariela's mother. She also experienced the pain and betrayal of an absent parent when he later disappeared from their lives altogether. \nThe story for GRANNY GOLEM started out as an idea her husband proposed a few years ago. Over time, it has evolved from a floundering prose tale to a personalized comic script that hit all of her own past wounds. CJ used writing GRANNY GOLEM as an opportunity to heal herself and let go of some of the overwhelming, dormant emotions she still carries two decades later.\nDivorces are very common in our society, and often we don't realize the impact it has on the children involved. Children of divorced parents are often less healthy, physically and mentally, and deal with very big, negative feelings and a lot of \"What if's?\" \nCJ hopes that GRANNY GOLEM, targeted towards a middle-grade audience but written for everyone, can help kids like her learn to verbalize and resolve their feelings about parental absenteeism and addiction instead of internalizing it into a festering wound. Children caught in divorce tend to blame themselves. Too often we forget to tell kids that their feelings are valid, even if they are mistaken.\n\"I have poured so much of myself into this story that it's nearly killed me at times.\"\n- CJ\nBrian Middleton Jr. on the golem's design.\nWith the Jewish folklore mixed in, CJ was able to see the world through a child's eyes again. The magic and wonder of everything around us, the connection with loved ones. The path and capacity to cry and heal and live.\nYou can read more about CJ's personal thoughts behind GRANNY GOLEM here:\nhttps://www.comicbookyeti.com/post/an-interview-with-cj-pendragon-writer-of-granny-golem\n                                       | The Story So Far: |\nTake a peek at Brian's interiors! We won't tell if you don't!\nPage One\nPage Two\nPage Three\nPage Four\n....let's skip ahead, shall we?\nPage Fifteen\n         How Influential is Judaism on the rest of the story?\nOne of the most challenging parts of GRANNY GOLEM, and the most rewarding, has been the research put into Judaism lore and history. CJ worked closely with several friends, family and community consults to ensure that Judaism was weaved into Ariela's story with respect and authenticity. She has hired a translation firm for English to Yiddish translation, has employed a sensitivity reader and has taken care to add little touches of Jewish culture to Ariela's character and surroundings.\nBubbe, the grandmother, is an important part of the GRANNY GOLEM universe and is the titular character. Bubbe is named and modeled after CJ's own step-grandmother.\n                                    | MEET THE TEAM |\nCJ Pendragon is a married mother of three with a mini-menagerie of children, cats, dogs and chickens! This is her first comic project but she owns and runs the comic book review site, Sirens of Sequentials.\nBrian Middleton Jr. is married with two beautiful daughters and six cats! Brian is the creator behind Wulfborne, an indie comic published through SCOUT COMICS. You can read the entire trilogy in trade!\nBob Salley is our editor. He's also the writer of the renowned series OGRE with Source Point Press! Bob is credited on other titles as well, including BROKEN GARGOYLES, SALVAGERS and SHELTER DIVISION.

Struble\nIt is 1872, and the war between the North and South is over. Neither side won. After years of bloody conflict, both sides entered into a truce, resulting in the formation of two nations, the Union States of America, where blacks are free, and the Confederate States of America, where blacks are still enslaved. Araminta Free is a former slave turned bounty hunter. She specializes in crossing the border into the Confederacy, and liberating slaves. She also tracks down Confederate war criminals, which has made her a woman with a price on her head in the southern nation. When a group of Confederate Raiders illegally ventures deep into the Union to kidnap free blacks and sell them into slavery, the stage is set for a deadly showdown between Araminta and the men who want her dead.\nImagine if director Sergio Corbucci (DJANGO, THE GREAT SILENCE) made a western starring Pam Grier as a badass, gun-slinging bounty hunter. Now imagine the story takes place in a world where the Civil War ended differently \u2013 instead of a victory for the North, there is a truce, and what had been one country is now two. This is THE HATED.\nThe first issue of THE HATED is 100% drawn and inked, and is currently being colored. Here are some samples of the amazing work by artist Sean Damien Hill and colorist Mx.

This will be a full color, 40-page comic book plus cover.\n30 pages of story\n10  back-up pages\nStandard sized comic\nThe purpose of this campaign is to fund the production and printing of THE HATED #1, fulfill all backer rewards, and cover the cost of shipping and handling for all reward tiers. Because THE HATED is more pages than ONE FALL, the cost of printing and shipping is more, for that reason, we have set our goal higher this time. But all of the money is going towards the costs of producing and delivering all rewards, any remaining/extra funds will go toward the production of THE HATED #2.\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nWe wanted the freedom to create a series on our own terms, and at a pace that works for our schedules. The first issue of THE HATED is drawn, inked, and partially colored and lettered. By the time this campaign is over, the first issue will be 100% complete and ready to go to print. The money raised from this campaign will go to fund printing and productions costs of the first issue of THE HATED, production of other rewards, and shipping. Any money raised over the target goal will be used as seed money for the second issue of THE HATED.\n\nTHE HATED #1 - We've got some great rewards for this campaign, starting the the comic itself. You will have a choice of a digital comic or a physical copy. There are multiple options for covers of the physical copy, including the main Cover, and the variant Cover B (image only, no text). \nTHE HATED #1 - David Mack Variant Cover - since a picture is worth 1,000 words, we'll just show it to you...\nDavid Mack variant cover\nTHE HATED #1 Black and White Limited Edition - Solid Comix is pleased to offer a limited edition, black and white version of THE HATED #1. This is the exact same comic as the color edition, only without the color. This edition will have a limited print run for Kickstarter. There will be no second printing. The black and white edition will only be available here on Kickstarter (and at conventions if any are left) -- no digital copies, not available online, and no retailer copies. Once these are gone, they are gone. \npages from the Black and White Limited Edition\n KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!!! This amazing sticker (2\"x3\") featuring Araminta Free is included with all physical copies. Not available anywhere else, this is special thanks to everyone supporting Solid Comix and THE HATED. \nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!!!\nBadAzz MoFo's Book of SPAGHETTI WESTERNS by David F. Walker - every order of THE HATED comes with this FREE digital of David F. Walker's book about spaghetti westerns, reprinted from the pages of his 'zine BadAzz MoFo. This digital book features reviews of more than 40 films and a historic overview of the Eurowestern genre -- 114 pages, including reviews of DJANGO, THE GREAT SILENCE, A BULLET FOR THE GENERAL, and many more. This is special thanks to everyone supporting Solid Comix and THE HATED.\nADD-ONS\nThe Joelle Jones 8.5\u201dx11\u201d pin-up is now available as an add-on to all print copy reward tiers for $10 each (sorry, not available with digital only). This was supposed to be the $20k stretch goal...but since we likely won't hit that goal, and since this is such an amazing work or art, and because I appreciated all the support everyone has shown to this campaign, it is being made available. \nTo add the pin-up to your existing reward tier click the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d button (it should be on the right side of your screen). This will take to a page called \u201cChange Your Pledge.\u201d Change the \u201cPLEDGE AMOUNT\u201d to reflect the adding of the pin-up or any other add-ons. EXAMPLE: If you pledge $8 to get a print copy of Cover A and you want to add the Joelle Jones, you would add $10, making your new pledge amount $28.\nJoelle Jones 8.5\"x11\" pin-up\nMORE ADD-ONS\nANOTHER NEW TIER!!!\nWe\u2019ve just added a very special reward tier. Let\u2019s call it the \u201cI Love Indie Comics\u201d tier.

All three are comic projects they I have backed on Kickstarter, and I want to share them with a select group of backers.

I have been using the post office as my main source of business shipping for more than 25 years. In that time, I've had more problems in the last six months than in all those years combined.

THANKS TO ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT, WE HAVE JUST REACHED OUR FUNDING GOAL AND ARE NOW GOING FOR THE STRETCH GOAL OF $25,000 - WHICH WILL ALLOW US TO PUBLISH AN EXPANDED EDITION OF MARINER! NOW OVER 100 PAGES WITH BACK MATTER MATERIAL INCLUDING PAGES FROM MICHAEL'S ANNOTATED SCRIPT, AND SKETCHBOOK STUDIES AND UNUSED PAGES FROM JONATHAN!!  \nOur Mariner expands upon Samual Taylor Coleridge's original lyrical masterpiece The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, exploring the themes of Choice and Regret through a more contemporary lens, but with a cast of characters throughout the architecture of time: the 30's, 80's, 1800's, today, and beyond. Their fears are realized in surrealist and somewhat spooky circumstances. \nOne of our already complete pages featuring a couple of my favorite characters!\n\nMariner is a fully painted 90 page graphic novel, which will be delivered to you, beautifully printed in an oversize format with a French Fold cover design!  AND- we're excited to be offering FREE domestic shipping for the books!\nA French Fold protects the raw edges of your book. (Different than a French Tuck, but just as classy, thanks Tan!)\n\nDon't know the original poem? No problem! Mariner does certainly reference Coleridge's text, but ours is a stand-alone story with no homework reading required. (But, if we reach our stretch goals, we will include the original poem in our printing as well! More on that later.)  \nMy name is Jonathan Marks Barravecchia, I am an artist and illustrator who has worked for companies such as Marvel and Aspen comics, and have shown my work in galleries in the US, UK, and Australia. \nJonathan is a cool boy.\nI vividly remember buying my first comic at a shop next to my grandmothers house (a reprint of Uncanny X-Men 169!), and I was hooked.  I love comics. I love making them, I love reading them, but as Ive grown more into my own artistic style Ive come to appreciate that my work does not necessarily fit on all books. Thats cool, comics can look like anything (!), so I've started to focus more on telling my own stories in ways which are visual honest and resonant to me. Hence, self-publishing, and now, Kickstarter! \nMichael Dean is a writer, filmmaker, and performer raised in the Mohave Desert. He has always loved bringing a vulnerable humanity to conceptually wild premises, be it in various Festival selected films, theater productions, or as co-creater / producer / writer of the cult favorite audio series Hollow Public Radio. \nThe beauty of Michael's works is owed to the incredible collaborators he's been fortunate to have again and again, and Jonathan is no exception to that. To see ideas of both cosmic existence and individual emotional distress treated with the same amount of artistic care and craft is what this book's writing strives for, what Jonathan's art realizes, and is exactly why Michael fell in love with comics as a child (spending, honestly?? too many hours in the comic section of the public library). \nMaking comics is hard work! Its' a fun job, but it's still a job, and at the end of the day, both Michael and myself are freelance artists who are paid per project.  This makes prioritizing creator-owned or passion projects difficult simply due to the fact that there are only so many hours in the day! Fever Dreams was literally done after and inbetween other jobs we were working on - and while that can work (clearly), it simply takes exponentially longer to get anything done and out on the shelves.  Mariner is a significantly larger (literally) undertaking, and we have chosen to turn to Kickstarter to help fund this so as to be able to put Mariner first, and turn around to get it out to you as quickly as we can!  \nWhile it is technically Jonathan's first Kickstarter, (aw! Baby's first crowdfund!) Michael and our editorial team have been a part of a number successful crowdfunding campaigns, raising money for everything from comic books, to stop motion projects, to even a full improv theater!! Trust that this team has the track record to deliver to you a beautifully made product, as they have again and again! \nThe majority of the funds from your pledges and pre-orders simply go to printing and shipping costs both to get the physical book back to us, and then out to all of you.  A portion of our budget will go towards realizing and shipping the rewards, and Kickstarter fees and taxes; and a portion will ostensibly be acting as our 'page-rates', in order to allow us to continue prioritizing and completing the book in the time frame which we have outlined.\nIn addition to the actual book, we are so excited to be able to offer Kickstarter exclusive rewards, including comic book collector standards such as signed and numbered editions and remarqued sketch editions, as well as original art, and a limited edition (only 10 printed!) collectors cover exclusive to Kickstarter!\nJonathan's commissions gives you the opportunity to have a bespoke image of your favorite characters!\nThumbnail previews of the limited edition variant cover featuring our character Samsara!\nWe're also happy to be collaborating with sculptor Alex Klein for our coolest reward, a 1:10 scale figure of The Mariner!  ( Plus, more talents will be collaborating with us for some pretty exciting stretch goals! But more on that later.) \nSculptor Alex Klein painstakingly crafts every one of his pieces with incredible detail.\n\nPlease tell your friends (and enemies too I suppose) and share this project with everyone!  Thank you all so much for your support, we cannot wait to share Mariner with the world!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking comics - making anything - is hard work. While Michael and I are both professionals, there are always risks and components with publishing which we cannot control. \nSome potential risks include printing and shipping delays, particularly with an overseas printer, which could include anything from bad seas to dockworkers strikes.\nThere are also the day to day challenges such as, If I get too sick to work for whatever reason, then there is no one else who can step in and finish pages. \nHaving said that though, not only are we already ahead of the game with pages (and even some rewards!) done, but Michael and I will be working simultaneously on art, editing, and lettering (Michael hand-letters every page!), so that Mariner will be print ready almost as soon as the final page is dry.\nI can also assure you that, while this is my job, it is also my passion (however healthy or unhealthy that is I do not know), and drawing and painting everyday is truly something I love to do. The funding which we receive through this Kickstarter platform will allow us to not only create this book which means so much to us, but to prioritize it in a way which we were not able to previously.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "THE WEDDING GUEST : Thank you for coming", "descp": "THANK YOU!

Largely due to Ramon\u2019s activism, both in M.A.Y.O. in and with Model Cities Program, Yaqui were successfully integrated into the expanding metropolis of Tucson: families bought property, roads and sidewalks were built, and sewage systems installed. Ramon and his colleagues even founded a night school to help adults learn English and established the region\u2019s first low-cost clinic to offer birth control.\nUtilizing newspaper clippings, interviews with surviving MAYO members, and Ramon\u2019s authored articles, La Voz De M.A.Y.O. dramatizes the remarkable life and achievements of my great-grandfather\u2014and in so doing, tells the story not just of a single man, but of a family, a tribe, a nation.\nPreview\nLa Voz De M.A.Y.O. #3 Page 1 by Henry Barajas, J.

It follows a young girl named Ariela as she struggles to learn how to cope with her parents' tumultuous divorce, her mother's addiction and the loss of her grandmother, the only source of stability Ariela has ever known.\nWhen Ariela's father is forced to admit her living conditions with her alcoholic mother are less than ideal, our young heroine finds herself whisked off to a small town in Kentucky, armed only with the ashes of her beloved Bubbe. Angry, defiant and hurting inside, Ariela soon comes to realize there's something special about her new home. When old folktales spring to life around her, she learns to cope with the anger inside her and how to rely on others with a bit of supernatural guidance from an unexpected source.\nGranny Golem takes a little bit of influence from several folklore tales over the entire run but its main inspiration is Judaism. Ariela's maternal side is Jewish and the primary folklore in the story is derived from a version of their lore. CJ worked closely with several practicing Jewish consults to make sure that Granny Golem stayed respectful and authentic.\nGranny Golem will be a total of 56-pages, including a 44-page comic and a 4-page illustrated prose one-shot.\n                      *                   *                     *                     *                       *\n              Why a story about a grandmother turned golem?\nWhat Brian said above is why: love. \nIt's a central part of this story and when he mentioned highlighting it in the character design, it just made sense. Love is, after all, what drives us to make the best and worst of our own choices.\nThis idea was first presented to me by my husband, who had it rattling around his head for many years before he asked me to write it. With a few false starts to a prose story, it became, almost overnight, my first comic script.\nAnd I have poured so much of myself into this story that it's nearly killed me at times.\nMy parents divorced when I was young and it was not amicable. My father suffered and still does, with substance abuse, selfishness and a general lack of caring about his children. I lived a lot of my life with anger and pain and misplaced blame. While there are many blatant differences between Ariela and myself, my emotions are hers. The absence of a parent. The tears. The confusion. And I felt like this was a good story to tell because there are a lot of children blaming themselves and no one tells them that their feelings are valid, even though they're wrong. \nWith the Jewish folklore mixed in, I was able to see the world through a child's eyes again. The magic and wonder of everything around you, the connection with loved ones. I wanted a strong little girl in an underrepresented demographic to get the chance to be the focus of a world, any world. \nBrian and I, with a lot of help from Bob, have worked hard to make Ariela's story one that is relatable and connective despite the fantastic elements of the story. \nIt will appeal to readers of all ages with an inclusive cast introduced over the series' run and mature themes applied in kid-friendly and honest ways. I have cried writing this a dozen times, and over the course of a comic script, found my own path to healing old wounds.\nSample Pages: \nTake a sneak peak at what we've been doing!

Enter: Keene, an independent contractor brought in to help figure out how and why she died. What unfolds is a mystery spanning decades that becomes less about why one woman dies and more about why a building would conspire to make it happen.\nThis 24 page one-shot utilises a central conceit that can only work in comics - every single page is framed exactly the same way, it\u2019s a front shot of the KDP building, but different panels and tiers of the page can jump around through time. Collins\u2019 expressive and intricate inkwork delivers us characters and moments through zoomed panels and cutaway areas so each page jumps around in time to build a truly epic story.\nThis comic is nearly completely finished and ready to deliver.\nNEWSPAPER SIZED PRINT STOCK\nThis comic is something special. The detail and care Collins put into every page needed more than the US standard sized comic could hold. You deserve to be able to spread this out and drink it in, so we\u2019ve decided to print this as an extremely oversized edition. At over twice the size of a regular comic, this is more like a newspaper in your hands.\nThe nature of the size means the comic will be folded to be posted to you, but this isn\u2019t a CGC affair anyway, this is the kind of thing you rattle with your hands with every read, the kind of thing you share with your mates, and the kind of thing that deserves to live.\nWe hope you agree.\nDIGITAL OPTIONS\nThere is a digital option for this comic, if you want to take it in as a PDF, but you will naturally forego that size element that makes this something special - unless you read it on an iPad Pro, or perhaps an interactive tv screen. \nFIRST DAY BACKER PARTY\nFor those who back in the First 48 Hour Window, well, do I have some goods for you.\nEarly believers get their hands on some extra digital swag, where you'll be instantly linked to:\nA PDF of BEAUTIFUL CANVAS #1 [art by Sami Kivela], and\n2 PDFs of my short comics about a prison for supervillains and a guard with size manipulation powers, LITTLE MAN IN THE BIG HOUSE [art by Paul Tucker, and Francesco Iaquinta]\nPLEDGE LEVELS\n$4 - Building Schematic\nA PDF of the comic with the script in a separate document.\n$10 - Talking Building\nA PDF of the building with a speech balloon or caption poorly lettered on, downloaded as jpeg, and emailed to you.

I\u2019ve also worked with Vertigo, Dark Horse, IDW, ComixTribe, and Black Mask to release comics like ETERNAL, NEGATIVE SPACE, BEAUTIFUL CANVAS, CHUM, and HEADSPACE.\nMitchell Collins - Mitch Collins is an Australian comic book artist. He loves to tell all sorts of stories, bringing pictures to the words. His credits include being part of Gestalt Comics TALGARD and featuring in the upcoming UNDAD VOL 3 and this comic here. He also works in storyboarding for short films, animations, UI & UX concepts. When MItch isn\u2019t working, he usually enjoys a nice cold one and a cigar out by the pool.\nSimon Robins - Simon's keen interest in comics was sparked by 2000AD as a young teen and has grown consistently since. He graduated from the Victorian College of the Arts with a Bachelor of Fine Arts majoring in photography where he created sequential photographic collages for his final porfolio and RMIT with a Masters of Design focusing on the visual communicative power of comics. Changing his career direction from design to comic book colouring, his career in comics started a little later than many. Simon draws on the skills and experienced gained from two decades working in the design and photographic industries to inspire his comic book colouring. Now a professional colourist he has worked with both mainstream and independent publishers/creators. Outside of comics he maintains sanity by screaming in a grindcore band, frequently cheats death on a mountain bike, is endlessly inspired by his wife and two daughters and takes solace in long walks on the beach with his slightly mad mutt Macey.\nSimon--Ryan--Mitchell\n5 PAGE PREVIEW [unlettered]", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis comic is 100% getting made and completely ready to deliver.

I hit into the back of a car. As I was on the phone with my wife, explaining what was going on, another accident occurred just feet away from me, and one of the cars came within inches of hitting my car. I walked away unscathed. The car had to be totaled. For a couple of weeks, I was using my wife's car and in that time, I started to listen to Prince. Specifically, the song alluded to above. It resonated with me because...well, he was right. Sometimes, as rare as it actually is, it does snow in April. I was alive and all I could think about was how resonant that song was to me.\nAnd then the news came.\nI am not blessed as an artist. My gift is storytelling, words...which, yes, is an art unto itself, but when someone of such magnitude dies, when their art has ceased, your first instinct (or mine, anyway) is to paint something. I'm just not gifted in that way. So, I came up with a story, a story told to me via a specific playlist, a specific order of Prince's music. Arranged by title only (no music or likenesses of Prince appear in this comic), the songs created a story of its own. Something that, maybe, could have been a Prince song that was left unwritten. Or something that has always existed. I did something similar a few years ago for a Nine Inch Nails anthology that we decided to pull at the last minute. For the first time anywhere, I present, HYPERPOWER, by Ricardo Ven\u00e2ncio (art), Alejandro Bruzzese (colors), and me (script and letters). As you'll see in HYPERPOWER and in TRIBUTE, it's a very non-linear style of telling a story, but it doesn't skimp on storytelling. I have this view about music that has always had a universal truth to it; music can reach everyone. Like the emotion of love, music is something that we all have within us, whether we can sing or dance, or not. Everyone has the hum of the universe.\nThat's how it started. \nAnd then I was introduced to Vasco Georgiev.\nVasco is a once in a lifetime talent (currently working on Dynamite Entertainment's XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS), and I'm grateful to Sean Izaakse (my co-creator on STRAY) for introducing us. I had ideas of what I wanted to write for him, but for some reason, TRIBUTE kept coming up whenever I saw his art. We reached a common understanding about the project, and he CLEARLY knocked it out of the park.\nSo, here we are. As of right now, only five or six people (besides Vasco and myself) have seen the book. We're ready to share it with everyone.\nWhat's TRIBUTE about? \nTRIBUTE is a classic \"boy-meets-girl\" story...but in this case, the boy is an androgynous alien from a planet where silence is golden. The alien (whom is unnamed in the story) is a rebel, and has continually snuck off his planet to experience music and life. Which comes into direct conflict with his father's orders.  \nThat's when the B.U.t14u7 1s are brought in. Cold and unfeeling, the B.U.t14u7 1s have the ability to silence entire worlds. The alien is undeterred. Knowing his time is short, he seeks out a special girl and finds her...here on Earth.\nWanna see more?

People don\u2019t have secret identities and vigilante night jobs. They become teachers or firemen. They work 9 to 5. Some fly to the office, but most take the subway.\nHumans with enhanced abilities are called Chimerans. They are registered with the International Chimeran Administration, a global organization dedicated to helping Chimerans integrate into society. They work to minimize harm caused by dangerous or destructive abilities and provide support and training to super-powered kids and their families. \n Ten years ago Anne walked away from the dangerous life as an ICA agent to start a family. Anne can shoot fire from her hands, but her true calling is helping kids like her get the support they need to grow up. When an old friend is mysteriously killed in the line of duty, Anne finds herself pulled towards the life she left behind. Along the way she encounters Vladimir Markov, a Russian ICA agent sent to investigate the murder.   \n What You'll Get: \nThe Comic itself is 25 pages\nThe Digital Deluxe and the printed editions of the comic will have 11 pages of additional content. The content will be a mixture of setting information and more background on how the comic came to be. \nFans of Heroes, Powers, Misfits, Alphas and other stories of superhumans' real world impacts on society\nPeople who like to read alternate history and crime drama\nLovers of comics about civil and social responsibility and Science Fiction!\nFinding Home | La Voz de M.A.Y.O. Tata Rambo\nWe\u2019re comic book fans. We\u2019re also gamers and one of our favorite pastimes has been interactive storytelling in tabletop RPGs. Playing in a long term superhero game, aside from being great fun, taught us to challenge the roles of heroes and look at their worlds with a critical eye. More than ever before we wanted consistent storytelling with repercussions when heroes took action. We wanted their worlds to be impacted by their choices. No reboots and do-overs. Having superpowers has very real-world implications, and we wanted to explore. These are characters and stories that we've shared with each other and built on for years. We want to give you the chance to fall in love with them too. \nLife is the ongoing accumulation of stories, and the best place to get them is from the people all around you. In homage to the fiction we\u2019ve spun around the table with friends and mountains of dice, we\u2019ve brought together a group of seasoned professionals and dedicated amateurs to craft the foundation of a unique superhero setting that can be shared and added to over the years. The central comic and collection of short stories have been made with love and care through countless revisions. We hope you\u2019ll enjoy the great tales inside.  \nThis campaign isn\u2019t just to raise money to print our book\u2014we want our future fans to be involved in bringing this world to life. Since the very beginning, Incident Report has been a collaborative story. This endeavor started with creating characters at the game table with our friends but quickly became something much bigger than we had ever imagined. We weren\u2019t ready to walk away. Soon, we we were spending late nights commandeering auditorium whiteboards in college, writing notes and power-sets on loose sheets of paper or on the back of study guides trying to build the foundation of this world. But for all of this work we still need one final piece to finish our story: you. \nWe've already completed the book, so we're raising all of the funds for printing and rewards. Here's the breakdown!\n Once the KS is backed, we will send out backer surveys\n We\u2019ll send out the digital version of the book once all of the files are compiled for the printer \u2014the book is complete, so this should be shortly after the Kickstarter ends.\n Printing can take 2-3 months to complete. \n Once everything physical is assembled, we\u2019ll begin shipping.

We're raising funds to print our pilot issue for the series, a 36-page installment featuring 5 comics stories, one prose story, and an exclusive interview with cartoonist Michel Fiffe! \nOur magazine exists as a space for a diverse range of creators of different races, artistic sensibilities, genders, experiences, and sexualities to explore the superhero genre. It's not always easy taking part in the genre when it seems to belong to an industry that is either forgetful of or downright hostile towards your existence! We're here to offer a space for creators to tell their stories in the genre, whatever those may be.\nCover Art by michi // chrysanthemumskies\nFortunately for our prospective backers, Weekend Warrior Comics #1 is complete thanks to the hard work of our crackerjack creative teams and dynamic designer!

The three man night crew will be witness to unspeakable horrors born from within the TOMB OF THE WHITE HORSE. \nTOMB of the WHITE HORSE final cover - Cover art by Kim Myatt\nSnow falls, tensions rise, and the presence of this package pulls the crew closer to the abyss of insanity. Blood will be spilled, sacrifices made, and by dawn humanity will be privy to what lies within THE TOMB. \nTOMB OF THE WHITE HORSE is a 36-page full color one-shot comic that is both a standalone story and the first of a four part horror series. \nBenjamin and I share a love of horror.The Thing, The Shining, and Hellraiser are a just a few we keep close to our hearts. Likewise, the otherworldly eeriness of The Twilight Zone, Tales from the Crypt, and reprints of EC Horror Comics were also objects of our affection. Equipped with an armful of this malevolent, bleeding love, we set our jaws and fashioned it into a comic.  \nPage 01: Inks - Benjamin \u00c6 Filby, Colours - Lesley Atlansky, Letters - Zakk Saam\nTOMB is a story of isolation, gore, and high strangeness that I hope will connect on more than a surface level. We wanted the struggle between our characters resonant with the divisive times in which we live. It's important to care about the people we're terrorizing, and without giving away too much, we wanted the reader to feel the pain of Sam, the rage of Taylor, and the smug security of Noah, instead of making them 2-dimensional cannon fodder.\nPage 02: Inks - Benjamin \u00c6 Filby, Colours - Lesley Atlansky, Letters - Zakk Saam\n The project has been a labor of love for some time. We distributed the first TOMB OF THE WHITE HORSE preview at NYCC in 2018. Then an updated version at C2E2 in early 2019. While working on a third re-write, we grabbed an opportunity to have my script reviewed by Danny Lore, (Queen of Bad Dreams, James fricking' Bond) and their notes transformed our work-in-progress into the chilling tale we have in store for you. \nOur goal of 3500$ is to pay for colors, letters, printing, fulfillment of rewards, and shipping to our backers. Value and turnaround time are important to us, so we've included free shipping in the US & UK, and our time goal is to have the book in your hands before the last day of October. \n As co-creators of TOMB, Benjamin and I are not taking a page rate for this book. We wanted to keep the goal low and ensure we could pay for the awesome letters & colors Zakk and Lesley are providing. The rest of the funds raised will go to production costs, printing & fulfillment/shipping of the final products. Any renumeration for us will come from stretch goals & will be duly noted as the campaign goes on. \n\nOne of our main priorities for this comic is to make it our own - we want the book to stand out, and be an object of substance in its own right. We've worked together to curate the high quality materials that fit the art and subject matter of TOMB - a 200gsm matt laminated cover to showcase Kim Myatt's fantastic painted cover, with 150gsm uncoated interior pages, giving the comic a tactile quality so you can FEEL THE HORROR!\n BENJAMIN \u00c6 FILBY \n More of his work can be found at benjaminaefilby.com\nIAN MONDRICK\nYou can find him on twitter @Ian_Face. \n\nLESLEY ATLANSKY\nMore of her work can be found at www.lesleyatlansky.com\n\nZAKK SAAM", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're determined to make this book! But bringing enough people together to generate life in a project like this is always our main concern. \nBenjamin and I have worked hard to make sure our budget is tight and responsible, but the only thing that keeps us up at night (besides the strange dragging sound emanating from the basement) is that our reach isn't wide enough to \"get the word out\" appropriately. The best solution is signal boosting from our fans and friends. \n\nSo please, even if you're not able to back the book, take a moment to tweet or post about TOMB OF THE WHITE HORSE on your social media feeds. \n\nTell your friends at the comic book shop, office, or the Overwatch league you play in Wednesdays, Fridays, and alternating Sundays.

It's Lucia! I have recorded my sophomore album, Best Friend Forever, and want to get it mastered and release it for all of you, with enamel pins (of me and my cat Penny!) and beautiful hand-painted cover art! I have a new band and a bigger sound... Let Me Into Your World and I'll Be Your Best Friend Forever!!\nHi! I'm Lucia Fasano. I'm a singer-songwriter who also acts (Portlandia, HBO's The Deuce, Hulu's Dollface), an improviser and stand-up comedian (UCB, All Jane Comedy Fest), and I write for comic books (Image, A Wave Blue World) and draw! \nI love making art so much-- if I didn't, I would truly have no creative outlet and would channel everything into something like miniature golf or collecting rare coins. \nHere's my latest single off my new album-- \"Spend the Night\" an ephemeral, emotional power-pop song about loving something and not wanting it to end. \nme (by joy newell)!\nI released my debut solo album, Radio Silence, through Kickstarter the summer of 2016. Ah, what a time that was. Thanks to a lot of the people reading this, I was able to put out that album, go on tour with The Doubleclicks (of my label, Doubleclicks Records), sell my CD in record stores and streamed it on Spotify, make some adorable t-shirts, make new friends and fans, launch my Patreon, and move back to the glamorous and sweaty city of Los Angeles. In the midst of that I wrote and recorded a bunch of new songs, and now I'm back with a new album full of them!\nBest Friend Forever is an album about all things friendship\u2014the sunny sides and the sacrifices, our friends as family, our family as friends, and what happens when a friendship ends. Compared to my first album Radio Silence, this album has less mandolin and more rockin'.

So with any luck, the ten backers (you know who you are) will be receiving your prints in the coming weeks/month.\nI have an update on the packages that were sent out in early March. Apparently it\u2019s now public that the new Post Master General is slowing the mail on purpose. It\u2019s some system that\u2019s meant to reduce labor costs, but it wasn\u2019t tested first and no one seems to be monitoring it as it goes terribly wrong. It looks like there might be a congressional investigation. This seems to coincide with the other information I've received, which is that much of the mail -- domestic AND international -- that was sent out in early March was immediately stored in holding containers to be sure that it was not part of the Covid spread.

For instance, my father-in-law, who lives in the UK, was a backer of the Random Monkey Sketch Lottery level; he just received his package and it was sent on March 12.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t received your book or rewards yet, please know that you are not alone. This pandemic has done a number on a lot of things including mail deliveries.  \n\n The good news is that every few days, I\u2019m delighted to see that backers are receiving their HEY, AMATEUR! books and rewards.\n\n I know it\u2019s frustrating but please hang in there. Everything in the world is still topsy-turvy.  If I resend any packages now, we run the same risk of them getting lost. And I have so little stock left because I was unable to print extras based on giving everyone free shipping. I am confident that you will be receiving your books soon and massive apologies again.\n\n One final note: If you\u2019re expecting the Paul Pope signed art print, I\u2019m still waiting for Paul\u2019s package to arrive in L.A.

All that mattered was this...place.\u201d\nSomeone wakes up on a beach, memory of their past life intact but unimportant. All that matters now is this place. They wander a decaying beach piled with giant bones, a bleak place where lighting strikes and dark hermits warn of painful transformations to come.\nThe Bones of This Place is a 48 page, 9x6, hardcover graphic homage to loneliness and unwanted transformation. Originally created as an INKTOBER project for 2018, with your help it can become so, so much more.\nWhy?\nIn 2018 something happened and my body started becoming something new. It did this without my permission, without caring what I needed or who I believed myself to be. \nYou\u2019re trapped in your skin - even if you don\u2019t want to be. There are things you can do to change yourself, but there are parts of you, deep down in the dark, that shift without your control. You\u2019re bound to these dark places, unable to escape. I became acutely aware, and troubled by this knowledge as my skin and bones started to twist into something I didn\u2019t set out to be. It consumed, consumes, me still. \nPage 2.\nIn 2018 I went to my partner\u2019s childhood home in Seaside, Oregon. \nHe had grown up as an army brat, moving from place to place, but he always talked fondly about the wreckage of the Peter Iredale, the skeletal remains of a ship that went aground in 1906. The beach surrounding the bones of the ship was littered with large pieces of driftwood, whole trees practically, that had washed up on this stretch of lonely shore. The starkness of the water, the dull sand, the pieces of wood that breached the sand like broken vertebrates, it all pulled at me. It almost felt like an ache in my spine. It was beautiful and frightening. \nThis combination of the beautiful loneliness and unknown pull of the wreckage and beach twisted around the unwanted transformation I was undergoing and ARE, the hooded figure who wanders the stagnant beach, was created. \nAre and Was\nThis is a different path than other Kickstarters I\u2019ve done. NOSFERATU! was irreverent but kind hearted, Casket Land was a game that brought people together. THE BONES OF THIS PLACE  is a move to atmospheric eldritch fiction. I want it to be a beautiful artifact that draws you in and leaves you beautifully empty. \nWith your help, I\u2019m hoping to bring you a 9x6 48 page hardcover piece - the main story, as well as concept art and explanations of what exactly, ARE and WAS are. \nArt not final.\n\"This isn't something you can escape from. You can run and run, but your body will continue to betray you. Why fight? Why not just let the changes come peacefully?\u201d\nRewards.\nThe setting of THE BONES OF THIS PLACE is stark and simple - and so are the base rewards for this project. Depending on what level you choose to support at - you can get:\nA digital edition of the book.\nA hardcover copy kickstarter edition\nOriginal art from the book\nA sticker of ARE and WAS\nAn embroidered patch of ARE\nThe original pages from the book (black and white ink and halftone)\nA hand knitted wool (by Marie) hood based on the hoods worn by ARE and WAS\nOur STRETCH GOALS are officially here, priced, and ready to be met. By backing and sharing, you bring this labor of love closer to the vision I've always had - a beautiful, spot gloss, foil stamped, and...well...you'll see. \nSpot gloss for the title on the front cover.\nA foil stamp on Are's hood for the front cover.\nAt $9,999 a vellum tip in page will be added. See below for an example.\nPLAY\n\nRisks\nSHIPPING WILL BE CHARGED AFTER THE CAMPAIGN ENDS.\nAll shipping fees will be charged AFTER the campaign ends, just before we ship the books. By doing it this way we can ensure you are paying the lowest possible cost for shipping. \nWe will ship the books in bulk to a series of warehouses around the globe. Final surveys will then be sent to each Backer requesting their address and calculating an accurate shipping charge. We're going to do everything we can to keep these rates as low as possible.

When Lark realizes that dark magic has crept not just into the drinks but has infected the new guy Bill, she and her best friend Naomi undertake a dangerous mission to save him. Meanwhile, Bill meets a member of the Arcanist's house band with a mystical secret of his own.  \nWe made our goal, but there's LOTS more amazing stuff to come from The Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast. We're announcing the first few stretch goals here, but there are a whole slew of them planned, and we'll release info on them as we get closer to each one. \nNew Pin Design added!\nThe Chimera from issue #1 of The Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast!\nIf we hit $5000 before we get to the end of the campaign, we'll add the Chimera Head Enamel pin to every rewards package that features the Logo Pin, as well as making it available in the Add-On Store, coming exclusively for backers at the end of the campaign. These super cool pins really bring Davide's work to life, and we can't wait to share them with you!\nStay tuned to the project for more stretch goals in the final week, as well as additional limited rewards tiers, and the launch of the Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast Add-On Store!\nThis first easily unlockable reward will add some great art to all reward tiers. We'll add an All-New 4th sticker design to the Sticker Pack, and add the pack to ALL PHYSICAL REWARD TIERS. This new sticker image is a spoiler for issue #2 so we won't show it here, and it will come in a sealed envelope to prevent giving away the secret!\nFor Digital only rewards tiers, we'll add art from both the sticker pack and the comic to a the new Digital Download Rewards pack including desktop wallpapers for laptops, tablets and phones with original art from the comic!\nThe A.C.E. #2 Sticker Pack. Sticker 4 is a SPOILER for the story, and all stickers come in a sealed envelope marked SPOILER WARNING! DO NOT OPEN UNTIL YOU'VE READ ISSUE #2!\nThe first of our awesome bar swag stretch goals, every PHYSICAL rewards tier will include 2 matchbooks from the Arcanist Bar itself. While Lark and the Arcanist Bar don't allow smoking of cigarettes on bar premises, these are also perfect for lighting candles for eldritch rites, or illuminating your way through secret passages or darkened ancient shrines!\nThe Arcanist Bar Matchbooks. Final design may vary. \"Wild Bill\" likes to doodle in these when he's not playing in the house band, so some matchbooks may feature a surprise!\nIf we hit this goal, every backer receiving physical rewards will now get The Armadillo Jackal short story as a physical print mini-comic! That's a whole extra book in every reward package. \nThose who backed digital only rewards tiers will get a second totally free comic from Cloudwrangler Comics as part of their digital packages. Everyone wins! \nfrom the cover for The Armadillo Jackal, by Jeff Rider, Keith Grassmich and Micah Myers\nThis very special goal will unlock a SECOND Exclusive Print from artist Blacky Shepherd! Blacky is an old friend of the Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast team, and has worked on some stellar comics like Vampirella vs ReAnimator  and Pumpkinhead with Cullen Bunn. If we hit this tier, his art print will be available in all tiers that include the Don Nguyen art print. Not only that, but at this level we'll add the Don Nguyen print to ALL physical reward tiers. Digital reward only tiers will get a digital version of BOTH images to add to their desktop and tablet wallpaper rewards. That's a ton of great original art added to every backer's rewards! This are may also feature on exclusive alternative covers of The Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast #2, stay tuned after the campaign for the limited availability of those books.\nCheck out some of Blacky's work at his portfolio page : https://www.cqshep.com/\n\nRead on to learn all about The Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast!!!!\nFeaturing stunning full-color art from Davide Puppo and Anthony Lee, and written by Jeff Rider, Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast explores magical worlds the mystical peoples, flora and fauna that Lark, an expert mixologist and wizard, uses to make our world's most unique libations! It's all ages adventure and excitement that not only explores enchanted places but current themes around respectful treatment of the environment and sustainable and ethical food practices. Plus, for the aspiring home mixologists, each issue contains a unique cocktail recipe straight from Lark's grimoire that, with a simple earthbound substitution, you can make in your home bar! (Ingredients, magical or otherwise, not included.) \nCheck out some sample pages below!\n\n\nJeff Rider is a writer living in San Francisco who publishes his comics in print and digitally at CloudwranglerComics.com and on ComiXology. Jeff has been telling stories since he could talk, loves collaborative art in all its forms, and believes passionately in diversity and inclusion in storytelling. In addition to Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast, he\u2019s the writer of the period thriller Major Holmes & Captain Watson with Ismael Canales and the sci-fi adventure Gravity Matters with Sean Dillon, and many more comics to be collected in an anthology of shorts coming this year.\nDavide Puppo is an illustrator living in New York and working as a freelance cartoonist. He was born in Italy and he inherited the ambition of the Renaissance masters, but he focuses more on comics rather than boring paintings! He is firmly dedicated to drawing stories that make readers smarter, open-minded, charismatic and highly imaginative. He has recently graduated and can\u2019t wait to immerse himself in the world of graphic novels.\nAnthony D Lee is a British colourist. See the \"U\" there? He's classy. The extra U stands for \"upscale quality,\" which Anthony delivers with his rich, vibrant tones. Anthony has worked on books for Image, IDW, Devil's Due, and another Cloudwrangler book \"Major Holmes and Captain Watson.\" When asked how he approaches colouring something like A.C.E, he replied \"Ummm... how did you get past my security?\" Anthony lives in the wilds of England with his cat. They probably have adventures. Those whacky Brits.\nCardinal Rae letters comic books, graphic novels, and other comics related things. She is the letterer for the 2019 Eisner nominated book Crowded from Image Comics and a long time Cloudwrangler Comics collaborator.\nNoah Sharma is a freelance comic editor located in Brooklyn. A former intern for Papercutz comics, he's worked with us at Cloudwrangler Comics, Gnosis 33, & more. He has also written for 6 years at Weekly CBReview & Comicon.com.  \n We're stoked to present some amazing rewards for this campaign.\nAll New Bonus short comic!\nOne of the things we're MOST excited to bring everyone is the exclusive new short comic The Armadillo Jackal from Jeff Rider and Keith Grassmick with letters by Micah Myers. It's a story of magical retribution for a beloved Texas icon that refuses to be hunted for sport or profit. While Lark's mission is to protect the magical creatures and peoples of this world and beyond, some of them end up taking care of themselves. \nThis exclusive new story (which may or may not be set in the A.C.E. universe...) will debut with this campaign, and every backer who gets a copy of Issue #2 will also get a DRM free digital version of this comic. Stretch goals will include PRINT versions of the mini-comic as well! Check out the preview pages here.\nArmadillo Jackal cover art by Mark Alvarado\nMonstrous Art print by Don Nguyen\nWe'll feature an exclusive art print from artist Don Nguyen (Pablo the Gorilla) with art coming soon. Don loves to draw creatures, and he's been excited about tackling ours since Jeff and Davide hung out with him at Wondercon this year!\nKiller Bar Swag\nNaturally, there'll be some killer swag from the magical Arcanist Bar itself. Our enamel pin features Davide's Arcanist logo design, for those who want to subtly show they know the Arcanist's magical secret. There are also some new designs to the ever popular Cloudwrangler Comics sticker collection, check out the art from Davide and Keith Grassmick below.\nThe Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast Logo enamel pin, show the world YOU know the secret of the Arcanist Bar!\nThe Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast Die Cut Sticker pack!\nEveryone knows that comics don't get made cheaply. When I created this book, I wanted to make sure that the artists got paid for their work up front, and at a fair rate. 80% of the money raised during this campaign goes to cover costs, cash that goes straight to the talented folks who made this story so awesome to read and look at. The rest are costs associated with the physical production of the books and other rewards like enamel pins, prints, etc.\nRisks? WHAT risks?!?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo far the risk and challenges to A.C.E. #2 are very few. The full-color artwork is 100% complete, lettering is also complete, and the only thing left is book layout and the time required for printing and shipping. The additional digital and comics perks like prints, cocktail menus and enamel pins are all currently in production.\n\nThese orders will come in the heart of what creators and printers refer to as \"Con Season\" so there can sometimes be print delays, but we'll be as open and transparent as humanly possible during that phase. However, we're working with a printer we trust, and this is unlikely.\n\nThis is also our third Kickstarter and is similar in scope to our previous project. Those projects funded quickly, and all digital and physical rewards were shipped within the promised deadlines, less than three months after the end of the campaign. I learned the value of making sure that the comic is almost entirely complete before launching a campaign means a really quick turnaround time and rapid rewards delivery. The few hiccups from our earlier endeavors became teachable moments for this one, so I expect even more smooth sailing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Just leave a tip", "descp": "Just give a little support to make Issue #2 happen, and get your name on the Thank You page.\nINCLUDES:\nOption of your name on the Thank You Page of Issue #2.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 6 or more", "title": "Two for the Road", "descp": "You'll get a copy of The Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast #2 in PDF form, delivered right to your inbox, as well as a copy of The Armadillo Jackal, the digital short comic by Jeff Rider and Keith Grassmick, set (loosely) in the Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast Universe.

This time around we\u2019re joined by the amazing Tr\u00edona Farrell (West Coast Avengers, Black Panther, Crowded)  on colors as we do our spin on science fiction \u2014think Quantum Leap, if Sam happened to jump into the body of The Highlander,  and then got dragged into a sexy noir thriller.  (Note: for those born after 1990,  sub Joss Whedon's Dollhouse for Quantum Leap and keep on reading).\nIt's an ambitious combo, but around here it's go big or go home if you want to have a chance of winning...  \nThis campaign is to raise funds to print the 32 page The Game: #1 and hopefully hit a couple of Stretch Goals along the way.  We've been fortunate enough in the past to reach  several in our other campaigns. Hopefully we can do that together again and run up your winnings on The Game.\nSo just what is The Game? \nThat's the question about to rock Eli Tanner. It's also a question that's hard to answer without giving too much away.  And if you've read White Ash, you know half the fun of the series is finding out the next big reveal.  So in a \"Break Kickstarter\" kinda way, rather than tease anymore we're just going to let you dive right in and read the first 10 pages of the book.  Right now.  \nReady...\nSet...\nGO!  \nYep, The Game roars out of the gates with a bang (sorry, too soon?).  And we're just getting started as  Eli's day is about to get a lot more complicated.  For instance, he still hasn't met Iris...\nOr Paul.\nBut they're coming.  So is the Sci-Fi.  (There's an epic game being played out over centuries... ) But you'll have to back our campaign to find out exactly where The Game goes next.  \nAaaaand, to make things more fun, as part of #BREAK KICKSTARTER month, we're going to PLAY A GAME with you.  (Details are somewhere on this page...).\nBut for now, as Paul would say, \"let's get the lead out\" and get on to the...\nTo start with, there's THE BOOK. \nOne of the things we love about Kickstarter is there's no publisher dictating that to save money we need to squeeze our story into 20 pages. (Yes, Marvel, I'm looking at you).   The Game #1 clocks in at 32 pages of story, no adds or filler.\nAnd that kind of content deserves a premium paper weight.   \nLike with White Ash, we print The Game on a heavy 85 lb glossy paper stock with a 105 lb glossy cover. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the difference.  A heavier stock also makes the comic less likely to be damaged in transit.    \n AKA Variant Covers. And this campaign we are lucky enough to be able to offer two.\nThe first is our IRIS COVER VARIANT from Image/ Dynamite/ Boom Studios superstar,  Jenn St-Onge.  This will be a exclusive print run of only 250 copies.  This variant will not be sold in stores.  They only place you can get it, is right here on Kickstarter. (If we don't completely sell out,  we may bring a copy or two to conventions. But I wouldn't count on it). \n And in honor of our second trip to SDCC, Conor whipped up an exclusive CON-ONLY 16 PAGE ASHCAN of The Game to sell at our booth and let people know about the Kickstarter.  Since we know not everyone can make it to San Diego, and we didn't want to leave our loyal backers out in the cold, we'll be \"buying up\" some of the copies at the Con so we can offer them directly to you. This is an incredibly limited print run. We only made 100 total copies of the SDCC variant and each one will be signed by Conor and Charlie.\nIf you're a collector, you're not going to want to miss out on this.  \nAnd to commemorate The Game's launch on Kickstarter, we're giving every physical backer a 6x11 print of Conor's gorgeous \"Welcome to The Game\" illustration.  (All backers will receive a digital copy).    \nNew to what we do? Along with The Game, you can snag a copy of White Ash:Vol 1 a 200 page hardcover,  in a wraparound dust jacket by Conor Hughes and Fin Cramb, that collects all four of our over-sized issues and includes an ALL-NEW BACK UP STORY that reveals a bit of White Ash's hidden history.  You can select this in one of our bundled tiers or grab a copy as an add-on post-campaign.\nAnd for those looking for the ultimate \"The Game\" collectable, get a pair of custom carved, The Game branded wooden dice and draw-string dice bag.\n\nWant a piece of The Game or White Ash original art?\nConor Hughes will sketch you a 6x9 drawing of a character from The Game or White Ash. Choose from The Game's Eli, Kimberly, Iris or any of White Ash's extensive cast of characters.\n\nReally play The Game and have your likeness drawn into the book. \nUnder Conor's careful eye, a background character will be designed to look like you. \n(NOTE: These are probably not speaking roles, just cameos. But every now and then, if we find the right person, we'll make you an actual character in the comic. So be forewarned...)\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRECH GOAL #1,  How To Assemble The Game (UNLOCKED).\nEvery backer will receive a behind the scenes PDF.  This PDF will included concept sketches, process breakdowns showing the pages from thumbnails to finished colors, the script and more.\nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - An Eye on Iris. \nIf we can reach $14,000 we'll be giving a textured 6x9 print of Jen St-Onge's amazing variant cover to all of our backers.  \n$17,00 (to be revealed when the preceding goal is unlocked)\n$20,000 (to be revealed when the preceding goal is unlocked) \nWe know what it's like to open up a package and find a mangled Kickstarter comic inside. We pack our books with care that we used in making the book and the love that we have for our backers. \nEach comic is bagged, boarded front and back and sent in stay-flat packaging. Made in White Ash means everything from the content, to the mailer we use, meets our standards of quality.  \nAdd-Ons will be handled post campaign by our friends at Backerkit.  If you want an extra copy of the comic/ want to add a White Ash hardcover or some of our swag from previous campaigns (Trading cards, post cards, prints, etc.) you will be able to select add those items for purchase after you confirm your shipping information.  If you have a specific question about an add-on, please don't hesitate to directly message us. \nAnd who's us?\nMeet the team.\nCharlie Stickney is a writer/producer residing in Los Angeles who's been fortunate enough to work for companies including: Sony Pictures, Revolution Studios, Universal Pictures, Hulu and Scholastic Productions.

And were it not for a job offer in LA, the plan after graduation was to move to New York to write comic books.

Previous to that he was one of the winners of the Millarworld art contest as well as being published in the Anthology Graphic Canon and Twisted Savage Dragon Funnies. \nYou can troll him on twitch at twitch.tv/conorhughes where he can often be found making comics as well as Hopewell NJ, with his amazing wife and giggle monster baby girl. \nTriona Farrell is a colourist from Dublin, Ireland. After coming out of college with a Masters in Visual Critical Theory, she began working as a colourist and has since exploded onto the nerd scene. She has worked for many companies such as MARVEL, IMAGE, DARKHORSE, DYNAMITE and VAULT as a colourist. Notable works of her include WEST COAST AVENGERS, CROWDED and TERMINATOR. She loves her cat and nerding out over everything.\n\nBREAK KICKSTARTER!\nYou made it to the bottom of the page!  Congratulation, you've passed the first challenge. Hopefully it was easy, but it's going to get a little tricker from here on out.  \nWe need you to tweet out this campaign.  And when you do, tag either @CharlesStickney or @conorhughes on twitter. \nIf you do that, we will reply to your tweet with a clue. Throughout the campaign, we will have more instructions on how to play our game.  Collect all the clues, solve the puzzle, and you will have an exclusive GAME WINNER reward added to your package when it arrives.  (If you're a digital only backer of the campaign, we'll have a digital version for you).\nSo good luck and may the best players win.

A good read full of passion and craft.\" -- Mark Waid (about Vol. 1)\n\nWHO WOULDN'T PUNCH A NAZI ... AGAIN?\nEverybody knows who the Nazis are. More so, if you saw a Nazi, you would want to punch that Nazi right across his face. ALWAYS PUNCH NAZIS is the next best thing to actually punching a Nazi.\nThis 66-page anthology addresses the Nazi-like racism that has been growing in America. The creators of Always Punch Nazis focus on the rising issues in America and how to handle bigots who want to oppress the country's citizens. This satirical anthology tells stories inspired by an evil that, although defeated during WWII, continues to fester today. You will learn lots of effective ways to deal with a Nazi, what happens when super-heroes fight for what they believe, how a certain comic book creator handled the Nazis when they knocked on his door (which you can preview below), and many more fun tales about standing up for what is right.\n\nAlways Punch Nazis Volume 2 Cover by Chuck Wojtkiewicz\n\nWHY DID WE RETURN?\nThe first volume of Always Punch Nazis garnered an incredible amount of attention. Word spread about Pilot Studios' mission to share stories and inspire people to battle against racism. Creators from various mediums approached the studio about contributing to the cause. That was the moment the creators realized we needed to continue producing Always Punch Nazis. Thus, Volume Two was born. \n\n\"What's Better Than Punching a Nazi?\" story included in APN Volume 2\n\nOUR MISSION \nThese anthologies are not about earning money. They are about spreading the word and educating people about racism, which continues to grow in our country. With a small goal, Pilot Studios can guarantee that you will receive the anthology that you so eagerly support. That bodes the question ...\nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? \nEvery Always Punch Nazis creator donated his or her time and talent to this book in exchange for copies of the book. The reward tiers are priced to cover the cost of printing and shipping the books, both to backers as well as over thirty contributors. The price also covers the Kickstarter fees. Any extra money raised will go to the production of Always Punch Nazis Volume 3. \nCREATORS \nCover Art and Colors by Chuck Wojtkiewicz\nBack Cover Art by Hilary Barta and Colors by Jim Nelson\nFront Cover/Back Cover/IFC Design by Chas Pangburn!\nAPN Logo by Kenneth Matthew\nCreated by Silas Dixon and Ben Ferrari\nEditor in Chief: Ben Ferrari\nWRITERS\nMatt Miner\nMike Luoma\nKurt Belcher\nRonald Bryce\nJose Sender\nWill Allred\nRobert Wolinsky\nMark Badger\nSam Noir\nKyle J.

Once the Kickstarter is complete, we will place the order. From there, it's in the printer's hands. \n\nUnfortunately, there is always a little risk. Since the funding is mainly going to the printing costs of the book, there may be a slight delay due to certain uncontrollable circumstances from the printer. Ben will keep you updated on the this once the campaign ends. This will allow you to know exactly where the books are and when orders ship from Pilot Studios to you.\n\nSometimes books can be damaged in transit to your house. This is another uncontrollable risk that we at Pilot Studios do our best to eliminate. In the event that your book arrives damaged, we will happily send you a brand new copy.\n\nThat's it.

The intention is to pay tribute to the cult genre movies of the eighties both from the graphics and scripting standpoints. Through the pages, clear references to the aesthetics and narrative work of John Carpenter, David  Cronenberg, Andrzej Zulawski, and Stanley Kubrick are found. \nThe Gatherer is targeted at a young adult audience (18-45 years old) who loves horror and science fiction, mostly horror and sci-fi films from the late seventies and the eighties. Some films which clearly define the comic\u2019s style are Prince of Darkness (Carpenter, 1987), The Thing (Carpenter, 1982), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (Kaufman, 1978), Possession (Zulawski, 1981), The Fly (Cronenberg, 1986), Scanners (Cronenberg, 1981) and The Lords of Salem (Zombie, 2012). \nPreview!\nSTORY: Emilia Pedrazzoli & Emiliano Pinto\nThe Firstborns, Official selection Festival Sitges 2016.\nWatch their short film here! \nART: Sebasti\u00e1n Cabrol \nHungry Ghosts #3, Dark Horse (2018) \nFalcon #6, Marvel Comics (2017)\nCaliban, Avatar Press (2015). \nCOLOR & LETTERING: Omar Est\u00e9vez\nDeath Of Love, Image Comics (2018)\nLil Charlie, John Bivens, Heavy Metal Magazine #284\nMythopia, Grant Morrison, Heavy Metal Magazine #285     \nOur payment processor!\nBased  on past experience and our research with some of Kickstarters top  campaign creators, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter  concludes based on what the exact cost will be to ship your tier.

That would make every single day the worst mass shooting in the US in modern times\u2014by 38 people. To put that into another perspective, as of June 10th the Washington Post has counted 1165 people killed in mass shootings in the US since 1966. So between suicides, accidents, crime, law enforcement, and other causes, there are more people killed with guns in two weeks in the US than in all the mass shootings over the last fifty years combined.\u201d\n\u201cConsistently, over 90% of Americans believe in common sense gun laws such as background checks,\u201d Wright said. \u201cBut the gun lobby, the NRA, and Mitch McConnell have kept them from passing. Mitch McConnell hasn\u2019t allowed a vote in the Senate on gun control since 2015. That\u2019s over 140,000 people who have died by gunfire in the U.S. under McConnell\u2019s watch. That\u2019s the equivalent of the entire population of Dayton, Ohio.\u201d\n\"Notes from the Other Side\" sample by Trina Robbins, Anne Timmons, and crank!\nActing as a companion to volumes that have raised money for victim funds, SHOTS FIRED focuses on the prevalence of gun violence in everyday life in the United States and supports advocacy groups working with communities to reduce gun violence, seek criminal justice reform, and enact common-sense regulations.  With these goals in mind, Comicker Press has partnered with the Community Justice Reform Coalition, a community-based coalition that sponsors intervention programs to prevent violence in communities of color, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a data-driven advocacy group focused on passing legislation at the state level.   \n\"Dung Control\" sample by Roger Langridge\n\"It\u2019s truly an epidemic facing this nation, and it especially and disproportionately impacts communities of color,\" said Amber Goodwin, Executive Director of CJRC. \u201cOnce again, we want to thank everyone for their support to make gun violence rare and abnormal,\u201d said Chelsea White, Director of Development and Events at CSGV.\nWe are using backerkit and comiXology for our physical and digital fulfillment. \n\nADD-ONS:\nHow do you add an Add-On?

For international shipping, costs have risen exponentially to the point that we can't offer to include it as part of the campaign.  If you're outside the US, your best option is to use a domestic/international shipping service like Shipito - we haven't used them ourselves, so we can't vouch for them.\nCOST BREAKDOWN\nSince all proceeds after the books are printed are going to charity, we've built in a slightly larger contingency than we normally would, to cover any unexpected expenses.  If unused, this contingency will be used to print more books.\nABOUT THE ORGANIZATIONS\nCSGV \nThe Coalition Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) develops and advocates for evidence-based solutions to reduce gun injury and death in all its forms. Our role is to formulate bold new ideas, assume the risks of innovation, and lead by example so that other groups can learn from and adopt our successful tactics. In recent years, we have: \nOrganized more than 20 of the nation\u2019s leading mental health and public health professionals to make evidence-based recommendations to address the difficult issue of guns and mental health. In December 2013, under the name \u201cConsortium for Risk-Based Firearm Policy,\u201d this group of experts issued detailed policy recommendations for both state and federal lawmakers. The Consortium has met four times and will meet for a fifth time in 2019. \nIn 2014, with CSGV\u2019s assistance, California legislators passed one of the Consortium\u2019s recommendations, the Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO) policy. Since then, CSGV has led the implementation process for the GVRO, which went into effect on January 1, 2016. To this end, we worked with the California Judicial Council to develop the forms and processes necessary to initiate a GVRO, held a press conference about the GVRO\u2019s implementation, hosted a pro bono attorney training in California, and launched a campaign to inform the public about how to access a GVRO. \nWorked with stakeholders and advocates in 11 states and the District of Columbia to pass Extreme Risk Laws, which are modeled after the GVRO. \nCreated fact sheets, presentations, and other materials to make Extreme Risk Law policy recommendations accessible to the general public. These materials helped us educate and activate a network of stakeholders and grassroots supporters to advocate for innovative policies. \nCJRC \nThe Community Justice Reform Coalition, a collective action fund of Tides Foundation, addresses the intersection of gun violence prevention and criminal justice reform in urban communities of color. \nCOMICKER LLC\nComicker LLC was founded by Saori Adams and Sean E. Williams, and launched in 2015 with its Comicker Digital imprint. Comicker LLC is designed to bring diverse creator-owned comics series to readers any way they want them (as ad-supported webcomics, collected as digital issues, and in print as trade paperbacks), and to give creators the flexibility to tell their stories exactly how they want to.

On this fateful mission, Eagle finds himself at the mercy of enemies in the field and callous and careless superiors at home. \nAfter the mission goes spectacularly wrong, we see the greedy and power-hungry Senator that caused the devastating failure face a horrifying attack on US soil. An act of revenge? But by whom?\nCover by Danny Flores and Moose Baumann\nAcceptable Losses tells a dark, poignant and action-packed superhero revenge fantasy, focusing on grim action and looking at the cycle of violence in the war on terror and those fighting it on both sides. Think Black Hawk Down meets Captain America, with a touch of John Wick meets Eye in the Sky. \nAbout the Cast\nThe US Eagle a.k.a. Corporal Sam Tyler is a good soldier. Always following orders, he believes in what the ideals of America mean and that they have a duty to help the rest of the world. Being the only subject of the US's controversial human augmentation program, Tyler gained enhanced strength, speed and stamina from the process, and became a symbol of America's might in the world.  \nUS Eagle Pin-Up by Carlos Pedro\n Private Deshawn Krinsky is the US Eagle's eyes in the sky and handler from home base. A young but incredibly bright officer, Private Krinsky has become an indispensable aid to US Eagle and his missions for their country. Idealistic and loyal, Krinsky has become a good friend to the US Eagle as well as his ally. \nKinsky Character Sketches by Danny Flores\nSenator Robert McKeen is a man in his mid-50s who has never seen a single day of active duty in his life. And yet he has found himself the political liaison to the US Eagle Program. A life-long politician and spokesman, there has rarely been a motion he couldn't schmooze and massage it's way through obstacles. A man of words and who values others opinions of him and the image of power above all else, McKeen can be quite brutal in his single-minded focus on his goals. \nMcKeen & Forley Character Sketches by Danny Flores\nGeneral Michael Forley has been working ops all his adult life. A proud, gruff military man to the bone, Forley is in charge of the US Eagle Program and is a no-nonsense leader. A stickler of protocol and chain of command, Forley nevertheless holds his own strong opinions on the missions they run.\nAbout the Campaign\nWe're looking to run a simple, straight-forward campaign with the majority of funds raised going to pay the production team for art, colours and letters, thus keeping costs down by being a digital first comic. The last time we tried this campaign we didn't get to the amount needed for a full print release but would have raised enough for digital. We still really want to tell and share this story, so we're focusing on a digital comic release to keep required costs down. \nHowever, should we far exceed the goal amount by a margin that would allow for a print release too, we would love to do that as well. \nFor now, however, the main focus is getting this book made and produced. Almost all the campaign total goes straight to the art team, with a margin kept for posting items that require postage too. \nAbout the Creators\nJoe Glass is the writer of Acceptable Losses. The creator and writer of The Pride and The Pride Adventures, that has been part of numerous very successful Kickstarters. This is Joe's first solo written, self-published comic that is not connected to The Pride and shows a whole new side of his writing. \nDanny Flores is an up-and-coming illustrator in the field of comics. Having only illustrated a few short stories here and there, this will be his first book published. He hopes to one day enjoy illustrating comics as a full time job. \nInterior page by Danny Flores and Moose Baumann\nMoose Baumann is a colourist who has worked on a large number of titles, including DC's Green Lantern, Seven Soldiers of Victory, and Nightwing, and many more. \nMichael Stock is a letterer and long-time collaborator with Joe Glass. Michael has lettered numerous comics across the UK independent scene including The Pride, The Kill Screen, Samurai Slasher and much more. \n Why Acceptable Losses? \nThere's a reason I want to make Acceptable Losses. \nFor me, it's about showing what I can do outside of The Pride. The Pride is an incredibly well received series, and I could not be prouder of it, but it is very much just one of the stories I have in me. Acceptable Losses is a chance for me to show off something completely different and even unexpected from me, that I think can be enjoyed both by fans of my existing work and also by people who've never read anything by me before. It was also a chance to work with the amazing Danny Flores and Moose Baumann, and my long-time collaborator Michael Stock once again.\nFor Danny, this is his first full comic to get produced, so it will be a great chance to show off his work too. I'm very excited for people to see what we can put together. \nFinally, it's a story about the consequences of our actions, as much in our world as in this fictional one. It's a story about where exactly an 'eye for an eye' gets us, and how rushing in headlong to get the job done without thinking through all of the angles can result in disaster. It's about seeing the shades of grey in even the most black and white of situations, and our responsibility for whatever we decide to do with that information.\nBut most of all, Acceptable Losses is about an entertaining, superhero revenge thriller with depth.\nInteriors by Danny Flores\n About The Project\nSince the last time we ran the campaign, work has continued slowly, while we decided when to re-approach this. The pages are almost all drawn, colours have begun too. With the backing financially that Kickstarter can provide, we'd be able to put full focus on the issue and get it finished and out quickly. We have allowed time in shipping estimates in case anything comes up, but generally should be able to turn the book around quickly. \nWe're all very excited and proud of this project, so really look forward to bringing it out to you all. With your support we can make this happen, so thank you so much in advance for your help. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGenerally, delivery dates are an estimate as sometimes work takes longer to complete, however we will endeavour to stick to the planned completion and delivery dates.\n\nAs ultimately we're shipping any physical items ourselves, please bare that in mind as items that require shipping might be later than estimated depending how many backers we wind up having to ship to. As such, making sure the address you provide after the campaign ends is valid for a while after the campaign is important.\n\nPostage tends to often be the major trip up in Kickstarter campaigns, and it has certainly caught me out before. As such, we are focusing on making this a digital release first. If the campaign proves very successful, we could possibly add a print component, but to begin with and to ensure we can finish making the comic and sharing this story with you all, we're focusing on digital and keeping costs down.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Thanks!", "descp": "Back at this amount for our unending thanks for your support!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2019"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a33 or more", "title": "Digital Copy", "descp": "At this level you get a digital copy of the action-packed one shot comic, Acceptable Losses\nINCLUDES:\nAcceptable Losses Digital Comic", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2019"}], "stat": ["104 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Second Printing!", "descp": "We are now able to offer a full print run!

An avid \u2026 who loves video games, David has somehow found himself living in bear and cougar country in the backwoods of western Montana.\nAIDING AND ABETTING THESE TWO: \nTony Avina\u2014 an American comic book colorist. Born and raised in the South Bay area of Los Angeles, he began his career working for Wildstorm Production in 2001. Since then he\u2019s worked for DC Comics, Marvel, Image, Dark Horse and Dynamite Entertainment. Some of his notable projects are The Boys, Happy, Sleeper, Richard Dragon, Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay and Batman \u201866 Meets the Green Hornet.\nALSO: The crafty COMICRAFT gang on letters.  \nNo, the book is not done.\nThe first chapter/issue is totally complete. The second chapter/issue only has letters, colors and some inks left to finish. There are still three more chapters/issues to produce.\nWith your support, David and I are confident we can finish that over the next handful of months.\nBut to make the wait a little easier, we do have some lovely Reward Levels to offer you\u2026\nYOU GIVE. WE GIVE BACK. ONLY FAIR.\nI will hand-deliver these to any shop within *REASONABLE* driving distance of Portland, Oregon. So for those lucky ducks: NO POSTAGE!\nNOTE: Both books will be shipped together, once IMPOSSIBLE JONES: GRIN & GRITTY has been printed.\nNOTE: All three books will be shipped together, once IMPOSSIBLE JONES: GRIN & GRITTY and SECTION ZERO 1959 have been printed.\n\nYOU IN THE SPOTLIGHT!\nAWESOME ART OPPORTUNITIES!\n\nHere's where things get fun(ner). Stretch Goals will alternate between something that makes the book better\u2014 spot gloss on cover, full color endsheets, etc.\u2014 and something for everyone who has pledged at THE GOODS\u2014 BUT BETTER! level or above\u2014 trading cards, stickers, cloisonne pins, etc.\nSo the more money raised, the more cool stuff you get\u2014 at no extra cost to you! (As long as you've pledged at THE GOODS\u2014 BUT BETTER! level or above.)\nIt is impossible to show how much coolness spot gloss adds to a book's cover. For an Ultra-Cool Collector's Edition, it's a gotta-have.\nGiven Imp's uncanny ability to alter her appearance, Paper Dolls are a natural! Not only will she have different outfits (since she can shape-shift her uniform, too) but different arms, extra arms, etc. A quick and easy way to explain Imp's powers to people you meet at cocktail parties.\n$50,000 STRETCH GOAL instantly added to everyone pledging at or above THE GOODS\u2013 BUT BETTER! level.\n$51,000 STRETCH GOAL instantly added to everyone pledging at or above THE GOODS\u2013 BUT BETTER! level.\n$52,000 STRETCH GOAL instantly added to everyone pledging at or above THE GOODS\u2013 BUT BETTER! level.\nNOTE: Until actually unlocked, all Stretch Goals may be changed or modified as new, cooler ideas come to me!\nIf you followed my SECTION ZERO campaigns, you know I vowed to get a tattoo to commemorate every successful Kickstarter I run. I stand by that vow! I now have two SECTION ZERO tatts, and would love\u2014 LOVE!\u2014 to add one for IMPOSSIBLE JONES.\nOnly YOU can make that possible. Only YOU can get me to decorate (or desecrate, depending on your view) my body\u2014 by getting IMPOSSIBLE JONES funded! Whatever ends up on my arm (or leg) is in your hands! (So to speak.)\nFirst: DON'T PANIC!\nApproximate postage costs will be:\nUNITED STATES: $8\nCANADA: $15\nTHE REST OF THE WORLD: $25\nFingers crossed, those numbers won't change much.\nPostage will be charged after the campaign ends, when the survey goes out and we know exactly how much it will cost.\nThis way we don't end up with an under-estimated postal bill that cripples us, and you don't end up with an over-inflated postage charge based on assumptions and guesses.\nOur surveys will be handled by BACKERKIT, who has done this many, many times before. The process is simple, safe, and painless. You will be glad we're doing it this way. Trust us.\nTruly and sincerely, I am constantly amazed and humbled by the power of people like you to make, well, the impossible possible. Making comics\u2014 and specifically making creator-owned comics like IMPOSSIBLE JONES\u2014 is what I want to do most in the world, but I can't do it without you. It doesn't even exist without you, without your support and belief.

About loss. All Shea and Sean have is each other...until they don't even have that.\nCover Art by Ben Bishop\nWRETCHES - Volume 1 is a sci-fi graphic novel perfect for fans of movies like The Fifth Element & Blade Runner, and shows like Battlestar Galactica & Firefly. At over 150 pages (140 of which are story), readers will get thrown into an action-packed universe filled with beautifully drawn pages and cutthroat characters. In addition to the six-issue tale, backers get to see cover art, pin-ups, script excerpts, and all sorts of other behind-the-scenes content.\nI started writing WRETCHES back in 2015. The story and it's characters truly grew with me as a creator these past few years, and thanks to all of YOU, I'm excited to finally be able to put the full story out into the universe! \n (Click the picture below to ENTER THE IMAGE in 3D on Facebook)\nLine Art by Salo Farias. Colors by Ander Zarate.\n SHEA & SEAN \nOn the rough streets of an alien planet, far from the one they'd called home, Shea and Sean were forced to grow up with nothing but each other. Forever outrunning the horrors of their past, they survive the only way they know how: by hunting and killing robots for profit!  \nLine Art by Salo Farias. Colors by Ander Zarate\nWhen they were just children they watched the war between humans and robots destroy their planet and kill their mother and father.\nInterior Art from Issue 3\nNow, when Sean is kidnapped by the enemy, Shea has no choice but to tear the entire galaxy apart to find him!\nLine Art by Salo Farias. Colors by Ander Zarate.\nTHE BOTS\nThe goal of the robots now is simply survival. After fleeing their home, other planets looked at them as lesser life forms. They were given no aid and left without the resources needed to survive, effectively giving them a death sentence! \nInterior Art from Issue 3\nNow, on the verge of finding a cure to their newfound mortality, some want to bring peace to their kind. While others threaten to rebuild and destroy those who turned their backs on them!\nInterior art from Issue 3\nHere's a preview of Wretches - Issue 1.\nSince writing issues 1 and 2 several years ago, I've grown as a writer. I took my red pen and did a rewrite to much of them to sharpen things up and give readers a more fleshed out look at the world and it's characters. Below is the opening scene from issue 1, re-written and lettered by the series' new letterer, Chas! Pangburn.\nIn the never-ending hustle these past years to promote and get Wretches out into the world, we were able to get Issue 1 published in serialized form in China! This was very cool news when it first happened and it's still a great feeling to see your work translated in another language, and published in another country.\n \u2022Every backer of a physical reward will receive this special, Kickstarter-exclusive print.\nKickstarter Exclusive Print\nNew LIMITED Reward added - only 18 left.\n Click the image for a better look at the prints and their numbered, signed bottom portions.\n(CLICK HERE FOR MORE DETAILS ON THE BELOW REWARD AND THE STORY BEHIND US 'GIVING BACK WITH THE 4TH MONKEY')\nJames E.

Action Lab: Danger Zone)\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nFor myself, like so many other creators, Kickstarter has been instrumental towards helping our projects see the light of day. Our work and social media posts caught the eyes of the folks at Scout Comics, who will begin publishing the individual issues in the direct market, hopefully by the end of the year.  Our goal is to put together this Kickstarter Exclusive trade, do a one-time print run, and load it with as much content as we can!\nI've already invested thousands of dollars into completing much of the artwork from Issues 3 to 6 (this way the book is completed and into your hands sooner), and the funds raised here on Kickstarter will go towards completing the artwork, coloring & lettering on the remaining pages, as well as funding the print run, shipping & packaging.\nFunds raised above and beyond our goal will go into stretch goals for our backers as well as be invested back into the series.\n\nOn behalf of the entire creative team, thank you so much for checking out our Kickstarter!\n- James", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks when publishing comics and fulfilling backer rewards, as there are multiple parties involved and unforeseen issues cop pop up at any waking moment! As long as we stay on schedule and the printer fulfills their parts without any hiccups (knock on wood) you WILL get this book in a timely fashion once the campaign succeeds.\n\nThis is my fifth campaign, and I have delivered on every single successful one thus far.

He and M.A.Y.O. helped the Yaquis and the community around them stop the City of Tucson from displacing the native people from their land, and help establish their tribal recognition with the help of Congressman Morris K. Udall. I worked with J. Gonzo, Claire Napier, and Bernardo Brice to help make this possible. I couldn't have done it without them.\nThe support was overwhelming. We received help from all over the world. It was a gratifying experience and the question on everyone's minds after reading the last page was \"what happens next?\" We're back to publish the second chapter of La Voz De M.A.Y.O. This will be a full color, 32-page comic book. \nThe official story\n La Voz De M.A.Y.O. is the true story of Ramon Jaurigue, an orphan and WWII veteran who co-founded the Mexican, American, Yaqui, and Others (M.A.Y.O.) organization, which successfully lobbied the Tucson City Council to improve living and working conditions for members of the local Pascua Yaqui tribe. Largely due to Ramon\u2019s activism, both in M.A.Y.O. in and with Model Cities Program, Yaqui were successfully integrated into the expanding metropolis of Tucson: families bought property, roads and sidewalks were built, and sewage systems installed. Ramon and his colleagues even founded a night school to help adults learn English and established the region\u2019s first low-cost clinic to offer birth control. \nUtilizing newspaper clippings, interviews with surviving MAYO members, and Ramon\u2019s authored articles, La Voz De M.A.Y.O. dramatizes the remarkable life and achievements of my great-grandfather\u2014and in so doing, tells the story not just of a single man, but of a family, a tribe, a nation.\nPreview\nLa Voz De MAYO #2, Page 1 (Barajas, Gonzo, Brice, Napier)\nLa Voz De MAYO #2, Page 2 (Barajas, Gonzo, Brice, Napier) *Not Final\nLa Voz De MAYO #2, Page 3 (Barajas, Gonzo, Brice, Napier) *Not Final\nLa Voz De MAYO #2, Page 4 (Barajas, Gonzo, Brice, Napier)\nLa Voz De MAYO #2, Page 5 (Barajas, Gonzo, Brice, Napier) *Not Final\nREWARDS\nSTRETCH GOALS \nThe Team\nGoal Breakdown ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLa Voz De MAYO is not only about my family's history, but, this is the history of a tribe of people and my hometown: Tucson, AZ.

Along with our friends Gabriel Mayorga and Lea Jean Badelles, we are artists who love to tell fun stories that inspire the imaginations of young and old alike.  Adam has been working as an illustrator and professional comic book creator for more than 20 years and this is Makana\u2019s 2nd book. \nAdam and Makana are the creators, writers and co-artists of PUNK TACO.\nWHO IS PUNK TACO?\nPunk Taco is a lovable sentient taco who rocks out across the universe with his band of misfits, fighting evil and helping those in need. Punk Taco believes in peace and love but has no tolerance for bullies and tyrants, so when he sees an injustice, he can't resist helping and joining in the fight. \nHe loves his friends and considers them family, and will do anything for them. His empathy and compassion for others and his willingness to sacrifice himself to help the downtrodden is legendary.\n Check out the official PUNK TACO Theme song. Written and Produced by Adam Wallenta and ICBM. Performed by ILLUS and RoXXXteady. Wouldn't PUNK TACO make a great animated series? \nPLAY\n\nVOLUME 2: THE STORY\nPunk Taco and the band were on their way to a gig when we last saw them in the Volume 1 Epilogue, when a giant hand reached through a mysterious portal and whisked them away. Volume 2 picks up immediately after that and thrusts our hero and his friends into a dangerous new adventure to save a planet endangered by a greedy syndicate that is mining not just the resources, but also the very life essence of the planet itself. Punk Taco must join forces with a coalition of tribes to prevent an environmental disaster, but the problem is, they are the size of ants compared to the giant that threatens their planet. What\u2019s a taco to do? \nTHE MISSION\nPunk Taco Volume 2 is a continuation of Volume 1, and picks up where we left off in the epilogue. The book is penciled and we are inking and coloring each page now. \nWe need to raise a minimum of $5,000.00 to print the book. This will cover the cost of printing an \"8.5x12\" hardcover with spot varnish and full-color interior pages, as well as shipping costs. We have a lot of great Stretch Goals including bonus stories, sticker sheets, coloring books and even PUNK TACO Volume 3! So let's get this funded on day 1 and make PUNK TACO a huge success!\nInternational customers - The cost of shipping PUNK TACO Volume 1 from the previous campaign cost me between $28-$40 for a single book. I apologize for the high cost of shipping but it is not something I control. When I originally shipped Volume 1, I had to come out of pocket for a lot of the cost. Because of these high shipping costs I will be including some extra rewards exclusive for international customers including original sketches in each book.\nTHE ART\nCheck out these sample pages of PUNK TACO Volume 2! \nAlien Tacos! Robots! Monsters! Cute Cuddly Furry Friends and one punk rocking band! PUNK TACO has it all!\nPUNK TACO is all about making new friends.\nPUNK TACO and the Band are about to go on a great big adventure with their new friend.\nWith new friends come new mysteries.\nPUNK TACO and the Band aren't the only ones making new friends.\nThe Dance of the Evocajas!\nREWARDS\nWe have a lot of great rewards including stickers, bookmarks, enamel pins, buttons, magnets, T-Shirts and original art.

It harkens back to the adventurous cartoons of the 90s, updated with frenetic energy and a few knowing winks sent toward adult readers, without losing its warm-hearted nature.\u201d\n- Pat Shand \nWriter of Afterglow, Destiny NY, Spooky Girls\n\u201cPunk Taco is childlike fun at its best! Full of tacos, nachos, aliens and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll!\u201d\n- Franco\nEisner and Harvey Award-Winning Writer/Artist of Tiny Titans, Itty Bitty Hellboy, Superman Family Adventures\n\u201cPunk Taco is like the dream you\u2019d have after passing out from a great Mexican feast while bumping 90\u2019s Hip-Hop through your headphones. Its psychedelic weirdness and social activism could only come from the combined minds of a kid and his dad, cracking up at a joke and then turning it into an entire galaxy. From radio station WKRS to the junk food villain\u2019s plan to \u201cMake the Galaxy Great Again,\u201d its hidden gems sparkle bright. Throughout all the juvenile, hyper-colored fun, you can dig the central theme that love, art and being cool to one another make up the infinite power that runs this mothership we all happen to be traveling on, and that greed, selfishness and fear are all headed for self-destruction. Long live Punk Taco and his secret nachos!!!\u201d\n- Secret Agent 23 Skidoo \nGrammy Award-Winning Hip-Hop Artist for Best Children\u2019s Album and Author of Weirdo Calhoun and the Odd Men Out \n\u201cPunk Taco is a fun, intergalactic action-adventure story full of the kind of love and optimism you\u2019ll definitely want to upload into the brain of any kid you care about.\u201d\n- Chris Giarrusso\nHarvey Award-Nominated Artist/Writer of G-Man, Mini Marvels, Encounter\n\u201cAdam and Makana Wallenta\u2019s Punk Taco is a lush, sumptuous spectacle for both adult and children\u2019s eyes, coupled with a crazy-fun story that wraps itself around important social issues... and nachos. It\u2019s delicious!\u201d\n- Mark McKenna\n2012 Inkwell Awards Hall of Fame. Writer, Penciller, Inker of Banana Tales, Combat Jacks, Batman\n\u201cTruth, justice and the quest for perfect nachos! Punk Taco is a fun-filled comic book burrito... an important tale of optimism wrapped in candy-colored art. Adam Wallenta created Punk Taco with his son, Makana. The result is a rockin\u2019 all-ages book that can be enjoyed by parents and kids alike. All that\u2019s missing is a side of guacamole!\n- Bill Walko\nWriter/Artist of The Hero Business\n\u201cAt the same time it\u2019s a kind of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure meets Axe Cop, Punk Taco is also a book that validates childrens\u2019 emotions in these turbulent times. It's okay to be upset and angry over the injustices of the world, and channeling those feelings into something active is a good way to manage them\u201d.\n- Kelly Sue DeConnick \n2014 Eisner-Award Nominated Writer of Pretty Deadly and Captain Marvel\n\u201cThis Taco goes Hard (shell)! Here\u2019s an intergalactic space adventure that feels foreign and familiar simultaneously. Punk Taco walks that same hero path I grew up admiring in my youth. With some incredibly beautiful colors, very unique character designs and an unpredictably building storyline, Punk Taco is an all-ages Sci-Fi comedy adventure that has a little something for everyone.\"\n- Marquee Mark,  Markellus Ragans\nHost of So Wizard Podcast\nJust a few photos of some of our many awesome PUNK TACO fans.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are no risks.

Katie has worked and volunteered in bike advocacy, literary administration, education, and tech. She has been running Books with Pictures full time since Free Comic Book Day 2016. She loves Bitch Planet and The Wicked and the Divine and Squirrel Girl and A-Force and Die and My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic and Hickman's Avengers and is built of enthusiasm and nurturance.\nThe other face you'll most often see at Books with Pictures is Nick Orr. Nick received his BFA in Illustration from the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan. After graduating he moved to LA and worked as a freelance graphic designer and artist. He spent his time fine-tuning his craft and figuring out how best to convey a story. Nick moved to Portland in 2007. After years working at Barnes & Noble, he joined Katie's team to open Books with Pictures in 2016, first part-time, and then full-time. In 2018, Nick completed the Helioscope Studio mentorship program for artists, and in 2019 will be an invited artist at the Lake Oswego Festival of the Arts. His print \"Take Me Away\" is one of our backer rewards. \nNicole Hawthorne is from Reno, Nevada, and moved to Portland for school and friendship. Currently she\u2019s working on establishing herself as a freelance artist, but for now she spends most of her days selling, reading, and talking about comics. She also works at an escape room guiding people through puzzles and making sure they don\u2019t break things. When she is not at either of her amazing jobs she\u2019s home with her spouse and two cats watching cartoons. Some of her favorite comics are Snotgirl, Crowded, and The Wicked + The Divine, and she could talk for hours on end about the web comics she reads.\nSeaerra Miller grew up in central Wyoming and moved to Portland to attend the Pacific Northwest College of Art and Design to study illustration. Since graduating in 2017 she has worked with with clients including Snapchat, Oni Press, and the City of Portland. She has also illustrated three books for Flying Eye and is currently working on a series of middle grade comics for them. When she\u2019s not reading, selling, or drawing comics she likes watching bad movies and listening to sad 80\u2019s music. Some of her favorite comics include Blue Monday, Giant Days, and Kiss Number 8.\n  Katie and the BwP Crew!\nThe building at 1401 SE Division St was built in 1927 to hold the Crucciola family's grocery store and butcher shop, with an outbuilding for keeping chickens just behind. Patriarch Antonio Crucciola passed away in 1946, but the neighborhood grocery carried on. By 1964, the building was in the hands of J.P. Wilder, who started advertising for shop workers and delivery personnel for his business, J.P. Wilder Company, repairing automobile brakes and clutches. The chicken coop became a machine shop, and the dirt lot was paved. The last ad for shop workers ran in 1968. By 1975 the building was tied to ads in the Oregonian for \"BOOKS BOOKS BOOKS.\" Since then--nearly half its life--this two-story wood-frame live-above retail shop has been a spot for literature.\n\n                             In 1976 the shop, Serendipity Corner Books, was purchased by Jean Bader and her friend and \u201csilent partner\u201d Frank Barst; it was already a \u201ccluttered old bookstore, then filled with empty soda bottles and sloppy stacks of musty books and magazines,\u201d Jean told the Oregonian. Serendipity sold used books, as well as both used and new comics, until 1986, when Jean moved to Lincoln City to manage a bookstore there.\n\n                             From 1985 to 1991, the shop was leased to Pegasus Books, the multi-branched comics chain that would eventually become Things From Another World. In 1991, Jon Hagen bought it and moved his decade-old store Longfellow\u2019s Books and Records there from its Moreland neighborhood location on SE Milwaukee. Longfellow\u2019s specialized in rare and antiquarian books, and also carried extensive runs of old magazines and rare folk records collected on Jon\u2019s scouting trips up and down the Oregon coast. For the past decade, Jon\u2019s son Nile had been helping him run the business, especially its online presence. In 2016, the Oregonian voted Longfellow\u2019s a \u201cuniquely Portland experience,\u201d and their \u201cfavorite bookstore.\u201d Jon died on Jan. 25 of last year, at the age of 80, and Nile put the building up for sale in the fall.\n\n                             Katie first spoke with Nile about buying it on November 6, Election Day: \u201cWhen Nile told me he was selling the building, I thought, \u2018there is no possible way I can do that.\u2019 And then I rushed home and called a bunch of people to figure out how to do it.\u201d She wound up forming the limited liability corporation Building for Books LLC, and bringing together about twenty friends and supporters to help make the purchase. Her plans for the space include not just a bigger, better Books with Pictures, but also a record store in the basement and a food cart pod in the parking lot.

However, as Abby\u2019s bloodlust leads her back to those responsible for her death, she begins to piece together the truth about how she died and how she lived.\n LITTLE GIRL is a ghost story from the ghost's point of view.\nHey Kickstarter community! PAT SHAND here. I'm back with my 11th Kickstarter, and this time, I'm teaming up with artist OLIVIA PELAEZ and publisher DEVIL'S DUE COMICS to bring you the graphic novel collection of our horror comic, LITTLE GIRL. We previously published it as a series of four single issues, and now we are here to raise the funds to print it as a paperback! It totals out to 88 pages of full-color comics, and it's ready to be printed!\nWe can only make this book happen here, with you! \nThis is also a personal tale for both me and Olivia. I've always been terrified of ghosts, since childhood -- and that fear was tripled when the ghost in question was a child. From The Ring to The Grudge to all manner of horror movies, I found myself so terrified by the idea of small, cold hands grasping at my throat... that I knew I had to explore that fear with a story.\nOur story is as terrifying as any of the previously mentioned tales, but we've added an emotional core to the traditional haunting narrative to explore death, loss, life, religion, the power of love, and the irresistible lure of vengeance. We've created something both cathartic and horrifying to appeal to classic horror fans, as well as those looking for a fresh new twist on the genre.\nNow... enough talking. Take a look at some more of Olivia's beautiful art.\nThis campaign also offers by far the most stunning original art I've ever been able to offer. I didn't even know this until recently because in my 8 years of working in comics with over 300 issues published... I have never seen an artist do this. Olivia traditionally drew AND colored the covers, and wants to offer them to you, our readers, through the Kickstarter!\nThe comic is completely DONE. It's written, drawn, colored by FRAN GAMBOA & JC RUIZ, and lettered by JIM CAMPBELL. We are ready to print it! Our delivery date is set in October just to protect ourselves if we have a printer or customs delay, but we fully expect to beat our delivery date by FAR. \nThis will also be shipping to comic shops by Devil's Due if we get funded, but all of the other rewards here are exclusive to THIS campaign. \nKeep reading to check out our other amazing rewards, including:\nthe graphic novel itself \noriginal hand-knit haunted penguin doll by Olivia Pelaez\nart cards\nbuttons, a signed bookplate, other books by me, and more... \nRead more about BREATHLESS here.\n Read more about SNAP FLASH HUSTLE here.\n Read more about PRISON WITCH, funded on Kickstarter, right here.\nWe also offer many items as add-ons, if you'd like to manually adjust your reward level! In addition to every individual item from the campaign, we're also offering EVERY BOOK I HAVE EVER FUNDED ON KICKSTARTER as well as some older favorites. \n Learn more about each of these books here:\n Destiny, NY Volume One,Two, and Three \nClonsters Volume One\nModern Dread\nPrison Witch\nAfterglow\nGangster Ass Barista\nSpooky Girls\nAs we hit our goals, we will reveal more of these!\nIf you have any questions or would like to add any of these items onto other pledge levels, please feel free to message me.

It looks like this:\nWatch for the first issue of HOPE on Free Comic Book Day!\nAs you can see above, in conjunction with Source Point Press, we're doing something pretty cool with HOPE by releasing the full first issue on Free Comic Book Day, which is a huge event that takes place at nearly every comic book store in the United States on the first Saturday of May.  Free Comic Book Day is EXACTLY what it sounds like: You go to a participating retailer (which is most of them) and you get FREE comics!\nThat's right, we're making the entire first issue HOPE Volume 1 FREE to comic fans just by heading to a comic shop on Saturday, May 4th while supplies last. It's not a preview and it's not a #0 issue.  It's the real, bonafide, actual issue #1, and if you like what you read you can then ask the shop to pre-order you the rest of the mini-series, which will then be available for pre-order monthly! We are honored to have this opportunity and look forward to the millions of people who attend Free Comic Book day discovering our work in HOPE for the first time.\nBut you're here now, though, and it's probably because you know that we, the creators, have cut our teeth in the world of Kickstarter. Maybe you're a fan of PLUME by K. Lynn Smith, or maybe you're a fan of NIGHTMARE WORLD and TALES OF MR. RHEE by Dirk Manning. If you're familiar with our previous Kickstarter launches you know we love Kickstarter, as it has allowed us to build our readership friend-by-friend and pledge-by-pledge via offering our Kickstarter supporters Kickstarter Exclusive versions of our work that are never again made available after the campaigns end...\nAnd that's exactly what we're doing here with this Kickstarter Exclusive Edition of HOPE Volume One: \"Mother\" from Source Point Press.\nThe book we're offering through this campaign gives backers the entire first mini-series (Issues #1-6) collected in one gorgeous Kickstarter Exclusive edition of HOPE Volume 1. Through this campaign, you can pre-order the entire first arc almost two months before we begin releasing the series in a monthly single-issue format! \nThe number of Kickstarter Exclusive upgrades this book receives (hardcover, wrap-around cover, UV spot gloss, extra pages of content, etc.) is completely dependent on how many Stretch Goals we unlock, so pledge accordingly and tell your friends about this campaign too! Remember, the more people back this campaign, the more everyone gets in Stretch Goal bonuses!\n(For those of you wondering, that's why we're not showing the cover yet... because, hey, the amount of support the book is going to get will determine how fancy the cover, for starters, will be!)\nJulie Lavelle enjoys a secret life moonlighting as an unregistered Ultra known as Hope\u2026 until a car accident with her husband and daughter changes everything in an instant.\nCo-created by K.

RHEE), HOPE offers readers a story in the superhero genre unlike any other, taking an unflinching and uncompromising look at parenting, heroism, the law, the media, and even womanhood through the lens of heroic fiction in a new six-issue mini-series published by Source Point Press.\nCombining powerful storytelling with dynamic art, HOPE offers readers a story of unrelenting emotional resonance and explosive action about a hero whose life is changed forever when her identity is exposed to the world at large, including both all those who adore her as well as those who would seek to do her and her family harm.\nCombining the gravitas of comic series such as SAGA with the instant accessibility of films such as THE INCREDIBLES, HOPE is a comic series that will feel both familiar yet fresh to anyone who reads it.\nHere's a peek at the first five pages:\nT SHIRT IMAGE!!!!

Series creator Ashley Victoria Robinson has had this tucked away as a passion project for a long time. It was always intended to by an Original Graphic Novel. However, this year, as Ashley enters the final stages of becoming an American Citizen, she decided to write a comic about a Canadian Superhero experiencing a similar journey.\nAshley has brought a team together to give life to the first chapter of AURORA & THE EAGLE in the hopes that you would want to invest in Aurora\u2019s story, her story, and their shared future. The funds raised by this Kickstarter campaign will go to cover the production costs of the issue and rewards.\n Meet AURORA & THE EAGLE #1 a 20 page YA comic book issue encompassing the first chapter of what will be a larger graphic novel written by Canadian-immigrant-to-America, Ashley Victoria Robinson. You\u2019ve probably seen Ashley on the internet, often speaking about her Canadian identity on shows like Collider Heroes, Movie Fights, Comic Boo NOW!, Geek History Lesson and Jawiin. This is her first solo-written comic book following 2015\u2019s Apollo IX #1 for Top Cow Productions. Prior she has co-written two graphic novels with her writing partner (and husband), Jason Inman, including: 2018\u2019s Jupiter Jet from Action Lab Entertainment and 2019\u2019s Science! through Bedside Press (also owned by a Canadian!).\nBoth Jupiter Jet and Science! came to life through the power of Kickstarter and more than doubled their original goals.\nShe is joined by fellow Canadian Emmanuelle Chateauneuf (Queen Street, Saint Anthony\u2019s School for Misplaced Children), former DC Comics letterer Carlos M. Mangual (Nightwing, Batman and Robin, Action Comics), and digital artist Sa Vu (a.k.a. Lightning Strikes). \n(If you want to know more about Ashley\u2019s previous comic work check out the Jupiter Jet IGN review!)\nWhat if you were the biggest superhero swimming in your small pond, until you suddenly got dropped in the ocean of the world\u2019s most elite heroes?\nAurora Borealis is Canada\u2019s best superhero. She harnesses the powers of the Northern Lights to do everything from taking out maple syrup thieves dressed in hockey gear to preserving Natural Resources and her nation\u2019s cultural identity from high-level political villains. Things are going swimmingly for her in the Great White North, until she is invited to become something more.\nThe Eagle (The United States\u2019 best superhero), shows up in Canada one day to recruit Aurora to The Unity League - which is only the greatest superhero team in the known universe. Each nation is represented on The Unity League and, like Aurora, their unique power sets reflect their respective national identity. Since the death of Canada\u2019s previous representative (Ed Fitzgerald, who possessed impressive water powers), there\u2019s been a power vacuum. The Eagle was placed in charge of training Fitzgerald\u2019s replacement. Who wouldn\u2019t want to go train under a big, strong, scary, American stranger, right?\nAurora\u2019s training is set to take place at The Eagle\u2019s home in the United States, which marks not only a change of scenery, but the very first time Aurora has ever left her home country. Her mentor isn\u2019t exactly the kindest, softest teacher and in a completely new locale Aurora is forced to define just what it means to her to be Canada\u2019s best superhero.\nWill Aurora come to a working balance with her identity, her powers, and her new partner? Probably. Is she worthy of replacing Ed Fitzergerald on The Unity League? Maybe. When she learns The Eagle is more fallible than he first appeared will they grow to a new understanding? You bet! It\u2019s not until Aurora is forced away from everything she has drawn strength from that she will truly come into her own.\nThis Kickstarter is about a comic book telling the story of a bright-eyed Canadian girl moving to America and growing into the woman she was destined to be. Aurora is going to have to do some serious leveling up if she wants to make it out of the book alive!\nAurora\u2019s story is an exploration of what it means to embrace dueling identities (girl and woman, civilian and superhero, Canadian and American), and the struggles that come along with such a monumental change of scenery at such a young age. Ashley was 20 when she first moved to the United States - she\u2019s not 20 anymore.\nChateauneuf was a happy addition to AURORA & THE EAGLE who joined the project after a round of enthusiastic emails. She brings dynamic and whimsical art to the page rending the story in ways Robinson could never have imagined. Mangual is a friend of Robinson\u2019s she has wanted to collaborate with for a long time who, fortunately, was able to step up to the plate and lend his expertise and precise workmanship when he was most needed.\nWant to know something awesome? AURORA & THE EAGLE #1 is already COMPLETE! That\u2019s right! The grey-scale art, the letters, the cover, and the formatting is 100% done. This means we are looking to fund rewards & shipping out to you. Since this book is 100% creator-owned, there\u2019s no publisher financing. We, the creators, are responsible for all costs involved in making this first installment of AURORA & THE EAGLE. Due to the unique nature of this Kickstarter, Ashley will not be taking a wage, but everyone else who has collaborated with her will be paid for their hard work.\nOur goal is to gauge audience interest in the full story of AURORA, THE EAGLE, ED FITZGERALD, and the rest of the international crew of THE UNITY LEAGUE. With this in mind, if you\u2019ve enjoyed any of Ashley\u2019s previous projects (Science!, Jupiter Jet, Terrific & Thief, Love is Love Anthology, Geek History Lesson, The Red Shirt Diaries), please support this unique step forward into creator-owned comic book creation. \nAURORA & THE EAGLE #1 will only come to life with your support, we have some fantastic rewards for you, AND REMEMBER: you\u2019re only charged if we make our funding goal. As of right now, there are no solid plans in place about where or when AURORA & THE EAGLE #1 will continue. This Kickstarter is the only way you get get this issue. Make sure to not miss out on Aurora\u2019s first flight!\nMoney earned will go to covering fees, production, postage, printing of the collection. All Kickstarter funds are to support our artist, letterer, cover artist and more! Any leftover money will be used to continue making the AURORA & THE EAGLE Graphic Novel ...maybe some back-ups by other creators? A variant cover? All money will go back into the book, period. \nLOOK, MORE ART!\n\nAURORA & THE EAGLE #1!

Datura is a sci-fi action adventure comic with a blend of the film Blade Runner and Tokyo Ghost (Image Comics). The world is inhabited by humans, aliens, and animal-human hybrids. \nMy name's Trevor Talbott (writer) and I co-created Datura with Diego Olortegui (pencils/inks) back in late 2015. I currently have three successful Kickstarters under my name for comics Child Number Four (one issue) and Eclipse (three issues). \nDiego Olortegui is currently working on Marvel's X-23. He's also provided pencils on What If? Spider-Man, Slapstick, Ms. Marvel, She-Hulk and Infinity Countdown: Captain Marvel and others.\nGab Contreras is the ever so talented colorist on the book and provides the logo and graphic design throughout the issue. She's also worked on the 2000 AD Sci-Fi Special 2018 (2000 AD), All We Ever Wanted: Stories of a Better World (A Wave Blue World Inc), A Princess of Mars (webcomic), and many others.\nThe letterer on the book is J Wright, who's the writer/artist for his creator owned series UnDead End and currently is providing the pencils on Cullen Bunn's new series titled Super Clean which was recently picked up as a TV series at The CW.\nDatura #1\nCurrently, Issue #1 of Datura is inked, colored, lettered - DONE!. This Kickstarter will assist with getting the book into as many hands as possible as well as printing and shipping costs. \nMost importantly, it'll provide the funds for the pencils/inks/colors/letters for Issue #2! \nSome of the rewards we're offering are digital and physical copies, sketches, and the opportunity to be drawn into issue #2 as a background character! Another cool reward will include an UnWrapped edition of Datura #1 which is an all penciled version with character designs in the back of the book! \nSketch Examples by Diego Olortegui\nDatura is a bounty hunter for her handler, Winema, who helped guide Datura and her sister, Dahlia, after the death of their father. The pulse of the story is the relationship between sisters. Dahlia insists on tagging along her big sisters jobs and helps out the best she can. This causes a huge rift between the two as Datura doesn't want her dangerous lifestyle to be Dahlia's too. She must come to grips with Dahlia becoming her own person and allowing her to make her own decisions without pushing her away completely. \nDatura and Dahlia interfere on a bounty and in turn become the target of rival hunter, Kerivoul, and his handler and mob boss, Mr. Behr. Datura must rely on her sister in order for both of them to survive the wrath of an enemy who can attack freely and within the laws because he has judges in his pocket who've built this newly developed criminal justice system.\nBehr & Kerivoul\nI started toying with the story of Datura in early 2015 and began posting to message boards late 2015 with the general concept and outline for Datura. I really wanted this to be a collaborative effort and didn't want to be too set in my way of thinking on how this story or the world of Datura could work. I also had no clue I'd be so lucky to have gotten a response from such a talented creator and artist such as Diego Olortegui. \nDiego was one of the first artists to reach out and I remember being totally blown away by his DeviantArt page. We exchanged some ideas for the main players and he went to work on a few concept designs. In my experience, when I've been provided with concept designs they're typically a lone body shot with the characters name scribbled somewhere on the page. Here's Diego's:\nDatura Character Design by Diego Olortegui\n Umm...yeah. My mind exploded when these started making their way into my inbox. It was at this moment I knew there wasn't any other artist or creator working on this book other than Diego. You can tell he loves what he does by how he provided multiple incarnations of the character and the all out presentation.\nDatura #1 : Pages 1 & 2\nDatura #1 : Pages 3 & 4\nThanks for your support and don't forget to follow the project and their creators on social media:\nTwitter:\n@DaturaComic\n@TrevorNTalbott\n@DiegoO8844\n@GabContrerasR\n@TheJWrightStuff\nFacebook:\nDatura\nTrevor Talbott\nDiego Olortegui\nGab Contreras\nJ Wright", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe production of Datura #2 could face some delays as co-creator and penciller/inker Diego Olortegui continues be offered gigs at Marvel Comics, but we are committed to our backers receiving their comics!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Datura #1 Digital", "descp": "Datura #1 (PDF) full color", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Datura #1 & 2 Digital", "descp": "Datura #1 & 2 (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}], "stat": ["54 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Digital Bundle", "descp": "This is a PDF bundle pack including every comic from Datura writer Trevor Talbott.\nINCLUDES:\nDatura #1-2 (PDF)\nChild Number Four #1 & Eclipse #1-3 (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Physical COPIES!", "descp": "You'll receive a physical copy of Datura #1!\nINCLUDES:\nDatura #1-2 (PDF)\nChild Number Four #1 & Eclipse #1-3 (PDF)\nDatura 1 & 2 (physical)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["40 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "UnWrapped Edition", "descp": "This level is really cool!

The amazing part was, because of Kickstarter and the crowdfunding structure, so many of you helped shape what the story actually became, lots of you, and your CATS, were actually IN the book. I didn\u2019t want to just make my comics alone... \nI wanted to make them with all of you. \u2665\nWith your support, through Kickstarter pre-order pledges and social media shares, I\u2019ll be able to once again, hunker down to draw, print, self-publish and ship out this epic 200 plus page sequel, THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2. \nCheck out all the awesome rewards and ways that you can not only get the book, but be a part of it, by being one of the very first to help make THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 a reality.\nHere are some of my favorite...\n See all the guest artist originals and prints HERE.\nI\u2019ll never be able to adequately thank you all enough for once again helping me to tell this story, but I CAN use your enthusiasm, and support to make the best damn book I\u2019m capable of and deliver it directly to you, the ones who showed up to the party early and made the whole thing possible.\nTo add...\n\u25ca AGGREGATE ISSUE #0  --- Increase pledge by $10 USA / $20 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca AGGREGATE BOOK 1 --- Increase pledge by $25 USA / $45 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca ISSUE #0 & BOOK 1 DIGITAL PDFS --- Increase pledge by $10 EVERYWHERE.\n\u25ca ADDITIONAL AGGREGATE BOOK 2 --- Increase pledge by $25 USA / $45 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca AGGREGATE BOOK 2  CHRIS JOHNSON COVER --- Increase pledge by $40 USA / $60 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca AGGREGATE BOOK 2 MATEUS SANTOLOUCO COVER --- Increase pledge by $40 USA / $60 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca AGGREGATE BOOK 2 KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE COVER --- Increase pledge by $50 USA / $70 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca ANY PRINT --- Increase pledge by $10 USA / $20 EVERYWHERE ELSE PER PRINT.\n\u25ca A SHIRT --- Increase pledge by $30 USA / $40 EVERYWHERE ELSE.\n\u25ca A PUZZLE --- Increase pledge by $50 USA / $60 EVERYWHERE ELSE PER PUZZLE.\n\u25ca A MINI FIGURE --- Increase pledge by $90 EVERYWHERE.\n\u25ca MP3 SOUNDTRACK --- Increase pledge by $10 EVERYWHERE.\n\u25ca KEVIN EASTMAN METAL PRINT --- Increase pledge by $20 USA / $40 EVERYWHERE ELSE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is technically my 4th Kickstarter, my 1st being THE AGGREGATE, my 2nd, (although it wasn\u2019t under my name) DRAWING BLOOD, and my 3rd, NATHAN THE CAVEMAN. I am very responsive to messages, comments and questions and will make myself available to answer any concerns whenever they arise.\n \nDEADLINE: \nI believe I\u2019ve given myself a realistic amount of time to draw over 200 pages, hire a colorist, put the book together, print, and ship the book and all rewards. I greatly underestimated the budget and timeline on THE AGGREGATE BOOK 1, but still found a way to bring it to life. With BOOK 2 I\u2019m being careful to not do that again, and to be realistic with the time and money these books take to make. That being said, sometimes unexpected things happen, and I am very appreciative of backers that understand those situations. I was lucky to have had zero complaints from AGGREGATE BOOK 1 supporters, as they understood I was working on the book every single day. I promise to NEVER leave anyone in the dark as to what\u2019s going on with the progress of the project. If something comes up, you will be well in the loop. This estimated deadline of March 2021, of course doesn\u2019t factor in the addition of any possible unlocked stretch goals like added pages, variant covers, or AGGREGATE APPENDAGES, which of course could potentially extend the workload.\n \nPRINTING: \nOver the last several years, I\u2019ve developed a great relationship with an amazing printer right here in the USA, who I\u2019ve used many times now, with a mind blowing quick turnaround. Once the book is completed, I have no doubts about the quality of the printed final product.\n \nSHIPPING: \nShipping is going up every single day in different areas, and the rules are always changing. I\u2019ll be shipping books media mail when possible to keep the domestic prices as low as possible. Unfortunately media mail is not an option for international packages. Here is the cold hard (sad) truth. A single copy of this book will weigh at least 2 lbs. The minimum cost for a single book to go first class outside the USA is $23, 2 books is $48, and 3 books is now priority at $68! So my shipping costs are real. I lost a lot on previous campaigns by underestimating shipping costs and am trying really hard not to do that again. I want to make the book available to all you international supporters though, so the option is available for almost every reward tier, but I felt I needed to let you know that the high shipping costs are the actual prices.\n \nPlease feel free to reach out to me with any questions you may have. I take crowdfunding very seriously and would never risk ruining my reputation on a project I didn\u2019t believe in or didn\u2019t 100% think was possible to fulfill. \n \nThank you for being a part of THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 and making it possible for self publishing creators like me to JUST MAKE COMICS and deliver them direct to the readers with a platform like Kickstarter.\n \n-Ben Bishop\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 - DIGITAL.", "descp": "\u25ca THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 digital pdf.\nINCLUDES:\nTHE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 - DIGITAL.\nYOUR NAME IN THE BOOK.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2.", "descp": "\u25ca THE AGGREGATE BOOK 2 signed.\n\u25ca WANT TO ADD BOOK 2 TO YOUR PLEDGE?

Mann\u2019s administration has exacted controversial measures to deal with the empowered he\u2019s deemed terrorists and is stoking national tensions to win public support for MANN FIRST, a cybernetically-augmented soldier program led by his son, THADDEUS.\nThe main person standing in the President\u2019s way is X \u2013  once known as Kareem Jenkins \u2013 who has become a symbol of resistance against the Mann Administration. X\u2019s one-man opposition has thwarted Mann\u2019s efforts both public and private, drawing attention away from X\u2019s teammates in THE PROJECT so they can save empowered blacks from government capture.\nThaddeus wants X dead by his own hands in order to destroy the spirits of empowered opposition and win the favor of his father\u2019s support base. Taking down his perceived rival would finally allow him to step out of his father\u2019s shadow and usher in a new era of the Mann dynasty \u2013 under his leadership. \n\n BLACK could not have happened without all of our backers, and Kickstarter was essential. The experience was awesome, afforded us amazing opportunities, and taught us some valuable lessons. Our goal remains to tell entertaining stories from black perspectives that increase authentic representation in the comics industry. \nStrides have been made and we're happy to see a burgeoning black renaissance in media. However, there\u2019s still much to be done about having agency in the black narrative. That means challenging the structure and examining what upholds inequalities and holds humanity back from our ideals in comics \u2013 and in reality.\nWe saw how those opposed to BLACK reacted to the idea of black people authoring how we are portrayed in media, which is why we think WHITE is an important part of the overarching world we're building. \nWe\u2019ve been lucky to build our world with full agency at Black Mask Studios, but to continue telling stories the way we want, we need to keep challenging ourselves, and publishing paradigms, by making these special variant editions of WHITE, and all six issues at once, exclusively available through this crowdfunding campaign. (If you are a retailer, you  will be able to order standard-edition periodicals directly from Black Mask once rewards ship.) \nThat\u2019s right \u2013 the ONLY way to get your hands on these copies of WHITE is through this Kickstarter.  \nDuring our previous campaign and over the course of making comics, we learned a lot \u2013 about what readers want, about what we want, and about how to get it to people. So, we decided on four very specific and very limited rewards for fans, collectors, bingers, and retailers.     \nThat\u2019s it! We felt very strongly about focusing solely on comics in formats unique to backers, readers\u2019 preferences, and retailers\u2019 needs. With your support, these will be very special editions. The only other people who will have a few copies are the creative contributors who helped make them. \n Because the campaign for WHITE  is all about providing fans with actual exclusives, we want to sweeten the rewards by offering additional Issue One periodical variants as we reach specific backer milestones. Each stretch goal will add a new cover to the mix and divide the number of covers, making issues rarer.    \n Some amazing artists \u2013 whose names you might recognize \u2013 Ashley A. Wood, Jamal Igle, Jeremy Love, ChrisCross, Sanford Greene, and the LEGENDARY Denys Cowan have each offered to do a bespoke cover for issue one. Each stretch goal will add a new cover to the mix and divide the number of covers, making books rarer. So please spread the word to back us and increase the rarity of your cover.\n*Distribution of variant periodicals will be random. Backers will not be able to choose which cover they receive but variants will be split evenly among backers. \nNow, we know we have some superfans who are going to want to get their hands on everything. Once all the variant covers are unlocked \u2013 we will offer two more rewards that include the original rewards.\n\n\n Kwanza Osajyefo, Tim Smith 3, Jamal Igle, Khary Randolph, Sarah Litt, Derwin Roberson, and Dave Sharpe return to produce the graphic novel, WHITE \u2013 the second part of the trilogy that began with the critically acclaimed graphic novel, BLACK. \nThe original team of creators from BLACK are returning, along with our terrific toner, Derwin Roberson, letterer extraordinaire David Sharpe, and new to the team, Juan Castro! \n Our production timeline is already underway to ensure that we get books out to backers with minimal hiccups. Your support will make certain that our team can concentrate on bringing you a jaw-dropping sequel to the comic that asked, \u201cWhat if only black people had superpowers?\u201d\n Issue One variant of WHITE is estimated to be delivered to backers October 2019. The limited edition variant of the graphic novel and retailer bundles will ship to backers in February 2020.  \n A majority of the funds are for production, printing fees, shipping and fulfillment costs, plus taxes.\nWe\u2019re super excited to welcome our fans back to the story, and welcome aboard new readers.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of our returns go directly back into making more books that reflect an authentic black experience through comics. Our goal remains to foster agency in our narratives and increase the representation of black characters across the diaspora, and it\u2019s only through your continued support that we are able to do so undeterred.\n\nWe learned a lot from our previous campaign, mainly that readers just want a book above all other rewards \u2013 so that is all we are focused on with this campaign.

To that end, we\u2019ve revised calculations and thoroughly researched successful campaigns and Kickstarter-recommended fulfillment partners to ensure logistics are seamless. \n\nThis will also allow us to focus on making comics and engaging with our supporters.

The tone light, fast, and fun. Keeping the vein of the wish fulfillment that runs through the stories of Batman and Robin, Johnny Quest, and Terry and the Pirates. Stories made for all ages. And in this lighter approach tackling some heavier themes, such as: death, adoption, and family life, without having to get too realistic. The Baboon and his team are a family and they act and deal with problems accordingly. They may butt heads, but at the end of the day they love each other. \nThe Baboon preview pages\nTo the world at large, The Baboon is a nothing more than a government myth. A figure of the shadows taking down evils wherever they lurk. To his crew -three of the greatest heroes of their time- he is a man of daring and compassion, who will stop at nothing to defend the world from the greatest evils known to man. But, to his adopted nephew, Jamie, Barton Marlow - The Baboon- is the coolest guy in the whole world. And now in his new life of adventure, Jamie wrestles with being the regular kid he once was and living up to his uncle's expectations. A man whose fantastic exploits are unequaled for narrow escapes, fantastic  adventures, and endless thrills.\n The Mustelid Menace- While in search of the Jackal formula -a super soldier serum that could change the dynamic of the entire world- the baboon is captured by the nefarious Professor Weezal. His only hope of escape is with the help of his amazing crew. But, things are strange on Mount Mustelid and the Jackal formula may be in full effect. Time is of the essence as the Baboon battles his way through armed men and hulking, carnivorous monsters. Let's just hope they never have to go back. \nAll this and more in The Baboon's first full length adventure (60 pages of comics awesomeness.) \nThe Baboon preview pages cont.\n WHY A HARDCOVER BOOK?\nThe Baboon is an ongoing series of stories and presented in the European album comics format. Nice, fun, digestible comics for all ages. Like Tin Tin or Lucky Luke. In keeping with this theme the book is going to be presented first in Hardcover. This style of comics gives me the ability to tell a story and not be confined to a traditional comics page count. Also, a pretty Hardcover always looks great on your shelf!\nJAMIE is a cartoonist living in Saint Petersburg, Fl. He loves old pulp comics from the 40s and 50s and Dungeons and Dragons.

Try to collect matching sets of cards faster than your opponents while simultaneously ducking, dodging, and throwing squishy airborne burritos. The cards you collect earn points, but getting hit by flying burritos loses them. So clear some space and put away the antiques, because you\u2019ve never played a card game quite like this before.\nSince we created Exploding Kittens four years ago, we've been making games that bring friends and family together around a table, away from their screens. We brought this game to Kickstarter because we believe that adding a bit of physicality to game night is what comes next.\nSo, if you're into the idea of party games and weaponized Mexican food, please help us make this game a reality. We think you'll love it as much as we do.\nHugs and missiles,\n-Elan, Matt, and the Exploding Kittens Team    \nHOW DOES THIS WORK?\nNo Funding Goals, No Backer Goals, instead we want you to enter the Burrito Bowl! \nCompete in a series of incredible events to test your burrito themed prowess and we\u2019ll upgrade your games for free!\nThrow Throw Burrito started when our friend, Brian Spence, pitched a new game idea to us and we immediately fell in love. Over the next eight months, we worked closely with Brian to tune the game, design the cards, and destroy most of the fragile items in our homes.\nThe game went through many versions.\nFirst, there was the \"Mangoes with Animal Heads Phase\":\nMango Pug\nThen came the flying animal ideas: \nThen fruit: \nThen so many Mexican food ideas:\nAfter finally choosing a name, Matt got to work on the cards: \nCharacter Exploration\nStyle Exploration\nWe wanted to put this project on Kickstarter because it's the fastest way for us to get the game into your hands and make improvements as a community. We think this game is great, but we need your help making it even better.\nSo if a world full of weaponized Mexican food is a world you want to live in, please back this project and help us build this game. \nWith love and mad strafing skills,\n- The Exploding Kittens Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge for our team is building the throwables.

But throwables are a new challenge. We're working with the finest toy manufacturers in the world to make sure that we deliver the best materials that are fun to throw (not too light) and don't hurt when they hit you (not too heavy).\n\nIt's also very important to us that everyone gets their game on time. We don't want this to be a campaign where you spend the next two years getting fifty emails about production updates and delays. If you back this project, we want you to start throwing burritos at your friends as soon as possible.

I make my living telling stories, and The Long Way Home is one I've wanted to tell for a long time. \nWhen I was 14 I moved to Okinawa, Japan. This was before the internet, before social media. I was dropped into the deep end with no idea what to expect. Within days I ended making lifelong friends and forming a bond that could only have happened in that unique way, in a place halfway around the world. The Long Way Home will be a documentary that will follow us as we return home together, for the first time in 25 years. It will explore the relationships we have because of that time and that place. It's a personal story but one I think everyone can relate to, going home again.\nAlongside the documentary project, I'm also producing a 60 page Manga called The Ronin and the Shisa which is an action adventure story that takes place in a future version of Okinawa.\nThere are reward tiers for every level of support and I urge you to check them out and see which one suits you best.\n*NEW 03/15/19 - Stretch Goal #3! At $6,000 The Ronin and The Shisa manga expands from 60 pages to 75 pages for all digital and physical backers!\n*NEW 03/03/19 - Another stretch goal has been added! At $5,000 all backers will have access to behind-the-scenes process videos and posts for both the documentary and the comic.  \n *NEW 02/24/19 - A new stretch goal has been added! If the campaign reaches $3700 then the cover to The Ronin and The Shisa will be pencilled by DC Comics and Image Comics star artist, Scott Godlewski!

THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING CAMPAIGN!\nWe have MANY more blocks of stretch goals, which will even include adding bonus stories, so let's keep these pledges going!\nThe first two volumes introduced the story of former magical girl Logan McBride and her mysterious girlfriend, Lilith Aberdine. Where we left them and their gang of friends, Logan and Lilith were forced apart by fate, leaving Lilith to deal with her old demons in New York, while Logan copes with her own problems in California.\nWe're doing things a bit different this time around. You've all been amazingly loyal readers... so we figured why not give you TWO ENTIRE VOLUMES IN ONE BOOK for our third installment?\nDestiny, NY Volume Three will have two main features, each as long as a full graphic novel. These stories take place at the same time and overlap in ways both beautiful and tragic.\nACT ONE WILL FOLLOW LILITH IN NEW YORK CITY, AS SHE DEALS WITH THE DANGER AND DRAMA LEFT BEHIND BY HER FAMILY... WHO WERE BASICALLY THE MYSTICAL MOB.\nInterior art by Elisa Romboli!\nAct One is illustrated by the brilliant Elisa Romboli. Check out some pages here.

ALONG THE WAY, SHE MEETS A SEER, TAYLOR, WHO MIGHT JUST HAVE THE KEY TO SOLVING ALL OF HER PROBLEMS.\nAct Two is illustrated by the incredible Carola Borelli. Check out some pages here. This feature will include returning favorites as well as brand new characters who you'll love every bit as much as Logan, Lilith, and the gang.\nInterior art by Carola Borelli\nFor the first two volumes, we launched the Kickstarter with just one chapter done. This time, we've been working on the book ALL LAST YEAR! Act One by Elisa Romboli is completely drawn AND lettered. Act Two by Carola Borelli is also well into production. This means that we're sending Destiny, NY Volume Three to print just about one month after the Kickstarter wraps!\nThis means you can expect less of a wait... because the truth is, we're too excited about this story to keep it from you for any longer.\nEvery volume of Destiny, NY ends with a chapter of bonus stories by guest creators that shed new light on our supporting character. Take a look at the stories! None of the art here is from the stories, but are just character shots.\nArt from the back cover\n BAILEY - The origin story of Logan's ex, the magical girl/MMA superstar!

We have a well-oiled system and are happy to announce that the book is almost done! In a creative endeavor of this size, possible challenges could be delays in production or printing, considering we ship overseas. However, any time that has happened in the past has been minor -- we have successfully Kickstarted multiple projects before as creators AND as a team, which has given us the utmost confidence that we'll meet and exceed your expectations. When hiccups are hit, we send updates. When we receive our shipment, we get them our to backers immediately without delay. I mean, why would we want to hold onto the books when we're so eager for YOU to read them? \n\nOne thing that we can't control is customs charges. We pay more for international shipping than we charge, but some countries will charge an extra customs fee based on the prices of the items included. Our advice there would just be to be aware of that!

Sometimes these flaws cause major issues in our lives. SWEET EUPHORIA is four issue series about flawed people doing their best to work out their issues. This campaign is to fund the printing of the first issue. If you\u2019re a fan of Edward Burns and Kevin Smith movies, you should check this out! \nA little background? Okay... \nThis is my first real attempt at a comic book. I wrote the initial draft ages ago and ended up sitting on it for a while. It was influenced by the early movies of Kevin Smith and Edward Burns. \nAfter reading many indie comic (mainly the books of Terry Moore), I revisited, revised and completed the story. It developed it into something else. The first issue introduces the characters, and delves a little deeper into one of the main protagonists, Will, while setting up the second issue (currently being illustrated).\nABOUT THE BOOK\nSWEET EUPHORIA is a black and white comic book, coming to a total of 28 pages (24 of story). The digital copies will be hi-res pdfs sent once the campaign has completed. \nThe other books offered as rewards are as follows:\nSHORTS - a collection of short stories that I created or collaborated with creators Lea J. Zimmit, Dan Amareiles, JR Loflin, Nikki Sherman and Justin Birch. \nPOWER-UPS: VILIFIED & ONE COMIC TO RULE THEM ALL - short tales created by the #ComicBookHour community. I worked on two stories with Erik Bitmanis (creator of the HARD WYRED series).\nNEWLY ADDED! \nThere's a sketch reward where you can get a 5x7 sketch included with your pledge.

Backers at $45 and higher can also add-on the EXCLUSIVE KICKSTARTER set by Rachel Perciphone for $25.\nSoon to be released by Red Stylo Press, COSMIC LOVE  is an eighty-page comic anthology first proposed by featured cover artist, Rachel Perciphone, and edited by award-winning author/editor Jennie Wood (Flutter, A Boy Like Me.) \n\u201cFlorence + The Machine is one of my favorite bands and particularly inspiring to me.  Their music is ethereal and otherworldly; I can\u2019t help but be taken to new places in my imagination.  I often listen to them while I work in my studio.  Florence\u2019s lyrics are full of imagery that allow for different visual interpretations and storytelling of emotional experiences.\u201d Rachel Perciphone\nCOSMIC LOVE  is a curated selection of original short form comics and illustrations in tribute to over a decade of music by the phenom performer Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine. Each team of creators was challenged to choose their favorite F+tM song and create an original comic story inspired by the music. Artist, Rachel Perciphone, then created a series of story cover/vignettes  also inspired by the chosen song. The result is an ethereal collection of original stories celebrating love in all its glorious forms. \nA special edition of this collection was released at Flame Con in 2018, and we're here on Kickstarter to give this book much-deserved wide release and distribution. In keeping with the music theme, the book itself will be printed at 7x7 inches to physically resemble a 45 RPM record cover, similar to a previous collection from Red Stylo, Baroque Pop (inspired by Lana Del Rey).\nAll of the stories and art in COSMIC LOVE are original works in tribute to and inspired by the music of Florence + the Machine. No adaptations, rather each piece is a reflection of the beautiful and secret places of the imagination that F+tM inspires with their music. This book is dedicated to our fellow F+tM fans everywhere!\nCosmic Love and Cosmic Love: Flame Con Special Edition, cover art by Rachel Perciphone\nThe collection is complete and this campaign is to help fund and ship a full print run. In addition, this book is a cooperative, put together entirely by the donated efforts of the creators. After rewards are fulfilled, the print run will be split evenly among the creative teams, so backing the collection directly benefits the wonderful individuals who helped make it happen. \nSweet sixteen contributors for COSMIC LOVE\nThe book features stories and art by:\nRachel Perciphone\nJennie Wood + Josh Segal\nVita Ayala + Kat Taylor\nSeth Greenwood + Angela Zhang\nEnrica Jang + Y.

Wild adventures I could get lost in as I followed the heroes along on their journey. Middle Earth, Hyboria, The Young Kingdoms, The Dying Earth. To me, it's not escapism to want to dwell in worlds like that for a little while. The wonderful thing about fiction, especially genre fiction is that it gives you a taste of the impossible - a window into another world. And that feeling, that exhilarating feeling of cracking open a book and getting lost in it, even for a moment, is something that I've always wanted to create for someone else. And I believe that Wailing Blade is a book that will. \nIt's often said that you should make the comics that you want to see in the world. In that respect, Wailing Blade is everything we've ever wanted to see in a comic. It's got action, it's got adventure. Compelling characters, and a lush, vibrant world for them to inhabit. We couldn't be happier to share it with you.\nWhat Exactly Is This Kickstarter For?\nThe team has already invested thousands of dollars and hundreds of man-hours into the development of this first WAILING BLADE series. \nThe first issue is 100% complete and ready to print.\nSoon, our book will compete for attention on the shelves of comic shops world-wide. \nWith your support here on Kickstarter, we can fund a larger initial print run for the book and expand the TAKE THE BLADE TOUR, bringing our new series to more comic conventions and in-store signings around the country. \nIt will also help fund cool new Wailing Blade merchandise and Kickstarter-Exclusive collectibles for our biggest fans. A successful launch will also help make even more Wailing Blade stories than initial series possible. \nFunds raised above and beyond our modest goal will go into project stretch goal enhancements for our backers as well as be invested back into the series. \n ComixTribe was launched with the help of Kickstarter fans and we know the only place some of our biggest fans can get our books is here on Kickstarter. So we\u2019re back with another awesome campaign to help make more killer comics! \nFeast Your Eyes on These Pages Inside the Book...\n Want to See Even More Before You Take the Blade? \nIf you'd like to read even more of Wailing Blade before you back this campaign, we invite you to download a generous 19 page preview. \n \u2694\ufe0f CLICK HERE TO ACCESS ACCESS THE PREVIEW \u2694\ufe0f  \nWhat Awesome Rewards Are Available?\n Want a Closer Look at Those Killer Covers? \nNOTE: YOU CAN ADD the KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE Cover to ANY PHYSICAL PLEDGE LEVEL for +$25!\nWAILING BLADE PROJECT TIMELINE\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: Jan 15 - Jan 31\nKickstarter Funds Received: Feb 14\nWailing Blade #1 to Print: Early February\nMerchandise in Production: February\nBook Manufacturing and Freight: (Late February) \nExtra Buffer Time for Unexpected Issues: (March)\nExpected Deliver to US Backers: (Early April) \nExpected Deliver for INT Backers: (Late April)  \nTHIS BLADE IS SHARP, SO HERE'S HOW WE'LL PROTECT IT IN TRANSIT! \nAs Kickstarter fans and collector's ourselves, we know there's nothing worse than backing a comic project and then having your rewards arrive damaged. \nAfter consulting with our backers, we've revamped our shipping practices to ensure your comics and collectibles arrive in great condition. \nAll comics shipped will be individually bagged with boards, and will be secured in Gemini Comic Supply Comic Flash Mailers, which provides impact-resistant protection.\nOrders with multiple comics will be sandwich packed and secured for additional protection.\nAnd our Wailing Boxes will be BUBBLE WRAPPED before being inserted into a second shipping box, so that it arrives in great condition. \nFurthermore, for this campaign, we're handling fulfillment 100% in-house. In the past, we've worked with some external fulfillment companies who specialize in packing and shipping so that we can stay focused on creating the books. \nHowever, for this campaign, we want to make sure that everything arrives to our backers as quickly as possible and limit the possibility of unforeseen delays, which is why we are rolling up our sleeves and personally overseeing fulfillment for every backer.  \nThank you so much for taking the time to check out our project. We would be absolutely thrilled if you're ready to take the next step and join this campaign! \nWill YOU Be the Next to Take the Blade?\nIf you've made it this far, you may be ready to be the very next person to TAKE THE BLADE! \nIf so, we'd like to ask you to scroll back up this page, choose an awesome reward, and pledge to be a part of this campaign today. \nOn behalf of the entire Wailing Blade team, thank you so much for your support! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe support of backers on Kickstarter has been instrumental to the success of ComixTribe since our very first project back in 2012, so we take the trust of our backers very seriously.\n\nWe've taken a number of actions to mitigate risk associated with this campaign, including completing the creation of the book prior to launching and establishing a strong relationship with a quality printer who has done great work for us in the past and is established in North America, which means faster printing and delivery times for our backers than overseas off-set print.\n\nEvery Kickstarter campaign comes with risks, unforeseen hiccups, and lessons learned...and we've certainly learned valuable lessons from every past campaign. \n\nWe're committed to delivering a superior reward delivery experience for our backers, so we're investing in the best protective shipping materials for comics and collectibles, and handling fulfillment 100% in-house, to eliminate the risk of delivery delays and to make sure your pledges arrive in great condition.\n\nComixTribe and the WAILING BLADE team have a long track record of delivering the goods, and the fact that we enjoy so much support from returning backers is testament to that.\n\nSo we invite you to back with confidence, as we want to be entertaining you for years to come.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "WAILING BLADE #1 DIGITAL DELUXE + MP3", "descp": "This TYRANT'S CUT DIGITAL DELUXE PDF includes the action-packed, blood-soaked Wailing Blade #1, plus more than 50 pages of bonus material, including: the full issue #1 script by Rich Douek, as well as concept sketches by Joe Mulvey.

On this fateful mission, Eagle finds himself at the mercy of enemies in the field and callous and careless superiors at home. \nAfter the mission goes spectacularly wrong, we see the greedy and power-hungry Senator that caused the devastating failure face a horrifying attack on US soil. An act of revenge? But by whom?\nAcceptable Losses tells a dark, poignant and action-packed superhero revenge fantasy, focusing on grim action and looking at the cycle of violence in the war on terror and those fighting it on both sides. \nAbout the Cast\nCharacter design sketch by Danny Flores\nThe US Eagle a.k.a. Corporal Sam Tyler is a good soldier. Always following orders, he believes in what the ideals of America mean and that they have a duty to help the rest of the world. Being the only subject of the US's controversial human augmentation program, Tyler gained enhanced strength, speed and stamina from the process, and became a symbol of America's might in the world. \nCharacter design sketch by Danny Flores\nPrivate Deshawn Krinsky is the US Eagle's eyes in the sky and handler from home base. A young but incredibly bright officer, Private Krinsky has become an indispensable aid to US Eagle and his missions for their country. Idealistic and loyal, Krinsky has become a good friend to the US Eagle as well as his ally. \nSenator Robert McKeen is a man in his mid-50s who has never seen a single day of active duty in his life. And yet he has found himself the political liaison to the US Eagle Program. A life-long politician and spokesman, there has rarely been a motion he couldn't schmooze and massage it's way past obstacles. A man of words and who values opinions and the image of power above all else, McKeen can be quite brutal in his single-minded focus on his goals. \nCharacter design sketch by Danny Flores\nGeneral Michael Forley has been working ops all his adult life. A proud, gruff military man to the bone, Forley is in charge of the US Eagle Program and is a no-nonsense leader. A stickler of protocol and chain of command, Forley nevertheless holds his own strong opinions on the missions they run.\nAbout the Campaign\nWe're looking to run a simple, straight-forward campaign with the majority of funds raised going to pay the production team for art, colours and letters, and a good chunk for printing and shipping. \nChart of the breakdown of funds distribution\nWith the funds for this campaign, we'll make as gorgeous a finished product for this one-shot comic as possible. If we exceed the goal amount, this will go into making an even better finish on the book. As well as single copy rewards, we also have group rewards options should anyone wish to get a bunch of copies for a reading group, stall or store.\nRewards are kept nice and simple to keep things straightforward, and shipping costs kept as low as possible. \nSome early artwork from Danny Flores\nAbout the Creators\nJoe Glass is the writer of Acceptable Losses. The creator and writer of The Pride and The Pride Adventures, that has been part of numerous very successful Kickstarters. This is Joe's first solo written, self-published comic that is not connected to The Pride and shows a whole new side of his writing. \nDanny Flores is an up-and-coming illustrator in the field of comics. Having only illustrated a few short stories here and there, this will be his first book published. He hopes to one day enjoy illustrating comics as a full time job.\nPage in process by Danny Flores\nMoose Baumann is a colourist who has worked on a large number of titles, including DC's Green Lantern, Seven Soldiers of Victory, and Nightwing, and many more. \nMichael Stock is a letterer and long-time collaborator with Joe Glass. Michael has lettered numerous comics across the UK independent scene including The Pride, The Kill Screen, Samurai Slasher and much more. \nWhy Acceptable Losses?\nThere's a reason I want to make Acceptable Losses. \nFor me, it's about showing what I can do outside of The Pride. The Pride is an incredibly well received series, and I could not be prouder of it, but it is very much just one of the stories I have in me. Acceptable Losses is a chance for me to show off something completely different and even unexpected from me, that I think can be enjoyed both by fans of my existing work and also by people who've never read anything by me before. It was also a chance to work with the amazing Danny Flores and Moose Baumann, and my long-time collaborator Michael Stock once again. \nSome early artwork from Danny Flores\nFor Danny, this is his first full comic to get printed, so it will be a great chance to show off his work too. I'm very excited for people to see what we can put together. \nFinally, it's a story about the consequences of our actions, as much in our world as in this fictional one. It's a story about where exactly an 'eye for an eye' gets us, and how rushing in headlong to get the job done without thinking through all of the angles can result in disaster. It's about seeing the shades of grey in even the most black and white of situations, and our responsibility for whatever we decide to do with that information. \nPage in process by Danny Flores\nBut most of all, Acceptable Losses is about an entertaining, superhero thriller with depth. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGenerally, delivery dates are an estimate as sometimes work takes longer to complete, and the creators are shipping the books out themselves, however we will endeavour to stick to the planned completion and delivery dates. \n\nAs ultimately we're shipping them ourselves, please bare that in mind as items might be later than estimated depending how many backers we wind up having to ship to. As such, making sure the address you provide after the campaign ends is valid for a while after the campaign is important. \n\nPostage tends to often be the major trip up in Kickstarter campaigns, and it has certainly caught me out before. However, that is why I'm including a fairly big chunk of the goal amount as purely towards shipping costs, and to ensure the book is shipped around the world easily.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Joe Glass\n9 created \u00b7 208 backed\nJoe Glass is the writer and creator of The Pride, a series following a whole team of LGBTQIA+ superheroes fighting for representation...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Thank You Tier", "descp": "At this level you get to support with our unending thanks!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a33 or more", "title": "Digital Tier", "descp": "At this level you'll get a digital copy of Acceptable Losses\nINCLUDES:\nAcceptable Losses digital copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}], "stat": ["63 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Print Tier", "descp": "At this level you'll get a print copy of Acceptable Losses\nINCLUDES:\nAcceptable Losses print copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["86 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Print + Digital Tier", "descp": "At this level level you get the print and digital copies of Acceptable Losses\nINCLUDES:\nAcceptable Losses digital copy\nAcceptable Losses print copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["44 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Bear Tier", "descp": "From Joe Glass' previous work, at this tier you can get a Bear enamel pin!\nINCLUDES:\nBear Pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a37 or more", "title": "Angel Tier", "descp": "From Joe Glass' previous work, you'll get an Angel enamel pin, featuring red glittered design work!\nINCLUDES:\nAngel Pin", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a38 or more", "title": "Muscle Mary Tier", "descp": "From Joe Glass' previous work, get one of the limited edition Muscle Mary pins, designed by artists Hector Barros.

Dallas is an tenacious techie who believes in the supernatural and Inez bases her crime solving skills in realism, and is also captain of the wrestling team.\nTogether, they are best friends who attempt to solve mysteries anywhere, and anytime. Inspirations for Cash & Carrie include Disney's animated series Fillmore, Scooby Doo, Gravity Falls, and the X-Files. Cash & Carrie is an inclusive series on the page and behind the scenes, and is for readers young and old.\nIn the summer of 2015, Cash & Carrie launched as a single issue all-readers mystery comic on Kickstarter with success. I put together a full volume (Book One) with co-creator Giulie Speziani that was released in the fall of 2016 from Action Lab Entertainment. \n2015 Cover by Penny Candy Studios. 2016 Cover by Nilah Magruder.\nSince Cash & Carrie hopped on the scene in 2015, there's been a LOT of all-readers mystery comics that have emerged, and it's time for Cash & Carrie to get back into the game in all new adventures!\nThis Kickstarter will help cover production, printing, reward production costs, and shipping and handling expenses for a 96-page softcover edition of Cash & Carrie: Book Two. \nInez Carrie and Dallas Cash. Super sleuths. Best buds.\nArt By Marcus Kwame Anderson. Script by Giulie Speziani.

Maybe.\nIt\u2019s all fun and games at Summer Camp Sobol until strange things start happening. Campers go missing, Bigfoot might actually exist, and what's really in the coleslaw? With no WiFi and the mosquito repellant not cutting it, our detective duo will have to stick together to solve these mysteries on their own. Will Cash & Carrie survive this spooky summer camp of supreme superstition? And who will win the Camp Sobol Summer Games? You'll have to read book two to find out!\nAdditional stories in Book Two include Cash & Carrie taking on a culinary mystery, we get a glimpse into universe of C+C and find out what the other kids in their neighborhood did over the summer, and there's a pinup gallery!\nBOOK TWO STORIES AND CREATIVE TEAM:\nBig Foot, Small Sneakers, written by Giulie Speziani with art by Marcus Kwame Anderson.

More than 120 pages of terrifying stories await you in this collection!\nAs a kid, I often went fishing at the creek with my old man. He had a nice fishing boat, lots of expensive rods and reels, and he often took the family out on ocean fishing excursions. But he still liked taking old fashioned cane poles out to the creek to fish for catfish. I went with him frequently. (One of his favorite fishing spots was near a country club, and we often squeezed through a break in the fence and crept across the golf course to get there.) \nFor some reason, I always took a big stack of horror comics with me to read on the muddy bank. House of Mystery, Ghosts, House of Secrets, Creepy, Eerie, Haunted Library, you name it. I never brought superhero books. Only horror tales seemed right while sitting in the eerie, early morning light. \nI loved those anthologies so much. They absolutely played a big role in the writer I would become. Over the past couple of decades, I\u2019ve written many short horror stories. Many of those prose stories were collected in the book A PASSAGE IN BLACK from OmahaBound. That book, if you haven\u2019t read it yet, has some of my earliest work in it, but I wanted to showcase everything so readers could see who I am and where I came from.  \nAnd now\u2014right here!\u2014I\u2019m announcing that my love of horror comic anthologies and my love of horror short fiction is coming together like peanut butter and jelly!  This book will feature comic book adaptations of some of my short horror stories from the prose collection. \nI have brought together an amazing group of writers and artists to bring these stories to life. \nJust check out the list (and the awe-inspiring artwork)!\nCindy Bunn and Baldemar Rivas - \u201cWhy Sing the Sirens\u201d   \nKevin Watkins and Adam McLaughlin - \u201cSchool for the Dead\u201d  \nAnton Kromoff and Bob Freeman - \u201cDance, Dance, Upon the Night of the Ball\u201d \n Heath Amodio and Daniele Sera \u2013 \u201cLast Night of the Fair\u201d \n Josh Roberts and David Moscati \u2013 \u201cFeast of Crows\u201d \n JimmyZ Johnston and Isaac Crawford - \u201cPiasa Dreams\u201d \n Jeff Lawler and Fran Strukan \u2013 \u201cStill Waters\u201d \n  AE Steuve and Arjuna Susini \u2013 \u201cFor Her Love\u201d \n Sonica Ellis and Rowan MacColl \u2013 \u201cSomeday Dolls\u201d \n Tim Mayer \u2013 \u201cA Passage in Black\u201d \n And yours truly working with Marcos Marz on something new! A short story (and intro to something bigger?) titled \"Dead Vein\"\nWith special appearances by Blacky Shepherd! \n A logo designed by the Kucharek Brothers! \nAnd a cover by Kyle Strahm! \nI want this book to represent amazing talent that readers might not be familiar with, and I think these folks have accomplished something beautiful and scary and fun. They took these prose stories and ran with them. They made them their own and did something special with them. This book is a showcase of different approaches to the horrific... and I think you're gonna love it!\nOmahaBound is helping with the design and printing of the project, so I\u2019m confident it is going to be a fantastic book!  \nAnd here\u2019s some more exciting news! \nAssuming the Kickstarter is successful, I plan on making this an annual project/event. The next volume, though, will feature all new stories by the various collaborators (and myself). This will be a way for me to contribute to the legacy of horror anthology comics in my own way. \nCULLEN BUNN PRESENTS A PASSAGE IN BLACK is my Creepy, my Eerie, my House of Mystery. We\u2019re on the verge of something exciting here. I hope you will all join me on this journey! \nAs we reach stretch goals for this campaign, we will be offering various enhancements to the book. \n$25,000 - When we reach this goal, we will add an introduction/foreword to the book. \n$35,000 - When we reach this goal, we will add five one-page/splash page story introductions/interludes by artist Blacky Shepherd. These pages will be in the tradition of the horror host story introductions of classic horror comics!\n$45,000 - When we reach this goal, we'll add a pin-ups section to the book, treating readers to all manner of ghoulishly gruesome horror imagery!\n$55,000 - When we reach this stretch goal, all print trade paperbacks will be upgraded to hardcover editions!\n$65,000 - To be announced!!!\n$80,000 - To be announced!!!\nAt the end of the campaign, you will have the opportunity to select add-on items to your order. Some of these items include--\nA PASSAGE IN BLACK T-SHIRT - $25\nThis exclusive t-shirt features the logo from the book. \nA PASSAGE IN BLACK PROSE COLLECTION - $15\nThis collection features 27 short stories and illustrations from Tim Mayer. The stories that inspired the graphic novel collection are presented here, too!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter project. I've learned a lot while running the first project. I recognize the value of working with great folks to make the book come to life, and I have partnered with experts in book production and delivery.\n\nALL of the artwork for this graphic novel is completed, and the book is being lettered as this campaign runs.\n\nThis means that we will be delivering this book very quickly. Digital versions of the book will deliver to backers almost as soon as the campaign funds (we'll need just a little time to finalize the \"Thank You\" page and any Stretch Goal additions), and the book will be sent to the printer for hard copy production immediately.\n\nMy primary goal is getting this book into the hands of our readers, so we're focusing on that! I have a team ready to manage the logistics of shipping the books out as soon as they are ready to go!\n\nI'm teaming with one of the biggest and best crowdfunding companies in the industry: BackerKit. Through BackerKit we'll easily be able to manage add-ons, surveys, address changes, and fulfillment.\n\nThere are always surprises and curve balls along the way, but we are positioned to manage those as they arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THANK YOU!", "descp": "Show your support for this project by pledging at this level.

The book is mostly complete aside from some editing. So, the book is pretty much ready to go.\nThe thing is, I love comic books.  I started collecting them when I was 4.  So I wrote a book about superheros, but what is a book about superheroes without some comic book art in it?  This book needs some sequential art in it. It just has to.\nMy idea is to have a different comic book artist or visual storyteller illustrate a scene from each chapter at the end of the chapter. So for my 21 chapter book, we are looking at 21 different artists doing those scenes. On top of all that, those artists will need to see some character designs to complete their pages.  Therefore, on top of the 21 artists doing pages, I have another 15 artists ready to draw character designs for 15 of the characters in the book. \nI have all the artists verbal okay for the timeframe and the project, but I have not formalized anything because I need the funding to do so. So, to get this book published with over 30 artists contributing, I need to get funded. Once the funding is secure, contracts will be sent out and art will be created.\nHere is a list of the artists who have signed on so far:\nBrett Barkley\nJason Baroody\nTressina Bowling\nChris Burnham\nJeremy Colwell\nVan Davis\nPenny Devoe\nWilliam Grapes\nJim Hazelett\nDoug Hills \nScott LeMien\nBrian Mazany\nJason Masters\nDave Meyers\nJosie Miller\nYasmin Florez Montanez\nDrew Moss\nDavid Newbold\nChristina Kraus\nLen Peralta\nDaniel Puch\nChris Ring\nBerk Senturk\nK Lynn Smith\nAdam Walmsey\nSteve Willhite\nand many more...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe coordination and logistics to make sure all the artists are fed the information they need to complete their work and then get that art back to me is daunting. \n\nBecause there are so many artists and coordination necessary, there is a strong possibility that the timeline might get dragged further than I am currently planning.

My name is CW Cooke and I've been working in independent comics since 2007. I've worked with companies like Big Dog Ink (Joan of Arc), Image Comics (Spread short story), Devil's Due (hit series Solitary with a soon to be released second volume which began as a Kickstarter), Action Lab (Stillwater), Pilot Studios (Always Punch Nazis vol 1 and more to come), Arcana, Viper, and Bluewater as well as in the self-published realm of comics.\nMy first series, Solitary (which many of you helped fund a few years back), has recently entered a development deal for film and television. Here's a link to see more about that and follow that progress as it happens: \nhttps://graphicpolicy.com/2018/10/04/nycc-2018-devils-due-comics-and-cw-cookes-solitary-gets-a-development-deal/\nCo-created with artist Travis Hymel and with colors by Jeremy Kahn and letters and logo by Micah Myers, we're working hard to bring our newest idea, L.U.C.H.A., to life. And Agente needs your help! \nA HORROR WRESTLING EXTRAVAGANZA:\nL.U.C.H.A. is the story of Agente, a luchador detective who spends his life solving low level crimes and murders, taking on any job that falls in his lap. He just so happens to get wrapped up in a murder campaign that involves vampires, wrestlers, and other notorious figures before the rug gets pulled out from under  him...and the readers!\nL.U.C.H.A. is one of the most fun things I've worked on in comics. Born from a simple idea as part of the Kayfabe anthology (a wrestling comic anthology put together by comic creators and wrestling fans alike, with the emphasis on wrestling as real), this story about Agente took on a life of its own because of the incredible working chemistry Travis and I had and the unbelievably insane story we came up with. The first ten pages will rock your socks off and after that it will swerve and take your breath away.\nPin, available at $50 level\nI've wanted to make a comic that was this insane for a long time, and I've found the perfect partners in crime. And we need your help because this beautiful work will require a lot to deliver the goods.\nBy pledging you're helping us see the series through to issue four. We're keeping our rewards focused around issue one, to keep this campaign simple, but we'll be sure to update you whenever new issues are available as well, and try to come up with some extra perks down the line to remember the backers who helped make this book's launch possible.\nWe have a lot of plans for stretch goals, but before we get there, hit that pledge button please! The rewards are at the bottom of this page.   \n WRITER: CW Cooke\nARTIST: Travis Hymel\nCOLORS: Jeremy Kahn\nLETTERS/LOGO: Micah Myers\nEDITS: Shawn Gabborin and Shawn Pryor\nSPECIAL THANKS: Jay Huwer, Shawn Pryor, Jeremy Mohler, Kit Caoagas, Shawn Gabborin, Trevor Mueller, Steve Ekstrom, my wife, my wonderful friends, my team, and so many others that I'm probably forgetting that helped keep my mind at ease as I built this thing. \nREWARDS:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe first issue is completely drawn and in the process of being colored.

The book is done, the colors are being completed, so getting it printed and delivered and all the rewards sent out is really the only challenge we face.\n\nI am very open and honest.

Both of the Standard Editions of TERMINAL #3 and #4 will feature cover art by artist Bob Rivard and they will connect with the artwork from the first two issues.\nTERMINAL #3 features \"Fausto Colon\" by Justin Gray (Jonah Hex, Hawkman) with artist Dan Lauer and colorist Stephanie Chan as well as \"Oubliette\" by Eric Palicki (No Angel) with artist Ande Rummel.\nInterior Art from TERMINAL #3 featuring two pages by Dan Lauer (Left) and Ande Rummel (Right)\nTERMINAL #4 features \"STEELTOWN\" by Vito Delsante (Purple Heart) and artist Ant\u00f3nio Brand\u00e3o (CREECH) as well as \"GEMINI XIV\" by Matt Brady (The Con Job) with artist Nikola \u010ci\u017eme\u0161ija with colorist Kirsty Swan coloring the entire issue.\nInterior Art from TERMINAL #4 featuring two pages by Ant\u00f3nio Brand\u00e3o (Left) and Nikola \u010ci\u017eme\u0161ija (Right)\nMuch like our first Kickstarter, both issues will also have a Ultra Rare 1:5 Guest Artist Variant. The Guest Artist Variant Edition of TERMINAL #3 features Josh Adams, Jeff Johnson, and a back cover piece by Rafa Garres. The Guest Artist Variant Edition of TERMINAL #4 features Eisner Award-Winning Artist Vasilis Lolos, Richard Pace, and a back cover piece by John Rauch.\nUnfinished interconnecting Guest Artist Variants featuring (left to right) Josh Adams, Jeff Johnson, Jamal Igle, Carlos Cabaleiro, Rob G, Larry Watts, and Vasilis Lolos. [Richard Pace art is coming.]\nWHY $8000 THIS TIME?\nDuring our first offering, we had the luxury of having our coloring costs covered. This time around, we needed to employ the outside assistance of colorists, Stephanie Chan (Hulk) and Kirsty Swan (Blood Queen). We're also funding BOTH issues fully without the requirement of a stretch goal this time...and we want to make sure we have enough coverage to handle shipping to all of our areas where TERMINAL will be available. Last time, we cut it really, really, really close.\nWe promise that, just like last time, we will be dumping a ton of digital and physical rewards on all of our backers.\nSO MANY FREAKIN' REWARDS!\nMuch like the last campaign, we will be featuring Reward Bundles that contain physical and digital comic rewards as well as prints, shirts and unique artwork from some of our talented crew. During the first week of the campaign, we will give details on a number of Funding Benchmark Rewards as we approach our goal of $8000.\nUpon reaching our basic funding goal, ALL of our Backers will receive a digital copy of the ALWAYS PUNCH NAZIS Anthology donated to our cause by our friend Ben Ferrari. Keep your eyes peeled on the Kickstarter page or our Imminent and Terminal Facebook pages for updates on our unlocked rewards.\nCompleting the funding goal of $8000 unlocks free copies of the ALWAYS PUNCH NAZIS anthology for all of our backers.\nTHE RETURNING SWAG!\nWe have NEW Exclusive 5x7\" Prints featuring the work by Robert Carey (Millarworld), Jerome Eyquem (Heavy Metal), Rafa Garres (Jonah Hex), Aaron Pittman (Grimfish), Valentin Ramon (D4VE), John Rauch (Invincible), TERMINAL cover artist, Bob Rivard.\nPlus, we'll be featuring TWO really cool T-Shirts featuring our \"MAKING COMICS DANGEROUS AGAIN\" slogan and our \"#ExpectUs\" motto and IP logo.\nThis shirt was only available to high-end backers the first time around. We want everyone wearing this bad boy.\nWe will also have EXCLUSIVE One-of-a-Kind artwork from Jerome Eyquem for our high-end rewards where the backer can CHOOSE which TERMINAL characters Jerome draws for them.\nAND...last but not least, YOU can become a TERMINAL Cover Art Character on your very own 11x17\" High-Resolution Print drawn by one of our artists. There will be extremely limited quantities of these prints so grab those packages while you can.\nHigh-End Backers can also look forward to Signed Copies of HUNTER BLACK trades from Justin Peniston & William Orr, Signed Blood Queen Omnibuses from Troy Brownfield, and Signed Copies of NO ANGEL #1 from Eric Palicki.\nRETAILER LOVE!\nThis time around we will also have retailer-friendly reward boxes that will provide select retailers with copies of ALL FOUR available issues of TERMINAL Pulp Anthology (as well as one copy of each Ultra Rare Guest Artist Variant) along with a couple of prints and stickers to package with each copy of Terminal #1 for one reasonable price. Each retailer who supports us will also have their info featured on a RETAILER SUPPORT PAGE.\nWe will also feature a \"DELUXE\" version of this Retailer Package that will partner at least localized member of the Imminent Press crew with their store to host a signing of copies of TERMINAL.\nWHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT IMMINENT PRESS?\nBecause we believe in making comics for everyone. We are pooling our talent to feature a wide spectrum of talented men and women from across the industry and from all over the world.

Gonzo\nA resonant, neglected slice of American history is told for the first time, in graphic-novel format. Featuring art by Jason \u201cGonzo\u201d Gonzalez, edited by Claire Napier, and script and lettering by me, Henry Barajas: journalist, comedian, author, native Tucsonan, and great-grandson of the story\u2019s main character, Tata Rambo, aka Ramon Jaurigue. \nLa Voz De Mayo (Page 1) by J. Gonzo\nLa Voz De M.A.Y.O. is the true story of Ramon Jaurigue, an orphan and WWII veteran who co-founded the Mexican, American, Yaqui, and Others (M.A.Y.O.) organization, which successfully lobbied the Tucson City Council to improve living and working conditions for members of the local Pascua Yaqui tribe. Largely due to Ramon\u2019s activism, both in M.A.Y.O. in and with Model Cities Program, Yaqui were successfully integrated into the expanding metropolis of Tucson: families bought property, roads and sidewalks were built, and sewage systems installed. Ramon and his colleagues even founded a night school to help adults learn English and established the region\u2019s first low-cost clinic to offer birth control.\nLa Voz De Mayo (Page 4) by J. Gonzo\nUntiring in their efforts for equal rights and opportunities, Ramon and M.A.Y.O.eventually secured official U.S. government recognition for the Pascua Yaqui tribe. Local government didn\u2019t give up their plans to bridge Tucson to the west coast and taxpayer dollars to the Old Pueblo\u2019s indigenous people without a fight. The Carter Administration was skeptical of the Yaqui\u2019s eligibility, so it took compromise from Ramon and the tribe. While trying to keep 12,000 families together, Ramon struggled with taking care of his own family life.  \nLa Voz De Mayo (Page 9) by J. Gonzo\nLa Voz De Mayo (Page 23) by J. Gonzo\nUtilizing newspaper clippings, interviews with surviving MAYO members, and Ramon\u2019s authored articles, La Voz De M.A.Y.O. dramatizes the remarkable life and achievements of my great-grandfather\u2014and in so doing, tells the story not just of a single man, but of a family, a tribe, a nation.\nIt's an honor to follow in my great-grandfather's footsteps. He was a writer in his own right by documenting what was happening in the community and trying to do something about it. I wish I could've finished this before he passed away last October. But I'm confident he was proud of my and my family's effort.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere has been a lot of time dedicated to making this first issue possible.

With over 100 pages of story and many more pages of extra features, Dead Legends is the martial arts throwback series that hits harder than a kick to the skull, brought to you by a group of dedicated comics pros who are prepared to deliver excitement with every turn of the page. \nYan\nWith brutal martial arts battles and an action-packed tale, Dead Legends starts with the story of Yan, who enters a martial arts tournament to avenge the murder of her husband. Her plan is to infiltrate the tournament grounds, eliminate the killer and make a speedy exit. But quick revenge isn\u2019t in Yan\u2019s future, and soon she\u2019s facing down the most hardened challengers the tournament has to offer, cracking heads and moving through the ranks as she fights her way toward her main target.\nFor an idea of what we'll be creating, check out this preview:\nAs the story progresses, we're introduced to a cast of characters that make Dead Legends more involved than your run-of-the-mill bracket & tier fight tale. From Damon, the champion who has grown tired of winning every battle he fights; to Red Death, the assassin who must enter the tournament to reach her target; to Stalk and Ward, two tournament fighters who get caught up in the struggles that Yan faces, each character in Dead Legends adds a little more to a story that has as explosive an ending as each of the battles that occur throughout the series. \nBlind Tiger Logo\nThis series has been at the forefront of James' and Gavin's minds for over a year, and while other projects have come and gone, Dead Legends has always been a story they both knew they would tackle. Now that day has come. With your backing, this labor of love will have the focus and attention it deserves from an extremely talented list of professionals. \nBeyond that, you get to experience the journey of the creative team through updates, from the happiness as more of the series gets completed to the successes gained as wider recognition for a story that we all feel so passionately toward begins to ramp up. Your help in creating this series will be  appreciated more than we can say.\nFINANCES \nFinances for this book are the main thing that have kept us from moving forward on our own. While Gavin and James are happy to forego upfront payment, they wanted to make sure that the talents they were bringing to the project didn't have to make that same sacrifice. Because of that, the bulk of the money brought in through this campaign will be used to pay for coloring, lettering and editing. The rest of the funds will be put toward printing and shipping costs, fees, reward fulfillment and taxes.\nIn this way, we will be able to create a visually and narratively amazing series while generating both a lot of buzz and a substantial readership that far surpasses what we are able to attract during the campaign. \nWe love this series and these characters, and can't wait to create a comic that will live up to the vision we have for it and them. \nTHE DEAD LEGENDS TEAM\n\u2022 JAMES MADDOX - Writing\nWith titles that include Metaphorical Her, Dead Legends, Clown, The Dead & Eccentrix, writer James Maddox has created a range of the most dynamic stories in indie comics.

I've also created and backed many Kickstarters. \nBilly The Kit is a supernatural comic book set in the old west that follows the epic saga of an orphaned rabbit hunting down the tornado god that killed his family. You can read more about it in an interview Barry and I conducted with COMIC FRONTLINE BY CLICKING HERE\nI know, I KNOW, how the HECK is a rabbit going to kill a Tornado God? What even is a Tornado God? Talking animals in the Wild West? This concept is bonkers! Yep, we know and that's why we created it. \nOnce a reader (that's you) takes this comic into their lives, they enter a world of active imagination, and go on adventures featuring what is sure to be their favorite new character BILLY THE KIT! \nMeet the profanity-spewing martial arts master; Luther the Goat! Meet poor Billy Langam, the sole survivor of a vicious attack that claimed the lives of his entire family. \nWhy was this sickly, skinny rabbit prone to infection spared such a gruesome fate? What makes him so special?\nThe answers lie within this 32-PAGE FULL-COLOR introduction to the fantastic world of Billy The Kit, where a bunny relies on faith, firearms, and Kung Fu to wage war against outlaws, desperados, and the pagan gods of a bygone era.  That sounds like fun right? Well, it is a lot of fun! There's even a FaceBook page for it HERE: @billythekitcomic where you can get updates and see a bunch of behind the scenes video of Barry illustrating and inking the book! \nAlso included in this book is the 8-page teaser trailer developed to show at conventions. \nBE WARNED, Billy The Kit might look all cute and cuddly but is not a book for children - this is for MATURE READERS. The language is salty and the blood is red...and also, salty. \nIt might also be what might happen if you put equal parts Bugs Bunny, Django Unchained, and a dash of Jack Kirby into one comic book. \nIMPORTANT NOTE! \nThe book is finished. Pencils, inks, colors, letters and all that great stuff!  That means if we are funded we move directly to printing, packaging, and shipping, which could take 6-8 weeks. However, if it takes less time then that the books will ship to you as soon as they are ready to be mailed! ALSO, and perhaps more importantly, this is the only comic where you can see a gory Goat V.S. Sasquatch deathmatch!\nWHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?\nIllustrator Barry McClain Jr. and digital painter Slamet Mujiono are compensated for their hard work in bringing this comic to life on the page and screens for all of you amazing people to enjoy. \nAfter that, the funds are allocated for printing, packaging, shipping, and supplies as well as Kickstarter taxes and processing fees. Not surprisingly those expenses add up quickly.\nIf we're fortunate enough to raise more than our goal, we'll use what's left over to make more Billy The Kit comics! Ideally, the long-term goal is to take the book to a publisher and tell stories for years to come. First things first though we want to make issue #1 a success.\n Check out the reward incentives on the right and images below for details. \nSuper Deluxe 52-PAGE Kickstarter Exclusive Variant\nWe're only going to print 75 of these with this cover and the additional print material: The Script, Character Designs and this Alternate cover based on the reward print and original art! \nBilly The Kit Color Mini-Print\nA Gorgeous Mini-print in full color by series artist and co-creator Barry McClain Jr. With colors by Matt Northrup. \n Jonah Hex Paperbacks & Issue #1\nJonah Hex Trades\nOne of the most feared bounty hunters in the West... \nJonah Hex has spent his entire life roaming from town to town searching for his next paycheck and earning it with a fierceness that's earned him a reputation for being a stern dealer of frontier justice.

More so, if you saw a Nazi, you would want to punch that Nazi right across his face. ALWAYS PUNCH NAZIS is the next best thing to actually punching a Nazi.\nThis 44-page anthology addresses the Nazi-like racism that has been plaguing America for many years. The creators of Always Punch Nazis address rising issues in America and how to handle bigots who want to oppress various citizens. You will learn the most effective way to punch a Nazi, a historical adventure about what happens when you continuously turn the other cheek, how fighting for what's right can be passed down through many generations, and many more fun tales about standing up for what is right.\nFinal Cover\nJoin the Always Punch Nazis creative team by picking up a copy of this satirical graphic novel anthology. \nPrinted Books!\nWHO IS BEN FERRARI?\nAfter the horrific events in Charlottesville, Ben Ferrari, the CCO of Pilot Studios, approached his team with a challenge. He and Silas Dixon wanted to do something to help battle the growing racial divide in the United States. This mission led to the birth of Always Punch Nazis. \"Who wouldn't want to punch a Nazi?\" quickly became the motto for the book you are purchasing. \nWHERE DO THE FUNDS GO?\nThe creators of Always Punch Nazis donated their time and talent to create the book you are purchasing. The funds to this campaign will go to Kickstarter, the printing cost of the books, shipping supplies, and postal fees.   \nA one page story from Kurt Belcher and Luis Rivera!\n HILARY BARTA\nHilary Barta joined the Always Punch Nazis team, contributing the artwork for the back cover of the book. Here's a little information about this fantastic artist. \nCartoonist Hilary Barta writes and draws comic books. In recent years he has contributed to SpongeBob Squarepants and The Simpsons line of comics, including The Simpsons\u2019 Treehouse of Horror. His art and writing have also appeared in Garbage Pail Kids, Heavy Metal, Creepy, Fear Agent, A-1 and The Goon. He's probably best known for his humor and parody comics, such as What The--?!, Plastic Man and Stupid, and as the co-creator of Splash Brannigan with Alan Moore at America's Best Comics. Barta began his career as inker on many comics for publishers including Image, Marvel, DC and Dark Horse.\nHilary Barta Back Cover.

With our powers combined we work every week to bring our vision to life one over-ambitious page at a time. With your help we created Volume 1. Now we\u2019re ready to print Kamikaze: Volume 2 AND a short one-off comic SoundBox! Let\u2019s make books together!    \n    Kamikaze is a webcomic that began its life as a pitch for an animated series. With a new update every Wednesday, the comic follows the style and story of its original vision. Last year through your help we printed Volume 1, and now we\u2019re ready to take Volume 2 to print! By supporting our Kickstarter you\u2019re helping us print our second graphic novel and the continue the story of Kamikaze! \n  Selected Pages from Kamikaze Vol. 2. Click to read Vol. 2 for free online!\n Kamikaze Volume 2 will be a softcover, 6 x 9in, perfect bound book. It\u2019ll have 110 double-sided pages which include the comic, a holiday mini comic, world building notes, beautiful splash art, character dossiers, development artwork, and an introduction by Afua Richardson (Nina Simone Award winning Artist behind Marvel\u2019s World of Wakanda, Attack on Titan, DC\u2019s All Star Batman, Vertigo\u2019s MadMax, Top Cow\u2019s Genius, and more).\n In addition to printing Volume 2 we\u2019re also using funds to print our second Wall Tale! Kamikaze Wall Tales are short one off comics that follow the adventures of Kamikaze. \n In an effort to grab a highly prized target Kamikaze has to dive into the Outer Trinity club scene. The tables are turned when Kamikaze finds herself getting in the way of an ambitious young girl who has the skills to make it big. \n  Soundbox is currently still running at KamikazeComic.com!\n   The good news is all the hard work is done! The art is finished, additional writing is done and all the content for the comic is being laid out for print. At this point all we just need the funds to put ink on paper! Because we\u2019re printing both a graphic novel and a floppy together, things are a bit more pricey this time around.\nAll comic printing will be done by the same printing company we worked with for Volume 1. They have over 20 years of experience, so you can expect the same gorgeous books as the first time! Because this printer is local to our area we\u2019ll be able to get your comics to you faster!\n\n\n When a risky delivery blows up in Markesha Nin\u2019s face she\u2019s hell-bent on doing whatever it takes to keep herself and her father alive. With a vicious gang hot on her trail Markesha\u2019s got two choices: Leave and risk death in the dangerous wastes beyond the city, or stay and take a dubius job from a treacherous benefactor. It\u2019s a race against the clock as Markesha does everything in her power to get out of trouble. The Razors are hungry for retribution, the only safe passage to a new life is closing, and Orson Stykes isn\u2019t letting her out of his sight.\nNeed to get caught up on Volume 1 fast? Watch this fantastic read through by the Comicstorian!\n       Kamikaze Volume 2 is the second installment of an epic science fiction saga, a taut political thriller, and a high-flying action series with an intimate dramatic heart.The story continues as tension mounts and Markesha must make a crucial decision.\n                   The comic is set in a world 200 years after a plague wipes out virtually all plant life on Earth. The whole world turned to dust, billions perished, and civilization as we know it was redefined. Survivors call it \u201cThe Withering.\"\n    Remaining vegetation came under forceful protection of city-states, lead by corporations that evolved into feudal royalty. Survivors settled around these protected areas to escape stretches of abandoned wasteland where only the most robust forms of life could survive the erratic weather, wind storms, and dust-bowl conditions. City-states jockey for position among themselves while searching for more farmland, resources, and any weapon to destroy their competitors.\n For the millions of poor, food is more precious than gold. For the few highborn, information is more precious than food.\nWhen we started working on Kamikaze as a comic we wanted to create a comic that looked \u2018animated\u2019. Using complex backgrounds, cell shaded art, dynamic lighting and expressive character designs gives the comic a unique \u2018animated\u2019 appearance. \n Each page goes through a multi-step process between three artists: Alan does rough layouts and backgrounds, Havana creates character designs and lettering, and Carrie takes the lead on writing while doing ink and color work.\nThe weekly page production process\n  Influenced by the works of Greg Weisman (Gargoyles,Young Justice), Bruce Timm (Batman the Animated Series) and film works such as Ghost in the Shell, Blade Runner and Mad Max, Kamikaze\u2019s unique style was created as a love letter to some of the best in animation and sci-fi media. When fans say \u201cIt feels like I\u2019m reading a movie!\u201d it makes us smile because that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going for. \n        How to get an Add-on:\n1. Click the \"Modify my pledge\" button (or \"Back this Project\")\n2. Add the amount from the Add-on to your pledge, and confirm.\n3. When the campaign ends, we will send a survey to confirm what Add-ons you want.\n    We really want you to get your rewards as quickly as possible so you can enjoy them! However, there are some things that could prevent us from making sure that happens. To prevent snags or delays in your shipping rewards follow these helpful tips to make sure you get your comics quickly! \nThe email address you have listed for Kickstarter MUST be one you use regularly.\nOnce funding has ended, you\u2019ll be sent a survey to fill out that will tell us where to send your rewards. If you do not receive an email with the backer survey please check your spam or updates folders. \nPlease make sure that your credit card information is up to date. If your card information is not current your pledge will be declined when funding has ended. That means you\u2019ll be dropped as a backer! If this should happen accidentally please contact us for alternate payment options.\nMake sure your physical address information is correct. We will copy and paste your information straight from the survey, so make sure all of your survey info is correct.\nIf your rewards are returned due to a bad address, our team will contact you and you\u2019ll have to repay the shipping cost. If your address changes after you\u2019ve filled out the survey but before your rewards have shipped, please update your address in the backer survey and send us a message. \nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nRead the comic for free, get up to date on the latest news, or send us questions through:\n                              ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUnlike our first Kickstarter we\u2019re earlier in the process of book layout. While we\u2019re confident we can get the book laid out quickly, backer rewards will likely arrive somewhat slower than they did last time. \n\nWe\u2019re also planning on sending out all rewards at once vs sending the book alone and then the other rewards separately. We did this last time but it put an even larger dent in the shipping costs than anticipated. This is a mistake we don\u2019t plan on making again, as we\u2019re committed to using the funds we\u2019ve been given wisely.\n\nSpeaking of rewards, this is our first time doing stickers and enamel pins! The designs for these items are finished, but we\u2019re still going to be on a learning curve for the printing/casting process. \n\nFortunately we\u2019ve been able to tap into the experience and know-how of experts on all levels. Our book printer has over two decades of experience producing work for a wide range of clients, including comics. Located less than 30 minutes from the team, they have proven to be fantastic collaborators and their turnaround time for printing is ridiculously fast. Once the book layout is finished on our side and the printer gives the go ahead, we\u2019ll have books in hand in less than 12 business days. The sticker and pin folks are established, well respected vendors who\u2019ve been working in the business for more than 15 years. Their expertise should ensure that the product you get will be quality work. \n\nWe were very lucky to have access to several veterans on successful Kickstarters on our last project. Through them we learned about fulfillment pitfalls and strategies that helped us get rewards out in a timely, secure manner. This time we think we can do an even better job getting everything out to you at once.\n\nAll the artwork has been done. The book layout work is in process so there shouldn\u2019t be months and months of waiting. We have a quote in writing from the printer, so there won\u2019t be any cost surprises. Just like last time, once the book layout is finished, everything will be set to go to print!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thanks", "descp": "Thanks for your support!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Backer Pack", "descp": "Just the digital stuff!

A child of prophecy is on the road to fulfilling her destiny... Niobe: She is Life.\nWith a world divided who do you turn to?  \nBetween two warring nations, in the heart of Western Ujoa, there is a haven to those who have lost their way. Some say you can rebuild your mind and spirit upon the mountains of Ugoma. For a Half-Elven (Sin-Galemren) girl with off-colored eyes, it is a chance to flee a dark past, and rest safely within the secret monatery of her ancestors. But you cannot run from destiny, or hide from the Devil.  \nSet within the original fantasy world of Asunda, Niobe: She is Life is a coming of age Beauty and the Beast love story threaded with murder and mystery that leads to all out war.\nShe is Life Preview Pages\nAnd the upcoming sequel... She is Death.\nThere is nothing more dangerous and beautiful than a wild woman.\nNiobe: She is Death is a tale of hard truths and revelations for a young woman who is tired of running. Niobe has lost her faith \u2013 in humanity and the world around her. In the sequel to Niobe: She is Life, we will witness Niobe\u2019s journey from heartbroken teenager to warrior woman, set to take on a world that would see her dead. Narrowly escaping a violent prison death, she learns that girls like her are being abducted. But the hunted becomes the hunter when she allies herself with a savage mentor who teaches her how to take vengeance on those who prey on the helpless \u2013 by being a bounty hunter herself. \nNiobe will hunt down and capture human traffickers, rescuing the victims for the families who seek her help. But each step takes her further down the path toward a destiny she did not ask for and a burden she does not want.\nShe is Death Covers and Preview Pages\nAnd that's only the beginning!\nSo many to choose from...\nReward packages and pledge levels are on the right, but here's a little more detail about the various items you can get.

In She is Life, one of the main plot points is a character accused of a crime based on the color of his skin, so we can't think of a better charity to work with than The Innocence Project.\nThe Innocence Project is a non-profit legal organization that is committed to exonerating wrongly convicted people through the use of DNA testing and to reforming the criminal justice system to prevent future injustice. \nWe will donate 10% of our proceeds after the costs of printing and fulfillment with a minimum donation of $1,000 if the campaign is successful. Help us help others and get some great books in the process. And consider donating directly.

On the wrong side of 40 after turfing out of the military, he\u2019s drifted from town to town and a series of dead-end kitchen jobs and quasi-legal freelance work. But his longtime dream of owning his own restaurant has finally come true, back in his hometown of Portland. Rock should be happier than ever, but the reality of his dream has a nasty habit of dragging him down. His customers are uncultured savages, he's not making enough money to pay back his loan sharks and they\u2019re forcing him to do something morally iffy or they'll take his truck. And possibly his thumbs. \n Harper Marbury isn\u2019t exactly a thief. She works half a dozen side hustles to pay her rent at the Split Apple Co-Op Loft where she shares overcrowded floorspace with dozens of spare changers, young families, traveling musicians, burnouts and scam artists. Developing a love of cooking by throwing the random ingredients found in the Co-Op\u2019s fridge every day together to feed her roommates, Harper\u2019s been nurturing a dream of what she could do in a real kitchen, with real ingredients. When she breaks into Rock\u2019s truck, mostly it\u2019s to get out of the rain, but when he doesn\u2019t show up, she opens up for business. Just to try it out. Just to see what it's like to cook in a real kitchen, with real ingredients.\nWhen Rock busts Harper, he hires her on instead of kicking her to the curb, inducting her into the arcane rituals of food cart society, a land where every cart collective is a gang vying for territory and rivalries are resolved with food truck duels rolling down the middle of Hawthorne with baseball bats. While Harper learns the ropes, Rock begins his job for the Bardems, searching for the identity of a rogue food truck operator who\u2019s invading the Bardem\u2019s territories. Together with Harper, as his conscience and helping hand, they\u2019ll navigate a world of secret menus, food pirates, culinary femme fatales, curmudgeonly dads, shadowy figures, creeps, foodies and 5 star ratings, trying to uncover the secret before the Bardems burn Rock\u2019s world down.\nSHORT ORDER CROOKS is a 5-issue, full-color comic that\u2019s equal parts comedy, crime story and cooking comic. The first issue is due out in June 2017.  We have future arcs we would like to do to tell the complete story, but we need your help to fund this first arc and help us find an audience for our weird little book.\nThe Creators \nEisner-nominated writer Christopher Sebela (High Crimes, Heartthrob, Injustice Ground Zero, We(l)come Back, I Live in A Clown Motel) \nArtist George Kambadais (Grave Lilies, The Double Life of Miranda Turner) \nColorist Lesley Atlansky (Kid Sherlock, Team Spirit, Baroque Pop Anthology, High Crimes)\nShort Order Crooks was initially created with Kelly Sue DeConnick (Bitch Planet, Pretty Deadly) back in 2010. After many years of other work getting in the way, Kelly Sue giving me her blessing to carry on without her and publishers reacting in mild confusion at the pitch, it is a comic that can only happen if we do it ourselves. We're asking for your support. Which is where Kickstarter comes in...\nThe Kickstarter\nAll money raised will go towards paying artist George Kambadais and colorist Lesley Atlansky's page rates for all five issues (120 pages) of SHORT ORDER CROOKS and to give backers some unique rewards. Since this is 100% creator-owned, there's no publisher's financing propping us up. The 15 pages we've done so far have been made on faith and spare time. Our Kickstarter goal is the bare minimum needed to bridge the gap that allows George and Lesley to be paid enough to commit to working on pages full time and to get copies of all five issues in the hands of readers. If you've liked any of our previous work or you support indie, creator-owned books or if you're looking for a comic that is a little off the normal path, we have a book (and some rewards) for you.\nThe Rewards\nDIGITAL COPIES\n- We'll send you a link to pdf/cbr files of each issue as we complete them.\nPRINT COPIES- The print issues of SHORT ORDER CROOKS will only be available during this campaign as part of a Kickstarter-based print run. All copies will be signed by writer Christopher Sebela and numbered and mailed out upon completion of the issue.\nTHE SECRET MENU\n- A digital pdf/cbr with almost 100 pages of behind-the-scenes process and artwork of issue #1. The Secret Menu will include the full script, as well as George\u2019s inks and Lesley\u2019s colors without lettering. Concept and sketch art, the original series pitch, character descriptions, a digital copy of issue 1 with notes and commentary and more. Almost all this material is exclusive to the Secret Menu. Perfect for completists or anyone interested in digging deeper into the comics creative process.\nVARIANT COVERS- Each issue will be released with a variant, with cover art provided by a different artist every month. Our amazing roster of artists includes Claire Roe, Brian Level, Jonathan Brandon Sawyer, Robert Wilson IV and Chris Visions.

No murderers.\nIF YOU WANT TO BUNDLE SOMETHING WITH ANOTHER REWARD LEVEL, PLEASE MESSAGE US AND WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.\nSOME FINE PRINT\nDue to ordering requirements possibly leaving us with leftover stock, that stock will be sold after the campaign with preference given to retailers and then backers, all profits made going back into the book.\nPrint versions of Issue 1 will go out within a month of the campaign's completion, while we await the money to reach us and begin making orders. The remaining 4 issues will be coming out every 4-5 weeks with an eye towards completion around October or November of 2017. Updates will be provided on Kickstarter on a regular (no less than monthly) basis. \nThe Money\nWe are looking to raise $16,000 minimum to pay artist George Kambadais and colorist Lesley Atlansky for their work on the book. At this minimum we raise, they are working at reduced rates and I am writing and lettering the book for zero money. If we can reach our stretch goal of $24,000, everyone will get paid their full page rate. \nThere are no unnecessary costs in the mix, this is the absolute cheapest we can make a 5-issue comic series for while still paying everyone a proper rate for their work. Here is how the money breaks down. It's pretty simple.\n  The Stretch Goals\nStretch goals are where campaigns get into trouble. We're doing our best to avoid that by not promising anything crazy. To be completely transparent, we would love to go above the goal not so we can get gold edges on our pages or embed holograms into the pdfs, but so that both George and Lesley can be paid their full working rates and I, hopefully, can be paid some compensation for writing, lettering and running the campaign. So we're trying to make this fun, but also not something that we actually have to pay a ton of money to make happen. In that spirit...\n$18,000 - George, Lesley and I will record a director's commentary for all five issues, where we talk over each other and maybe bring up an interesting factoid every now and then. Listen to us slowly get tired of each other since we all spend most of our time working quietly by ourselves. Everyone who has given at the $5 and up levels will get mp3s of this to listen to as you read along. George and Lesley will get paid more.\n$20,000 - Everyone who gives at the $5 and up level will receive a pdf book of recipes from famous comic book creators. Eat like the stars! George and Lesley will get paid more. I will get a small payment.\n$22,000 - An illustrator will be hired to fancy up the comic creator's cookbook.George and Lesley will get their complete page rates. I will get a little more money.\n$24,000 - Wow, we totally don't have to worry about anything at this point. Thank you. That's very nice of you. We will hug you at a con. The entire creative team will be properly compensated for their time, which hardly ever happens.\nFuture Stretch Goals\nAny money raised beyond the 24k stretch goal will go strictly to paying the creators and put towards production of the 2nd arc of SHORT ORDER CROOKS. Rewards at this level and above will mostly be digital, perhaps with some slightly nicer paper stock for the print issues.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll three of us are experienced in our respective fields in comics. We've hit deadlines for all kinds of publishers on time and we've worked on personal projects with similar swiftness and focus. We know what we're doing. We've got everything set on our end. The first issue is almost completed and will be done and ready to deliver within a week or two of the campaign wraps. We're doing our best to hit the ground running and have all five issues to you by October or November of this year.\n\nThis being comics and life being life, delays of a month or two might possibly be in the cards down the road, but updates and explanations will be quickly provided via Kickstarter as to any changes in delivery dates of issues and/or rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "#1 Issue - Digital", "descp": "\u2022 Our infinite thanks.\n\u2022 A pdf/cbr of the 24-page issue #1\n\u2022 You'll be thanked in the back.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}], "stat": ["54 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "#1 Issue - Print + Secret Menu PDF", "descp": "\u2022 Our immeasurable thanks.\n\u2022 Print copy of Issue #1 (numbered/signed by writer Christopher Sebela)\n\u2022 A pdf/cbr of Issue #1.\n\u2022 The Secret Menu: A digital pdf/cbr with almost 100 pages of behind-the-scenes process and artwork.

We have crossed $10,000 and unlocked a new Float stretch goal. The Float prestige format hardcover edition will be now be printed exclusively for our Kickstarter backers. This edition of the book will not be available anywhere else.\nWHO GETS THE HARDCOVER?\nFloat backers at $25 and up will now receive the hardcover edition of the book.\nEarly Bird reward package backers will also receive the hardcover upgrade.\nCAN I GET THE HARDCOVER IF MY REWARD LEVEL IS UNDER $25?\nIf you're a \"Just Float\" reward level backer and you'd like to get the hardcover simply add $10 to your pledge amount or upgrade to any reward level $25 or higher.\nWhen you upgrade, you will also receive all stretch goals unlocked including Float signed & sketched by Howie plus the signed album on CD.\nLike 40 million others, I suffer from anxiety. This book details its effects on my life, my loves and my career. It\u2019s the most personal story I\u2019ve ever told but I hope that many of you will be able to relate to it. I\u2019m hoping it helps you because making it has helped me. It has given me a brand new perspective on my illness.\nIt\u2019s not a subject of shame. It\u2019s a symbol of strength.\nWe don\u2019t have to let anxiety drown us. We can float.\nFloat is told from the perspective of three characters which act as symbolic stand ins for my personality. Their tales all converge with a confrontation of the glass ceiling overhead.\n In its discussion of anxiety, this graphic memoir also reinterprets the glass ceiling. While the term is generally associated with women and minorities in their careers, it easily applies to those who deal with mental illness in their profession, and the stigma it carries. In the book, I have illustrated the ceiling as a physical threat.\nWe are now unlocking some amazing stretch goals on our way to the Float hardcover edition!\n    I am excited to present this book to the public, as it is a departure from my previous work and a personal testimony of mental illness. I am an award-winning graduate of Pratt Institute and a freelance illustrator. My first graphic novel, Mr. Scootles, was published in 2008 by Alterna Comics. In April of 2009, my series Tara Normal launched as a popular weekly webcomic. It was awarded the 2009 WRCA Reader\u2019s Choice Award for Best New Comic and appeared in TAPS Paramagazine, the official publication of the show Ghost Hunters on SyFy. I won the 2016 Spacie Award for Best Independent Comic Artist. In addition to illustration work for clients such as CBS Radio, T-Mobile, and two holiday themed pieces for the official Walking Dead website, I have also illustrated stories in the comic book collections Nightmare World, Tales of Mr. Rhee and Love Stories (To Die For) written by Dirk Manning and published by Devil's Due Entertainment. \nDuring this exciting new art project, I\u2019ve collaborated with my friend, musician Victor Guest. Victor is a brilliant artist and working with him to expand the dimensions and scope of this project has been a dream come true. He\u2019s creating a soundtrack to accompany this book. It will allow readers to experience Float in a unique way.\nAs part of this art project, my wife Shelley has created YourGlassCeiling.com. The website gives people the chance to really see into my life and how it's shaped this project. We're even giving people the chance to share their personal experiences on the Breakthrough Moments section of the site.\nYou can also view full pages of artwork from Float at this link: http://yourglassceiling.com/category/making-of/the-art-of-floating/\nWith your help, Float will become a unique visual and audio artistic presentation. \nAll of our rewards are Kickstarter exclusives and will not be available anywhere else. We have set up multiple rounds of stretch goals so that if we raise the necessary money Float will become a Kickstarter exclusive prestige format hardcover edition just for Float backers! We have to unlock all of them to achieve this ultimate goal.\nHere are some of the great rewards we are offering. \n               ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I'm writing this, the artwork for Float is 90% completed so any risk is minimal.
