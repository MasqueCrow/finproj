Well, we've made them, so you can have them too!\nEach of these elements really do feel totally different from one another.\nIron - It's density immediately makes it feel super heavy compared to say, aluminum or titanium. This material alloyed with a little bit of carbon, makes steel which is nearly twice as strong as aluminum.\nCopper - Slightly more dense than iron, yet almost twice as weak. This material shines in it's thermal and electrical conductivity.\nAluminum - Lightweight, yet strong. This material is extremely popular for applications where lightweight strength is needed.\nTitanium - The most 'exotic' of the bunch. This material is often used in lightweight applications where aluminum just isn't strong enough.\nCopper has over twice the density of aluminum\nQuality:\nEach cube and the stand is made from high purity billet, machined on a CNC mill with extreme precision. After machining, the cubes are then polished prior to being laser engraved. \nHow large are the cubes?Each Cube is approximately 1\" x 1\" x 1\". \nCalipers Measuring the Cubes\nHow pure are the cubes?\nAll the cubes are greater than or approximately equal to 90% purity. \n\"Fe\" is low-carbon steel (~96% pure Iron). \n\"Al\" is 6061 aerospace grade aluminum (96-98% pure aluminum). \n\"Ti\" is aerospace grade Ti-6-4 titanium (~90% titanium).\n \"Cu\" is C110 (~99% copper).\nDon't iron and copper oxidize/patina/rust?\nAll metals oxidize under certain conditions, but you can easily prevent this from taking place. That said, the copper and iron will form a beautiful patina over time if you allow it to take place. The iron cube is technically low-carbon steel (~96% Iron) so if you would like to keep a patina from happening, be sure to regularly apply a very thin layer of oil to the \"Fe\" cube. As for the copper cube, a patina can be kept from forming by cleaning with vinegar, lemon juice, or alcohol.\nWill you deliver on time and as promised?\nWe take our reputation very seriously and we always aim to deliver a high quality product in a timely manner.

As the campaign winds down, you should definitely check out the stretch goals!\n- - -\n My name is Ngozi and I'm the creator of Check, Please!, an online comic about hockey, college, and the frequent baking of pies. Since the summer of 2013, Check, Please! has updated about every other month with complete, fully-illustrated episodes. I successfully Kickstarted Year One and now I\u2019m back to print Year Two and reprint Year One!\nCheck, Please! follows Eric \u201cBitty\u201d Bittle, a former Georgia junior figure skating champion, vlogger extraordinaire, and master baker who gets a scholarship playing hockey at Samwell University. Not only is Bitty bite-sized for a hockey player, he is not at all a bro and has one great fear: getting checked\u2014or hit\u2014while on the ice.\nThe first volume of Check, Please follows Bitty\u2019s freshman year. Over the course of the school year at Samwell, Bitty manages to befriend his bro-y teammates and find a home, all while dealing with the brooding Jack Zimmermann, captain of the Samwell men\u2019s hockey team and former hockey prodigy.  \nBitty\u2019s sophomore year is the the volume we\u2019re Kickstarting! From moving into the Samwell Hockey Haus at the beginning of the year, to saying goodbye to seniors at graduation, Bitty's life changes a ton during his second year at Samwell.\nAnd you can read all about it here!\nThe goal of this project is to collect the comics from the second volume of Check, Please!\u2014aka, Bitty\u2019s sophomore year\u2014into a full-color printed book. Not only will the finished book compile the main comics, it will also include extra features such as concept pages and a wealth of author notes\u2014all of which are book exclusive! I\u2019ll also be reprinting Year One which is currently sold out.\nThe last campaign was incredible. It was the largest project I have ever undertaken and I learned a lot from it. I want to make sure that there are as few complications and delays as possible this time around.\nAnother change for this campaign is that instead of signing books themselves I'll be signing sticker bookplates for any physical editions. For the Year One kickstarter, I had to fly to Austin, TX and sign books for two days straight--this slowed down the shipping process immensely. By doing signed bookplates that are included with your physical copy, you can apply the bookplate yourself or tuck it inside if you prefer!\n        \u2606THE BOOKS - You can get Year Two and Year One in digital, softcover, or hardcover formats! Both books come with author notes and extras not seen on the web. You can even get physical editions that come with signed bookplates! \n\u2606 PRINT SETS - A set of FOUR (4) Year Two themed postcard sized (4x6\u201d) prints. The images above are examples, the final prints will be different.\n\u2606 BITTY'S SAMWELL JERSEY - That's right, you can own Bitty's Samwell jersey! I'll be working extensively with a real apparel company to create number 15's white Samwell sweater!\n\u2605 ARTIST BOOKPLATE - Custom bookplates are bookplates that I design, print, illustrate on, and glue into a book with PVA bookbinding glue. This is as custom as it gets!\n\u2605 DIGITAL COMMISSIONS - A high-res, full-color PG-Rated digital illustration of up to two Check, Please characters with a simple background. Please have your commission idea ready. I'll shoot you a message during the campaign for approval. If I'm not comfortable with the content or rating, you'll be able to lower or cancel your pledge before being charged. Thanks you!\n\u2605 BE-A-WELLIE!  - Get drawn into the comic as a background character at Samwell University and become part of the Check, Please universe!

Grab a seat, class is back in session.\nPage-a-day calendars. The 2017 version!\nnearly entirely different from the previous calendar!\nLet's start at the beginning.\nI'm Dr. Dante Shepherd. For the past eight years, I've been producing Surviving The World, a daily photocomic with a chalkboard and labcoat and lessons touching on just about everything (science, literature, creeping people out, you name it). The comic is a mix of humor and education combined with complete destruction of the fourth wall. In my real life, I'm an actual professor, and in STW, I pretend to be.  And the comic is a whole lot funnier!\nOne of over 2800 STW comics\nPage-a-day calendars?\nWe previously made a page-a-day calendars for 2014 through a Kickstarter, and they came out friggin' amazing.  6.25 inches by 6.25 inches, weighty, full color, utterly beautiful.\nThe 2014 ones came out friggin' amazing. So let's make new ones for 2017! With new content!\nYou could plaster your door or your fridge with them.  You could plaster your dog with them.  The stand-alone content worked perfectly as a page-a-day calendar, and given that there are now over 2800 comics to choose from, you'll get a solid 365 days of content!\nNot only that, but these calendars will contain 50 ORIGINAL STW COMICS!  That's on top of pulling from the best of the previous 2800+ comics!\nLook at these beautiful pages! Let's do it again!\nAnd each page has other content to enjoy!  Besides a comic on each page you get:\n- a fake international holiday inspired by a real historical event for every single day of the year!\n- a rudimentary word-of-the-day, basically making your calendar two-calendars-in-one, but in this case, we reaffirm the quality of your present vocabulary!  Who needs to learn new words when you're already good at words!\n- a cloud name for each day of the year! Hurricane centers tell you what hurricanes are called and some weather channels tell you what winter storms are called, but this calendar goes even further and unilaterally tells you what the clouds themselves are named!\nWhat else?\nTo thank you for your contribution to the campaign, there are number of pretty cool rewards available at the different tiers, many of which will only be available through this Kickstarter. These rewards may even increase your happiness, which, hey, who doesn't want that?  \nWhat are some of these great rewards?\nWell, let's talk about them!\nRecognition on the Surviving the World site itself! (And you'll even get a nickname of questionable coolness!)\nA PDF form of the 2017 calendar!\nA hard copy of the 2017 calendar!\nA leftover hard copy of the 2014 calendar! \nMagnets depicting classic STW mazes to help hang up the pages of the calendar that you display!\nMaze for Magnet #1\nThe STW class report card printed on a whiteboard, for your own personal life assessment!\nInitial report card design!\nA STW-specialized black dry-erase board!\nA personalized mini-slate chalkboard with a permanent lesson, personalized for whatever subject matter you want!\nSomeone last time requested their slate lesson be about \"potatoes\"\nAn original maze painting on canvas, with colors of your choosing!\nI will even once again eat a pound of raisins (and hate every second of it and be utterly miserable in more ways than one that day), just like last time!\nThere are even crazy tier levels, like getting a ball of cat hair with your rewards, or having me draw a mustache on my face on every page!\nAnd may reward tiers include various combinations of these rewards!\nAnything else? \nActually, yes! There are a number of STW items which you can directly choose to include as a reward if you add it on to your backing tier. These can include additional calendars as well. First, select the reward tier that you're interested in, with the amount necessary to support the campaign at that tier. Then, make your donation an additional amount to reflect the add-on item that you wanted. This will cover the shipping of both items, too.\nThe pricing for the add-on items are as follows:  \nAn extra calendar = $25\nA set of 4 black-and-white STW mini-books containing lessons from the site, signed and personalized = $10\nA set of 12 STW squid-themed Christmas cards = $12\nA velociraptor USB containing over nearly 50 different velociraptor impressions = $15\nAn official STW labcoat = $40\nA signed official STW labcoat = $45\nStretch goals?\nIf we're fortunate enough to hit the target and keep on going from there, we will not only continue to improve the content of the calendar itself but also improve the content of the rewards that you receive!  So consider, if we break the following overall tiers:\n$27,500 \u2013 FLURRY OF CHALKDUST: the calendar will contain 12 new STW comics - ON TOP OF THE 50 ORIGINAL COMICS already part of the calendar!  So a total of 62 ORIGINAL COMICS!\n$30,000 \u2013 THE AUDIOBOOK: a digital recording of me reading the entire calendar will be provided to all backers\n$35,000 \u2013 THE SOUNDTRACK: a soundtrack listing to go with every calendar page will be provided to all backers\n$40,000 \u2013 REFRIGERATOR EXTRAVAGANZA: two additional magnets to the magnet set for every A-PLUS and higher level\n$45,000 - TO BE ANNOUNCED as we get closer \nSo fingers crossed!\nAll of this and all of that sounds awesome!\nI agree!  So thank you for your support!  You will love these calendars!\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe calendar design is complete, and most of the content is already prepared.

However, it doesn't matter how long or how short your text is \u2013 we can use an extract, or repeat your words across whichever product you choose.\nIf you fancy getting yourself (or a friend or loved one) a truly one-of-a-kind Litographs scarf or t-shirt, below you'll find some fun ideas we've come up with as inspiration if you're choosing the custom text option. As long as it's your own writing, you have permission to use it, or it's in the public domain \u2013 your imagination is the only limit!\nJust like our t-shirts, our new infinity scarves will be hand-pressed to order in Cambridge, MA. We use high-quality, 100% spun polyester to deliver the look and feel of cotton, while allowing for full color, all-over dye sublimation printing \u2013 your text will cover every inch! Dye sublimation printing produces vibrant, super soft, permanent prints that are guaranteed to never shrink or fade when machine washed.\nEvery Litographs design emerges from the text of a book. Just as the words on the pages of your favorite novel come alive in your imagination, so our products are designed to illustrate the memorable characters and scenes rooted in these words. We work closely with top artists to create a new visual experience for classic and contemporary works alike.\nFrom a distance, the artwork on our t-shirts, posters, totes \u2013 and now scarves \u2013 illustrates a theme, character, or setting from each book. Move closer and the text becomes fully legible!\nFind our full collection at litographs.com \u2013 we've been making art from books since 2011.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been printing text on clothing and accessories for 4 years, making improvements in quality each and every year.

For this, our 20th live show celebrating our 10th year of making movies funny, we're busy planning an amazing night of riffing and comedy with most of the original MST3K stars, including...\nRiffTrax regulars Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, Bill Corbett!\nPLUS confirmed special guest riffers:\nTrace Beaulieu, Frank Conniff, Mary Jo Pehl and Bridget Nelson, Jonah Ray and Joel Hodgson!\nRiffTrax Live: MST3K Reunion\nThanks to our generous backers, the MST3K Reunion show WILL take place on Tuesday, June 28th, 2016 in Minneapolis, MN - the birthplace of Mystery Science Theater 3000!\nRiffTrax Live: TIME CHASERS on May 5th!\nThe base goal for the Kickstarter is helping us fund ANOTHER super-cool event -- a RiffTrax Live show featuring an all-new riff on the best science-fiction film to come out of Vermont, TIME CHASERS! We've already secured the rights to this MST3K classic, and thanks to your generous donations, we've created a new widescreen HD transfer of the original movie in partnership with the film's creator, David Giancola.\nRiffTrax Live: Time Chasers\nTo fund this once-in-a-lifetime piece of MSTie History, we need your help. The cost to pull it off is beyond doing on our own, but with a little help from our fans, we can make it happen. In exchange, we've come up with some exciting rewards and VIP packages just for you. Since we met our base goal, that means 2 ADDITIONAL shows have been unlocked for 2016. Woohoo! We're still trying to figure out what those titles are, and are actively talking to potential movie partners right this very moment.\nSo friends, please join us (won't you?) for this hilarious adventure: the MST3K REUNION SHOW broadcast LIVE to hundreds of movie screens on June 28th; TIME CHASERS on May 5th, and two more potential shows later in 2016. With your help, this year could be the biggest one yet!\nWHAT'S THE REUNION SHOW GOING TO BE LIKE?\nThe MST3K Reunion Show will be a night to remember:  A cavalcade of goofy educational short films like the ones often riffed on the show, and that we continue to riff over at RiffTrax. Our old colleagues from MST3K will each join us on stage to joke around and riff a short or two. We may not have the puppets or costumes, but we will have a blast.\nThere'll be a ton of funny stuff which we're still figuring out, but we know for sure you'll get a night of amazing and hilarious shorts riffed of course by our own - Mike, Kevin and Bill. Bridget and Mary Jo, who have been a big hit on RiffTrax, will team up; Frank and Trace will dazzle you with their awesome comedic talents, and Jonah Ray and Joel Hodgson round out the cast as they riff a short together.\nThen, prepare yourselves for the grand finale: a SUPER RIFF-A-PALOOZA with all the guests at once!\nThe whole thing will be filmed live in front of a big crowd at the State Theater in downtown Minneapolis, and simulcast to 700+ theaters all across the U.S. (and, if possible, Canada!). Then MST3K fans all across North America will meet up in theaters to enjoy the show! \nWe'll also sponsor a cosplay contest, with winners to be announced live during the show that very night!\nWHO WE ARE\nThe guys at RIFFTRAX have been providing hilarious movie commentary for years. First as writers and stars of the cult TV comedy show MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000  \u2013 and then online since 2006, as RIFFTRAX \u2013 Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett have taken on movies bad and not-so-bad, with one and only one mission: to make them funny.\nRiffTrax has written and performed comic riffs for over 400 titles that range from major Hollywood blockbusters, to obscure B-movies and educational short films. We've even been on TV on the National Geographic Channel, riffing zany animal shows. You also might have caught us on Comedy Central's @midnight last June. Oh, you did? Well then POINTS!!! And that's not all - we just recently announced an amazing new RiffTrax app that magically syncs our Riffs to the biggest blockbuster movies!\nCelebrity guests on various RiffTrax offerings have included Neil Patrick Harris, \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, Bob Odenkirk, David Cross, Paul F. Tompkins, Joel McHale, Jonathan Coulton, Andy Richter, Kristen Schaal, John Hodgman, Mythbuster Adam Savage, Maria Bamford, Chris Hardwick, Fred Willard, NPR's Peter Sagal and loads more.\nIf you're still not familiar with us, check out this video for a little taste of what we do at RiffTrax:\nWHY WE'RE ON KICKSTARTER\nIn 2009 we did an experiment: a live show in Nashville, riffing the Ed Wood classic PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, simulcast to 500 movie theaters around the U.S.A. It was a raging success, and RiffTrax Live was born. Since then, we've done 17 more live simulcast shows, including: \"MANOS\" THE HANDS OF FATE; the sorpnl-filled D-movie BIRDEMIC; the bug-infested classic STARSHIP TROOPERS; Vincent Price's cheesy HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL, the SyFy sensation SHARKNADO and many more, most of which were only made possible thanks to the generous support of you, the Kickstarter community.\nMovie rights and film remastering expenses cost a decent chunk of change, and the production costs for the Live Shows themselves are crazy high, especially doing a show from downtown Minneapolis - so to have this madness make any economic sense we need your help. We have our deal with Fathom Events locked in, we have the dates reserved for the shows, and we have a bunch of stars from MST3K on board for a night of hilarious entertainment - the rest is up to you! \nWHAT DO YOU GET OUT OF THIS DEAL?\nLots of stuff! For starters, every backer at every level gets first dibs on tickets to see the live shows in person - including the MST Reunion show, which is sure to sell out. That's an EXCLUSIVE advance purchasing window just for backing us on Kickstarter!\nPlease take a look at the rewards we've created, listed here on this page. Unfortunately, due to the complexities of the many individual movie theaters, we are unable to give away actual theater tickets to the shows as rewards.\nBut we CAN give you the actual digital downloads of two of them: the MST REUNION SHOW and TIME CHASERS, along with the other exclusive rewards created just for backers. That, plus the warm fuzzy feeling of knowing you helped make an MST Reunion possible.\nWe're offering great rewards at very low-priced levels, as well as some fantastic VIP packages that include meeting the MST gang in Minneapolis, tickets for the best seats in the house, getting your picture in the credits, and even being able to write a riff that will be used in a Live Show script!\nWondering what goes on at our VIP meet-and-greets? Check out this video from our STARSHIP TROOPERS gathering:\nWHAT IF WE GET EXTRA MONEY, PAST OUR GOAL?\nWe raised past our goal in our last three Kickstarter projects, and all of the money collected went towards getting the rights to the movies (plus getting additional movies to riff live), top notch production of the event itself, and in creating and fulfilling rewards. It will be no different this time around.\nMaking these shows a reality costs meaningfully more than our base goal, and so if we raise more money, it will go towards movie acquisition costs for two more shows this year, better production values, and towards all the awesome rewards.  And perhaps you know that since RiffTrax started offering Mystery Science Theater 3000 episodes, we have been giving a portion of sales to all the MST principal cast members. RiffTrax will put a meaningful portion of all additional proceeds beyond our Kickstarter goal into this same pool.  \nWith all that being said... THANK YOU! We have the best fans in the world, and we know how lucky we are. This summer marks our 10th birthday at RiffTrax - we couldn't have done it without our fans, and we sincerely thank you for your support over these many years. We can't wait to make you laugh even more during 2016 - so join us for RiffTrax Live!\nMarch 29: Exclusive Backer shirt revealed!\nTake a look at the first draft of the concept for the EXCLUSIVE backer shirt available to backers pledging for the $100 reward and higher:\nSome details subject to change\nWho do you recognize?

Jacob, a singer-songwriter on a path toward superstardom, struggles to make sense of the big moments in his life \u2013 most notably the end of his relationship with Grace, a passionate woman fascinated by a romance from the past. Two other performers weave the stories of other couples into this powerful blend of music, love letters and poetry that catapults us across time and out of our contemporary world of snapchats and shortcuts onto a journey of two hearts aching to be heard in a world too small for their words.\nJeremiah & Jessica met auditioning around town in Atlanta. Jeremiah had been working on a musical for close to 7 years. When Jessica offered to give the script \"a look,\" she was immediately swept up in Jeremiah's unique songwriting, and that look very quickly turned into a dynamic partnership. They realized they had a story to tell. The two began furiously working to totally re-design and re-create the script and bring the songs to a place where they felt comfortable sharing what they'd made with their community. With the addition of new songs, new words and new voices, THE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE was born. After 2 very successful concert performances, a sold-out staged reading at Actor's Express, and the encouragement of their peers, they realized their show had a special kind of magic-and the team began to feel that it was ready for a wider audience. \nSome audience feedback:\n\"It's amazing and ridiculously relate-able. The perfect mix of comedy, quirkiness and sadness. The perfect love story.\"\n\"You inspired me. More than you'll ever know.\"\n\"Very genuine, heart-felt and thoughtful.\"\n\"Totally raw. I was with you the whole way. Brought up so many memories and emotions. Thanks for being REAL. Seriously.\"\n\"Humorous, honest and genuine.\"\n\"Two words that come to mind: Raw. Passion.\"\nTHE LAST TIME WE WERE HERE was selected to perform in New York City for lots of important people. \nBut, just like any upstart, rag-tag, underdog project, we need a little help from our friends.\nCheck out one of our favorite cuts and give us a listen, #TLTWWH\n Want more clips?

Our contributors have collectively written a dozen books, and have been published everywhere from academic journals to The New York Times and The Atlantic. \nYour Kickstarter pledge will get Scalawag going, and help us run the magazine for this full year: four issues, online content, and soon events in communities around the South. We won\u2019t stop there. Right now, we need your backing to get going.\nWhere we\u2019re coming from\nThe fact is, there\u2019s a shortage of good journalism in the South. Local newspapers are drying up, and Northern media can\u2019t fill the gap. We're also short on thoughtful commentary, and on forthright civic conversation. These shortages couldn\u2019t come at a worse time. There\u2019s been a lot of hard news down South lately: too many children going hungry, too many folks out of a job, too many sick and too many in need. But there\u2019s also hope and excitement. People across the across the region are doing incredible work to shape the futures of their communities.  \nAmidst all of this, we need a way to know what\u2019s going on, and a community in which to discuss it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re building Scalawag.\nScalawag will publish the South\u2019s most necessary journalism, its very best ideas, and its most important stories. We\u2019ll talk about the South without resorting to stereotypes. We\u2019ll export good writing and sometimes import foreign perspectives. We\u2019ll look for new ways of understanding the South in the fullness of its diversity and complexity. And we'll search for a full sense of what it is to be Southern in the twenty-first century. \nA draft of a spread from our first issue\nWe're laying out our first issue now, and already have pieces lined up for our second (and for the website). Our contributors are already working on all kinds of important stories \u2013 about lives of homeless men in a fast-growing city, good ideas on immigration in Mississippi, and queer communities across the rural South. We' want to approach the familiar and the new with an open heart as we listen and share the stories that are shaping the South.\nWho we are\nOur team\nWe\u2019re a team of young Southerners \u2013 from Virginia down to the Mississippi Delta \u2013 with a carpetbagger thrown in for good measure. Among us we\u2019ve got important experience: teaching writing and journalism, leading state-wide field operations for the Obama campaign, consulting for the United Nations and top CEOs\u2014even winning a Rhodes Scholarship.\nWe know we have a lot left to learn. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so glad to have a community of advisors at our back. At the center of this community is our Board of Advisors, full of experienced writers and journalists, like Alec MacGillis, Taylor Branch, Anne Fadiman, and Bill Chafe. They\u2019ve won a stunning number of awards\u2014including two Pulitzer prizes.\nOf course lots of folks can recite nice resumes. So what\u2019s more important is that our team shares a commitment to the future of the South, and to the conversations and communities that will shape that future. We care about the folks who share our homes here. And we\u2019re genuinely curious about the questions Scalawag will ask and answer. \nWhy we\u2019re Kickstarting\nThe money you pledge on Kickstarter will jump start Scalawag\u2019s first year. It\u2019ll take Scalawag from a project in our kitchens to something real\u2014it\u2019ll let us pay our writers fairly, print our magazine, build out our website, and cover the costs of serious journalism. More than all that, your pledge will also be an investment in the magazine\u2019s future. Scalawag may be a non-profit, but we don\u2019t intend to rely on outside help forever. So we\u2019ve built a real business model, and we intend to become sustainable within three years. Like y\u2019all, Scalawag will be in this for the long haul.\nWhat you\u2019ll get\nWe\u2019re most excited to (finally) be offering subscriptions to Scalawag\u2019s first and second years. But pick your fancy: You can also get our signature cocktail recipe, a mason jar for drinking it, a limited-edition print of our first cover, or even a lifetime subscription.\nSomething else you want to know? \nEmail us at editors@scalawagmag.org! We'd be happy to hear from you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe don\u2019t want to pretend this will all be easy. Here\u2019re three of the biggest challenges we face, and what we\u2019re doing about them.\n\n\u2022 We\u2019re piloting an unconventional model in an uncertain time. The market for media is undergoing a generational shift. So we\u2019ve focused on developing a real path to sustainability: keeping our operating costs low, and building a base of committed subscribers. Moreover, our 501c(3) status means we\u2019ll never have to compromise our mission to stay in print.\n\n\u2022 We need to build awareness to succeed. Scalawag has to reach readers, and these days people\u2019s attention can be hard to come by. So we\u2019ve been pushing to spread our message, testing the idea with hundreds of influential Southerners, and developing a comprehensive marketing plan.\n\n\u2022 We need to attract top-notch contributors. Real journalism takes real talent. That\u2019s why we're working nonstop to source pieces from some of the best journalists in the country. Our success to date gives us confidence we can succeed. \n\nAbove all, we\u2019re committed to this project for the long haul. We know the path forward isn't simple.

Peasant\u2019s point of view.\nThe story behind Suspension of Disbelief began when we started reminiscing about our LARPing days. Every month was filled with evil villains, horrible monsters and world-ending danger; which lead to the question: \"Who the hell would want to live here?!\"\nProof of Concept Pilot\n Proof of Concept: Fence of Summoning\nThe show started with a few sketches about the crazy things that happen in, really, any fantasy game as seen from the NPCs point-of-view.  We had a few generic townies standing in as our protagonists watching as people were assassinated in broad daylight, corrupted the basic fabric of reality and came up with the dumbest character names.  \nAfter we held an open casting call, those protagonists really took shape.  We initially imagined four men in the roles, maybe gender-flipping one or two if we needed to.  Turns out, we had four phenomenal women blow us away at auditions.  They came in immediately harnessing the possibilities in these characters, breathing a real life into them.  After meeting those four women, there was no question.  Our Salvagers would be women.  And they would be hilarious.\nWe knew we had something special after the initial table read.  We filmed the shorts over a long weekend, building the exterior porch and interior of our own Last Chance Tavern.  As we edited the shorts, we began sketching out future adventures.  The story took a life of its own, growing into its own fleshed out fantasy world.  The more we saw of the work our cast had done, the more we knew that this show deserved more.  After much deliberation, we came to the conclusion that a few short sketches wasn\u2019t going to be enough for these women, these characters or this new world we had discovered.  Taking what we had already filmed as a proof of concept and the centerpiece of the first season, we began rewriting in earnest, introducing more characters, more intrigue and more monsters for our special effects department to play with.\nSeason One is now a feature-length season told in seven episodes.  We follow the Salvagers as they try and survive: monster-summoning fences, rogue adventurers, sentient vegetation, visiting nobility, undead hordes, and totally harmless old men with ulterior motives. We couldn\u2019t be prouder of this new show and we need your help to unleash it on an unsuspecting world!  BWAHAHAHA...sorry.\nFind Us On Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SODSeries \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sod_series\nTumblr: http://isthatblakeoutlaw.tumblr.com/\nFrom the beginning we wanted to tell this story from a peasant's-eye view. We wanted to start off with a simple story of simple people trying to make a life under extraordinary circumstances.\nOut of our first few sketches came the Salvagers. They don't hunt, they don't fight, they don't take sides, they stay out of politics and crazy adventures. The Salvagers pick up what's left behind on the battlefield when the Heroes are done fighting, either because they're victorious or they've fallen and their spirits are on their way to be resurrected. The Salvagers, or others like them, sell gear back to unlucky adventurers or to merchants in town at a reasonable mark-up.\n Dani is played by Madi York\nWilla is played by Madeline Hatter\nSally is played by Adena Brumer \n Myke is played by Christina Leidel\nThis is a world with a severe class distinction between Heroes and the rest of us. For Heroes life is easy, money is plentiful, power is assumed, and death is a minor inconvenience.\nBeing a hero in Arbrontith means weighing your options, following the directions of your Faction and kicking selective ass at a rate that would make a third-world dictator blush.  Being literally anyone else means running, hiding, swearing, scratching out whatever existence you can manage, running some more and definitely NOT farming.  It means turning a blind eye to random crimes and wanton slaughter in the streets.  It means only counting on heroes to do the bare minimum required to get some sweet loot while your home is invaded by goblins or burned by pillaging barbarian hordes.\nSome heroes are assholes.  Ok, most heroes are assholes.  But some show up with the express purpose of robbing and killing their way to the top.  It always seems cool to wear all black and be the villain until you run face-first into an Abyssal Horror and find out what true Evil feels like.\nOf course there are the monsters, too.  The Dark One summons them from the surrounding countryside, conjures them from the Hellmouth (did we mention there\u2019s a Hellmouth?  That\u2019s pretty hazardous to one\u2019s health.) or finds ways to manipulate weaker minds into becoming his eternal Doom Slaves.  They arrive regularly, almost by some unseen schedule, fight heroes (even though instinct should tell them not to go near the place where untold thousands of their brethren have been massacred) and die horribly.  Some are truly terrible and dangerous.  Some, like our artistic goblin friend pictured above, are pretty stupid and relatively harmless.  Just watch out for what\u2019s on his paintbrush.  It\u2019s probably not poop.\n HeadGames Entertainment has been around since 2007. We've spent seven years making films, succeeding, failing, and learning from those failures. We have produced two full seasons of the hit webseries Star Command:\n We've worked with tons of special effects, huge casts, make-up, costumes and sets.

Overall, the funds we hope to raise on Kickstarter is only one piece of a multi-tiered plan that includes securing financing from a bank, verifying gifts from various philanthropic organizations, and raising additional capital from community members and major donors. The staff and board are diligently working to ensure we hit the those goals, but missing one could make the reality of purchasing this building very difficult. That said, we're already under contract on the building, and know there is community support because we've already successfully rezoned the property and had the land use amended. Hooray! \n\nThe other big challenge is not being able to move into the space until 2016. Even if /when we successfully secure the space this December, the current tenant is still entitled to be in the building until February 2016. But, while that seems like a long time, that's not necessarily a bad thing. They'll cover our mortgage while we go through the permitting process, finalize architectural plans, and raise additional funds for a modest renovation. So really, it all kinda works out.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "The Update you've all been waiting for!", "update_content": "Happy New Year, everyone!

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web. And now that we've reached our stretch goal of$5,000,000, we'll also be able to bring the service to mobile phones, Android, game consoles like XBOX and PlayStation, and set-top boxes like AppleTV and ROKU.\nEvery Classroom. Together, we want to provide Reading Rainbow to as many classrooms as possible FOR FREE! Now that we've reached our stretch goal of $5,000,000, we'll be able to provide year-long subscriptions in over 7,500 classrooms \u2013 and every additional $100K we raise lets us help 500 more!\nNo matter how much we raise, we promise that every dollar you pledge will bring Reading Rainbow to more platforms, and provide it for free in more classrooms.\nWe can make sure that millions of kids learn to love reading, but we can\u2019t do it without you. That's why I hope you\u2019ll join me in making a difference!\nI believe that spreading the love of reading is its own greatest reward. But if you're going to join our cause, we also have some wonderful prizes. But you don't have to take my word for it... Take a look!\nAside from the signed book, the rewards above will be available to anyone who pledges! \nBut we also have several LIMITED EDITION rewards... so be sure to get them before we run out! (And if we DO run out, keep checking back -- we'll do our best to add more when we can!)\nOr, if you prefer, you can also pledge for a reward package that will be gifted to the classroom or school of your choice!\nAnd, if you're just interested in Star Trek related rewards, and don't want all of the Reading Rainbow goodies above, we've also got a few special reward levels created just for you:\nThis Kickstarter \u2013 and Reading Rainbow \u2013 couldn't happen alone, so I want you to meet the full team behind our Kickstarter.\nEverytime I walk into the office, I am reminded that the Reading Rainbow team is made up of passionate, talented artists, producers, engineers, and so many more. Most of them grew up on the show, have families of their own now, and dedicate their working day to improving the lives of the next generation.  \nIt's an honor to be surrounded by my Reading Rainbow family every day, and we can't wait for you to join us.

With our jeans it almost feels like you\u2019re wearing nothing. \nDesigned for athletes, these jeans are made to fit comfortably over muscular legs by accommodating your quads and butt without forcing you to buy larger sizes for the small waist you work so hard for.\nHowever, Barbell Denim will accommodate any body type. Even if your legs aren't particularly muscular, Barbell Denim will still look amazing on you and feel even more amazing as you move in them. Our hybrid denim stretches both ways so that it can compliment smaller legs, while still easily stretching to accommodate larger legs as well. \n OUR STORY \nWe wear jeans because they're stylish, comfortable, and can match any outfit you throw at them. But what happens when you want to be active; lift some weights, play some ball, climb a tree, or even just help move some boxes? \nThe Barbell Apparel team spends a minimum of 20 hours a week in the gym, and when we get off work, we\u2019re snowboarding, mountain biking, motorcycling, and doing just about any adrenaline fueled movement you can think of. \nWe were tired of struggling with jeans that didn\u2019t fit, weren\u2019t comfortable, and completely restricted our ability to move. So we decided to fix it.\nOUR VISION\nHere at Barbell Apparel we strive to make premium classy clothing for active and athletic people when they aren't in the gym. Premium functional denim is just the beginning, with all of your support we will be looking into making functional, classy, and comfortable dress shirts, slacks, blazers, socks, and chinos. \n1. SUPERIOR HYBRID DENIM: Our denim is the culmination of years of textile research, and months of testing. Using a special denim fabric and high tensile-strength stitching, our jeans provide unparalleled flexibility and comfort.\n 2. FREEDOM OF MOVEMENT: Our top priority was designing jeans that you could feel completely free and limitless while wearing. We consider this one of our biggest achievements. While wearing Barbell Denim, you will almost forget they are there. \n 3. DETAILED CRAFTSMANSHIP: We leave no details behind. With a hand designed leather label, embossed branded rivets and buttons, stitched tags and labels, custom branded pocket fabric, extra-strength double stitching and premium hanger loops, our jeans are an example of the best kind of craftsmanship. \n 4. INCREDIBLE STYLE: Not only did we want you to feel amazing in Barbell Denim, we wanted you to look amazing as well. With the input of leading fashion designers, our men\u2019s and women\u2019s jeans use a fashion conscious cut that incorporates both classic and modern elements for a look that is truly stylish and timeless. \nSIZING OPTIONS \n \u2022 Men's Jeans: offered in Straight Relaxed fit. Waist sizes offered are 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, & 40. You can choose between a 34\" or 36\" inseam length. \n\u2022 Women's Jeans: offered in Straight Leg fit. Waist sizes offered are 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, & 33. You can choose between a 32\u201d or 36\" inseam length.\nCHOOSING YOUR SIZE\nOur jeans are created to fit to your actual waist size. Many athletic people have resorted to ordering jeans to fit their legs instead of their waist. For example a physique model tried our jeans thinking he was a 36/38 but in reality he was a 32. To get your perfect pair of jeans, buy your true waist size. \nEven if you don't have super muscular legs, Barbell Denim will fit and feel amazing on you. Simply go down one size, and they will fit you perfectly. \nPremium denim normally runs long so it can be tailored to fit you most comfortably. If the standard size is to long for you, it is very simple and cheap to have a local seamstress tailor the length to your liking; this normally costs no more than $12.\nHELP GET PRODUCTION STARTED \nAfter months of designing, testing, and setting up production, we are finally ready to bring our amazing Barbell Denim to the mainstream market. We need your help to fund our initial order. In return for your support, we are offering a limited time discounted price and a variety of special packages. \nOUR GUARANTEE \nWe guarantee you will love the fit and feel of your Barbell Denim. \nIf for any reason your jeans don't fit right, send them back free of charge for an exchange.

Let's go for ten!\nThe Story\nPhileas Reid was once a household name.  He was an American hero.  Every school boy and girl knew him as \"one of the men who built the atomic bomb.\"  Phileas, however, was never able to take pride in the work he had done.  \"We saved the world, perhaps, but at what cost?\"  Nearly twenty years have passed and Phileas has just published a book:  We Are Not Alone.  While the world thinks he's gone crazy, having plummeted from respected mind to mad scientist, Phileas thinks it's absolutely crazy to pretend that we're alone in the universe.  \nCharlotte Hughes, a reporter for The News Tomorrow, hasn't decided if she thinks Phileas is crazy or not.  What she does know is that if Phileas is right, that would change everything.\nMarshall doesn't have much of a choice but to tag along on all of his mom's crazy adventures.  He's only ten years old and doesn't have anyone else to look after him -- not that he's complaining.  He inherited his father's desire for truth and justice and his mother's insatiable curiosity.\nThe story really begins with our fourth hero, Teinan Breen.  She's a fourteen year-old girl from Io (the inner most of Jupiter's four Galilean moons) who, in an effort to have even just a little bit of control over her life, runs away from home and decides to hide on Earth.  \nHere's hoping no-one saw her crash land.  Here's hoping her people don't come looking for her and our military misjudges it as an alien invasion and begins a war between our two worlds.\nTeinan crash lands on Earth.  She's not from around here and two worlds are going to collide to try and find her.\nPhileas Reid Knows We're Not Alone is an all-ages graphic novel with its sights set on action and adventure, but that doesn't mean the book isn't without a message:  You are not alone.  Wherever you are, whoever you are, no matter what age you are, people have gone before you and people are with you now.  Just because you feel alone, doesn't mean you are.  This knowledge is supposed to be comforting, but it's also a challenge.  You not being alone in the world also means your way of doing things and your way of thinking things isn't the only way.\nThe Team\nScott Fogg (writer/creator) - A lifelong daydreamer, Scott grew up in Narnia, Metropolis, Hill Valley, Sherwood Forest, Battle School, and on Tatooine and Gallifrey.

There are, however, two very large challenges in our way. They are both financial in nature.\n\nThere's a number of ways this story could be told. While we could tell this story online, a page or panel at a time, we believe the best way to tell this story is as a graphic novel. While not the most expensive way we could tell the tale of Phileas Reid, it isn't without its upfront costs. From making sure the artists are properly compensated to publishing fees, making a graphic novel that we can be proud of is expensive enough that it's unattainable without a little help from our friends.\n\nShould we be able to pool our resources together enough to make this book a reality, the biggest challenge will be for us to balance and manage our time to stay on schedule. All four of us have day jobs because all four of us have families to provide for and bills to pay. The money we put together from Kickstarter won't be going towards any of that, so it's not like we're going to be able to quit our day jobs and make comic books full time -- yet. So, if this Kickstarter is a success, it will mean, for all intents and purposes, that the four of us will have two full-time jobs (and families who -- for reasons that escape our imagination -- want to see us from time to time).\n\nThe first problem has the potential to be unsolvable. We can't do it without you. The second problem is easily solvable, it just means we'll be seeing fewer movies in theaters and even less sun that we usually do. We'll have to create a schedule and stick to it, balancing our jobs and our friends and family in a healthy but productive way -- honestly, it's exactly the kind of challenge we've been wanting for some time now.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #78", "update_userinfo": "PRINCE OF THE SILENT PLANET", "update_content": "Hey everybody!

We really want to hit the stretch goal where we can add blurbs on the back of each shirt, highlighting the figure on the front. Therefore, we now only have 1 stretch goal of $14,000 that'll be dedicated to having 2-3 sentences on each shirt's back describing that figure's significance.\nThe Return to Kickstarter\nSince completing the original UnderRepped project on Kickstarter, we have gotten great recommendations for new shirts...from you. Now it's time to bring those ideas and shirts into design and ultimately production. Unfortunately, designing and printing these shirts comes with a substantial cost. While some of the new shirts have been prototyped, we need to raise more funds before moving into full-scale production. For these reasons, we think Kickstarter will again be a good fit.\nWe are really excited to expand our line with new figures from a multitude of different areas. Backers from our previous project told us that they wanted a more diverse set of figures, and we listened by adding figures like Langston Hughes for social activists and poetry lovers, Gene Roddenberry for Sci-Fi gurus, and Gunpei Yokoi (Inventor of the Game-Boy) for gamers. These figures all influenced the way we think about certain subjects, yet we believe people who want to spread their story don't have many chances to do it. We hope you will back our project to help us expand our reach!\nThe New Reps\nThe project will work to bring 6 new individuals from prototype to production.\nGene Roddenberry - Futurist & Creator of Star Trek\nBillie Holiday - Influential Jazz singer & songwriter\nLangston Hughes - Writer, social activist, and significant figure in the Harlem Renaissance\nGregor Mendel - Founder of the science of genetics\nAlan Turing - The father of artificial intelligence\nGunpei Yokoi - Invented the Game Boy\nShirt Quality\nIn addition to Underrepped's designs, we also make sure that the shirts are comfortable and durable. All of the shirts will be:\n\u2022 Printed in Camden, NJ\n\u2022 Made of 100% cotton\n\u2022 Printed using a discharge process\nThese specifications allow us to deliver consistent, high-quality tees. From the previous feedback, we will continue to print UnderRepped shirts with the discharge printing process. Most t-shirts are made by putting ink onto the shirt (plastisol), and over time the image can crack and peel. We wanted to avoid this. The discharge process lifts dye from the shirt leaving you with an image that is literally part of the fabric, meaning it's as soft as the rest of the shirt. All of these decisions have come together to make a high quality shirt that looks great!\nWe will also include custom tags that are specific to each shirt!\nUnderRepped's Initial Media Coverage!\n\n\"Coolest T-Shirt Brands of 2013\" by ChicGeek!\n\"Top 10 Unsung Heroes\" article on AskMen!\nOne of TrendHunter's Top 20 Stories!\n- Featured at InStash, T-Shirt Factory, Cottonable, & Playboy's TheSmokingJacket!\nOriginal Shirts\nWe will also be offering any of our old designs as part of the project.

Coulton tweeted back \"DO IT.\" And so they did. \n \"What I love about this project is that it's the crazy kind of thing that just had to happen, and because of Twitter and Kickstarter and the internets, it actually can,\" says Pak. \"Jonathan and I are both working here as independent creators who own our own work. So if he says yes and I say yes and then whoever wants to buy it says yes, this beautiful thing can actually happen.\" \nTakeshi Miyazawa (\"Runaways\") will provide pencils and inks, Jessica Kholinne (\"X-Treme X-Men\") will color, and Simon Bowland (\"Incredible Hercules\") will letter. \n\"This thing has monkeys, robots and zombies. It hit the trifecta,\" says Miyazawa. \"How could I say no?\" \nThe plan is to produce a 60 page graphic novel that will be released digitally in four parts through Monkeybrain Comics and comiXology and then in a collected trade paperback form. \n\"We're very excited to be working with Monkeybrain and comiXology,\" says Pak. \"Monkeybrain has done an amazing job of getting fantastic, genuinely independent creator-owned comics out into the world and comiXology has developed a phenomenal app for viewing comics on digital devices.\"\nKickstarter backers will get each of the digital comics and the hard copy of the graphic novel during an exclusive window before the books are sold to general public. And there are multiple added bonuses possible for Kickstarter backers, including first dibs on a brand new song written and performed by Coulton. \nAnother standout reward is the limited edition Code Monkey figure, sculpted by the acclaimed comic artist Sean Chen from the Takeshi Miyazawa character design. \nWork-in-progress of Sean Chen's sculpt for the Code Monkey figurine!

PRODUCER PACK contributors will ALL be real Comic Book Producers!\nWHAT IS OUR STORY ABOUT... \n WATSON AND HOLMES, by Karl Bollers & Rick Leonardi, is a re-envisioning of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes and Dr John Watson as African Americans living in New York City's famous Harlem district. Watson, an Afghanistan war vet, works in an inner-city clinic; Holmes, a local P.I. who takes unusual cases. When one of them ends up in Watson's emergency room, the unlikely duo strike up a partnership to find a missing girl. Watson And Holmes bump heads along the way as they enter a labyrinth of drugs, guns, gangs and a conspiracy that goes higher and deeper than they could have imagined.  \nWHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO... \n Because of the strong reception of our digital offerings for the two issues of WATSON AND HOLMES on all platforms, New Paradigm Studios is looking to print our books. We are in the process of working with Diamond Distributors to put the WATSON AND HOLMES series in every comic book and hobby shop all over the country. We are kicking off a Kickstarter campaign to expand our outreach, and put your support into the ground for new exciting stories and developing new series. Join us in building a new comic book company off the ground with our debut title, WATSON AND HOLMES. This title that has given us the honor to work with the talents of Rick Leonardi, Karl Bollers, Paul Mendoza, Taylor Esposito, Dave Lanphear, Nicole McDonnell, Larry Stroman, Walt Simonson and many more soon to be announced.
