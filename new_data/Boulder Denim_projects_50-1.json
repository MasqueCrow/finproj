I have been tattooing professionally for twelve years. During that time, I have successfully opened, owned, and operated multiple tattoo shops that are still currently up and running. I found climbing ten years ago and though my first love is bouldering, I also enjoy a killer sport climb or multi-pitch route.\n For years, I have dreamt of finding a way to meaningfully combine my two passions: tattooing and climbing - and I finally figured it out! I initially created a tattoo special that donates 10% of quarterly profits to a rotating non-profit that directly works to preserve and maintain our beloved wild outdoor areas. As this small personal project began to take hold, I was still left plotting about how else to expand on the concept. And what better way to raise money for the outdoors then to bring sick tattoos to the hikers, climbers, bikers, and general nature-lovers done inside Tattoo Basecamp.\n\nInterior Layout\n\n  An Airstream Basecamp trailer turned mobile tattoo shop? It\u2019s as simple and bitchin\u2019 as it sounds. After endless instances of friends wanting to get tattooed out at a climbing festival or classic crag, the time has come to make the experience a reality. It is an important factor to be able to offer a clean, proper shop atmosphere regardless of terrain, location or weather. I plan on creating a registered, up-to-code, genuine tattoo shop on wheels that brings high-quality tattoos to the outdoor community around the country.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREWARDS\nWOMENS TANK TOP\nMENS T SHIRT\nSPECIAL EDITION BANDANA\nArtwork prints\nWHY AIRSTREAM BASECAMP?\nWhile planing the mobile tattoo station I\u2019ve gone through different options to create it. From a toy hauler to a camper trailer, but none of those were a good fit for this project as the Airstream Base Camp trailer. It\u2019s was love at first sight. Since the Interior is exactly what I needed to pass health department codes. Most camper trailers are wood interior and porous surfaces as well as the furniture fabric, and the health department requires for all tattoo shops to have non-porous walls, cabinets, countertops, and furniture including pillows.   Plus it has other things like power outlets, hand washing sink, potable water, wastewater tanks, and lighting. Leaving me with only very few things to adapt to be able to be up to code. \n\nWHAT\u2019S THE PLAN?\nOnce funds are received, the plan is as follows:\n1. Purchase the Airstream Basecamp trailer.\n2. Begin build-out and conversion to a legitimate tattoo station.\n3. Submit the plans to the health department.\n4. Finish inspection and finalize permits to operate.\n5. Rewards are printed and packaged.\n  *Climbing trips projected for spring 2020.\n6. Rewards are shipped to our stellar supporters.\n7. Plan a route and hit the road!\nWHY DO I CARE?\nAs so much of my inspiration for both my artwork and tattoos comes from natural spaces and climbing locations, I feel responsible to give something back to the places and community that has given so much to me.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSETBACKS\n\nHealth department permits: There\u2019s multiple steps to be able to get the trailer fully certified and these take time.\nMy plan would be to have everything ready for full inspection within two months of the trailer being funded so there\u2019s no delays and I can start traveling. I have completed this process before on a brick and mortar location and have successfully passed all the inspections with no setbacks. I\u2019m confident this would be successful on the first go.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Angel Lopez\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nAngel Lopez is a Tijuana, Baja California native and San Diego, California local.

It's essentially an invisible dock hidden covertly in an inconspicuous, but sleek charger. \nNintendo Switch Dock + AC Charger = Covert Dock\n\n\nLet\u2019s tackle the obvious here though. The Switch does not actually sit directly on the Covert Dock, but it does have docking capability. So how does it connect? Glad you asked: \nStep 3: Profit\nYou can display your game onto the big screen in its full 1080p docked mode glory with just a Covert Dock - leaving all the additional docks, chargers, and/or dongles connected at home.\n\n\nOne of the secrets behind making Covert Dock so powerful without the bulk is thanks to Gallium Nitride, or abbreviated to three magical letters from the periodic table, GaN:\n\n\nBy using the latest GaN technology, we get incredible efficiency gains that run cooler enabling us to surpass the limits of last generation silicon chargers. Take a peek inside:\nIt's like carrying your very own save crystal\nWhen we say it's compact, we're pretty serious about it - we got rid of all the un-necessary bulk. It's 1/10th the size of the original dock, or put it another way, 90% smaller!\nAll fighters are drawn to scale\n\nAnd if you compare it to the original charger alone, it's 22% smaller and does way more. We're not even including the extra space those inconvenient prongs take up when packed.  \nYou had one job\nHow else does it measure up? Well its somewhere between Genki Audio and an individual Joy-Con (without that pesky analog stick poking out).     \nCountless times we wished our chargers had foldable prongs. When they stick out they snag onto things and can even scratch our precious screens. During our design, we found out that it\u2019s really difficult to make a charger that is both small and have foldable prongs. \nYou're welcome. Now you don't have to think twice about packing it.\nThe Covert Dock is designed for the Nintendo Switch, but it's actually quite robust and works with a lot of USB-C devices - you'll want to take it every time you leave the house.  \n\n\nThe tiny port on the top is basically your trusty USB-C port designed to work to the standard charging profiles of the Nintendo Switch. But unlike other chargers, it also grabs the display data from the USB-C device so that it can be processed for the HDMI display output.   Beyond just matching the Nintendo Switch charging profiles, the Covert Dock complies with the latest PD 3.0 protocols meaning you can fast charge smartphones (250% faster) and tablets, and even power hungry laptops, including the latest USB-C only MacBooks. \nUnlike other chargers that have two ports, our USB 3.1 port actually passes data as well, so you don't just charge your controllers you can actually connect your accessories whether it's a wired controller, ethernet adapter, Genki Audio, or whatever crazy accessory you're packing. It also works with tablets and computers so if you have one of the fancy systems without USB-A ports, you'll be able to hook up your flash drive, wireless mouse or a presentation clicker in a pinch.  \n\n\nGetting down to the last port, we come to the world's first HDMI port built into a charger, ever.  It's designed to work with the custom display profile for the Nintendo Switch but additionally supports the DisplayPort standard so you can broadcast whatever you want, wherever you want; from showing off your latest PowerPoint presentation skills to binge watching Stranger Things (or Dark).\nCovert Dock is ready to go, take it with you to your favorite bar, taco truck, dorm room, game/comic convention, hotel lounge, office meeting space, friend's house, friend's friend's house, and maybe even when visiting the family - we can't wait to see where you'll take the fun. \nWhen developing the passthrough charging for our previous Genki Audio adapter, we learned a lot about how power is managed by the Switch and how important it was to choose reliable components for peace of mind. \nOur engineer, Andrew wrote up a in-depth article on the causes of bricking and has even been picked up by Ars Technica, essentially it's caused by poor components overloading the  M92T36 chip which manages the docking and power of the Switch. When damaged, the Switch cannot be charged, but fortunately the chip is replaceable and your save progress is unharmed. \nTo maximize reliability, we made sure not to skimp on parts. We've configured the Covert Dock to use only standard Switch charging profiles when used with the console and conform to PD standards for other USB-C devices. We've worked closely with experts in this field, including producers of the official Switch AC adapter, engineers of various docks in the market (including Insignia), and the developers behind reputable PD and GaN technologies (Navitas). \nWe\u2019ve selected premium components and are getting global certification for complete protection for you and your devices. We have a dedicated chip to manage and prevent over current/voltage production, overheating, overpowering, and short circuits. Additionally, we\u2019ve made it possible to update the firmware so that we can maintain compatibility in the unlikely event that the Switch docking protocol changes through firmware updates and new hardware revisions.  \n\n\n\n\nHere's a quick demo with Andrew demoing and Eddie kicking the trash can:  \n\nPLAY\n\n\n\nTogether, we founded Human Things in 2017 on the idea that real objects could be special like those found in video games - you know the ones where you open treasure chests filled with enchanted items that give your character special abilities.  \nWe first want to thank and acknowledge Charlie, Cici, Su, and Angela for coming together last minute to review our crazy script, and through many late nights shaping it into an amazing video.\nThank you to our cast of friends and loved ones, including Jennifer, Ivette, Rory, Nathan, Ricardo, Vitor, Carmo, and Bill for sacrificing some of the nice weekend sun to help us bring this fun video to life.\nShout-outs to fra/ctal, Heck, Poon, Chack, Zak, eggnog, Doomblaze, VHS, and the rest of the competitive Smash community for helping us capture the epic party closing.\nOur sincerest appreciation to Roanna and Stephanie our wonderful graphic designers who volunteered their time to really inject some fun to our Kickstarter page.\nDank u to Christian for building out and managing our European outpost in Amsterdam.\nWith additional thanks for our wonderful friends at WeWork Labs, Kickstarter, Stone Brewing.\nAnd of course, we want to thank backers like you. With your crowdfunding support we\u2019ve been able to operate as a quirky indie hardware developer free from outside investors.

It's Dave from Thread&Leather, back with my new business partner Lily (who also happens to be my sister) five years after successfully launching the Wrap Wallet right here on Kickstarter. We're excited to bring you two amazing new products: the Thread&Leather Clutch and the Half-Wrap Wallet.\nThread&Leather Clutch - Simple, but not basic\nWe've spent the last year creating the ultimate take-anywhere clutch, designed to hold all your essentials in one spot. Durable for everyday use, yet stylish enough for date night.\nThe Clutch also works great for keeping all your travel documents and currency organized, so you don't lose anything important while rushing through security to catch your flight.\nThe Clutch is 7.75\" wide by 4.5\" tall, perfectly sized to hold everything you need and bring with you everywhere.\nThread&Leather Half-Wrap - Maximum minimalism\nWe at Thread&Leather are extremely proud of the Wrap Wallet. Over 12,000 customers agree that it is the best wallet in the world. It is as small as possible while remaining fully-functional. It is so good that it was recently awarded U.S. Utility Patent #10,080,407.\nHowever, we keep getting requests for an even smaller wallet for minimalists, people who don't carry cash, and people who want something ultra sleek for going out at night. So we took the best parts of the Wrap Wallet, the credit card pocket on the inside and the slide pocket on the outside, and combined them into the Half-Wrap.\nThere's enough room to hold 6 cards between the two pockets, with a few bills folded up inside, just in case. It also makes an amazing business card wallet, holding 10 business cards in the main pocket, with your hotel key easily accessible in the slide pocket.\nMaterials & Construction\nLike the Wrap Wallet, the Clutch and Half-Wrap are made in the USA, laser-cut from premium, locally-produced goat leather. We hand-sew every wallet with the finest French waxed-linen thread using the saddle stitch, which is stronger than any machine sewing method. We pride ourselves on the details & quality. See for yourself!!\nAfter testing dozens of closure options, we found the perfect magnetic clasp for the Clutch. It is simple, secure, feels great to open and close, and the stitching detail looks amazing!!\nEvery product we make is bespoke, sewn to customer specifications. You have your choice of seven colors of leather and five colors of thread, for 35 total color combinations.\nLeather Colors\nThread Colors\nColor Combinations\nHere are a few of our favorite color combinations. You'll be able to select your personal color combination after project funding closes. Creativity is encouraged!!\nHalf-Wraps in British Tan & Green, Rich Mahogany & Ecru, All-Natural & Red, and Jet Black on Black\nClutches in Jet Black on Black, British Tan & Green, and Ferrari Red on Red", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter project has its risks. We learned this the hard way after our first project exploded in popularity, and a few loose ends were lost along the way. But that was five years ago, and since then we've built a streamlined system where wallets are laser-cut, hand-sewn, and shipped around the world every business day. All of our production happens in-house, and we'll be using the excess capacity our business has after the holiday rush is over to begin producing and shipping the Clutch and Half-Wrap right after the project ends.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "Half-Wrap Wallet", "descp": "The best wallet in the world, pared down to the bare essentials.

We wanted to shake up the Everyday Carry market by providing awesome, minimal products everyone can use on a day-to-day basis. Introducing NanoPen, the pen that goes where you go.\nWhen we say \"World's Smallest\", we mean it. Measuring in at a staggering 5cm in length, and 0.75cm in diameter, nothing else on the market comes close with the portability we offer.   \nIt's pretty F*CKING strong. Try to break it if you can. \nThis material is superior because it is particularly resistant to deforming. It's Mohs Hardness is rated at 9 which is higher than Titanium and Steel.  \nUsing a Tungsten Carbide tip, this pen is more than just a writing instrument. We've tested the NanoPen thoroughly to ensure that it is a perfect EDC tool for the toughest tasks.\nHave a neat idea? Sketch it out with ease. Fill out forms on the go. Puncture bothersome plastic packaging. Heck, even cut open all those Amazon boxes- The options are endless.  \nThe tungsten carbide ball is designed to be a perfect sphere that can grip any writing surface. Its surface is actually composed of over 50,000 polished surfaces and pits connected by a series of channels throughout the entire sphere. This design allows the ink to be present on both the surface and interior of the ball.  \nAt Slughaus we believe in pushing boundaries and elevating overall design & functionality in peoples lives. It's more than just a pen that fits on your keys, its a simpler way of living.  \nThe earliest design we have of a pen dates back to the late 1800's. These pens smudged easily and would leak, voiding them unusable. Fast forward to 1945, the ballpoint pen design we know today was perfected and patented.\nIn 2018 we like doing things differently, making the traditional ballpoint pen sleek and minimal, for you to carry ANYWHERE effortlessly.  \nWhen we say take your EDC further, we mean take it with you anywhere and everywhere. We aren't a traditional Every Day Carry brand. We like to get creative and give new meaning to the way you carry things.\n   Hook it on to your backpack, duffel, or keychain to ensure you never forget a pen when you're traveling on-the-go.\nAdd it to your favorite jacker zipper, and utilize it as a zipper pull.  \nNeed less bulk on your Keys? Add it to a traditional ballchain and wear it as a necklace.  \nNever lose your pen again.   \n      They say that size doesn't always matter. But it does when it comes to EDC.  \n     We've considered every possible aspect of the NanoPen from the size ratio of the key ring to body, to the finish of the metal to ensure proper grip when in use. We started from a standard pen and reduced it to an extremely minimal design, while giving it infinite function.\nIn order to perfect the NanoPen we had to go through various vigorous testing and revision. We worked with multiple pen manufactures to ensure our design was perfected to be the best tiny ballpoint pen on the market. Truly, there's nothing out there like it.  \n   SLUGHAUS is a small company based out of San Francisco with the sole mission of helping you stay minimal and functional. We believe that your everyday carry essentials influence your lifestyle. NanoPen's elegance inspires innovation, while its functionality keeps you on-the-go. We hope that our products not only help keep you minimal, but help mold your lifestyle as a whole.\nMEDIA KIT HERE\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Single Pack", "descp": "Single Pack = 3 NanoPens.

As a very positive result of removing this built-in cable, we are able to make significant improvements to the design.\nFirst and foremost, the HyperDrive will be much thinner and sleeker looking now, with the same length, width and design lines as the iPhone X. The charging USB-C port is also now moved to the back of the HyperDrive for better cable management when the HyperDrive is used as a standalone wireless charger.\n5 Reasons why HyperDrive is better than other wireless chargers \n1) 7.5W Wireless Charging\nAlmost all Qi wireless chargers currently in the market are the 5W, 10W or 15W variety designed for Android Smartphones which may not work well with the iPhone or charge the iPhone very slowly at less than 5W.\nHyperDrive is the only wireless charger that supports all 4 Qi wireless charging standards (7.5W, 5W, 10W and 15W)\nHyperDrive supports the latest Qi wireless charging standard including 7.5W high speed wireless charging optimized for the iPhone as well as 5/10/15W high speed wireless charging of Android smartphones.\nBetter and faster than mophie and Belkin wireless chargers sold by Apple\nHyperDrive is the only wireless charger that supports 5/7.5/10/15W Qi standard\nHyperDrive takes 2h58m to full charge iPhone X from empty, faster than mophie & Belkin\nHyperDrive is the World's 1st wireless charging stand with LCD voltage/current display\nHyperDrive supports both USB QC and USB-C PD input which supports firmware update while mophie/Belkin uses DC input which does not support firmware update\nHyperDrive has a built-in USB-C hub with 3 x USB power output (5V1.5A)\nHyperDrive has not 1 but 3 charging coils to allow iPhone to charge in any position\n2) Lower Temperature\nTraditional Qi wireless chargers generate too much heat which may cause the iPhone to shut down\nTraditional Qi wireless chargers are not very efficient and generate a lot of heat which causes the iPhone to reduce or stop charging completely to lower operating temperature.\niPhone 8/X will charge wirelessly at \n7.5W at temperatures below 36.5\u00baC/97.7\u00baF\n5W at temperatures between 36.5\u00baC/97.7\u00baF and 38\u00baC/100.4\u00baF\n3W at temperatures between 38\u00baC/100.4\u00baF and 40\u00baC/104\u00baF\n0W (stop charging) at temperatures above 40\u00baC/104\u00baF\nHyperDrive is a low temperature device and insulates the iPhone from any little heat it generates so that it can charge properly\nHyperDrive uses power efficient components and is designed to be a low temperature (25\u00baC/77\u00baF) device. Whatever little heat generated is dissipated from the aluminum sides and is isolated from the iPhone by an air gap and insulator convertible stand layer.\n3) Fixed frequency that does not interfere with Touch and Face ID\nTraditional Qi wireless chargers may emit frequencies that interfere with Touch or Face ID\nTraditional Qi wireless chargers are made with low cost materials that have fluctuating electromagnetic frequencies that may interfere with iPhone functions like Touch & FaceID.\nHyperDrive uses a fixed frequency designated by Apple that does not interfere with Touch or Face ID\nHyperDrive uses a fixed wireless charging frequency designated by Apple and is guaranteed to work perfectly with the iPhone.\n4) Firmware upgradeable\nAs HyperDrive uses USB-C input instead of DC input (Belkin/mophie). It is currently the only iPhone wireless charger in the market that is firmware upgradeable to support new features like faster iPhone wireless charging speeds in the future.\n5) Award winning USB-C hub\nBesides being a great wireless charger, HyperDrive also incorporates award winning USB-C hub capabilities that raised over $3.1 million on Kickstarter and Indiegogo and has hundreds of positive reviews with an average 4 star rating on Amazon and BestBuy.\nDespite its features and having a USB-C hub, HyperDrive is no bigger than the ordinary wireless charger sold in the Apple Store\nAnd is actually thinner than the most popular Android wireless charger on the market\nA single HyperDrive replaces $250 worth of separate accessories\nBut you can get HyperDrive USB-C Hub + 7.5W Wireless Charger for as low as $79\nRewards \nEarly Bird Special (50% off) \n$79 - 1 x HyperDrive \n$158 - 2 x HyperDrive \n$237 - 3 x HyperDrive \n$395 - 5 x HyperDrive \n$790 - 10 x HyperDrive \nKickstarter Special ($50 off)\n$109 - 1 x HyperDrive \n$218 - 2 x HyperDrive \n$327 - 3 x HyperDrive \n$545 - 5 x HyperDrive \n$1090 - 10 x HyperDrive \nExpected Retail Price\n$159 - 1 x HyperDrive \n$318 - 2 x HyperDrive \n$477 - 3 x HyperDrive \n$795 - 5 x HyperDrive\n$1590 - 10 x HyperDrive \nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!\nReward Fulfillment\nTo ensure timely reward delivery, we will ship rewards via insured postal service from 2 fulfillment and distribution centers in:\nCalifornia USA - fulfilling rewards within the United States  \nHong Kong - fulfilling rewards to the rest of the world \nFulfilment managed via BackerKit\nProject Timeline\n15 January 2018 - Kickstarter begins \n19 February 2018 - Kickstarter ends \nFebruary 2018 - Production begins \nApril 2018 - Shipping of Early Bird rewards \nMay 2018 - Shipping of Kickstarter Special rewards\nSpecifications\n Output:\n- HDMI supporting 1080p@60Hz, 4K@30Hz\n- Gigabit Ethernet\n- SD (UHS-I 104MB/s)\n- micro SD (UHS-I 104MB/s)\n- 3 x USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5Gb/s)\n- USB-C 60W power delivery pass through charging \nInput: 1 x USB-C \nWireless Charging: 5/7.5/10/15W Qi Standard \nNumber of Wireless Charging Coils: 3\nDC/DC efficiency: Up to 96% \nDevice Operating Temperature: 25\u00baC / 77\u00baF \nEnclosure: Aluminum & ABS \nDimensions: 5.1\" x 3.7\" x 1\" / 130 x 94 x 25.8 mm \nWeight: 7.2 oz / 0.45 lb / 204g\nDesign Story\nThe initial idea of this product was to combine a Qi wireless charger with a USB-C hub and make it as compact as possible. For our first design, we decide to take the ubiquitous flat round Qi wireless charging pad, add some thickness to it to accommodate USB-C hub elements. However a perfect circle is not a very efficient shape for laying out electronic components. We also explored a perfect square design but it was too utilitarian. We finally decided on an organic design with rounded edges. When we wanted to add a convertible phone stand tray to our rounded square prototype, we realized that tray was too short to stably support a phone in portrait position. Hence we came up with the final design which is a cross between a rounded rectangle and an oval which provided a stand tall enough to stably support a phone in portrait mode. The additional space also allowed us to have not 1 but 3 wireless charging coils, an LCD display panel and compartment to for the built-in cable to stowaway.\nProof of Concept \nPLAY\n\nThe above unedited video demonstrates a fully functional pre-production HyperDrive with all ports working (2 x USB 3.1 hard drives, USB-C Power Delivery, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI display, microSD, SD and USB flash drive). HyperDrive is also shown to provide pass through power delivery to the 15\" MacBook Pro as well as wirelessly charge the iPhone X at 7.5W (5V, 1.5A) in multiple positions. HyperDrive is plug-n-play and interfaces directly with Mac OS or Windows. Plugging devices into HyperDrive is like plugging directly to the computer. On Mac OS, video displays are controlled by Mac OS System Preferences > Displays. Power delivery by Mac OS System Preferences > Energy Saver. External storage are controlled by Mac OS Finder.\nAbout us\nHYPER by Sanho Corporation has been making award winning Apple accessories since 2009.

This is a film about 5 of the best climbers in the world doing what they do best: crushing. Pretty Strong will follow 5 female climbers* around the world as they explore new climbing areas, find projects, and push the boundaries of our sport.\nThis film is for every climber stuck on the couch recovering from an injury. This film is for that little girl who just started climbing, to show her that the climbing world is a place for her. This film is for the climber looking for that last nudge of inspiration to get off their ass and go to the gym. If you\u2019re a climber, this film is for you.\n*There are dozens of climbers we are considering for this project, but the final selection will depend on climbing objectives, funding, athlete schedules, and our production schedule. As we get more of these things confirmed, we will update you on who we are planning to include. Comment below on who you would like to see featured!\n**Shoutout to good friend, designer, motion graphics artist, and creative genius Bryan Nanista for our badass Never Not Collective end card. Check out more of his work at http://www.bryanjnanista.com/ or on Instagram @bnanista.\nWhat was the first major climbing film you ever saw? What about the most recent one? Chances are if you\u2019ve turned on a climbing film in the last 18 years, you\u2019ve seen male climbers dominating the screen. With more women climbers than ever, the numbers weren't adding up, so we did some research. \nNina Williams on the Southwest Arete (5.9). Photo: Colette McInerney\nOut of 91 main segments in high production climbing films, there have been 8 segments that feature a female climber as the main character (and the same woman was the subject in three of those). Out of the 91 segments, 11 showed a woman climbing\u2026but her part was a supplement to the main story about one or more male climbers. Out of the six narrative-style feature films we looked at, none have had a female climber as the lead character.\nEmily Harrington on 'Tom Et Je Ris' (8b+/5.14a), Verdon Gorge, France. Photo: Colette McInerney\n...And we want to see more women making media.\nNot only are the climbing films being made today mostly featuring men on screen, but they are predominantly being created by men. We're hoping to foster a community and network of female media makers through Never Not (with this project and future ones). We want to build relationships with established female camera operators, editors, composers, animators, etc., and create opportunities for women who are new to outdoor media. \nBelow is a breakdown of the Pretty Strong budget. We are planning on getting half of our funding from Kickstarter and the other half from brand partners. \n        We are videographers, writers, photographers, and most importantly, climbers. With climbing films for inspiration, all four of us longed for movies that put female climbers front and center. As we developed individually as creatives and eventually founded this all-women's production team, we realized: We should make the film we've always wanted to see.\nStarted by four unapologetic women of the outdoors, Never Not Collective seeks to tell the stories of everyday people doing great things, brave things, things that are challenging, engaging, and gratifying\u2014regardless of \u201csuccess.\u201d Action is exciting, but we believe that people, with all their complexity, faults, and flaws, are at the heart of every compelling story. Our deep commitment to collaboration stems from diverse backgrounds in writing, photography, video, multimedia, and analytics. This fusion of unique perspectives helps Never Not create refreshing content that connects with a wide variety of viewers. \nCOLETTE MCINERNEY After a decade of traveling the world as a professional climber, Colette started recording her adventures through photography and film in 2010. She found her passion at the intersection of photo, film, travel, and climbing, and since then she\u2019s worked with companies like Red Bull, National Geographic, Prana, and New Balance to capture the story behind the biggest accomplishments. From summiting 14,000-foot peaks to scaling massive limestone walls, she can\u2014and will\u2014go anywhere to get the shot.\nJULIE ELLISON As Climbing magazine\u2019s first female Editor in Chief, Julie has spent a quarter of her life writing, shooting, and editing stories about climbing and the outdoors. With a genuine documentary style, her stories use adventure as a way to experience the world and help the people in it. She\u2019s written about the refugee crisis on the island of Kalymnos, a climbing camp for cancer survivors, and seeing death firsthand in Mexico. In 2017, the OR Daily named her one of the 26 Most Talented People in the Outdoor Industry.\nSHELMA JUN Shelma is a sucker for a good story. Whether it\u2019s documenting cyclists of color in NYC or building a temporary community art park in the Lower East Side, she focuses on bringing people together and sharing their stories. She is the founder of Flash Foxy, a multi-media platform that celebrates women in climbing, and the creator of the Women\u2019s Climbing Festival, a weekend of climbing, panels, and clinics. In 2017, she was named one of 40 women who\u2019ve made the biggest impact in the outdoor world by Outside Magazine.\nLESLIE HITTMEIER Working as an editor at Skiing Magazine, a managing editor at Teton Gravity Research, and a freelance photographer, Leslie became a fixture in skiing media before joining Never Not Collective as the group\u2019s token young gun. She\u2019s traveled to Chile, Japan, France, Jamaica, and all over the American West to document badass skiers, climbers, and adventurers in their natural habitats.

Currently available at the $99* EARLYISH BIRD perk ($139.95 retail price), $198* for two, or $285* for all three. *Does not include shipping.\n        Made in Bolivia with llama fiber, the Libre Sweater is our answer to the garment that doesn\u2019t exist any more\u2014a beautiful, rugged knit engineered to be put through the wringer, day after day. It keeps you comfortable, invites you to push yourself, and maintains that classic, heritage-inspired look, wherever you happen to roam. \n            We started with a tailored, unisex silhouette for the Libre, and then added raglan sleeves for enhanced mobility. In other words, no restriction while reaching for a climbing hold, zero bunching while stretched out over the handlebars, and no pull while lifting the coffee mug. For the front panel and arms, we\u2019ve employed a buttery-soft, midweight llama knit for year-round wear. We engineered an innovative, breathable knit mesh for the back panel, helping to regulate body temperature by releasing excess heat and moisture vapor. Say goodbye to sweaty back syndrome. Additionally, we beefed up the ribbing on the neck, cuffs, and hem to eliminate the dreadful stretching and sagging that plagues most woolen tops. We then rounded out the design by adding double-reinforced seams throughout to ensure it stands up the loads of use and abuse we encourage you to dish out. \nThe Libre pays homage to the early wool-wearing boundary pushers\u2014vikings, sailors, climbers, alpinists, skiers, writers, and other trailblazers who did things their way. After all, the wool sweater is one of the original technical midlayers, and we recognize it as a symbol of freedom that invites, and challenges, us to push ourselves to do things our way. \n  The story starts with the llama\u2014that noble, dependable pack animal that\u2019s been providing a way of life for people in the Bolivian Andes for thousands of years. Llamas are adapted to this high plains region, where 50-degree temperature swings can occur daily, and their hollow hair serves as the perfect form of natural insulation. It\u2019s proven to effectively trap warm air, insulate when wet, create a natural wind block, in addition to being naturally hypoallergenic, elastic, strong, and soft to the touch. This made it the perfect choice for the foundation of our Libre project.\n    Additionally, llama fiber is sourced with minimal effects on the environment, and the sale of llama fiber acts as a source of income for thousands of families in the Andes. We\u2019re working closely with these farmers and manufacturers to develop a supply chain that focuses on the animals\u2019 well-being, improves people\u2019s lives, and minimizes our impact on the environment. Members of our team regularly visit suppliers to ensure that we\u2019re creating a lasting, positive impact on communities in the region by responsibly sourcing the fiber that goes into our products.\n               We\u2019ve partnered with a team in Bolivia for our fiber, which is one of the few companies in the world that\u2019s developed an innovative dehairing process to separate coarse llama hair from fine hair. It\u2019s based on the same principles used for dehairing cashmere, yielding the finest fibers possible for its \u201cCashmere of the Andes.\u201d This fiber is then knitted to our specs to create the highly insulating, comfortable, and durable Libre sweater.\nTransparency and camaraderie stand at the center of this company, with a group of employees that has grown into a family within a superb working environment and excellent working conditions. \nThe group we've partnered with proudly holds social and environmental sustainability as the company\u2019s core values. Its strong commitment to social responsibility is evident throughout the company\u2019s practices and production processes: \nIt is WRAP (Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production) certified. \nAll workers receive health and retirement benefits, paid vacation, and double pay for overtime. \nIt provides food subsidies to factory workers. \nErgonomic chairs for all of its workers. \nClose to 80% of its workforce are women; many of whom are the sole providers of their households. \nPreservation of Bolivia\u2019s strong heritage of knitting by providing job opportunities through this trade. \nThe use fiber dyes with low environmental impact. \nA water treatment plant has been mounted by its sister company and yarn provider to treat the production\u2019s water residues. \nLow-carbon emissions through the use of natural gas as our main source for heating. \nThe use of biodegradable plastic bags for shipping. \n      All our products are Guaranteed For Good. Your product is guaranteed to last 61 years, the average lifespan of a person living in the developing world. \nIf your product does not meet your expectations in any way, we\u2019ll work with you to resolve the issue, whether that means returning the item for repair, replacing or exchanging it, or refunding your purchase.\n  Davis Smith is a member of the UN Foundation\u2019s Global Entrepreneurs Council.

All the trips we have done in the past relied on us as volunteers to come up with large amounts of funds, typically asking our family and friends, to finance the project. Also, our impact on these trips was limited to building a single house for one family. Project Latitude is our solution to the following problems:\n1. How could we make volunteering trips more affordable?\n2. How could we have a more lasting presence in these communities?\nThe concept is simple: Our products are tied to a community for as long as they are sold. The community will inspire the product design, make the products and they will be the sole recipients of the funds raised from the sales.\nEach project will have a fundraising goal. We are architects, so every project will respond to the communities\u2019 construction needs. Since this particular project is a build, let's say it's a certain amount of bricks needed to be raised. Every product we sell will count towards this fundraising goal.\nEach product is tied to the community for its lifetime. So when we start a new project, it will be with an entirely new line of products \u2013 based on the culture of this new community.\nBecause of everyone\u2019s support on Project Latitude\u2019s Kickstarter, we were able to donate 1200 liters of water to the Ecuador Earthquake relief efforts. The water was donated earlier this week in Canoa, Ecuador and came at a critical time for the community.\nOur first product is the result of a trip to Ecuador, where we were inspired by the Andean culture and lifestyle. We fell in love with the rich colors and textures of the local fabric, which inspired us to design a backpack to help raise our funds.\nThe Chaski Backpack is an all-purpose roll-top backpack designed for people like us, one that could be used in the city AND on adventurous weekend getaways. \nEach Chaski is individually handmade in Ecuador.  Chaski means messenger in Quichua - the local Andean language.\nRoll-Top Style Backpack\nLocal Material Shoulder Strap Detailing\nExterior Pockets for Everyday Essentials\nAll Detailing is made from 100% Recycled Car Tires\nPadded Interior Laptop Compartment\nVertical Front Pocket Accessible While Backpack is on Shoulder\nRubber Bottom with Unique Pattern from Recycled Car Tires\nAustriAlpin Quick-Release Buckle\nHandwoven Interior Lining and Accent Strap\nMultiple Strap Colors Available\nAll products are stamped with the latitude coordinate where the product is from. The Chaski has 00 for Ecuador.\nAnyone can track the impact the sales are making as well as track the overall progress of the project on our website. Each product will also come with a tag about the members of the community.\nOur hope is to create a brand that will ultimately impact communities across Latin America by rethinking the way volunteer projects are funded.\nWhile many other companies offer to donate a portion of their proceeds to a good cause, Project Latitude actually takes the funds - or bricks in this case - and builds the project!\nWith the help of volunteers, Project 00 will build an entrepreneur workshop in the community of La Isla outside Quito, Ecuador. This will provide the community with much needed space for production, which in turn will empower the workers and the community as a whole.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are architects/designers - we have full confidence in the process of designing the products as well as organizing the physical build.

Fill tikr with treats, then set the length of playtime by turning the built-in timer dial. There are NO electronics to break, and NO batteries to charge or even replace. Yup, you read that right!\nFill with Treats!\nSet the timer from 5-45 minutes\nPlaytime!\nPlaytime can be as short as 5 minutes, or as long as 45. You decide! \nTikr rewards your dog's play and curiosity with gradual access to the treats inside. \nTreats can only fall out when the timer-controlled holes in the toy align, so your dog remains captivated throughout play.\nThe treat holes are different sizes, so larger treats are saved until the very end. First the small, then the medium, and finally the large treat!\nOh, and did we mention... no batteries or charging required!\nTikr is made of incredibly tough rubber that is safe on teeth and won\u2019t make that loud rattling sound that hard plastic toys do.\nHelp us reach 1,001 backers and free tikr treats unlock for all backers! Tikr treats are the perfect size for tikr, healthy, and all-natural. Help spread the word!\nThe idea for tikr came from playing with our dogs Misha and Aure. Our dogs love to play. But unfortunately, nothing on the market was keeping their attention for more than a few minutes at best. They needed a stimulating, long-lasting dog toy that would spark their natural curiosity. And we wanted a safe, healthy and affordable solution... \nSo, we came up with tikr!\nOur concept was to use a timer to MAXIMIZE the time that treats were captured by the toy. This would ultimately ensure that playtime would last. I took the idea to d:e Creative to transform it from concept to reality...\nSome of my early sketches\nTogether we developed tikr to be the ULTIMATE solution: a super fun interactive dog toy that rewards your pup's attention with treats, and can keep them engaged for an amazingly long period of time - over and over again!\nEarly CAD screenshots\nAll dogs rejoice... it's a hit!\nTikr's patent pending secret is the built-in timer combined with varying hole sizes. As the timer unwinds, the hole in the treat chamber slowly aligns with the increasingly bigger holes in the outer shell. When the inner hole aligns with the outer holes, the treats are awarded through play. Larger treats remain inside tikr (until the time is right) because they can't fit through the smaller holes. \nIt's really that simple!\nX-Ray view shows the treat chamber rotating - in super quick time!\nWe're designing special tikr treats that will be the ideal size. But, you can totally use any treats or kibble your dog likes! Keep the play experience exciting by varying the timer settings, or amount of treats used.\nTikr is made from a food safe rubber-like blend that's flexible, extremely durable, and easy on your dog's teeth. It uses no electronics or batteries.\ntikr size compared with a standard tennis ball\nTikr has been our labor of love for the last two-and-a-half years. The design has been perfected and dogs absolutely love playing with tikr!  Production is nearly ready, and we've come to you, the Kickstarter community, to help us make tikr a reality for dog lovers everywhere. \nTooling has been very costly, and we want to make a sizable order with the factory in order to keep the costs low for everyone.

We believe that there needs to be a fashionable and functional alternative for climbing footwear. This is where our journey began, and has now surpassed what we thought was even possible. In the end, we created an authentic shoe line full of classic, distinctive qualities. Let\u2019s Take Hold together.      \n     Early in the process, we committed to blending fashion and function. The colors, style, and nostalgia of retro footwear drove our simple obsession. Pulling inspiration from vintage running shoes, retro soccer shoes, and bowling shoes, we slowly began turning these inspirational concepts into high performance climbing shoes. \n     We pioneered along-side an innovative designer from France and began to tackle the mountains ahead. Every part of each shoe has been meticulously designed. The external features of the shoes distinctively resemble the classic footwear that originally inspired us.  \n     Our development process resulted in over 150 samples. Although a daunting and lengthy process, only extended by our fierce and stubborn determination to develop originality and a timeless aesthetic, not a single detail was overlooked.\n     Between our ingenuity and final world-class samples, 1,095 days have passed. That is three years of defying the odds and building our vision. 36 months of creating a product that is stylish, unprecedented, and innovative.\n     We want to build these shoes together, and offer you a deep discount as an early pioneer. We are not owned by a parent company or conglomerate.  We don't have big investors, and are completely independent. Yet, you have helped make us identifiable in the world of climbing, for which we are incredibly grateful. We are excited to bring you a future of innovative grips, clothing, and footwear. Thank you and enjoy.\n      In our pursuit for a rubber that exceeded the standard, we discovered one formulated for the United States Navy Seals. The rubber was built for a purpose. This outsole rubber provided security for the Navy Seals, assuring that their feet would not slip during rugged approaches.\n     We signed a licensing agreement, and began to incorporate the innovative rubber into our shoes. This tenacious rand and outsole rubber is called \u201cDark Matter\", and is a member of the \"UnParallel Rubber\" family. Its signature is denoted with a simple line placed on the bottom of each shoe.\n     Our functional colored outsole rubber is the first of it\u2019s kind, ever. Several models are the only climbing shoes, ever created, devoid of the monotonous black outsole. The creation of both a sticky and colored outsole rubber provides a perfect combination of fashion, function, and performance.\n     Inspired by a retro running shoe, the Runner embodies simple aspects of classic footwear while retaining the functionality of a high-performance climbing shoe. A medium stiffness, highly downturned toe provides precision in technical or steep overhung climbing. The fish-hook, thin midsole helps edging power for gym and outdoor climbing.\n     The padded tongue, breathable mesh upper, and thin lining offers comfort and reliability. Crafted with synthetic materials to create a long lasting fit (minimal stretch) and three point velcro closure system, the Runner is a supreme climbing shoe blending fashion and function.\nLearn More\n     Inspired by a retro running shoe, the Runner embodies simple aspects of classic footwear while retaining the functionality of a high-performance climbing shoe.

The LV (Low Volume) version is for a narrower, thinner foot.\nLearn More\n     Inspired by everyday classic footwear, the Street is a faultless blend of fashion and function. The softest and most downturned aggressive shoe in the line was designed with synthetic materials for minimal stretch. An ultra thin midsole proves a softer, more sensitive feel, creating an extremely lightweight, aggressive climbing shoe.\n     The Street is fully sealed in a formidable matte black finish and equipped with a thin, padded tongue. The toe box has been masterfully crafted to allow for a higher level of comfort and works conjunctively with the perfect amount of tension in the heel. The larger matte black buckles give the tightening system power and sensitivity to mold the soft shoe to your foot.\nLearn More\n     Designed to resemble a retro 70\u2019s bowling shoe, the Bowler mimics similar characteristics in style. Adorned in vintage details, the Bowler is an original climbing shoe intended for beginners with a less aggressive, classic shape. Produced with a supremely thick midsole for durability, ultra thick rand, and leather upper for extreme comfort, the Bowler is something cool for beginner climbers.        \nLearn More\n     Modeled after a 1970\u2019s retro soccer shoe, the Kick is a uniquely crafted climbing shoe. A perfect companion for intermediate climbers, the shape is slightly arched and perfectly tensioned in the heel. Developed with comfort and function in mind, the medium stiffness midsole helps enable the shoe retain its clean shape.\n     The Kick is dyed leather with custom colors, soaking them in rich tones creates an unprecedented original shoe. Perfect for bouldering, gym training, and outdoor climbing, the Kick blurs the lines between comfort and performance.

If you are a guy, start with your street shoe size. Then, we suggest ordering a half size down for a comfortable fit and a full size down for a performance fit.\n     If you are a lady ordering a Regular Volume shoe, take a size and a half off your street shoe to get the regular volume equivalent. Then downsize a half or full size depending on fit preference.\nLow Volume (LV): Low Volume shoes are for anyone with a thinner, narrower foot. Because this is normally a characteristic of ladies, the sizing of Low Volume shoes are based on ladies\u2019 sizes.\n     If you are a lady, start with your street shoe size. Then, we suggest ordering a half size down for a comfortable fit and a full size down for a performance fit.\n     If you are a guy ordering a Low Volume shoe, add a size and a half to your street shoe to get the low volume equivalent. Then, downsize a half or full size depending on fit preference.\nWhere does your rubber come from? \"Dark Matter\" rubber, a member of the \"UnParallel Rubber\" family, was developed for the United States Navy Seals. A sticky, colored outsole rubber for their approach shoes was needed. We use this same rubber for our climbing shoes. The first of its kind.\nHow many shoes are you able to produce? We are in this for the long haul and are committed to filling every pre order and orders for years to come.\nWhat sizes do you offer? Regular Volume: 4-13 (includes half sizes) Low Volume: 4-11 (includes half sizes).\nWhat if my shoes don\u2019t fit? Simply call us to receive a return authorization number. Send the shoes back, and we will ship you a replacement in the correct size.\nDo you ship internationally? Yes. If you are outside of the USA, please select the international support option.\nWhere will you be selling your shoes after Kickstarter? Early retailers listed above will be the first with product, please support them.\nWhen is the estimated delivery date? We plan to ship all pre orders between June 1st and July 1st of this year from our warehouse in Saint Louis, MO.\nWhy do you need my support of this project?

So, we need to hit this goal! You can help by continuing to spread the word and sharing on Facebook/Twitter! \nWHAT PEOPLE SAY ABOUT TEPLO:\nIntroducing the world\u2019s first smart bottle for tea lovers.\nTeplo is a revolutionary smart bottle that allows tea drinkers to brew the perfect cup of tea by tracking and controlling brewing temperature and time, via a mobile app. Instead of letting your tea get cold, a rechargeable battery hidden in the base of the bottle keeps the beverage at the preferred temperature. Plus users can personalize, find and order premium teas from all over the world on Teplo\u2019s app.\nTHE PROBLEM:\nTea is the most popular drink in the world yet many tea drinkers don\u2019t realize that getting the perfect cup of tea is actually quite complex and difficult; tea is extremely sensitive to temperature and brewing time. Compared to the way most typically brew tea: by simply throwing a tea bag in hot water and start drinking, we are ignoring taste, flavor, color and even the correct drinking temperature of the tea. \nThe Teplo team spent the past year carefully engineering both the bottle and the technology that powers it and are excited to unveil our product and bring it to tea lovers around the world. Introducing the world\u2019s smartest bottle for tea drinkers - simple and elegant!\nTHE SOLUTION:\nTeplo combines technology with its unique design to allow for the most perfect tea drinking experience, unlike anything else.\nThe glass bottle allows tea enthusiasts to appreciate the color of the tea, as well as to maintain the perfect temperature for a long period of time.\nHOW IT WORKS:\nCRAFT YOUR PERSONALIZED TEA BLEND:\nTHE SPECS:\nTeplo\u2019s innovative design consists of a glass bottle with a thermo sensor, heater, Bluetooth communication module and two batteries. An internal battery is used to communicate with smart devices, and has an all-day battery life. An external battery maintains the drinking temperature for as long as four hours.\nTHE APP:\nTeplo will provide a mobile application for iOS and Android, available from the App store.\nTHE R&D:\nWe develop our technology in our in house R&D lab. We also leverage our capability by partnering with manufacturers across the world.\nTHE PRESS:\nTHE TEAM:\nKazunori Kawanobe (CEO, co-founder)\nAbhinav Sureka (COO, co-founder)\nMayuresh Soni (CTO, co-founder)\nMarissa Goldstein, CMO\nBill Phelps, Ideastorm Inc., Design Partner\nTetsuo Hitomi(tet.hitomi@gmail.com), Logo Design Partner\nMai Usami(sammy.mu@gmail.com), Logo Design Assistant\nLemonLight Media, Video Production\nAdam Goldstein, Timroon, Manufacturing Partner\nOUR STORY:\nWe are three friends who came to the US to get our MBA\u2019s at Babson College. Coming from Japan and India, tea is really important to our culture. With a growing tea market in the US of $2.4B, we thought that there must be a better way to use technology to create a better tea drinking experience. So, after discussing together, we decided to create Teplo, a simple yet elegant solution that combines modern technology with traditional tea drinking.\nWe\u2019ve spent the past year designing and building both our hardware product as well as the technology that powers it. We\u2019ve gone through countless prototypes and have tested it out on our classmates, who come from all over the world.\nNow we are ready to launch Teplo and get it into the hands of tea enthusiasts all over the world and we need your help.

N3RDABL3\nWhat Is myLED?\nmyLED is an external notification light for iPhones and iPads that flashes to alert you of notifications such as missed calls, emails and social network updates. It allows you to keep informed of activity on your phone without having to switch on the screen.\nmyLED is packed with a ton of functionality and fits seamlessly into iOS devices. It sits inside the headphone jack to ensure full visibility from every direction, and when there is an interaction such as an email or missed call, myLED starts flashing to let you know.\nmyLED in real life size\nmyLED in operation\nmyLED is an incredibly simple solution to an issue many of the 400 million iPhone and iPad users have: notifications. There is no convenient way to get alerts for activities such as missed calls, emails and social network updates on iOS - if you\u2019ve used a BlackBerry or Android and have seen them flash to alert you, you'll understand the difference. Phone notifications are a small detail however it can cause much aggravation to check the phone for new activity every few minutes. \nWe have come to face the challenge of creating myLED from a personal need. We used to have Blackberrys and got accustomed to the extremely handy notification light. When we migrated to the iPhone and the iPad we felt the devices had a major deficiency in the lack of external notification i.e. to check for missed activities you must switch the screen on. This can be particularly inconvenient, for example when the device is on silent mode such as in the office, at meetings, lectures or when you are in noisy environments. \nFrom this need we decided to find a better way to get notifications from our iPhones and iPads; so we created myLED.\nHow Does myLED Work?\nmyLED is a elegantly designed accessory with a micro-LED connected to the audio jack. You insert it into an iPhone or iPad, switch on the myLED app, and set what you\u2019d like it to notify you of - missed calls, and Twitter updates for example. Now those incoming notifications  will trigger myLED to flash, and it will continue flashing until you see what you\u2019ve missed - alternatively you can program myLED to flash for a given time only.\nHow to use myLED\nSince myLED allows you to customize different blinking patterns for the various notifications, it is easy to see what kind of activity has happened at first sight. \nFurthermore, myLED comes with a headphones clip so that when not in use it can be safely stowed.\nmyLED headphone clip\nmyLED is a super-useful complement to any iOS device, so small and intuitive that it will feel as a natural part of your iPhone or iPad.\nWhat Kind Of Alerts Can I Get On myLED?\n   Missed Calls\n   FaceTime\n   Emails \n   Skype\n   Facebook\n   Twitter\nWhere We Are At\nWe have been designing and developing myLED for a couple of months applying lean methods to the entire process. We set out with a goal of creating an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) and to complete a proof of concept.\n  CAD model of the jack's head\nWe successfully built a number of prototypes, iterated through a few designs and developed a basic working iOS app that enables myLED to run on the iPhone and iPad. \nmyLED prototype\nThe next stage is to launch the project here on Kickstarter in order to gauge interest in the product. While we are generating funds we can complete the development of the myLED jack and start to produce packaging concepts and detailed plans for the app architecture. As soon as funding is available to use, manufacture can commence.\nProject Timeline\nWhy We Need You\u2026\nWe are raising money to revolutionize the way notifications work on iOS.\nOur team is in advanced discussion with a manufacturer and in order to produce myLED on an industrial level we need to address the following:\nTooling, manufacturing and assembly: the production of the bespoke 3.5mm jack requires special tooling, and this costs several thousand dollars alone. The soldering process for connecting the micro-LEDs to the jack needs high precision and it is also highly expensive.\nInjection molding: to manufacture the white casing we need to create a custom-made mold for plastic injection.\nApp development: we need to continue developing our software in order to reach full functionality, and for this we\u2019ve found highly skilled and experienced developers who are working for us.\nFinally, we have to package and ship myLED to you.\n\n  FAQs\nDoes myLED flash in different colors? Currently myLED produces a red flash. We choose to create myLED with a single color in-order to minimize the size of the device, which otherwise would require significantly more electronic components. This design also ensures minimal power consumption that may otherwise significantly affect battery life on an iOS device.\nDoes myLED alert for text messages? At this point we are facing challenges making text messages work with myLED so we expect the initial app to ship only with notifications for Calls, Emails, FB, Twitter and Skype.\nCan I use earphones while myLED is in use? No, myLED is inserted into the headphones input and so headphones can\u2019t be used together with myLED - that said, the whole point of myLED is to alert you to phone activity when you\u2019re away from it. Also, a plastic clip to hold myLED to your headphones set when not in use will be shipped as part of your myLED package.\nDo I need to install software on my iOS device for myLED to work? Yes, you install a free app that interfaces and controls the settings for myLED. The app will be free for download to all our backers.\nDoes the app need to be \"on\" for myLED to work? Yes, myLED app needs to run in the background and we are currently working on further minimizing battery consumption. Our tests on iPad 3 showed 80hrs of battery life with myLED app running in the background and wi-fi data connection switched on.\nIs myLED compatible with all iOS devices? Currently myLED has been successfully tested with iPhone 3, 3S, 4, 4S, 5 iPad 2, The New iPad. \nI want to order more than one myLED \u2013 how can I do it? Due to the new Kickstarter rules for manufacturing projects we have not been able to insert more rewards for multiple quantities (for example a x2, x3, x10 packs etc). However you can pledge a sum equal to the price of the reward desired  x the number of myLEDs you want. We intend to do a survey at the end of the funding to collect addresses and make sure everyone receive what they pledged for.\nAlso, please contact us directly if you are interested in a large quantity purchase (x10 myLEDs or more) to secure the best deal.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy pledging you get to be involved in an innovative project and we endeavour to reward you for that, but you also agree to share the residual development risks and challenges with us. \n\niOS development\nOne risk is app approval by Apple for the AppStore. \nGaining access to notifications on the phone log is blocked for most apps and we are having to work hard to find solutions that don\u2019t use this method.\nWhile we will work tirelessly to create an app that is acceptable to Apple and feel that we can do so, we cannot make guarantees since this process is outside of our control. \nThe final development of the app will continue as soon as the funds are available to us, and we will be submitting our app for approval at the first opportunity. However, given the nature of our delivery programme, we will be likely to hear back from Apple once the product and packaging production is well underway and these activities will absorb almost the entirety of the money raised on kickstarter. For this reason, if we come up against an insurmountable problem with the app approval, we will be unable to offer refunds.\nUnexpected software development obstacles could be a risk too, although we have carried out a large number of experiments with our developer to ensure the feasibility of all the features and details that are still to be implemented in the final app.\n\nmyLED working with text messages\nWe have run into a challenge getting the app working with the text message client. We are exploring alternative solutions and will inform our pledgers on progress throughout software development.\n\nManufacturing process\nShipping time can be delayed subject to manufacturing delays.

We compare the Boombot REX to the Jawbone Jambox and the Kickstarter funded Outdoor Technologies Turtle Shell.\n________________________________________________________\nBoombotix at CES '13! Stop by booth 3506 in the iLounge pavilion and check out the Boombot REX speaker firsthand. Sake and Sumo on Tues and Wed at 4PM!\nREX is the next evolution of smart speakers in the ultraportable Boombot collection. A salute to the king of dinosaurs, the REX mimics the thump of the T-Rex\u2019s footsteps as it ruled the land. With revolutionary acoustic and industrial design, a noise-canceling microphone and a built-in clip, the REX allows you to stay connected to your friends and your music, while keeping your phone safely in your pocket. The REX connects to iPods, smartphones, tablets, and laptops using wireless Bluetooth technology. Stream music, change tracks, and answer, end, or deny phone calls on the fly. The REX is built to withstand the demands of an active lifestyle so you can bring music to where you enjoy it most.\nUltraportable engineering that fits in your palm\nThe product originated from carving a clay block to find the ideal shape for the ultraportable speaker. The REX was crafted to fit in the palm of your hand, be clipped onto your backpack, belt, or handlebars and be toted on adventures with ease. The housing is a ruggedized high-impact ABS shell with the circuit board secured to the internal frame in four locations. The unit is certified IP53 water-resistant; don\u2019t hesitate to bring it cycling in rain or on your next snow outing. The REX is powered by a rechargeable medical-grade lithium-ion battery that will keep the tunes booming for 6 hours. The industrial design of the REX encourages you to pick it up, clip it on, and add a soundtrack to your life in motion.\nModern design with unparalleled utility\nAs a companion device to your mobile phone, we sculpted the edges of the REX to compliment your handset as a day-to-day accessory. We chose to build something distinguished that can be discreetly integrated into your outerwear, or showcased as a beacon of modern design. In addition, the REX features fully interchangeable grills and belt clips and will come in limited edition colorways designed by renown artists. Whatever your flavor, we've got you covered.\nUncompromising acoustic performance\nThe sound on the REX is unmatched by any speaker of its size. With dual 36-millimeter full-range drivers and a MASSIVE Bass Woofer, the REX is the smallest 2.1 sound-system in the world. The full dynamic range of the REX is stabilized across all frequencies in the audible spectrum allowing the speaker to reach over 90 dB@2ft. The REX has optimized volumetric calculations that are matched to the driver characteristics ensuring that every square inch helps deliver the richest audio experience possible.  \nHands-free capabilities that empower and protect\nThe REX incorporates a noise cancelling microphone that allows you to answer, deny, or end a phone call with the press of a button. Leave your phone protected in your pocket and change tracks and volume using our custom designed firmware. Do it all with just three buttons. \nDaisy chain with SoundHub technology\nThe Boombot REX features Audio IN and Audio OUT ports for ultimate system scalability. Simply plug in any peripheral speaker system to the Audio Out port on the Boombot REX and the stereo signal will be replicated throughout the entire system. To daisy chain the Boombot REX, simply plug the Audio Out into the Audio In port on the next Boombot REX speaker, and repeat infinitely. The best part of it all? Control any impromptu sound system wirelessly with Bluetooth!\nSiri Integration\nThe REX is the first ultraportable speaker with Siri integration.  Queue a request to Siri with the push of a button and Siri will answer back to you through the speaker. \nWhat we need to bring the REX series to life\nWe've invested in the research, design, and development of the product. We've even invested in the tooling to build this incredible piece, but we need your help to get the first pilot run of the REX to market.  We are looking to Kickstarter to raise at least $27k to fund our first low-volume production run.\nWe are grateful for your support. We're proud to offer our backers with:\n$5 donations Get swagged out with an anodized aluminum dog tag and a die-cut 4-color sticker.

Backers will enjoy an all expense paid trip to our headquarters in San Francisco where they will work hand-in-hand with our engineering and design team to craft their own one-off personalized speaker.  You will also be taking a fresh REX out for an evening of partying with the Boombotix crew and a staged photo-shoot where YOU get to be the creative director.  You\u2019re the BOSS!\nStretch Goal 1 @ $100k\nTHANK YOU Kickstarter for allowing us to continue following our dreams.  Now that you have sweetened the deal for us, we want to give a little something extra back to you.  We made these mini-cube shaped travel chargers that you can use to charge anything via USB including your new Boombot REX or your mobile device.  Each charger features a soft-touch coating and folding plugs so you can stay juiced up wherever you go.  \nThe Story\nBoombotix was founded by Lief Storer and Chris McKleroy - two college friends who met on the ski slopes of Lake Tahoe, with a passion for music, gadgets, and the active outdoor lifestyle. Lief, an optical engineer with a background in fiber optic lighting systems, created the first Boombot ultraportable speaker in 2009. Developed as an alternative to headphones, the Boombot was conceived by combining a Japanese vinyl toy, off-the-shelf speaker internals, and a walkie-talkie clip. Originally developed for a bike ride to work, both founders quickly realized that this product integrated perfectly into their life off the saddle as well. Chris, with a background in marketing and product design, began to sculpt the first Boombot REX prototype in 2011. With support from friends, advisors, and the growing team at Boombotix, the Boombot REX project began to take shape and evolve into the product you see today. \nEngineers + Audiophiles\nOur team has been building ultraportable speakers for years now and we have experienced the pleasure and pain of hardware.  Lief Storer heads the electromechanical design leveraging years of experience developing high-power intelligent fiberoptic lighting systems.  Chris McKleroy was instrumental in the original concept and design of the REX, and continues to be involved with the manufacturing and product management process.  Ben Radler flexes 16GB of RAM lodged in his cerebral cortex to undertake the task of iOS and Ruby development.  Ben is building technology that will expand the potential of the REX with a mobile app that allows audio mesh networking. \nOur crew now consists of seven people crammed into a studio-loft-garage in San Francisco's Mission District.  There is never a silent moment in the office, especially when you have round-the-clock R&D on a speaker system loud enough to fill up the whole room.  At least it sounds amazing because we wouldn't have it any other way. \nEveryone on our team has at least an 18-inch vert. Fact.\nHARDWARE\nPOWER OUTPUT: 3W x 2\nDRIVERS: 36mm x 2\nIMPEDANCE: 4 Ohm\nLOUDNESS: 87dB@2ft\nRUNTIME: 4-8hrs depending on conditions\nBATTERY CAPACITY: 1000mAh\nMICROPHONE FIELD: 60 degrees\nWEATHER RATING: IP53\nWIRELESS RANGE: 25-40ft\nDROP TESTING: Up to 2.5m\nINDICATOR: Tri-color LED\nFIRMWARE / SOFTWARE\nFully customized sound profile\n3-button interface for all commands\nSiri integration\nBluetooth v3.0 +HS\nBattery indicator displays on most mobile devices\nOption to set as favorite device\nFor in in depth acoustic analysis of the Boombot REX, please refer to our Portable Speaker Showdown.  We compare the Boombot REX to the Jawbone Jambox and the Kickstarter funded Outdoor Technologies Turtle Shell. \nFREQUENCY RESPONSE\nFrequency response curves in the audible spectrum show that the Boombot REX has very comparable response accross most frequencies to the Jawbone Jambox. The larger passive radiator of the Jambox offers more bass. With significantly less size and weight.\nSIZE REFERENCE\nWe have spent the last 15 months fine tuning the industrial design and the electromechanical engineering of the Boombot REX in our SF-based live-work-garage-studio loft.  We have been creating speakers for over two years with our trusted contract manufacturer in Shenzhen; we have gained many production efficiencies and learned about a number of production faults to look out for after shipping thousands of Boombot speakers. After six rounds of prototypes, The Boombot REX unit has been tooled and we are currently testing our T1 (first unit off the tool).\nPending the success of our Kickstarter campaign, we will begin production on the first round of units on December 31. We have sourced the materials for the first 3,000 units to be ready for this first production. These units have a 30 day lead time (production time).  We will take an additional 10 days to do a final inspection and QC of all outgoing units.  It will take another 24 days to ship across the Pacific Ocean leaving from Hong Kong and arriving in Oakland, CA. Units will be shipped via USPS ground from the Bay Area once landed.  We use a fulfillment center in Vacaville, CA which has the capacity to ship hundreds of boxes with a 48 hour turnaround. Between production time (30 days), final inspection and QC (10 days), and shipping from Hong Kong to Oakland, CA (30 days), the Boombot REX should be shipping out of our fulfillment center in early March.\nPending success the success of our campaign, beginning January 22nd, we will be able to produce 5,000 units per month with our current factory in order to meet demand. Units will have a 30 day lead time (production time), 10 day quality control/inspection,  and a 24 day shipping transit time. Units will be shipped to backers in order of project funding date. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHardware is hard. But we love it. As we mentioned, we've swallowed one of the most daunting tasks in product development (tooling), but there are certainly some potential bumps in the road that we're prepared for. \n\nOne of our biggest struggles on this project was power management. We aimed for such a compact form factor that there is limited space for anything. Hitting our target runtime has continued to be a struggle, but we are working on engineering a more efficient amp design. Some of our more recent tests seem much more promising, but there is still a lot of work to be done to deploy this design into production. \n\nThe REX pushes the upper threshold of what the speakers are capable of. There have been a number of improvements with integrated signal filters to alleviate issues with clipping and distortion. Digital music these days is chalked full of a wide variety of quality standards. This has resulted in a daunting variable that makes it difficult to deliver consistent sound quality from inconsistent signal levels. It is something our team would like to continue investing our time in improving, but for now, we'd encourage you to avoid crappy recordings whenever possible. After all, YOU are an audiophile too right? \n\nWe've worked with our ODM in China for several years now, which alleviates a number of risks associated with outsourcing. That's one less problem to worry about. This doesn't mean that we can relax, but we know that our challenge with them is to get them to produce exactly what we spec. Any first run product is more at-risk of falling off of spec, so we have to pay particularly close attention to getting it right the first time around, managing our risk, and ramping up production gradually.
