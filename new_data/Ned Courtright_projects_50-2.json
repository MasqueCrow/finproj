[{"backer": "Ned Courtright", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Epic wraparound cover by Fabio Ramacci and Ilaria Chiocca. (Trade dress not final)\nWelcome, soldier! Your mission, should you choose to accept it: \nFund PBOW: WORLD WAR BITCH No. 2,  a 40-page, saddle-stitch comic reuniting the creative team behind RED XMAS from Scout Comics. Readers call it...\nEpic wraparound cover by Fabio Ramacci and Ilaria Chiocca\nPBOW (that's Pregnant Bitches of War) launched in 2013 and quickly became a cult hit, selling through our website, comiXology, and Amazon. A crazy mix of over-the-top horror, sci-fi, grindhouse, and dark humor, it was a roller-coaster ride exploring a dark future where six pregnant women squared off against... well, Dad. \nHere's the pitch:\n\"Plucked from the time-stream by mad scientist Nikola Tesla, six pregnant women accidentally kill a young Hitler -- and unleash a nightmare future! Now, hunted by the Exalted Father, and with Tesla acting as Charlie to their Angels, they must save the world from a hell of their own creation... before their water breaks!\"\nIf you thought Volume One was nuts... you ain't seen nothin' yet.\nStandard issue when you enlist in the Kickstarter-exclusive edition:\nthe 24-page main story by the team that brought you RED XMAS\na back-up Frieda tale by Clay Adams, John Edingfield II and Ryan Kroboth \nplus exclusive bonuses\n THE 007 HOMAGE VARIANT\nWe're keeping our rewards pretty simple this go 'round. But in addition to our epic wraparound cover by Fabio & Ilaria, we have this variant by ALBERT EINSTEIN: TIME MASON's Tony Donley and FIREFLY's Fabiana Mascolo:\n\"The Man with the Golden Gun\" homage by Tony Donley and Fabiana Mascolo.\nSee below for more on our rewards. But first we dare you to enter...\nTHE BRIEFING ROOM !\nPossible Spoilers! Here's what you need to know -- last issue, The Exalted Father was warned of a dire prophecy:\nWhile his arch-frenemy Thomas Edison--dressed in drag, natch--heard the curious tale of an albino alligator with an... interesting diet. \nOK this double-page spread is really small here... but all you need to know is the name on the book.\nLater, Thomas Edison and his crew met up with PBOWs on a bridge high above the body of water where Gustave is said to hunt his prey. It... didn't go well:\nAnd now... \nThe Rewards\nIn addition to our standard and variant covers, there are a few rewards we'd like to highlight. Starting with...\nThe \"Virgin\" Cover\nNot a lot of virgins here--they're, uh, all pregnant--but you can get Fabio and Ilaria's epic wraparound cover sans writing:\nNo virgins were harmed making this variant.\nAnd if you're feeling flush, we also have the original art available:\nThe Sketchbook\nSnag a signed sketchbook of Fabio's art for $75, or for $100, he'll personalize it with a sketch of your choice. \nBlank sketch cover is $75. But for a few bucks more, he'll draw something on it... like this!\n\nA peek at some of the awesome art inside the sketchbook.\nTHE WATERCOLOR\nAwesome artist and all-around swell guy Kyle Roberts contributed a pin-up to our PBOW Volume One Trade, and he recently created a limited edition, hand-numbered, hand-painted edition of it. We've got a limited supply of these beauties, so act fast, soldier!\nSigned and numbered by Kyle Roberts.\nThe Add-Ons\nDon't see the combo you want? Add digital or physical rewards to your order at checkout for the perfect four-color meal.\nTHE TIERS\nTHE PACKAGING--AND THE GUARANTEE\nWar is hell. So is the USPS. We've received our fair share of comics that got mangled by the mail carrier.\nYou pay premium prices on Kickstarter, and you deserve better. That's why your supplies will be delivered in Gemini Comic Mailers:\nThese babies are sturdy. They require a little more money, a little more time (and a lot more tape!) but it's worth it to make sure your comics arrive in pristine condition.\nAnd if somehow your comic still shows up looking like it went through a war zone?\nFrieda will replace it free of charge.\nYour base of operations will be the FRIED Diner. To many civilians, the diner appears to be a cover for a comics publisher of questionable taste. But don't be fooled by their nine successful Kickstarters--the comics business is ALSO a cover. These people are battle-hardened warriors, and they'll be your guides as you enter the fray.\nClay is the co-writer of RED XMAS from Scout Comics, and he served as co-editor for the NIGHTMARE THEATER anthology on Kickstarter. His feature script, THE ECLIPSE, placed second in the horror category of the FADEIn Awards, and his latest comic, ELECTRIC YOUTH, co-written with Kyle Roberts, was recently featured in the LA Times. He has written and directed for television and holds a BFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU. In a past life, he voiced lead roles on TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES, POKEMON, and YU-GI-OH.\nFilm nerd/director Alexandre is the co-writer of RED XMAS from Scout Comics. His most recent documentary is LEAP OF FAITH: WILLIAM FRIEDKIN ON THE EXORCIST, now streaming on Shudder. He holds a Masters Degree in Dramatic Writing from NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and has written and directed numerous award-winning films and documentaries, including MEMORY: THE ORIGINS OF ALIEN, 78/52: HITCHCOCK'S SHOWER SCENE, AND THE PEOPLE vs. GEORGE LUCAS. \nHot off RED XMAS by Scout Comics, Fabio jumps into the PBOW fray from Rome, Italy, where he has published with Sergio Bonelli Editore, Star Comics, Midian Comics and Cairo Editore. Aside from Fried Comics, he has contributed art for a bunch of Kickstarter comics and also some sketch cards for Dynamite Entertainment. Our resident Italian Stallion likes alt rock and (we assume) makes a great cappuccino, but all indications are that he ain't that Fabio.\nIlaria Chiocca is an italian comic artist, illustrator and colorist. She has published two manga style comic books with Shockdom as co-author; she's created many covers and she has been published by Lo Scarabeo publisher as a digital painter, and now she's working as a colorist for Fried Comics, Scout Comics, and many other projects worldwide.\nJohn is a cartoonist, illustrator and writer. He has successfully funded two books of his creator owned series Rancidville on Kickstarter, as well as contributing to a number of anthology projects. He currently skulks in the hills of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania with his family.\nRyan is a writer, artist, and alum of the The Comics Experience School. He successfully Kickstarted his debut comic, SUNMAKER, and contributed art to the ComixTribe column 'The Proving Grounds.'  He loves Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, ninjas, teens, mutants and turtles.\nThe worst.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nBecause wars--like comics--have to be funded, dammit!\nDid you know Forbes magazine recently named Kickstarter one of the biggest (and most successful) comics publishers of 2018? We love the direct market and always will, but some of the best comics being produced right now are coming out on this very platform, and we love being a part of this indie, gonzo spirit. Plus, Kickstarter backers are the best. This is our direct pipeline to you, the readers.\n*Cough* I mean, soldiers.\nOK. Where do the funds go?\ncopyright Can Stock Photo / pressmaster\nGlad you asked. First we will drive around town in our low-rider, windows down and music blaring as we wave it at everyone we see.  \nAfter that, all funds go 100% towards fighting the war: paying the art and design team, printing the books, and shipping them to you. Anything above and beyond that will go towards the next battle, PBOW: WORLD WAR BITCH #3.\nYour Tour of Duty:\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: ~20 Days (May 18-June 17)\nKickstarter Funds Released: ~June 30\nDigital Rewards Released: ~August 1\nBook Goes to Printer: ~August 15\nBook Printed and shipped to us - ~September 1\n\"$#it happens\" buffer - 2 weeks (~September 15)\nPack and ship - (September 15-September 30)\nExpected delivery to US backers - 2 Weeks (Late September)\nExpected delivery for International Backers - 4 Weeks (Early October)\nBEFORE WE GO...\nWe here at the FRIED Diner are a cowardly and superstitious lot.

Allen is a man of many talents, but he excels at knowing what people want or need, and knowing how to get it - mostly through lying and flattery. Using his (questionable)skills, Allen takes advantage of the desires of the passengers and crew of the Iridescence to an unknown end. The story focuses on Allen as schmoozes and tricks people into getting the things he needs from them. All the while, his internal monologue is running through his process and keeping him from getting too bored. He meets a variety of colorful characters in his exploits, ranging from lowly crew members to wealthy passengers. He'll need all of his wit and charm to get what he needs, so that he can get what he actually wants. \nThe real question is \u2013 what does Allen want?\n\nConfidence Volume One is the second release from Singularity Studios Publishing and is my first solo effort. I am using Kickstarter to fund the costs of the artwork and the printing. As of the launch of this campaign, the artwork is about a third of the way completed. I hope to have the final comic ready to print by mid-June and then on to backers sometime in August of 2021.\n\nConfidence was actually the first comic script I ever wrote back in 2016. It started out as a ten page short that I had my buddy David Wilson draw so that we could submit it to an anthology. Though it didn't get selected for the anthology, it stayed on my mind for awhile after that. I always intended to go back and try to turn it into something longer or ongoing, but life and such got in the way. Once the Pandemic forced us into isolation last year, I had time to flesh out some of my ideas. I worked on Confidence Volume One on and off for about three months before I really found the voice I was looking for so I could tell the story the way I wanted to.  I love the characters I have created and I can't wait to expand their world in future volumes. I had so much fun creating this comic and I want to share that joy with every reader that I possibly can. \n\nConfidence represents a wonderful collaboration of talent from all over the world and all of us are excited for you to see what we have created.\n\n\n  Page 1\n Page 2 \n Page 3\n Page 4\n\n\n\nTodd Zverloff \nWriter/Creator\nTodd is a writer born and bred in Akron, Ohio.

I'm Ken and I run Nix Comics in Columbus, Ohio.  I could use your help bringing some of the art and writing I completed in 2020  to print in 2021.\nLike a lot of people, I had a strange, uncomfortable 2020.  I felt stuck in a strange limbo where I was constantly working, writing, drawing, and creating BUT not publishing.  Last year I managed to put out a few copies a zine titled \"What Have I Done For You Lately?\" shortly before the pandemic forced isolation.  I've done so much since and I hope that you'll help me self-publish the work with this Kickstarter.\n\nHere's what I'd like your help publishing in 2021:\nOut of Time Zines: Two follow ups to the \"Lately\" zine where I embrace the suspended quality of time instead of fight against it.   Originally, I was going to make just one issue, but I found I had too much good stuff for a single floppy zine... So I've divided the work into two separate zines: Out of Time #1 (storybook) and Out of Time #1 (sketchbook).\n Out of Time #1 (Storybook) is a collection of my fantasy writing through the 2020 isolation, including:\n3 Fantasy Short stories\n3 chapters of my illustrated novel WIP \"On Tour With Roy Lee Hood\"\nFour preview pages of my comic memoir about my first brick & mortar comic store \"Rudy Goose\"\na reflection on my obsession with creating a punk rock music and comic arts festival named RATCAF\nplans for my next big anthology which I hope will include an LP record titled \"The Vicar: Live at the New Rose.\"\n48 Pages B&W plus color cover.\n Out of Time #1: Sketchbook: A collection of drawings from 2020 from my sketchbook. Subjects range from the mundane (stuff like hamburgers, horses and bunnies) to the absurd and, of course, to fan art of musicians, horror movies and comic books.  These were all done in various styles/experimental techniques:\n\"Eyes Closed:\" Drawn quickly (length of one song) without looking at the paper.\n\"Two Handed: \" Drawn with pens in both hands, moving as simultaneously as I can.\n\"No Lift:\" Whole comic pages drawn without lifting the pen, so essentially just one line.\n56 Pages B&W plus color cover.\n ICARP 2020 Report: As readers of the SOLRAD literary magazine know, I spent a lot of time in 2020 conducting research and writing essays about the comic arts community.  I call this work my Independent Comic Arts Research Project or ICARP for short. (Sorry, no cute fishy logo. I tried and failed to come up with one I liked) The goal of this research is to provide artists, activists, advocates, academics, and other non-alliterative but otherwise concerned community members some tools for problem framing, problem solving and solution implementation for the issues facing the comic arts community.  I have compiled all of this material into a single report for 2020, which will be available as a PDF for free. Knowing a lot of people, myself included, prefer such things in printed and bound format, I am offering the material here in such a format as a Kickstarter reward.\nFREE PDF version available here: \nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1dSieACWOKQMKrcyRApcy6Bl6vdm9C09-/view?usp=sharing\nIncludes:\nA survey of vendors at the 2020 Indie Comics fair in Columbus, Ohio\nA survey of 240 Comic Artists conducted on-line\nA survey of 49 non-artist Comic Arts community members including fans, non-fans, Journalists, and other Comic Arts professionals\nA survey of 30 comic artists about their experiences vending at comic shows, conventions, and festivals\nAn overview of Comic arts nonprofit organizations as of 2018.\nA proposed method for establishing living wage page rates for Comic Artists\n120 pages B&W Paperback Book\n Abstracts In Isolation: \nFor the first few months of isolation, I began each day creating at least one 7\"x7\" abstract digital painting in photoshop. The idea was to create images reflective of not only how I was feeling but also how I wanted to feel.  I am going to create a limited number of print sets of 100 of these pieces which will include a set of grid and concentric circle transparency overlays that you can use to make flipping through the prints an interactive experience.  Just wanna look? No problem.

(I'll ask you which you want after the kickstarter has ended). For $15 you can get both!\nI.C.A.R.P.: For $25 you can get a print copy of the ICARP 2020 research and essays paperback book.  (Please note, that this material is available for free in PDF form.)\nALL THREE: For $40 you can receive all three printed zines and books.\n Sketchbook PS Plus Zines:  For $30 you can receive an original sketchbook picture Sleeve with record plus the two new Out of Time Zines.  Please Note:  This reward takes a little back and forth between you and me.  I don't have enough space to list each original piece of art as an individual reward. Please take a look at all of the sleeves I have available at this link and message me with the sleeve you want when you select the reward.  They will be available first come, first served so maybe have a back up-option or two. I will update the available list every night.\nABSTRACTS IN ISOLATION Print Set: For $60 you can receive a set of 50 prints of abstract art pieces created during the first 100 days of Covid Isolation in 2020. (Images created digitally) Prints on card stock with 5 transparencies for viewing. \nTHE WHOLE MAGILLA: For $90 you will receive all three books and zines plus the Abstracts in Isolation print set. \nTHE WHOLE MAGILLA (PLUS LEFTOVERS): New to Nix Comics? Or just have some big holes in your collection?  For $150 I will send you all of the new publications and fill out your Nix Comics Collection to the best of my ability.

She then escapes the wizard's tower by following the strange little creature into a different realm. Issue 2 then picks up with the day that follows, where Kia tries to carry on as normal. \nWe are currently approaching the \u00a33,000 Stretch Goal. If we reach \u00a33,500 then all physical backers will also receive a free comic celebrating the wonderful artwork of Marleen Lowe who we lost to cancer in 2020. We want you to enjoy seeing what a talent she was.\nBetween Issues 1 and 2 however Kia journeys through the The Inbetween. A Nexus where all realms interconnect. A place where time and space behave differently. A place where, if you're not careful, you can see glimpses of your life; past, present and future.  \nMany seek out the Nexus for power, many more avoid if for fear of what they might see. Kia, of course, is unaware of any of this.\nKia and her new friend are confronted by beings trapped in The Inbetween, and the creature has been altered by its natural habitat.\nKia Wordsmith - The Inbetween consists of a 24 page story illustrated by regular Kia Wordsmith artist Ian Ashcroft and also the original Jigsaw Girl 8 page story by Marleen Lowe, referenced in Ian's pages. \nJigsaw Girl page from Marleen Lowe\n'The Pencils of The Inbetween' is a 20 page sketchbook showing some of Ian's penciled pages from this issue.

Andy does some great cartoons and caricatures. You can find his work on Facebook.\nI love seeing our characters in the style of different artists.\nAs we are nearing the \u00a32500 Stretch Target I've commissioned an image Tom Brown, who currently has his Hopeless, Maine Kickstarter running, for the \u00a33,000 Stretch Goal.\nTom's work has an Arthur Rackham feel to it which I love. \nShould we reach \u00a33000 then all physical backers will also receive a copy of this art card.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe comic is complete, we are just looking for funding to help print it and contribute to art costs.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a32 or more", "title": "Pickpocket", "descp": "A Digital Copy of Kai Wordsmith -

ABYSSAL ALBION takes place in a GREAT BRITAIN where both cosmic and folk terrors are a commonplace and chilling truth.  \nRavaged by death and madness, the series follows the continuing journey of two siblings, SISTER and BROTHER, as they try to survive a world teeming with savage cults and sanity shattering beasts.\n If you are a fan of nightmarish post-apocalypses, doom-laden horror,  and mind bending cosmic dread, this is the series for you! Where our first issue dove head-first into the nightmare filled depths of the British woodlands, the second takes us to its now less than idyllic coastlines.\nThough it\u2019s not only overly aggressive seagulls, and the unpredictable British weather our pair will have to contend with.  In their search for Sisters estranged partner the pair face the horrifying and  grotesque -  DEEP ONES.\nHalf-man, half-fish hybrid,  worshippers of the colossal ancient deity DAGON, Deep Ones now inhabit and control the worlds coastal towns and ports.\nContinuing on from our previous 28 Page issue, we shall continue to deliver a unique look at a very weird apocalypse, stunningly drawn in B&W.  \nWith your support we are set to deliver another quality issue, delving even further into the unknown world of ABYSSAL ALBION.\nWritten by cosmic horror aficionado, screenwriter, and creative producer for the DEADBOLT Films, THOMAS J CAMPBELL (BEYOND, AND NOTHING HURT) and with artwork by accomplished artist WAYNE LOWDEN (PLAINER JANE, NOCTURNE), lettering by KEN REYNOLDS (COGNITION, HERE AND THERE) and cover colours by TRILBY BLACK.\nABYSSAL ALBION is filled with exciting and spine-chilling homages to the CTHULHU MYTHOS and hopes to continue the tradition of the originators of weird fiction, H.P Lovecraft, Ambrose Bierce, Robert W. Chambers, Charlotte Gilman Perkins, Arthur Machen, amongst others.\nDrawn in striking and suitably atmospheric Black and White by WAYNE LOWDEN, with art that perfectly captures the strange and chaotic world our protagonists now find themselves in.\nThe book itself will be printed on 120gsm uncoated paper to give the pages a slightly rough, more visceral texture, and will feature a 200gsm full colour gloss laminate cover.\n\n\nBIG COMIC PAGE\n\"Imagine if you will a story that is similar to The Walking Dead, but instead of zombies shambling across the pages, you have the creeping, insidious horrors spawned by Cthulhu and the rest of his star-spawned family. Okay, I\u2019m not saying that this is another Walking Dead, but it definitely has a similar vibe, and the same potential to be an epic saga given half a chance.\"\n3 MILLION YEARS\n\"This is a real page turner, with some excellent scenes, art, lettering and storytelling. Hopefully, there is more to come from this world \u2013 those with little knowledge of the Lovecraft mythos will enjoy this as much as those who have more.\"\nCOMIC BOOK NEWS UK \n\"Wayne Lowden  really delivers something special here. It\u2019s art that oozes with unsettling qualities, encapsulating the darkness literally and metaphorically. I like it, I like it a lot. There\u2019s a tangible menace that leaked off the pages for me. Panel after panel delivers incredible detail and emotional weight. It\u2019s a heavy sketch style of monochrome brilliance, rich in shading that just sets a wonderfully dark atmosphere.\"\nTHE CONVENTION COLLECTIVE \n\"As can be expected, a story in the horror genre deserves some parental discretion. There is cursing and some violence as well as some scary imagery that skews this title towards older readers.\"\n MIDLIFEGAMERGEEK.COM \n\"The intriguing events of the issue set us up nicely to learn more about the siblings and their surroundings as we continue to follow their struggle for survival. With the first issue having come to life with the aid of a successful crowdfunding campaign, I shall be keeping a very keen eye out for the second issue\u2019s launch on Kickstarter.\"\n Of course you'll need supplies if you're to survive in the harsh world of ABYSSAL ALBION - so by backing us here is just some of what you can get!\n25mm CTHULHU Pin Badge\n25mm ABYSSAL ALBION Pin Badge\nBookmark\nFull Colour Cover Art Print\nLogo T-Shirt (Limited!)\nOriginal Art Prints\n\n As we hit our target and issue two becomes a reality, we'll be releasing a bunch of stretch goals. \nFirst of which being a unique A4 Mythos Inspired art print commissioned specially for ABYSSAL ALBION from the fantastic Davey Jebadiah Sewell - A master of occult and gothic horror imagery, a couple examples of his beautiful work can be seen below below.\nShould we go beyond even further then we have an art  variant by Canadian horror artist and illustrator Trevor Henderson.\nKnown most famously for his unsettling \u201cSIRENHEAD\u201d creature,  as well as a myriad of other terrifyingly creepy cryptids and weird imagery. As anyone who is aware of Trevor's incredible work will attest, expect something truly uncanny and horrifying.\nKeeping with the tradition of a unique campaign video that gives a glimpse into the setting wider ABYSSAL ALBION setting via short film,  SOLITUDE was shot alone during lockdown to serve as further worldbuilding into the world of ABYSSAL ALBION. \nDirected & Written by Thomas J

In 2020, together we released dry brushes that helped new and advanced painters take their gaming miniatures to the next level! The combined 4,644 BACKERS most frequently asked question is \"Do you make smaller sizes?\" Well, NOW I DO. If you're ready to join the army of painters, hobbyists, gamers, crafters, terrain builders and artists you found the campaign you were looking for.\nGhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Paint Brush Set is the answer to the question \"will you make a size #000?\" Instead of a single new brush added to the mega popular Ghost Brush line I wanted to create a set that will be your go to when you need to conquer the smallest of details packed into the wonderful miniatures and models we paint today! You probably already know the feeling of using wonderful new paint brushes but I invite you to join the #GhostBrush community and crush your hobby painting goals!\n \"Art is never finished, only abandoned.\"  Leonardo da Vinci\n\nMy name is Jeff Beyer. We met the last two years when 4,644 Backers gave me their trust and support in helping bring the Ghost Miniature Paintbrushes to life! With online sales, retail shops, and the last two Kickstarter campaigns, thousands of people are painting with these brushes! You can find me on Youtube under the name RedBeardBoss and on Instagram @Sleepwalkair_brush and I love painting. These past years we showed the bigger companies we wanted quality miniature painting supplies at a fair price. I'm not interested in charging you to cover the bill so I can hire big name studio painters in an attempt to convince you these brushes will bring you 1st place golden trophies. I could send every hobby channel on Youtube a free set and pay them to tell you how great these are but I'm not going to do that either. All you have to do is read the comments from the last TWO campaigns and feel proud knowing you are helping build a community of painters and hobbyists who simply love putting paint on little plastic figures.\nPrecision\nWith your support, we will help thousands of new artists fall in love with miniature painting.\nThank you for taking the time to check out my Kickstarter and happy painting!\nI would like to introduce you to the GhosTiny Ultra Fine Detail Miniature Paint Brush Set.\n\nThis new set of 9 ultra fine detail brushes includes 7 rounds, a flat, and a chisel shaped brush. These not only cover you for the smallest of miniature details but imagine the confidence in being able to choose the perfect shape and size for the task! This set is made with the same beloved white nylon hair of the other Ghost Paint Brushes. The birch wood handles of the new GhosTiny range are thicker and more comfortable to hold when you're focused on getting those tiny highlights in those hard to reach spaces.\nAccuracy\nUltra Fine Point\nDon't forget the original Ghost Brush Set\nOriginal 8 round Ghost Brushes and 2 Ghost Dry Brushes\nIf you need a set or two of the original Ghost Brushes I have included pledges just for you! I set out to design the Ghost Brush specifically to help people paint miniatures and people love them! The wide range of sizes were chosen to give you the flexibility to paint the tiniest buckle on your favorite character\u2019s shoe to the massive wings of a terrifying dragon! The white nylon hair holds a nice point compared to most synthetic brushes and is soft enough to achieve smooth blends. Finally, the birch wood handle gives you the feel of being an artist right in your hand. I want you to improve as a painter by having access to quality brushes that get the job done and don't break the bank!\nLet's Make The GHOST Dry Brush Size #0D!\n\nThe new Ghost Dry Brush #0D has already been designed, tested, and I can include once we reach $50,000. This goal may sound high but the last campaign was over triple this amount! This brush is small but packs quite a punch! It has has a thinner handle than the #1D and #2D in this range and is exactly what you asked for. A smaller Ghost Dry Brush! When the stretch goal of $50,000 is obliterated all eligible pledges will have this brush included!!!! The only 2 pledges not eligible will be the Classic Pledges.\n#2D, #1D, #0D\nSome minis are worth spilling paint for! But we won't be spilling any today!\nDesigner @polymorph_miniatures used his ungodly skill to help bring my concept for this amazing new add-on to life! The Necro Paint Pot Holder is the most entrancing way to hold your washes and paints during use to prevent accidentally spilling them. This diabolic creation is resin and will look truly wicked on your paint table. This is a perfect project for your new Ghost Dry Brushes and I can't wait to see how you all paint them to display in your hobby area\nNecro Paint Pot Holder\nFun to paint!\nDo you own a game store?\n\nDo you own a commission paint studio?\n\nDo you need a ton of paintbrushes?\nRetailer Display Rack\nThe retail pledge is for you! You will receive 5 GhosTiny Sets and a 100 Ghost Brushes and a display rack to entice customers! The display rack has 96 holes and I will include some signs with the rack! This pledge is also open for everyone who needs a lot of paintbrushes! If you own a retail store and your customers love these brushes I will be able to fulfill orders right away to keep your display rack full! Don't forget the retail pledges also receive stretch goals earned during the campaign!\nCare for your Ghost Brush\nThe Ghost white nylon hair not only looks great but will help you create better painting habits. Always remember to load the brush with paint only about half way to avoid getting paint in your ferrule. Getting paint inside the ferrule is the fastest way to ruin your brush.\n\nClean your brushes frequently with water and use brush soap after painting to make sure no paint residue is left inside the bristles. The white nylon hair will change color from use but it is good practice when cleaning your brushes to try and get them as clean as possible.\nAll paint brushes are designed to pull paint and this one is no different; however, as miniature painters, we tend to use a stabbing motion with our brushes to push paint into small details. This push motion causes the tip of your synthetic brushes to curl over time. To reduce this, use a pulling motion with your brushes as much as possible and if you absolutely need to push paint into a small area, make sure you use very gentle pressure.\nNEVER leave your Ghost Brush or any paintbrush sitting submerged in water! This will not only destroy your wonderful sharp tip, it will cause the wood handle to swell and ruin your whole brush. Seriously, stop dropping your brushes hair-down inside a water cup. Instead, swish the brush back and forth in the water to remove paint, then wipe on a towel to make sure no paint is left within the bristles.\nThese tips will help your new favorite paintbrush enjoy a longer life.\nGhost Brush Family Photo\nGhost Brush Classic Pledge\nIf you missed out on the first two campaigns these pledges are for YOU. These pledges are for the painter who wants the original sets of Ghost brushes but doesn't want the new GhosTiny set.

They're a PIRATE! And recently, Jamie and their two friends, Thomas and Daniel, have...found, an unfinished map. What can they do with this map?\n(An image of Jamie Roberts enthusiastically saying, \"Go treasure hunting, of course!\")\nAnd so begins the winding, magical, epic adventure that is The Legend of Jamie Roberts.\n\nWith your help, we want to get the first 4 chapters of this legend into one beautiful, shiny book. (Some say \"graphic novels,\" some say \"trade paperback.\" I say, \"beautiful, shiny book.\")\n\nBut who's \"we?\"\nOk, it's the royal \"we,\" because it's me - Kelci Crawford, maker of fine comics for nearly 8 years. And I've run KickStarter campaigns nearly every year since I started, so I know what I'm doing.\n\nThe Legend of Jamie Roberts is under my small-press company, Fantasyville Productions, LLC. Sounds like a fancy title, like Captain O'Malley. But sadly, I am a one-person operation on a tight budget, which is why I'm on KickStarter to begin with.\n(image of Thomas, Jamie's friend, asking \"So Why is The Legend of Jamie Roberts so special?\")\nThis is the story I needed when I was a teenager - confused about my gender identity, wanting to sail the seas and go adventuring away from my positively crap-tastic circumstances. I'm making this story for all those out there like teenage-me, sailing the chaotic seas of their own identity, wanting something new and exciting and adventurous!\n\nThis story doesn\u2019t JUST feature pirates - there\u2019s magic! Spirits! And Dragons!\n\nBut this is online for me to read, isn\u2019t it?\nYes, the first 4 chapters are available to read online.\n\nSo why should I back you?\nBecause...\na) the book has some redrawn artwork that\u2019s not in the free version. \nb) the book will have bonus content the website does not have - things like extra comics, Q&As with the characters, a behind-the-scenes look at how comic pages are made from script to colors, and much more!\nc) this KickStarter will have campaign-exclusive rewards as stretch goals are unlocked!\nThe rewards available are all listed beside this pitch, so scroll through and see what fits your style (and budget).\n\nSome campaign-exclusive rewards include\u2026\nYour VERY OWN orb to stash and protect. Make sure this NEVER breaks, or Ranki will escape!\nA map of the land of Corith, complete with notes added by Jamie, Thomas, and Daniel.\nA custom-signed copy of each book you order.\nAlso, for another first, there\u2019s a pledge level where you can order copies of this book for your local library! Libraries have helped us all this past year, and being a former librarian myself, I want to pay that love forward. People deserve books, even if they never knew this KickStarter existed.\nHere's a chart with the breakdown for the costs of the campaign:\n(A chart showing 40% of costs of the campaign going to printing, 16% of costs going to KickStarter fees, 23% going to ISBN and barcode for the book, 5% for shipping the books to the creator, and 15% shipping to backers)\nIf you still have questions, check out the Risks and Challenges section below. Hopefully there your concerns will be addressed. But if you still have questions for me, just send me a message.\n\nCan you back this campaign? GREAT! Please do, and share this campaign far and wide!

Where\u2019s the rewards for THAT campaign?!\"\n\nYes, I\u2019m still involved with NeverEnding. And yes, we\u2019re still fulfilling rewards for that campaign. But that\u2019s separate from THIS campaign, which is being run under my own company, Fantasyville Productions, LLC. NeverEnding is a separate company, who has a team of artists whom I\u2019m leading to fulfill rewards. Those rewards will get fulfilled as quickly as possible.\n\nWith that said, I feel that the rewards for this campaign are distinct enough from NeverEnding\u2019s offerings. I\u2019m comfortable asking you to get The Legend of Jamie Roberts, volume 1 to print because of that.\n\nAlso, since this specific campaign is narrower in scope, the rewards can get fulfilled faster. As I\u2019ve mentioned above, I\u2019ve run successful campaigns for the last 8 years on this platform, and all of those previous projects have been fulfilled.\n\n\n\n\"There\u2019s an option to back this campaign and donate copies of this book to my local library. How are you going to make that happen?\"\n\nI\u2019ll admit - this is the first time I\u2019ve made this an option in a campaign. That said, the information I\u2019ll need from you (if you choose this reward option) is the name, address, and/or website of your library. If you have the contact information of the folks who work at your library, that would be even better. If you know who\u2019s in charge of acquiring new books at your library, that\u2019s *chef\u2019s kiss*.\n\nSo why am I charging for copies donated to the library? Because printing is expensive. All I\u2019m asking at this reward level is to offset the cost of printing and shipping these books.\n\n\n\n\u201cOk but WHY is the reward donating two copies of a book? Can\u2019t I just give one?\u201d\n\nSpeaking as a former librarian, libraries would REALLY rather have duplicates, because books can get lost, damaged, stolen, or otherwise unreturned. If a library only has one copy of a book? That sucks. But multiple copies? Yes, please.\n\n\n\n\"But Covid-19 is affecting the post office and the delivery of packages in general. \"\n\nI know. And to make it even worse, the post office situation in Toledo (where I\u2019m now based) is even wonkier.

She has clients to see and tedious paperwork to never be caught up on. She also has a special talent and advanced training in removing and preventing demonic possessions in children. That's also during the day.\nIt's at the same job. Connie Dhar is burnt out and not just because she works in social services. The heat at her day job is only getting worse as incidents become more intense and her personal life goes to hell.\n\nThe world has seen a rise in spiritual possessions over the last few decades. In response, the American government has outlawed any possession of minors and created state and federal programs to combat this threat to our safety. C.P.S. (Child Possession Services) is one such program. Constance Dhar is one such disgruntled employee. Connie works for the state division assigned to help bedeviled children remove unwanted spirits and recover. Connie has worked for C.P.S. long enough to have forgotten that she was once a rising star of the agency. Now, she is just going through the motions, between nights at the bar. When a series of truly strange possessions begin popping up, Connie will have to decide if she cares about anything other than the bottom of a bottle and her betta fish. \nConnie at work.\nTHE BOOK\nC.P.S. was co-created by ten-year collaborators- Bobgar Ornelas and Jon Westhoff. Originally part of a series of shorts (published as \"Mendicant\" and a FCBD anthology with King Bone Press), Bob and Jon are teaming up to bring Connie's first full length story to print. The book will combine the 2 short \"origin\" stories and a brand-new 26 page tale, with a pin-up by the amazing Bryan Boles, for a 44 page fully colored monstrously over-sized book. This will be the first book from the new publishing company Part-time Comix. This is a one-shot comic, and while there may be lingering questions that we hope will intrigue our readers, this is a complete story. \nIntended for mature audiences: profanity, alcohol usage, adult situations, child endangerment.\nOriginally created as a one-off story for Bob's series MENDICANT, Connie and all her flaws took a special place in their creators hearts. After another short for FCBD, they set to fleshing out more of her story in her first full sized issue. It has taken some time, but Connie is ready to punch back in and probably punch her boss, if her co-worker can't hold her back. CPS provides a slice of life look at the bureaucratic BS that would happen if American society had an outbreak of demonic possession. Our two short stories provide an intro into Connie and her crew. Our first full length story will go more in-depth into a day in the hellish life of what a social worker for possessed kids. \nKids amIright??\nTHE TEAM\nBobgar Ornelas- Co-creator, writer, colors(\"origin\" stories), cover and internal art, Bob is the driving force behind this giant book.

But with so many competing media options available today, fans and creators alike can be separated by platforms, sometimes missing out on great stories. It\u2019s unusual for horror literature and horror comics to overlap, or for either to merge with the horror of the fine arts. Enter - CORRIDOR\nCORRIDOR magazine hopes to unite these voices by bringing together creators from all the realms of horror print media. Imagine what it would have been like if Ray Bradbury, Junji Ito, and HR Giger had the opportunity to work together within the same pages! \n\nThe first Oversized 10\" x 13\" 96-page issue of CORRIDOR will bring together the worlds of short fiction, comics, and fine art. Its stories will blend horror with science-fiction and fantasy, focusing on weird, wondrous curiosities. These horrors will express an uncertainty about reality, invoking a radical strangeness and providing psychological mysteries that dissect our collective fears and anxieties.\n\nManaged by Christian Sager & Dave Moore, Corridor's first issue will feature work from:\nCorinna Bechko \u2022 Nadia Bulkin \u2022 Brandon Daniels \u2022 Kristi DeMeester \u2022 J.M.

Our goal is to tell high-quality stories and we hope this creator-centric approach will encourage the best from our diverse group of collaborators.\n\nWe recognize these are ambitious goals. That\u2019s why we need your help. Below is a clear breakdown of how your support will finance this magazine. Depending on its level of success, we envision making CORRIDOR available multiple times per year, perhaps even branching out into multimedia storytelling.\nPledge today to get your copy of CORRIDOR magazine\u2019s first issue! By bringing together creators from different worlds of storytelling, you\u2019ll get high-quality, weird tales that blend horror with science-fiction and fantasy. Best of all, this will directly support these creators by paying them fairly and allowing them to retain ownership of their hard work.\nCONTRIBUTORS \nA fossil preparator by day and writer by night, Corinna Bechko is a Hugo- and Eisner-nominated New York Times best-selling author who left her heart in the Triassic.\nNadia Bulkin writes stories, thirteen of which appear in her debut collection, She Said Destroy (Word Horde, 2017).

A place where people of color, women, LBTQIA+, and everyone can know that they have a family, a place to hang out, socialize, feel safe, and enjoy good beer.\nWhile there are over 8,000 breweries in the US, there is little representation of people of color. Black brewery owners account for just 1% percent of brewery ownership, according to Bart Watson, chief economist of the Brewers Association. \nHistorically, craft beer has been a largely male-dominated industry. However, the number of women working in the field is steadily growing: today, about 29% of brewery employees are female, and about 21% of breweries have at least one woman in a leadership role.\nUrban Jungle represents both. There is a brilliance and beauty that comes out of conversation and partnerships and now is the time to begin truly talking and working towards diversity and inclusion. We are hoping that in this moment of crisis, where there's a generation that is pushing aggressively for change, we can be part of the change within this industry and that we own that change collectively. \nNot only do we want to welcome any person from any background, but we want to support their businesses by partnering with them for collaborations and ingredient sourcing. \nThis isn\u2019t just about business, it\u2019s about building community.  \nLeft to Right: James from Forager Brewing, Brandon from Black Beer Travelers, Isla Street Brewing, Will from Equilibrium Brewing, Shannon Harris\nFresh Fest : America's First Black Craft Beer Festival\nWhere\nWe plan on opening a farm-inspired brewery within a 45-minute drive from Downtown Austin or the Austin Airport, which makes this area an ideal location for a destination brewery. \nCan't quite picture what we are going for?

Silicon Valley meets The Day After. \nFrom a creative team of California ex-pats comes a biting satire of the tech industry and the cultural decimation it leaves in its wake.\nJason McNamara ( co-creator / writer) is the graphic novel author of Nocturnal Commissions, The Cicada, SUCKER, The Rattler, The Crossing, Abandon, From Mars with Love, The Martian Confederacy, Short Hand, Continuity, First Moon and Less Than Hero. After being squeezed out of San Francisco he landed in Portland, Oregon where he teaches comic book scriptwriting at Pacific Northwest College of the Arts.   \nAnke Gladnick (co-creator / illustrator) Anke Gladnick is an illustrator and comics artist who grew up in California and somehow found their way to Portland, Oregon. Through a mix of collaged analog and digital elements, Anke\u2019s work is both visually and conceptually layered with a focus on the surreal and is inspired by dreams, nostalgia and a sense of poignancy. Their client list includes the likes of NBC, Washington Post, NPR and The Intercept. Anke is also part of the successfully Kickstarted comics anthology \u201cNo Refunds\u201d, featuring rising talents in sequential art from the Pacific Northwest. \nThe goal of this campaign is to fund the creation of an original 96-page graphic novel and to ship it to backers.  We are going to produce and release the work as four digital issues over the next year and then collect the entire story in a printed graphic novel and ship it to backers. This is an ambitious undertaking for us and will require a year of work. \nPreviously I have Kickstarted The Rattler, Sucker V1, The Cicada, Sucker V2, and Nocturnal Commissions. I am confident that I can manage this project and create a successful experience for all of our backers. Until the last copy ships, I work for you. \nHow many great books will never get made because we destroyed our ability to concentrate through device addiction and the instant gratification of the Internet? How many artists will never make their great works because they are priced out of their communities and homes? Why are we allowing a culture where our metric of value, our own human worth, is based solely on dollars and power?\nWe explore these themes through Sven and Johanna, a pair of sheltered teens who arrive in the city and immediately find themselves caught between warring ideologies. As they navigate the sensitive politics of the apocalypse, their worlds are broken open; their perceptions of identity, community, and purpose must either evolve or shatter.

Good Girls Don\u2019t Make History is a graphic novel that amplifies the voices of female legends from 1840 to the present day. Reliving moments from the lives of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Alice Paul, Ida B. Wells, and Susan B. Anthony, we boldly tell the inspiring stories from one of the most formative eras in women\u2019s history\u2014the fight for the vote in the United States. Our tale begins at a modern-day polling station in California with a mother and daughter voting together, then flashes back 180 years to the World Anti-Slavery Convention where the women's movement got its legendary start. The twists and turns take readers across the country and through time illuminating parallels between epic battles for liberty in the past and eerily similar struggles for justice today.  \nDesigned for a young adult audience, but meaningful for all ages and genders, Good Girls Don't Make History, is a story about strength, resilience, and persistence. Women's rights advocates, history buffs, and anyone passionate about making a difference in the future of America will love this book. Building on the achievements of the fight for women's vote can help us create a better reality for generations to come. Future books in this series will cover sagas of African American, Native American, and Asian American women fighting for their freedom. \nOur books are printed at the highest quality, with thick glossy paper and a thicker matte cover stock. It's important to us that the graphic novel feels good and will last 100 years. If we hit our stretch goal of $11,000, we will print with hardcover.\nNEW STRETCH GOAL:  $12,500.  For every additional $1,500 we raise over $11,000, a double-page spread will be added to the book.  These homages will be modern-day reinterpretations of classic works from the suffrage-era.\nAdditional modern interpretations of historical masterpieces\nElizabeth Kiehner leads digital transformation at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Elizabeth is a popular thought leader on the topics of artificial intelligence and creativity and she is a TED speaker. As a former business owner and executive at IBM, Kiehner is taking a stand to promote and advocate for gender equity. Her 10-year-old daughter Agnes is growing up with a confidence and fearlessness mother did not have. Elizabeth is writing this book to harness some critical lessons  from the past and embolden women\u2019s action, engagement, and involvement across the public and private sectors. Her mission is to inspire others to set audacious personal goals, and continue the fight for gender parity in all spheres of life.

With his creative partner Elizabeth Kiehner, Keith produced \"The Legends of Science\" cards, highlighting the people and achievements of many of the world's greatest scientists. Moved by both the hundred-year anniversary of women\u2019s right to vote and the disturbing events following the 2016 election, Keith has focused his energy on researching and producing a graphic novel celebrating the exciting story of women\u2019s fight for the vote in America. \u201cWe just thought it could be told in a dynamic way because it\u2019s a riveting story, not an austere one,\u201d Keith says.\nKara Coyle is Creative Director at advertising agency Mekanism.

Click here!\nCODE 45 is 100 percent funded - thank you! \nCheck out our amazing stretch goals! \nCode 45 is a 5-issue graphic novel about Vanessa, a subway driver in Montreal who hears rumors that there are 'dragons' in the tunnels, monstrous apparitions that seemingly defy any explanation.\nHer co-workers are terrified of working nights because of what they've seen, and so a large number of them self-medicate to get through their shifts without giving in to fear and anxiety. Gradually, it's become impossible for them to tell what's real, and what's a hallucination brought on by their drug use.\nVanessa is transferred to the night shift and falls slowly into both this world and, thanks to her DJ roommate, the underground rave scene (a source of drugs and mayhem). She starts to witness things she can't explain, and is forced to confront a shocking secret from her past that will make her question everything she though she knew about her family, her job, and the nature of reality.\nIssue #1 was funded in just 16 hours in March of 2020. Issue #2 and Issue #3 pick up the story with a 52 page mega-issue that takes us deeper into the darkness that Vanessa has discovered lurking inside Montreal's metro tunnels.  \nIn Issues #2-3, Vanessa starts her night shift duties and encounters a world quickly spinning out of her comprehension, forcing her to turn to a long-distant source of support as she begins to unravel the threads of the mystery confronting her. How much longer can she deny what's right before her eyes? - especially as the disappearances begin to multiply and even her own friends aren't safe from the forces stalking the tunnels.\n Both Issue #1 and the 52-page #2-#3 mega-issue are available via this campaign. \nOf course you will! But more specifically, if any of these things float your boat, you're going to love it:\n Stories that feature strong female protagonists, dragons, the subjectivity of reality, the underground rave scene, the paranormal, trance, the thin border that separates our world from fantasy, hardcore, a frank discussion of mental health, electronic dance music, and hallucinatory drugs.\n Movies and TV like A Scanner Darkly, Pan's Labyrinth, Jacob's Ladder, The X-Files, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Last Year at Marienbad.\n Writers including Terry Moore, Philip K. Dick, Dan Simmons, Richard K. Morgan, Douglas Coupland.\n Comics like Motor Girl, Wayward, Saucer Country.\n\"As soon as I read \u201cThere are dragons in the tunnels,\u201d and saw the art that accompanied those words I was all in on CODE 45. The story and art kept getting better and better as I read through the amazing first issue. I highly recommend this comic and I personally can\u2019t wait to see what happens next!\"\n- James Haick, President, Scout Comics & Entertainment, Inc.\n\"The art is really fantastic -- it has great layouts and flow, the characters are appealingly rendered, the backgrounds are wonderfully detailed, and it's all gorgeously coloured, with a powerful use of lighting. You really get a sense of space and presence, feeling like you're right there, in the scenes!\"\n- Wolfen Moondaughter, Sequential Tart.\n \"Joe Ng's artwork is well complimented by colorist, Josh Perez's, vibrant palette, especially in the second half of the issue...If you like to have a dose of reality to go with your fantasy, this a book to pick up and read.\"\n - Sequential Magazine\nCreatively, there were many things we wanted to explore in the Code 45 universe. Writer Benjamin Hunting spent a lot of time in the underground Montreal rave scene in the early 2000s, and he had never seen it depicted before in a graphic novel - or, well, anywhere.\n\"Montreal is perhaps North America\u2019s most ignored metropolis when it comes to media representation. I wanted to showcase the city that I love from the perspective I had when I first moved here in the late 1990s. I spent a lot of my early years here exploring the city from within the metro tunnels,\" says Benjamin.\n\"Montreal\u2019s metro is unique in that each station was individually designed by a Canadian architect at the end of the 1960s, which means no two are alike.  The metro is also notable for having a number of stations that were dug out and never put into service, which made them the perfect setting for a number of the subterranean activities that take place in Code 45 \u2013 including the underground music scene, which figures prominently in both the book and my own life.\"\nHe combined that with the desire to talk about very real mental health issues facing people living not just in Montreal but around the globe.\n\"Using fantasy as a bridge to being able to discuss not just the questions of subjective reality and how we perceive the world around us, but also to broach the topics of depression and mental illness, and how that impacts both individuals and society, is something very personal to me,\" continues Benjamin.\nThe ability to link these concepts together within the framework of a shared hallucinatory world where the perception of reality is not necessarily universal was something that drew in artist Joe Ng. Sinking that deep below Montreal's streets and exploring the city's subterranean metro tunnels  provided a seldom-seen perspective from which to explore Code 45's characters and concepts. Together with Angela Hodge (designer) and Josh Perez (colorist), the team was able to weave a story that peels back the silence and cranks up the bass to the point where the narrative is shaking the ground like an out-of-control train. \nCode 45 Issue #1 has already been printed and shipped to our first round of Kickstarter supporters from our initial campaign. We have additional copies ready to go as part of our current set of rewards for anyone joining us for the first time.\nThe funding from this campaign will be used to pay for the art, coloring, and lettering as we continue the series. It will also cover the printing and shipping costs of the 52-page Code 45 #2-3 mega-issue. Overall, we intend to continue using Kickstarter to fund the art costs for the remaining  issues of Code 45 prior to its retail release by Scout Comics in 2021. \nArtist - Joe Ng. His first comics job was drawing Transformers for the Toronto-based company Dreamwave Productions. After that he was picked up by Udon Entertainment to work on a Transformers / G.I. Joe crossover book published by Devil's Due Publishing. He is best known for his work on the Udon Street Fighter comics but has also worked on many other video game properties such as Soul Caliber, Dark Stalkers, Nintendo's ARMS, and Overwatch.\nWriter - Benjamin Hunting. A full-time freelancer who over the last decade has been published in the New York Daily News, Motor Trend, Super Street, Toronto Star, and National Post, as well as numerous other magazines and online publications. He has also self-published a literary novel. This is his first graphic novel.\nGraphic Design / Lettering - Angela Hodge. Started her career as a children\u2019s book illustrator for Cornucopia Books before her foray into graphic design. After a period of paying her dues as a lowly layout artist, she stumbled into 3D modeling and now enjoys a challenging career as a physical product designer.\nColorist - Josh Perez. Born in Germany, raised in Texas, and  resides in the incredibly humid world(it's its own world, promise) of  Florida. As an artist and colorist he's been with  the comic industry since 2003 and has worked with a lot of the  franchises he's grown up with as a kid. Not only done work for  comics (IDW, Dreamwave, Fun Publications), but cartoons, toys, and the odd video game or two, as well. He is mostly known for his work on with the Transformers, Street Fighter, and Mega Man licenses.\nOur team has worked with a wide range of publishers\n The Comics\nIssue 1 is a 28-page, full-color gateway to the world of Code 45, complete with concept art and a page listing the names of each of our supporters who chose a tier that included 'Thanks' inside the book itself.\nThe #2-3 mega-issue is a 52-page, full-color Kickstarter-exclusive edition that will never be offered at retail or by any other publisher.\nThe B+W Edition\nCode 45's original black and white edition was so beautifully inked by artist Joe Ng that we decided to make it available as a limited-edition digital copy for fans of highly atmospheric line-work.\n The Enamel Pin \nNot guaranteed to protect you against dragons, but definitely works to identify you as a lover of the underground. We have a limited number of these still available on certain rewards tiers.\nThe Stickers\nFor those who love to stickerbomb, these fantastic Joe Ng dragon heads make the perfect hand-grenade for laptops, public transit stops, or DJ decks.\nThe Postcard Set\nAvailable in our catch-up rewards tiers that collect Issues #1-3 together is the set of four exclusive postcard-sized prints selected from the pages, panels, and concept art of Code 45 that were sent out with each copy of Issue 1 in our original Kickstarter campaign.\nA Trio Of 8.5\"x11\" Prints\nGet a larger look at the visual world of Code 45 with a color print from artist Joe Ng. We're offering a choice of either the cover of Issue 1, the cover of Issue 2, or the original promo print. We will contact you to verify which one you want after the campaign has ended.\nBecome A Character\nHave you ever wanted to see your face in a comic book? If that's the case, then we've added a reward that's perfect for you! Artist Joe Ng will add you as a background character in an upcoming issue of Code 45. This is your chance to view yourself in your finest early-2000s finery, or discover what you looked like as a raver, or maybe put on a virtual - and vintage - STCUM uniform.\nThe Dragon Head Sketch \nGet closer to the dragons of Code 45 than you would ever be able to in the metro tunnels with a gorgeous 6\"x8\" sketch from Joe Ng.\nIssue 2 has already been completed, with the art for Issue 3 currently in progress. We plan on transmitting the completed mega-issue to the printer by mid-September at the latest, at the same time as we send out the digital versions of the book.  Artist Joe Ng will also finish the dragon heads from the reward tiers at this time. \nWe expect a 2-week turnaround at the printer which is located in Canada. Since we can pick up locally, we won't have any shipping delays to deal with. We're giving ourselves two weeks from picking up each book to sign and ship out each of the rewards, which translates into a mid-October delivery. We most likely will need only half that time, but we'd rather underpromise and over-deliver to make sure everyone gets their rewards on-time. \n(Wait, what are stretch goals?)\nStretch goals are our way to say 'thank you' to everyone who supported us by adding extra rewards at no extra cost. Once we've reached our initial funding goal, the more our supporters share and talk about Code 45, and the more orders we receive for the book, the more we can offer to those who have already pledged for a print version of the issue at any tier.\nStretch Goal #1 @ CA $14,000 - Page-By-Page Audio Commentary from Benjamin (writer) and Joe (artist)\nAs a thank you for getting us to $14,000, we are offering everyone who purchased either a print or digital copy of any issue an audio commentary track that will take you page-by-page through the book as Benjamin and Joe describe their creative choices, inspiration, and details that make up that slice of the Code 45 world. It will be available via an easy download link that will be sent to you at the conclusion of the campaign.\nStretch Goal #2 @ CA $15,000 - Exclusive Happy Hardcore DJ Mix Soundtrack from Kasper Klez + Paper Toy!  \nIf our overall total surpasses the $15,000 mark, everyone who purchased either a print or digital copy of any issue will receive a download link to an exclusive DJ mix from Kasper Klez, brought out of retirement from the early 2000s rave scene to bring you a dose of the happy hardcore energy from era depicted in Code 45. You also get a download link to one of designer Angela Hodge's competely-custom paper toys! \nStretch Goal #3 @ CA $16,000 - Exclusive Dark Hardcore DJ Mix Soundtrack from Kasper Klez + 2nd Paper Toy\nIf our overall total surpasses the $16,000 mark, everyone who purchased either a print or digital copy of any issue will receive a download link to a SECOND exclusive DJ mix from Kasper Klez. This time it's a trip to the darker side of hardcore to serve as a soundtrack to Code 45's most dangerous moments. You also get a download link to a second competely-custom paper toy from designer Angela Hodge.\n Stretch Goal #4 @ CA $18,000 - One-Of-A-Kind STCUM Metro Map Print - Here Be Dragons! \n(Work-in-progress - we don't want to spoil the surprise!)\nIf our overall total surpasses the $18,000 mark, everyone who purchased a print copy of any issue will receive an 8.5x11 print of the early-2000s STCUM Metro map, complete with 'here be dragons' warnings for the unsuspecting traveling (in the form of Joe Ng's amazing dragon head sketch art).\n Stretch Goal #5 @ CA $22,000 - Limited Edition Code 45 Character Trading Cards\nIf our overall total surpasses the $22,000 mark, everyone who purchased a print copy of any issue will receive a set of four limited edition Code 45 character trading cards! These cards will depict four specially-chosen characters, and include stats and info on their origins not found anywhere else in the Code 45 universe.\nWe know it's important to you that you receive each of your rewards in the best possible condition. It's important to us too - which is why in addition to using Gemini flash mailers and ultra-stiff 9x12 reinforced mailers for our backed and bagged comic books, we're also sending a Shipping Dragon along to protect your package en route.\nThese Shipping Dragons are hatched from deep in Montreal's metro tunnels, and have sworn an oath to not let any harm come to your rewards while they are in transit. They are easy and fun to assemble, and they make excellent pets.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have already shipped Code 45 Issue 1 on time to all of our supporters from our first campaign. This campaign is intended to fund the art costs associated with completing the 5-issue series, as well as pay for the printing and shipping costs of the Issue 2-3 mega-issue.\n\nMembers of our creative team happen to live in the vicinity of our printer, which is located in Canada, which means we can go pick up our issues immediately after they are printed - with no worries about shipping delays. All of our other printed rewards are sourced locally, and pins are already here at Code 45 HQ waiting to find a new home.\n\nOur team has a history of delivering on-time art, writing, and design to publishers like IDW, Udon, Fun Publications, TakaraTomy, Dreamwave, Devil's Due Publishing, the New York Daily News, Motor Trend, Automobile Magazine, and Super Street.

The books cover topics like:\nEvaluating your ideas and choosing one\nCrafting a mission and vision that are true to your values\nMaking a budget even if that word terrifies you\nGetting the word out about your project\nDeciding how much to charge for your time or products\nNavigating bureaucracy and contracts\nMaintaining healthy work habits and work/life balance\nTaking the leap to doing your project full-time\nKnowing when to sell, close, or transform your project\nDaunting? Maybe. But with help and support, you can achieve all of this and so much more. And that's what these books are here for. \nReady to get going?\nAbout the books\nThis project brings into the world two books to help you birth your creative business! You can use them together or each on their own, depending on your style and preference: \nQuit Your Day Job\nQuit Your Day Job delivers clear practical tools, interviews with successful entrepreneurs, and just the right amount of real talk for anyone who has a creative passion and is thinking about trying to turn it into their full-time work and draws on years of professional experience helping artists and makers launch and grow their values-driven businesses. \nQYDJ is the second edition of author Eleanor Whitney's first book with the somewhat vague title of Grow. We're stoked to have the opportunity to give her work a title and cover which can help its evergreen contents reach even more creative folks who want to make their mark. (Stay tuned for a backers-only update about this process.)\nWhat you'll find inside Quit Your Day Job\n\nQuit Your Day Job Workbook\nThe Quit Your Day Job Workbook is packed with interactive exercises, worksheets, and templates developed by Eleanor to give you all the tools you need to develop your business idea, figure out the nuts and bolts, and handle all the planning, pricing, marketing, publicity, financial, paperwork, collaboration, fundraising, and whatever else you need to make your creative business dream a reality. \nThe workbook is even longer than the original book and contains 100% new material, published for the first time this fall.\nAn exercise from Chapter One of the workbook\nAbout the rewards\nThe paperbacks: Both Quit Your Day Job and Quit Your Day Job Workbook are paperback books. You can back this project for either one of them, or for both of them, and we'll mail them to you as soon as we get them back from the printer. \nIf you want to add extra books or workbooks to your reward, and you live in the US, add the cover price for each additional one you want and drop us a line letting us know. If you're outside the US, please ask us for a shipping quote before you increase your pledge.\nThe ebooks: Want an ebook? We've got ya. You can get either the book or workbook on their own for just $10. Want more copies, both of them, or want to add an eBook to a different pledge? Try the brand-new add-ons feature on your web browser to add whichever book you'd like.

Whitney is a feminist writer, musician, and editor living in Brooklyn. She has built community and content strategy for startups and arts organizations including Axiom, Managed by Q, Dev Bootcamp, Shapeways, the New York Foundation for the Arts, and the Brooklyn Museum. Her first book, Grow (Quit Your Day Job is the second edition) is a practical field guide for managing a creative business. She's currently working on her next book, Riot Woman, a collection of feminist essays, and is the host of a podcast of the same name. She loves to punch out her writer's block at her local boxing gym.\nAbout the publisher\nWe are Microcosm Publishing & Distribution, a scrappy mid-list publisher and purveyor of empowering, brightly colored books and zines. Based in Portland, Oregon, we have a team of 13 workers, 500 titles, and more than 2 million books in print. Our goal is to connect you with books that put your power in your hands.\nAs a creative business that's weathered the ups and downs of the last 24 years, we deeply appreciate the value of combining sound math with good design, smart numbers with shining inspiration, and strong contracts with strong relationships. That's what these books are all about!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nA successful Kickstarter project helps us connect directly with readers, and also means we can sell enough books in advance to reduce the  financial risk of publishing a book. \nKickstarter funding is all-or-nothing: That means that if we don't make our goal by the end of the project, we get nothing and you pay nothing. Your card will only be charged for your pledge on the day the project ends, if it meets its goal. \nThank you for supporting our vision, Eleanor's books, and the tiny but lively ecosystem of independent publishing! With your help, we can change the world. \nP.S.

Ace being the quintessential bad boy likes fast cars and hot chicks. His classic car and Tess meet both those qualifications. Unfortunately for Tess, Ace has a dark side that she is unaware of. \nWill they make it out alive? \nThis is the first issue of a four-issue mini-series. Rodney originally wrote this as a one-shot and had discussed the project with another artist before meeting Eamon Hill at a local creator meet-up. As they got to know each other better, Rodney discovered that Eamon had the same love of old Grindhouse and Horror movies as he did. Especially, the greats like Hitchcock, Carpenter, and Romero and their use of suspense in storytelling.\nIt was also during this time that Rodney was introduced to Eamon\u2019s artistic style and realized he was perfect for Roadkill Rampage. As the two began working together, it was obvious how well Rodney\u2019s writing style meshed with Eamon\u2019s art to create what is before you now and why we have decided to continue the story with additional issues.\nAs of the launch of the Kickstarter, Rodney has issue #2 completely written, and Eamon is ready to get started drawing. It is our hope to release Issue #2 in 2021. \n Our Artist, Eamon Hill, brings our story to life creating digital pencils and then printing the art to finish it traditionally with ink washes to give the art that unique gritty look that you will find throughout the book. \nPLAY\n\nPage from Roadkill Rampage\nPage from Roadkill Rampage\nWriter - Rodney Fyke is a writer and artist from Cincinnati, Ohio. He's been working on and off in Independent comics since the early 90s. His art style varies from high detailed illustrations to cartoony drawings. His published projects include Superior Seven, Peanut, Puddin\u2019 n\u2019 Jelly, Pitter Patter, and Unchained. Roadkill Rampage is his first venture into the Horror genre. He has over twelve comics that have been published in which he's either written, illustrated, or both. \nArtist - Eamon Hill is a tattoo artist and cartoonist based in Cincinnati. He and his wife, Lish Crossland-Hill, comprise Pigbone Comics; the studio responsible for the Gothic Horror-Western, Arcana Vaquero. Eamon is a bit of a traditionalist when it comes to art; preferring brush, ink washes, and watercolor. Roadkill Rampage is Eamon's first project with Hazzum, but he is the artist on his self-published comic Arcana Varquero also available through Hazzum.  Chapter #2 f Arcana Varquero is currently in production with Pigbone Comics. \nLetterer - Dave Lentz is a letterer, designer, and sometimes artist and writer. When he's not reading comics, he does his best to create them by any means necessary. he\u2019s pretty keen on his wife and son, Batman, Star Wars, TMNT, and comics in general and has done work for Source Point Press, Last Wolf Legion, Action Lab, and more. You can find some of his work at www.davelentz.com\nEditor - Kasey Pierce is CEO of Red Pen Media offering editing, copywriting, and creative advising. She\u2019s also a creator and brand ambassador for Source Point Press (since 2014). In 2015, she created movie-optioned Sci-Fi comic series, \u201cNorah\u201d. To find out more, visit Facebook.com/redpenmedia1 or Facebook.com/kosmickasey.\nHazzum Productions - Hazzum was started in 2009 by Tina McElhinney and Rodney Fyke. We've been publishing comics since 2010. That first year, we debuted our all-ages comic, Peanut, Puddin' n' Jelly - a 6-issue series. We also published Pitter Patter and Unchained. We recently teamed up with Pigbone Comics to distribute their Western-Horror, Arcana Vaquero.

(F/F)\n Dirty Deeds: A thief breaks into a house and gets a sexy punishment. (F/F)\n You Do Something To Me: A witch uses magic to connect with her fairy girlfriend while away on a trip. (F/F)\n Moral Dilemma: An angel and a demon make a sexy bet for the fate of a man's soul. (F/F)\n The Witch: The only virgin in town dreads the arrival of a witch who is said to eat virgins. (F/F)\nThere is also a trio of Greek mythology adaptations.\n Heaven on Earth: The (pro)creation of the world. (F/M)\n Object of Affection: Pygmalion makes the perfect woman out of stone, but she has her own desires. (F/F/M/M/F/M)\n Six: Persephone and Hades' whirlwind romance is interrupted, but they keep the fire burning until she can rejoin him. (F/M)\nA page from \"Six\"\nBonus content includes written erotica, mad libs, satirical \"articles\", pinups, coloring book pages, puzzles, quizzes, and more!\n Content include a range of body types, BDSM, queer people, and lots of humor while still being sexy. (Good sex should include laughter!) As far as trans representation goes, I admit there is no overt depictions in the comics because this is a lot of earlier stuff and I wasn't there yet with my own mind and understanding, but the bonus content is newer and has trans content. I will say there is nothing in the book that equates vagina = woman/ penis = man. I want everyone to have fun here!\n The book will be approximately 180 pages, mostly in full color but some of the bonus content in black and white. It's a paperback book and it'll be printed in The United States.\nIn addition to the book itself, you can also get some cool other swag to go with it. First up, this big sticker sheet in which I channel my inner Lisa Frank:\nObviously this is heavily censored and you gotta trust me that the genitals behind those hearts are brilliant.\nIf enough people order these, I want to upgrade it to holographic foil! So tell all your friends about this so we can get the ~~M A X I M U M * S P A R K L E~~!\nI'm also making these embroidered patches. Well, I'm not stitching them myself. That would take me 500 years. Anyways, they're cool:\nArt subject to change.\nI can't wait to sew this onto a really cute sweater so the world can finally truly know what I'm about.\nYou can also get original sexy watercolor paintings. These will be up to my discretion for what to paint, but you can advise on whether you want it PG-13 or XXX, and if you have any hard limits on what you'd like to see. But y'all, I got some extremely nice Japanese watercolors and a lot of metallic gold paint.\nHopefully I don't need to censor this. For some reason, a lot of sites have the rule that digital art must be censored but \"traditional\" art doesn't need to be. So, to whoever at Kickstarter is looking at this, these are important Art nipples made of real paint on real paper.\nThey're about 5x7\" so you can put them in a frame and then hide them when your parents come over or just leave them up and let your parents deal with the fact that you are an adult with your own sexuality!\nYou can also get some of my other work in various bundles. All of these are paperback graphic novels:\n Darlin It's Betta Down Where It's Wetta: Pearl the mermaid has only heard about vaginae through legend, and she goes on a quest to get some. (F/F)\n Eat Me: Literal food porn, in which shy factory worker Rhonda is magically transported to a surreal technicolor world of food people and monsters. (F/F)\n The Lady Eudora Henley: A newlywed woman, already dissatisfied with her sex life, is drawn to The Lady Eudora Henley, a noblewoman with a reputation for filth and depravity. (F/F also includes explicit trans representation)\nYou can also get copies of Filthy Figments' anthologies Food Porn and Score, in which I have a story in each of them. In Food Porn, my story The Munchies features a couple of hungry stoner girls. In Score, my story Tag Team is about two pro wrestling dudes who take things a little further during practice.\nIt's collectively nearly 1,000 pages of smut if you snag everything. Wow! That'll pass a lot of time while staying indoors.\nThis project could definitely be filthier. Let's get it there. The goal is $12,000. But we can go higher.\n$15,000: Physical books will include a full color \"centerfold!\" Mad Magazine style ;)\n$20,000: Sticker sheets will be larger, with more stickers, and **sparkles**!\n$25,000: Sexy bookmarks to slide between the sheets... of paper.\n$30,000: Let's make this book bigger with a brand new comic!\nAfter that, who knows? Drop your suggestions in the comments. What would YOU like to see?\nSurpassing the initial goals won't just make this project better, it'll make it easier for me to make better content in the future for other projects.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThese books will be printed in America, so there shouldn't be a problem with having to receive a shipment from China, which is so often a holdup for projects like this.

So they strap up, hit the streets and are ready to fight back against bigotry with a sequin baseball bat and some bad ass righteous fury! \nThe fabulous Bi Phallicia\nFollow the most fabulous street gang in the world as they patrol the Gay Village, step up to bigoted politicians and bash down the bashers. And in the midst of it all, they discover there's a conspiracy behind it all!\nThey're sick of being seen as victims! Sick of having crimes against them ignored! The Glitter Vipers are here to fight back!\nThe story is a brisk 60 pages, with a few behind the scenes extras thrown in too to give you a great little package in a glitter grindhouse revenge fantasy!\nThe gang's all here! Art by Katie Fleming\nWho Are the Glitter Vipers?\n Bi Phallicia  - Bi Phallicia, real name Jason Filson, is a Manchester drag queen of some repute, who as well as her weekly shows runs a support group for those that have been victims of abuse, bigotry or hate crimes. Unfortunately, she finds herself becoming not just the organiser but also one of the members. She takes on the lead in the Glitter Vipers gang when they decide to fight back. \nJesus Moretti - Jesus is a Colombian immigrant living in Manchester, UK and close friends with Bi and her group. He's dating Anton Bakunin. He's a broader, tougher looking man who came to the UK to live a more open and free life as a gay man. \nAnton Bakunin - Anton had a rough upbringing, finding it a lot harder to hide who he is as a gay man. An Eastern European immigrant who fled his home where being gay can result in being 'vanished', Anton came to the UK to try and find peace. Unfortunately, homophobia isn't just something that happens 'somewhere else'. \nMelissa 'Mel' Carter - Mel is a garage worker in Manchester, and is dating Bri. They are attendees of the support group after the pair were attacked by homophobes on a tram.  Mel is very tough, and has been harbouring a lot of anger over the surprise attack they suffered, and is eager to make sure nothing like it ever happens again.\n Bryony 'Bri' Stonehouse - Manchester born and bred, Bri has been dating Mel for nearly two years now. She also felt more anger than anything else after they were attacked, but she abhors violence entirely. Instead, Bri uses her smarts and community spirit to build the community support group stronger than ever before. \nCallum 'Cal' Wilkes - Cal came out much later in life, as his life in a biker gang didn't feel like the safest place to be openly gay. In fact, it turned out he was right when he did get outed to his gang and he wound up kicked out and alone. Struggling at first to find his tribe after this rejection, Cal is now a regular of Manchester's leather scene and brings his gruff, take-no-guff attitude to the local queer community. \nQueenie Iwobi - Queenie is a trans woman from a Nigerian family, she moved from her home in London to Manchester for council work years ago. Now, she takes part in the support group as a way of managing the daily micro-aggressions she faces as a proud trans WOC in this world, and to help support others like her. Also not a fan of violence, she joins Bri at the homebase, creating a helpful, safe space for the community and using her skills as a community support worker. \nAlbert 'Alby' Prince - a 16 year old trans masc kid, Alby has been sneaking out to the gay scene for a while to find a safe space to be their authentic self, away from their home where they are not out. Alby became a big fan of Bi's shows, and Bi took them under her wing so she could make sure Alby was having a safe experience. Alby prefers he/him or they/them pronouns, but is not yet out to their family.\nPage of inks by Katie Fleming\nContent Warning\nWe are aware that the topic of hate crimes, bigotry and assault are sensitive topics, that we as a queer community often face far too often. Sensitive to this, the book will contain content warnings so that readers can be aware going in what to expect. \nWe are also aware that it can be annoying to be seen as just the victims all the time. And while there can be a lot of emotions that are discussed after these kind of things, one emotion is often overlooked or swept-under-the-rug: anger. \nPage of inks by Katie Fleming\nSometimes when we see these things happen, or when they happen to us, there can be a strong sense of justified anger, and we look at that through the medium of revenge fantasy grindhouse action and explore what sense of resolution or satisfaction can be found there. \nAll the while telling an entertaining, thoughtful action story in a very modern world. We'll have fun, but won't be making fun. \nWho's It For?\nHave you ever seen the news and just felt so angry? Then you, for sure. \nBut seriously, I think anyone who has felt that kind of strong reaction to things that happen in the world, whether it be a story of injustice they've seen in the news, or an article of a hate-fuelled attack, or worse, have had personal experience with that; I think anyone who relates to that will find something to relate to in Glitter Vipers. \nQueenie Iwobi by Katie Fleming\nAnyone who has stood up to or is aware of organised hate, systemic violence and bigotry in this world can maybe find something in Glitter Vipers that speaks to them. We've all felt angry: this is about our right to that rage, and finding an outlet for it.\nWe all get told that we should not let that anger rise, that we don't have the right to our anger or how lashing out is wrong, but see the same things happen again and again. Glitter Vipers will explore that anger, it's justification and how it too can have a role in recovery, for good or ill.\nGenerally suitable for teens aged 16 years of age or older, the book has some light use of course language, violence, and as mentioned, sensitive topics around bigotry, hate crimes and assault. If you are buying for someone else, please do bare that in mind. \nCover by James Gifford\nWho's Making It?\nOne thing that we wanted to achieve with this book was the keep the whole creative team as queer identifying people. It's an LGBTQIA+ focused story, so it only felt right to have it be made by LGBTQIA+ people. \nThe team is as follows:-\nJoe Glass - Writer\n Joe Glass - Joe is the writer and co-creator of popular LGBTQ+ superhero adventure series, The Pride, now a successful ComiXology Originals series. He's also the writer of Acceptable Losses, a mature, political thriller with a dark edge. Most recently, he's worked with RuPaul's Drag Race star Manila Luzon on a countdown Instagram comic for her single, Robbed! Joe lives in South Wales with his family, and a petulant cat named Oliver. You can find his website here. \nKatie Fleming - Art\n Katie Fleming - Katie Fleming is a queer artist from Dublin, Ireland.  She began creating comics with her Partner with their LGBTQ+ comic '100 Times' and '100 More Times'.  since then she's worked on numerous anthologies and comics, such as 'Heart of Steal', 'The Black Rubric' and the webcomic, 'Ship Wrecked'. Glitter Vipers is her first graphic novel and she's super excited. When she's not making comics she's spending her time as a Werewolf. Her work can be found here. \n Kelly Fitzpatrick - Kelly Fitzpatrick is known for her work on books such as: Bitch Planet, Supergirl: Being Super, Wonder Woman: Tempest Tossed, Shade the Changing Girl, DC: Bombshells, Archie, and Josie and the Pussycats. Nominated for the esteemed Hugo awards, she is also a past nominee for Autostraddle, Ghastly & Prism awards and has worked on titles nominated for the GLAAD and the Harvey awards. Her client list is available on her website and includes such prestigious publishers as DC Comics, Archie Comics & Dark Horse Comics. \nLucas Gattoni - Letters\n Lucas Gattoni - Lucas Gattoni is a seasoned graphic designer and typesetter now pursuing his dream job of comic book lettering. He has lettered GLAAD nominated Liebestrasse for ComiXology Originals, Twin Worlds for Action Lab, Eskimo Kisses for Scout Comics and is currently lettering the Spanish version of Sonic The Hedgehog for IDW. He lives in his home country of Argentina with his husband and their three unnamed goldfish (oops, make that two now). His website is here.\nTed Brandt - Editor\n Ted Brandt - Ted Brandt is best known as an inker, working with his partner Ro on the Eisner- and GLAAD-nominated CROWDED from Image Comics. He likes long walks on the beach, and eating too much pizza. Ted is using his editorial hat on Glitter Vipers to help make the book the best it can be. \nJames Gifford - Cover Artist\n James Gifford - James Gifford is a cis gay illustrator and storyboard artist who lives in London. He's a wayward pirate, plundering whatever illustration jobs he runs ashore on, never resting in one spot for long. A lone creative, a side-spitting gunslinger. The moment you think you have him pinned, he slips through your fingers like smoke. He's earned coin from Cartoon Network and Marvel comics and is currently creating content for Dungeons and Dragons in his spare time. You'll chip your teeth on his tough exterior, but deep down his heart is gold. His website is here. \nSpire Eaton - Spire is a graphic designer, artist, animator and comic creator based in Florida. He designed the Glitter Vipers logo for the book. That fabulousness is all down to him! You can check out his work here.\nHow Far Along Is It?\nAt time of launching the campaign, the book is entirely written, final inks are done for about roughly 20% of the book, with a further dozen pages ahead prepped too, and colours and cover work is starting in conjunction as the rest of the pages are drawn.\nAlby Prince by Katie Fleming\nWe estimate that by the end of the campaign the book will be half way or more complete, and have allowed a roomy space of months between campaign end and delivery in an effort to ensure prompt delivery of the finished product. \nBy following and/or backing the campaign, we will keep you updated with new pages and art as they happen, so you'll be the first to see more as it comes!\n How is the Money Spent?\nA Breakdown of How the Goal Amount is Split\nThe majority of the goal amount is to pay for the art production of Glitter Vipers: this includes the drawing/inking, the colours and the design elements of putting the book together. \nThe next biggest elements are the printing costs (currently based on a modest-to-large print run) and the shipping costs of sending copies out to those who back for physical reward tiers. Costs of shipping have been worked out based on impending Royal Mail price changes taking effect on July 1st 2020. Due to COVID-19 and changes in legislation for USPS in America, international shipping will be rising significantly, but we are baring this in mind in the planned goal amount and postage prices. \nThe smallest element is to go on extra rewards elements, like the stickers. \nAs such, the greatest overall chunk of the the goal amount we are asking for is to cover the production cost and to make sure our art team get a good, speedy payment for their hard work. \nSample colours by Kelly Fitzpatrick\nWhat Can I Get?\nWell, naturally we are looking to provide both digital and print options of the book as reward tiers. In this day and age, there's no excuse to not offer both options to backers, so both will be readily available. \nThere is also a tier to get multiple copies of the book, at a discounted price! This is primarily for comic stores that would like to support and stock the book, but also libraries and heck, if a group of friends all want to support but are on a budget, or you think you know a group of friends or family who'd all be interested in a copy, you can back at that level to get multiple copies at discount. This level is limited.  \nThere are options to get signed copies of the book, signed by writer Joe Glass, but again these are limited due to the time and energy taken in signing a lot of books can take.\nWe also have Glitter Vipers stickers available, so you can grab reward tiers with those included. \nSample of the Embroidered Patch\nOr, why not grab an embroidered Glitter Vipers patch! This is a very limited reward tier, so once it's gone, it's gone. Get it while you can! \nPlus, there's just the positive energy of knowing you've supported a great, queer focused comic project by queer creators, and that's worth everything, right! \nFinally, we have been sure to include the price of postage so when you back, you'll know exactly how much it will be in total. We've based the postage prices on the updated Royal Mail pricing coming into effect on July 1st, 2020, based on the planned sizing of the book and estimated weight.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSometimes life gets in the way, and unforeseen obstacles pop up causing a delay in getting the products shipped in time. In this campaign, we have estimated a lot of time for completion and printing, so all things being equal there shouldn't be a delay to the books going out, but as ever, it is an estimate. \n\nLikewise, as far as postage goes, we have sourced good, strong, tough packaging that should withstand any handling from delivery services. Similarly, we have taken into account the new postal rates for sending to the United States from the UK, and have priced accordingly. This does mean International postage costs are higher, but with the changes in USPS and increases in general post costs due to COVID-19, it is worked out to be as fair and cheap as possible, while still maintaining a relatively speedy and well-handled delivery. \n\nThe biggest challenge is the goal amount: while it can seem large, the goal is what it is to allow for making sure the team are all paid fairly for the books production, the printing of a good sized print run and shipping. The biggest help to overcome this challenge is to share and spread the word of the campaign, so for all of you deciding to support, we hope you can help us in spreading the word too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Thank You!", "descp": "Our unending thanks for helping us on our fight back!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a36 or more", "title": "Digital Copy", "descp": "A digital copy of Glitter Vipers\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}], "stat": ["195 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a312 or more", "title": "Print Copy", "descp": "You'll get a print copy of the book and a digital copy too!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Copy\nPrint Copy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["165 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a314 or more", "title": "Sticker!", "descp": "At this level, as well as your print and digital copies of Glitter Vipers, you'll be able to mark your membership to the GV gang with a shiny holo-sticker!

But some people still prefer the traditional ways of getting from point A to point B, including Tristan Keys, a writer who refuses to embrace the technological advances everyone finds so mandatory. When tiny cracks start to appear in the world around him, he has to wonder if he hasn't been a pawn of technology all along\u2026 \nThis gorgeously illustrated sci-fi tale by acclaimed writer ZEP (A Story of Men, A Strange and Beautiful Sound, Titeuf) and artist DOMINIQUE BERTAIL (Ghost Money, Omaha Beach, Mondo Reverso) aims a spotlight on current social trends such as over consumption, climate change, social media, identity theft, and transhumanism.\nFollowing a proud tradition of classic science fiction authors such as Philip K Dick, Isaac Asimov,and Arthur C Clark, this visually stunning work pays tribute to the great sci-fi comic artists of the past, including Wally Wood, Jean \u201cMoebius\u201d Giraud, Enki Bilal, Fran\u00e7ois Schuiten, and Jean-Claude M\u00e9zi\u00e8res.\nWe\u2019re excited to present a gallery-quality 9\"x12\u201d hardcover edition of this stunning 88-page work of art, with an exclusive, limited edition variant cover by celebrated illustrator PEACH MOMOKO (@peachmomoko60) and a variety of other rewards available exclusively to backers through this campaign. \ncover mockup with final artwork by Peach Momoko.\nA mock-up of the ghosted spotUV element that will be hidden on the cover.\nPARIS 2119 is a taught, high-concept sci-fi thriller in the vein of BLACK MIRROR, BLADE RUNNER, and WESTWORLD, exploring the consequences of mankind's addiction to technological progress and how that could lead to our very extinction. Cinematic and immersive, with subtle atmospheric moments exploding into tense action when least expected. Make no mistake: this is a mature tale (for nudity, adult language, and violence). \nZEP\nZEP (born Philippe Chappuis) is a comics creator from Geneva, Switzerland best known for his immensely popular cartoon series Titeuf and its associated comics magazine Tch\u00f4! which have sold over 23 Million copies in the French market alone and been translated into 20 languages. In addition to his socially-relevant comedic cartoon work, he has been recognized for several of his more intimate, thought-provoking stories, including A Strange and Beautiful Noise and A History of Men, all after winning a Lifetime Achievement Grand Prix d\u2019Angouleme award in 2004, the most prestigious prize in the European comic industry. Zep and Dominique teamed up on volume 1 of the pulpy sci-fi series INFINITY 8 before starting PARIS 2119.\nPanel from INFINITY 8 by Zep and Bertail\nPanel from INFINITY 8 by Zep and Bertail\nDOMINIQUE BERTAIL\nDOMINIQUE BERTAIL grew up reading comics, learning to speak and draw from Lucky Luke, Tintin, and Blueberry before discovering new influences such as Otomo, Sienkiewicz, and Baudoin. He attended the school of the Beaux-Arts in Angoul\u00eame where he met noted comics writer and scholar Thierry Smolderen, with whom he began a long list of collaborations, most notably with The Pelgram Hell and Ghost Money. \npanel from GHOST MONEY\npanel from GHOST MONEY\nPEACH MOMOKO\nPEACH MOMOKO is a Japanese artist whose paintings have been showcased in annual gallery shows in Japan and abroad, including the US and Europe. Her body of work combines classical Japanese elements with iconic elements of modern pop culture and propaganda. Her ability to combine beauty and nostalgia with darkness and danger have made her one of the most sought-after cover artists currently in demand. She has to date created numerous in-demand variant covers for Marvel, DC, IDW, Image, Dark Horse, Valiant, Titan, and Heavy Metal. You can follow her work on Instagram @peachmomoko60.\nThe good stuff \nOur funding goal is set where it\u2019s at to cover a bare minimum print run of the campaign exclusive offerings: variant cover, signature plates, stretch goal add-ons, etc. We have some exciting plans, but we need your help to achieve them.\nThe digital tier will include not only the complete graphic novel with both covers, but any additional content that is unlocked through stretch goals. These rewards will be provided as DRM-free PDFs through Gumroad.\nThe core product of the campaign -- you will receive a copy of the hardcover with the limited, exclusive variant cover by Peach Momoko. The book will also include a 4x6\"bookplate signed by Zep and Dominique Bertail.\nNOTE: The first 300 copies of the book will be offered at a discounted tier for early birds, at which point the price will revert accordingly.\nGet hardcover copies of Zep and Dominique's other celebrated works, GHOST MONEY and INFINITY 8 vol.1: LOVE AND MUMMIES at a specially-priced bundle tier.\nOr, if you are a comic book collector, these complete single issue runs of both GHOST MONEY and INFINITY 8 vol.1: LOVE AND MUMMIES are limited to only 100 sets available. Each issue is 32 pages plus glossy cardstock cover, except for GHOST MONEY #10 which is an extended 40 pages plus cover.\nDominique has agreed to create an original ink and watercolor drawing for 10 backers at an exclusive reward tier. Subject matter of the backer's choosing, or left to Dom's spontaneous imagination.\nOur top tier will offer the original cover art painting by Peach Momoko. This original ink-and-watercolor piece is 11x15\" and suitable for framing.\nIn addition to these exclusive offerings, WE WILL DEDICATE THE BOOK TO THE BACKER WHO PLEDGES THE MOST TO THIS CAMPAIGN, printed on the inside of the book along side the author's own personal dedications.\nPlus, as an added bonus, ALL BACKERS WILL RECEIVE AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF AMBASSADOR POINTS AS THEIR TOTAL PLEDGE VALUE. If you aren't familiar with our Ambassador Point program, visit our webstore for more information.\nWe are offering a RETAILER TIER that includes 5 copies of the Limited Peach Momoko variant at a wholesale discount. This tier will also include some point of purchase promotional items for your store, including mini-posters and/or postcards you can use as bag-stuffers. YOU MUST BE A VERIFIABLE RETAILER, WITH A BUSINESS ADDRESS/LINK AND TAX ID/EIN to qualify for this tier! If you do not qualify, do not select this tier as your rewards will be adjusted accordingly. \n Note: your pledge does not including shipping, which will be applied by Backerkit when you fill out the final survey after the campaign is complete. This helps us ensure sufficient postage is collected without overcharging you with unspecific estimates up front. This also gives you an opportunity to determine your preference of shipping provider and delivery speed. Trust us -- this is best for everyone!\nWhile our initial goal is set to cover the costs of the campaign specific exclusives, we have exciting plans to supplement your rewards should we exceed that goal. Design upgrades, bonus content, and additional in-world artifacts will all be added to your reward packages for FREE pending your support in helping us spread the word.\nHere's what we have going on... \nAnd now this, just added (July 13th):\nOlivier Vatine added to the lineup!\n\nThe Magnetic connection\nOver the past six years, MAGNETIC PRESS has built a reputation for publishing high quality art books, graphic novels, and games showcasing some of our favorite creators from around the world: Bengal, Tony Sandoval, Fred Brremaud and Federico Bertolucci, LRNZ, Matteo de Longis, Miki Montllo, Joel Jurion, Bertrand Gatignol, Caio Oliveira, etc, etc... the list goes on and on. Mind-blowing talent that we believe you will love as much as we do. We are constantly on the lookout for dynamic new styles and stories to share. Magnetic wants to be a matchmaker between you and your new favorite discovery. A secret stash of the coolest stuff your friends don\u2019t yet know about.\nIn the six years since Magnetic started, we\u2019ve released over a hundred books and collected a handful of awards and nominations along the way, including 19 Eisner nominations. That might sound big, but we\u2019re not. We\u2019re still just two people with a lot of passion and tenacity, as indie as it gets. The market is going through some challenging stuff these days, and our previous ability to get books into stores has been somewhat affected by all of that. So we\u2019re coming back to Kickstarter to directly engage you, the discerning connoisseurs of quality, and to offer access and exclusives that won\u2019t be available through retail channels. While we do plan to make a basic, standardized edition available in stores, the Limited Edition Peach Momoko cover, signature plate, and other rewards will only be available through this campaign. \nBy backing this project, you\u2019re not only getting a special collectible edition of a gorgeous book and some other cool extras at great prices, but you\u2019re also supporting Magnetic Press as an indie publisher weathering an evolving market place so that we can continue to bring you amazing books like this. (And there are so many amazing books on our radar...)\nThe translation and layout are essentially complete. Our goal is to send this book to the printer as soon as the campaign ends once we know how to set our print run of the standard and exclusive variant editions.

Lovecraft inspired survival horror comic series set after the rise of the GREAT OLD ONES and the fall of humanity.\nTaking place in a GREAT BRITAIN where both cosmic and folk terrors are a commonplace and chilling truth. Ravaged by death and madness, the story follows the journey of two siblings, SISTER and BROTHER, as they try to survive a world teeming with savage cults and sanity shattering beasts.\nIf you are a fan of nightmarish post-apocalypses, doom-laden horror, and mind bending cosmic dread, this is the series for you!\nAs you will have seen from our introduction video, Britain is not in a good place. \nThe GREAT OLD ONES have awoken, and with them death and madness has rapidly spread across the globe.  Still, there are a few that remain untouched by the grip of insanity, and it is a pair of such individuals that we now find ourselves following.\nIntroducing us to the survivor's guilt ridden SISTER, and the her spirited teenage BROTHER, the pair must navigate through DARK YOUNG infested woodlands and DEEP ONE inhabited coastlines as they come to grips with their new dark reality. \n A reality populated with crazed cultists, nightmare inducing creatures, and vast eldritch horrors. \nWith nothing but the clothes on their back, and no family and friends other than themselves to rely on,  they embark on a journey of survival that will not only push their sanity to its limits, but their relationship and family bond.\nThe first issue will dive head first straight into this frightening new universe. Dragging us deep into dark folklore infested woodlands of England, where the DARK YOUNG, followers of the great old one, SHUB-NIGGURATH, now call home.\nWith a story arc set to place over four 28-page issues, stunningly drawn in B&W, by backing this project you'll be supporting us to make ISSUE #1 become a reality and be an instrumental part of creating this thrilling new horror universe.\nWritten by cosmic horror aficionado, screenwriter, and creative producer for the DEADBOLT FIlms, THOMAS J CAMPBELL (BEYOND, AND NOTHING HURT) and with artwork by accomplished artist WAYNE LOWDEN (SHARKS OF A TRAIN, NOCTURNE), lettering by KEN REYNOLDS (COGNITION, HERE AND THERE) and cover colours by SEAN CALLAHAN (AIKO, NOCTURNE).\nABYSSAL ALBION is set out to be a chilling series filled with exciting and spine-chilling homages to the CTHULHU MYTHOS and the originators of weird fiction, H.P Lovecraft, Ambrose Bierce, Robert W. Chambers, Charlotte Gilman Perkins, Arthur Machen, amongst others.\nDrawn in striking and suitably atmospheric Black and White by WAYNE LOWDEN, with art that perfectly captures the strange and chaotic world our protagonists now find themselves in.  \nThe book itself will be printed on 120gsm uncoated paper to give the pages a slightly rough, more visceral texture, and will feature a 200gsm full colour gloss laminate cover.\nOf course you'll need supplies if you are to survive out there in the harsh world that is ABYSSAL ALBION -

This volume is available in several formats, including two (2) that are exclusive to this campaign. You will also have the rare opportunity to own original art from this monstrous horror tome, or even commission brand new artwork!! Support us and we will feed your horror collection!!\n(*) 160-page if we hit the $15k stretch goal!\nSpeaking of support, as many of you know, our lofty goals of the first campaign were not met, so we had to drop back and re-think it a bit. We've come up with a new pricing structure, added some new cover options and lowered our initial goal. We originally only had one stretch goal that was intended to boost financial support for our creative teams, but this time around, we've added some incentives for backers as well.\nA Little Bit of Backstory:\nBack in 1989, when Gore Shriek\u00ae was a household name \u2013 it was in my house anyway \u2013 (and if you were alive and actively collecting horror rags back then, it probably was in your house too) Tom Skulan decided to compile a \u201cBest of\u2026\u201d book to bridge the gap between the recently deceased Gore Shriek\u00ae Volume 1 and the (then) forthcoming Gore Shriek\u00ae Volume 2. It also served as an annual of sorts. It was slightly oversized, had no discernible logo, and featured a stunning Rolf Stark painted cover. The ninety-six squarebound, black-and-white pages therein contained many a classic Gore Shriek\u00ae tale, as well as a new jam from Rolf himself. Tom called this compilation Gore Shriek\u00ae Delectus. \nThe venerable Gore Shriek\u00ae Delectus (FantaCo, 1989) atop a pile of it's siblings...\n\nIt was limited to 3000 copies and sold out rather quickly. It was always Tom's intention to do a follow-up, but the years rushed by, other projects crept to the fore, and a second volume of Delectus was moved to the back burner (and eventually fell behind the stove LOL). \nWell, here we are thirty years later, looking at the same concept but\u2026 matured a bit. Now we\u2019re all a little older \u2013 not necessarily wiser \u2013 but wading back into the fray. A couple of years ago, Tom licensed the black-and-white comic book, Gore Shriek\u00ae Resurrectus to Derek Rook\u2019s Rough House Publishing (www.roughhousepublishing.com\u2026 make sure you check it out, they are killing it over there!) and as a companion piece, FantaCo has pulled together some of the best new blood we could dredge up from the abattoir floor and showcased them in this awesome, all-new 128-page graphic anthology, now titled Gore Shriek\u00ae Delectus 2020.\nSome of the old gang are back: Rolf Stark has painted us some amazing covers and a fantastic story \u2013 with his daughter Rachel penning the tale! The Gurch has also graced us with a couple of new pin-ups and covers (and possibly some stories you may not have seen, depending upon how well the campaign goes). Everyone else is new blood. Fresh meat for the grinder, if you will. Here's a little sample of what's in store:\nWriter Josh Hadley and artist Tony Fero bring us a delightful tale of dystopian apathy and literal brainwashing. Things tend to get a little sloppy in the future...\nWriter/artist Anthony Richichi weaves a psychosomatic tale of living nightmares, lucid metamorphosis, morbid introspection, and teeth. Lots of teeth...\nWriter Josh Hadley and artist Monstress Savage flip the script and show us the seedy underbelly of a Hollywood where all of the Classic Monsters are REAL.\nWriter/artist Sara Hanley shows us an intriguing view of podcasts, neglected auto maintenance, self-restraint, fandom gone to an extreme... and the intricate art of candlemaking!\nWriter Mike Howlett and artist Mark \u2018Frightfeast\u2019 Allen give us a biology lesson about amphibious life, endemic ecosystems, vernal pools, and the lengths some will go to protect their homes...\nWriter Ray Ramos and artist Jason Paulos bring us a post-Capitalist era romp in the woods. The hunters become the hunted in this table-turning tale of war and WOAH!\nWriter Vincent Dawn and artist Sara Hanley attempt to shed a little light on the darkness that resides in all of us. Sadly, sometimes the darkness is playing for keeps...\nWriter Rachel Stark and artist Rolf Stark deliver the goods with a heartwarming tale of a girl who strives to make everyone see just how good she is... often with mixed results.\nAuthor Michael Jernigan pens us a little prose tale about desire and the turning tides of fortune.

But, right now, I'm here to tell you about NIGHTMARE THE RAT.\nNIGHTMARE THE RAT is a mischievous little monster who preys upon the populace of Hell City by stealing their teeth. I began drawing his comics in 2010 and released a collection in 2014. Since then, I've been working diligently to complete Nightmare's tale. That day has finally arrived.\nThis Kickstarter is meant to raise the funds to publish the second, and final, NIGHTMARE THE RAT collection. \nNIGHTMARE THE RAT - The NEW collection!\nAbout the collection:\nNIGHTMARE THE RAT is an homage to early 1900s comics and the collected editions reflect that influence. This 32-page collection will be printed oversized (10.5\"x16\") on good old-fashioned newsprint with bonus comics and a sketchbook. It's the same format as the first collection, so they'll look great together! \nPut them side-by-side! They look great together!\nThis second collection completes Nightmare's tale, concluding with a finale that might be the most messed-up thing I've ever drawn.

What the hell is this about?\nNightmare the Rat is a demon who steals people's teeth, forcibly sometimes.\nHis nemesis is a tiny owl named Morningbreath who poops in people's mouths.\nThe mayor and his goon squad are always trying to take Nightmare down!\nAlso, there's a cult and some kind of apocalyptic prophecy???\nYou can currently read most of Nightmare's adventures online, however, the collected editions are the intended reading experience. \nWhat kind of rewards are there?\nBeyond the collection itself, we are also offering...\nEnamel Pins! \n1\" enamel pin, complete with collector card!\nMini-Prints! \nNINE postcard-sized prints! By Kelly Williams, Giles Crawford, Jason Axtell, John Shine, Matt Dembicki, Steve Becker, Brett Uren, Jacob Warrenfeltz, and Chris Maranac!\nSketch-covers! \nI have a ton of blank covers to draw on. Let me draw something for YOU!\nOriginal art! \nNightmare the Rat \"daily\" strips. 2 strips per 14x17\" page!\nThe cover illustration!? Wow!\nHow far along is this project?\nAll  of the comics are drawn and ready to go. I still need to put together the back cover, but that'll go quick. By the time this campaign ends, all I'll have left to do is send the files to the  printer.\nHow will this money be used?\nI'm the only creator involved with NIGHTMARE THE RAT, and I don't expect to make much off of this. All of the money raised will go towards printing the newspaper collection and shipping out your rewards. Anything extra will go into printing more copies and possible stretch rewards.

Easy and affordable, it ensures your plant journey is a success from the get-go. \n\nKnow Your Pico  \n\nAs seen on \nGrowing plants indoors around the year can be tough because they require lots of direct sunlight to thrive. Unfortunately, you can\u2019t carry sunlight around to make sure your plants get the energy they deserve.\nThanks to Pico's multi-spectrum LED grow lights, giving your plant enough light isn\u2019t a problem anymore; with it, you too can #GrowLikeaPro.\nPowered by high-performance power-efficient LEDs from OSRAM, Pico provides all the necessary wavelengths of light to replace the sun completely, and allow you to grow plants all year round.\nThese powerful LEDs are chosen to support a wide range of plants and each color wavelength stimulates a specific biological function in plants.\n The LEDs are mounted on an easily-adjustable telescopic arm\u2014because plants grow like crazy under our LEDs!      Reminiscent of a vintage radio antenna, it grows alongside your plants. As they extend upwards towards the light, extend Pico by up to a foot in height.\nPower Pico through any USB Type-C cable. Included with your Pico are 2 cables to get you started, a short double-ended USB-C and a 3 meter (10\u2019) super-long cable, along with magnetic organizer loops to help route the cable around fridges, windows or anything else magnetic. You may use any phone charger to power the Pico and the optional Pico-timer helps you automate it. \nThe Aluminum heatsink makes the LED module rigid and lightweight; it also helps the LED chips last longer through its excellent heat dissipation.   \nWith its USB Type-C ports on both sides, you can chain up to 3 Picos together with a regular phone charger. Or build yourself an indoor jungle with 6 Picos powered through a 5V 3A charger! Just connect cables to either side, and each Pico will accept and pass-through power to the next one.\n\nRegardless of how busy you are, Pico\u2019s watering system makes sure your plants have as much water as they need\u2014no more, no less\u2014to sustain their health and beauty. All you need to do is top-up once a week. \nWatering too little can kill your plants, but so can too much. Getting it right takes time and experience. Not many of us have it. With Pico, that\u2019s all taken care of for you!\nThe transparent window lets you know when it\u2019s time to top up, typically once a week. Employing just capillary action and gravity, this design does not require any power supply or involve a motor or pumps. Your plants will also grow quicker and healthier due to root oxygenation from below, provided by the ventilation holes.\nPlant pots take up space. They often can only be placed on flat surfaces by windows, which limits your options.\n With Pico, any place is a good place to grow some plants.\nWork desk? Check. Fridge? Check. Wall? Check. Glass window, bathroom or even in a vehicle? Check, Check, Check. \nAll 3 interchangeable mounts are included with your Pico.\nWhy several mounts?  Because when it comes to plants, you can't have too many and you might want them everywhere.\n\nAnywhere is a good place to grow!\nGrow anything you like \nNo seed pods or subscription is involved and hence no recurring costs! Choose any seeds or growing medium of your choice.\n\nPlants Make You Happy\nResearch has long suggested that indoor plants have a positive effect on the human mind and body. Studies show up to 60% reduction in depression, over 40% in anger, and just under 40% in anxiety. And at work, plants have increased the productivity of the office by up to 15%!\nPlants have been proven to improve motivation and concentration, increase energy levels and decrease fatigue. And thanks to the transpiration and evaporation of water from plants, they increase the air quality and improve eye strain and skin health, and reduce the spread of airborne diseases.\n\n\nFresh Herbs Right In Your Kitchen \nAlways wanted to have fresh edibles at hand? Imagine being able to throw your own homegrown, organic basil onto that bowl of pasta, or some fresh mint on your chicken. \nNo more runs to the store for that missing ingredient, having to wash the pesticides and chemicals off of your leafy greens.\nGrowing edible plants can be a challenge. And while the end result is often worth it, it is a commitment most people find difficult to make. With Pico, we made sure to get all variables just right, so you can grow your favorite herbs at home without a hassle.\n\nYes, it's tough choosing a color.\n\n\n Stretch Goals unlocked!!\n Pico tool design credits to Daksh Savla\n\nWhat\u2019s Included\nPico comes assembled and ready to grow. Just take it out of the box, add some soil and water, and a few of your favorite seeds. Plug it in and watch your plants thrive!   \n What\u2019s in the box\n 1X Pico (preassembled and ready to use)\n 1X Power cable (with magnetic cable organizer) (1 meter - 3' 3'')\n 1X Daisy Chain Cable (3 meters - 9' 10'')\n 3X Interchangeable mounts (magnetic, velcro, wall mount)\n\nWho we are?\n We're Altifarm Enverde, a startup based across the USA and India. We strive to offer a healthier and wholesome way of life to all. We believe in Your Right to Grow, Anywhere, Anytime.\nOur design team behind Pico\n Our first campaign was for Altifarm, which led us to switch from a Product Design studio into building home farming products. Altifarm is our flagship home farm with grow lights, greenhouse and mobility packs.\n Last year we launched Herbstation, a more sophisticated compact indoor farm. We've just completed fulfilment to our Kickstarter backers around the world.\nCompared to the other two, Pico is a tiny\u2014but only in size and not in ambition. Our goal with Pico is certainly big\u2014to bring as many people as possible into the fold of Urban Farming. Now anyone can connect with nature and #GrowlikeaPro!\nThis year, we took Pico to CES 2020. We were excited by all the attention\u2014no one could get enough of it!  \n\n Why Grow at home?  \nIs it possible for a Pico to grow enough to replace grocery shopping? Certainly not! \nWith our products Altifarm and Herbstation, we help people grow a substantial amount of fresh produce at home, with soil-based and soil-less methods. If anything, most items that are consumed fresh\u2014the ingredients for salads, smoothies, soup, garnish\u2014Altifarmers grow enough to meet a family's requirements when planned and rotated well\nWith Pico, our aim is to bring up the conversation around sustainable practices in food, and by participation, to have a greater appreciation for fresh produce among family members, including children. \nYou don't need fertilizers or pesticides when you grow your food at home\u2014no transportation, refrigeration, or even washing is required. And certainly, no single-use plastic packaging is involved.\n\n Timeline \nProduct Development \nFor business Inquiries: info@enverdeworld.com\nSay Hi to us: hello@enverdeworld.com \nPICO is fully managed by The Crowdfunding Formula (TCF), the biggest digital marketing team responsible for the top crowdfunding campaigns.

More Pages!!\nThe campaign ends at midnight and we're on our way to unlocking a 4th Stretch Goal. If we can get to $4,500 before midnight, we'll be adding a crazy, cool, amazing, and wonderful 2-page spread to the end of the book. I don't want to spoil anything, but it would be extremely fun to get this unlocked, and I'm sure Angela Oddling would make this something truly amazing!!\nWe\u2019ve already unlocked 3 stretch goals, so if you back for just $10, you get over 30 digital indie comics, the Supercats digital bundle, the physical edition of the new Supercats Halloween book, a vinyl sticker designed by David Jaxon, and 2 art prints designed by Angela Oddling and Corinne Roberts!!\nUNLOCKED STRETCH GOALS \n$4,000 - Corinne Roberts AND Angela Oddling Art Prints\nWe're excited to announce that when we hit $4,000, we will be unlocking special prints of these beautiful Supercats Halloween! pieces. If you want these, you have to back at the $10.00 tier or higher.\nThe first is by Corinne Roberts. Her style compliments the Supercats look and feel to well, I just knew I had to get her to do something for us this time around!\nArt by Corinne Roberts\nThe second print is by Angela Oddling. She is one of the most charming and talented artists I know. Her personality and whimsy is reflected in every page of Supercats, and I absolutely love this Halloween Kitty piece she put together for backers!\nArt by Angela Oddling\nREMINDER: You are not charged until May 4th, and you will only be charged on May 4th, if we are funded 100% or more. So, please back now to help us build momentum and boost visibility! (You can always alter your pledge before the campaign ends.)\nThis Chibi Supercats Sticker comes with every physical reward!\nThe Story\nSupercats Halloween! is a silly tale about what the Supercats do on Halloween day. Meowow is taking the day off while Ohno goes trick-or-treating, but when he finds the Bad Dogs dressed up like Supercats he springs into action to save Halloween!\nSupercats books are a wonderful way to introduce kids to reading through comics. Not only are these books a blast to read out loud with your little ones. They're also a clever, cute way to introduce children to reading through comics and teach them valuable lessons of self-worth and friendship.\nThis is a hybrid children's comic book / comic book. It's a 20 page, full-color, 8 x 8 saddle stiched book with beautiful, whimsical art by Angela Oddling. This cross between children's picture book and comic book takes Supercats one step closer to becoming an all-ages comic book series.\nAlthough Supercats books are meant for Pre-K to K kids, the beautiful art and whimsical tales will capture the imaginations of children of all ages. \nIf you love comics, cats, superheroes, or just cute cartoony stories, you and your kids are going to love Supercats.  \n A Simple Lesson \nWhat good is a book without purpose? Not only is this simple story a blast to read, but it teaches the valuable lesson that friends are important and you should never be afraid to ask for help. Some things in life are too hard to do on your own. \nChildren absolutely love the charming characters, and I guarantee they will want to read these books over and over again!\nSomething Special\nI wrote this series attempting to make something different. After reading many, many kid's books over the past few years with my son, I found that there really isn't much that introduces the comic book structure or style to kids just learning to read. \nIt's my hope that these books will be a bridge to get more kids interested in reading through comics and bring new readers to comics by showing them what they are and why they are so fun. \nWhy Launch Now?\nFans, backers, and comic lovers,\nThese are crazy times. The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically changed how we all are currently living from day to day. Social distancing is difficult, but there is no reason we should stop reading and creating. \nProducing books helps put people to work and pays bills during a time of need. Money raised here will go directly to artists who need to eat, printers who need to pay their employees, delivery workers who need to keep getting that paycheck, as well as many others who cannot afford to stop working.\nThis story is all about relying on your friends when things get rough and never being afraid to ask for help in times of need. This is a message I feel is very timely with everything that\u2019s happening in the world right now.\nThese are hard times for creators. Creative arts are extremely important during this period of social distancing. Many of us rely on them to entertain us and help us get through this difficult time. Meanwhile, conventions are being cancelled and it's making life very hard for creators like me to keep creating. So, I want to give back by sharing the work of other creators over the course of this campaign.\nEvery backer will be getting immediate access to a bundle of over 30 independently created and self-published comics including all of the currently published Village Comics titles: Alter-Life, Nook, Supercats and ZED.\nGive what you can. I know times are hard for many, but the world keeps spinning and we will get through this together. \nAs a special treat and a vote of confidence, please enjoy the digital edition of the first Supercats book for free even if you can't afford to back.\nStay healthy and safe.\nCaleb Thusat\nSUPERCATS!\n(please enjoy the first book, completely free right here)\nSupercats Halloween!

The digital editions of the books are also available in the Indie Digital Bundle, if you would like to check them out before you buy them!\nThe Origin Story\nI've been making comics for about 4 years now, but most have been dark stories targeted at a teen and adult audience.  About 3 years ago I became a parent. Now I'm a full-time father and comic creator, and I want to create something my son and I can enjoy together.\nThese early Supercats is books are just the beginning. This is a story based on characters I created while playing with my son, and it's series that will evolve over the years. The plan is to have 3 children's books that increase in reading difficulty. After these books, Supercats will evolve into an all-ages comic book series!\nI truly hope that you and your kids will love these characters as much as we do and want to read, grow, and learn along with us.\nProduction\nSupercats Halloween! isn't quite finished, but Angela Oddling is working hard to have artwork complete by the end of the campaign. We will be sharing as much as we can throughout the campaign, but we also don't want to spoil it. \nRest assured, this book will be printed in the US and will be delivered to your door as soon as humanly possible.

This year we plan on publishing two \"floppies\" (stapled comics) and three \"graphic novels\" (books with spines). \nTHE FLOPPIES:\n\"Flop Sweat #1\" by Lance Ward\nLast year we published Lance Ward's \"Blood and Drugs\", a fictional story based largely on actual events from Ward's own life. This year, we'll begin serializing his autobiographical comics under the \"Flop Sweat\" moniker. \n\u201cFlop Sweat #1\u201d by Lance Ward\n\u201cFlop Sweat\u201d is an ongoing serialization of Lance Ward\u2019s autobiographical comics arranged chronologically. Previous self-published collections of these comics were featured in The Best American Comics. Ward\u2019s life has been rife with pitfalls: abandonment, addiction, mental illness, sexual assault, arrest, attempted suicide, and even a death experience (not \u201cnear-death\u201d, he was clinically deceased!). Yet, through it all he has somehow maintained a positivity about and loyalty to his art, even after crushing his drawing hand!\n\n   This first issue covers Ward\u2019s preteen years including a devastating accident, his parents\u2019 divorce and mom\u2019s subsequent dive back into dating, bullying, shoplifting and more!\n5.5\u201d x 8.5\u201d, 28 pages. Full-color covers and interior. $6\n\"Malarkey #5\" by November Garcia\nWe've been big fans of November Garcia's hilarious autobio comics for some time, so we were thrilled when she allowed us to publish last year's \"Malarkey #4\". This year she's drawing a supplemental collection of diary comics to go with \"Malarkey #5\" just for this Kickstarter (see \"Garcia diary bundle\" reward tier)!\n\u201cMalarkey #5\u201d by November Garcia\nIn her fifth and final issue of the \u2018Malarkey\u2019 series, November Garcia attempts to move beyond her self-destructive, debaucherous hijinks (though there\u2019s still plenty of that) in order to address a sudden onslaught of deaths, deal with complicated familial relationships, as well as reflect on youth and mortality. Steeped in her signature self-effacing humor, this work continues to demonstrate why she is what reviewer Ryan Carey calls \u201cthe premier autobio cartoonist of our time\u201d.\n5.5\u201d x 8.5\u201d, 28 pages. Full-color covers and interior. $8\nTHE BOOKS:\n\"Eddie's Week\" by Patrick Dean\nTwo different titans of the comics industry (Eleanor Davis & Danny Hellman) approached us separately encouraging us to consider publishing something by Patrick Dean, a fixture of the Georgia comics scene who is exceedingly humble about his own work while championing that of his fellow cartoonists. \nDespite a recent diagnosis of the degenerative disease ALS, Dean continues to draw prolifically (check out his Instagram!). While we don't want ALS to be the focus when discussing his talent, we do want to help in some small way. For every \"Eddie's Week\" sold, we'll donate $2 to ALSA, an organization that hopes to find a cure. \n\u201cEddie\u2019s Week\u201d by Patrick Dean\nEddie Lubomir is heading into a quiet week off from work, but the city of Tragoston's Stay at Home Warden Project (S.T.H.W.P.) unexpectedly places a convict in his care...in a prison cell...in his living room! Eddie and his new inmate roommate, Randall, get off to a rocky start but manage to find a way to co-exist and even enjoy each other's company. But when Randall takes advantage of a thin disguise and Eddie's date night with the unflappable Liz to escape his living room prison cell,\nEddie must create a wild web of lies that spirals out of control to protect Randall and himself in a city where no one is quite who they seem to be. The rest of Eddie's week becomes an avalanche of theft, robberies, secret organizations, and murder. Romp your way through this absurd crime comedy showcasing wacky government bureaucracy, intermittent show tunes, pissed off bees, bear costume enthusiasts and you, too, will know some of Tragoston's secrets.\n6\u201d x 8\u201d, 196 pages. Full-color cover with b+w interior. $14\n\"The Burning Hotels\" by Thomas Lampion\nWe're always on the lookout for underappreciated talent, and we hit the jackpot with Thomas Lampion. He was across the aisle at last year's CAB (Comic Arts Brooklyn), and we traded some mini-comics. As soon as we read those comics, we knew we had to convince him to let us publish something. He suggested a memoir set in the strange little town of Hot Springs in which he grew up. \n\u201cThe Burning Hotels\u201d by Thomas Lampion\nThe Burning Hotels is a memoir by Thomas Lampion, centered around his eccentric North Carolina Hometown and its bizarre past while encompassing the mysteries of childhood, adulthood, American History and the importance of where we come from.\n6\u201d x 9\u201d, 104 pages. Full-color covers and interior on natural paper. Perfect bound. $10\n\"WOODS\" by Mike Freiheit\nMike Freiheit was one of the first people we ever met in the comics community. He had a table next to ours at SPX in 2009, and we immediately liked the cut of his jib (he was always cutting jibs back then). \"Monkey Chef: A Love Story\" was one of our favorite graphic novels in 2018, so we're thrilled to publish a very different book by the same talented man. \n\u201cWOODS\u201d by Mike Freiheit\nAfter suffering a psychotic breakdown triggered by the election of a powerful demagogue, Beth follows her husband Jason to a remote cabin where the two try to make their own world in spite of the increasingly volatile political climate. While the couple are trying their best to overcome Beth\u2019s break from reality, otherworldly arbiters conspire to change their lives forever. WOODS is a horror story that confronts the traumas surrounding a loved one\u2019s battles with mental illness, questions the struggle of individual engagement in the collective, and imagines the possibilities of a world that transcends beyond earthly understanding.\n7\u201d x 10\u201d, 144 pages. Full-color cover with b+w interior on natural paper. Perfect bound. $15\n\nSAMPLE PAGES?

Wherever Lyndsey finds someone who has seen the Box, chaos ensues. Soon, even her own sanity falls into question. In the end, Lyndsey will have to decide if she really wants to see what\u2019s inside the Box of Bones.\nDescribed as \u201cTales from the Crypt Meets Black History,\u201d Box of Bones is a supernatural nightmare tour through some of the most violent and horrific episodes in the African Diaspora.\nVolume 1 contains art from John Jennings, Sole Rebel, Damian Duffy, Frances Olivia Liddell-Rodriguez, Tommy Nguyen, Jarmel and Jamal Williams, and Bryan Christopher Moss with covers by Stacey Robinson!!!\nHelp us raise $10,000 to bring this book to print.\nBy Anthony Moncada\n\nTHE CREATORS\nAyize Jama-Everett\nAyize Jama-Everett was born in 1974 and raised in Harlem, New York. Since then he has traveled extensively in Northern Africa, New Hampshire, and Northern California. He holds a Master\u2019s in Clinical Psychology and a Master\u2019s in Divinity. He is the author of three novels, The Liminal People, The Liminal War, and The Entropy of Bones.\n\n\"When John Jennings first brought the idea to me years ago, I never imagined it would involve so many other creatives that I\u2019d admired from afar. It\u2019s been amazing to collaborate with some of the most talented up and coming and established artists. The fact that we\u2019re organizing around what\u2019s basically a bad fever dream of my historically obsessed black brain is a bit humbling, but I think the narrative and our process gives everyone a chance to shine. My hope is that this work is transformative to the industry, showing creatives and publishers that narratives around black people in the US are as diverse and marketable as any other stories. I\u2019m proud to be a part of this and excited for what happens in the future of the Box of Bones.\"\nBox of Bones #1 -- Cover by Stacey Robinson\nJohn Jennings\nJohn Jennings is a Professor of Media and Cultural Studies at the University of California at Riverside. His creative and academic work centers around intersectional narratives regarding identity politics and popular media. Jennings is co-editor of the Eisner Award-winning collection The Blacker the Ink: Constructions of Black Identity in Comics and Sequential Art and co-founder/organizer of The Schomburg Center\u2019s Black Comic Book Festival in Harlem. He is co-founder and organizer of the MLK NorCal\u2019s Black Comix Arts Festival in San Francisco and also SOL-CON: The Brown and Black Comix Expo at the Ohio State University. Together with Damian Duffy, he worked on the New York Times Best Selling Kindred: A Graphic Novel Adaptation (for which he won his second Eisner) and Parable of the Sower: A Graphic Novel Adaptation. His debut solo effort, the hoodoo noir Blue Hand Mojo: Hard Times Road, and Pitch Black Rainbow: The Art of John Jennings are his other Rosarium projects. He was recently tagged to direct and curate a new imprint for Abrams, Megascope.\n\n\"We created Box of Bones because we wanted to figure out a creative way to talk about black history and teach people about the injustices that black folk have had to endure. We were thinking about the Movement for Black Lives and our current political climate and how violence against people of color has been both normalized and erased. Box of Bones is way to talk about that erasure and present a narrative that embraces a righteous rage about black pain but also talk about what happens when you let yourself indulge in that rage too much.\"\nFrom Box of Bones #3 -- Art by Bryan Christopher Moss", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere may always be delays.

Not knowing of his past or why he is in such a dire state of mind, we are shown a sequence of events that will have undeniable consequences on the man's life. We observe his descent into the depths of his mind where his demons reside and where every fiber of his being will be put to the test. He faces the inner turmoil between personal faith and self resentment. Although the events of his journey are tragic, the story depicts a strong and powerful message that leads the way toward enlightenment.\n ART TEAM \n creator/ writer\n  Arismendy Jimenez\nI am a 24-year-old aspiring comic book writer from Paterson New Jersey that is addicted to watching cartoons, anime and reading comic books. The love and strong passion for art and storytelling lead me to pursue a career as a comic book writer. I Obtained the goal of one day making my own line of comics that will demonstrate my creativity and skill. I worked a full-time job, saved money and funded the book entirely by myself for this moment. This is the FIRST of many, and I'm very excited for you guys to be a part of my creative journey.\n Outland Entertainment\n  For this project, I went out and hired Outland entertainment, a trustworthy company that works with a great selection of talented artists and letterers. Through them, I was put in contact with an accomplished artist by the name of Ger Curti and an incredible letterer by the name of Ed Dukeshire.\nInstagram:outlandentertainment\n penciler/ inker - Ger Curti\n  Ger Curti is a comic book artist and illustrator based in Buenos Aires, Argentina. His work has appeared in the two times nominated horror anthology Chillers published by Transfuzion and Troma Films, Ignition by 215 Ink, Bloody F##king Revenge by Challenger Comics, and the independent series Palooka by Person of Merit Comics. He also collaborated with Terminus, a comic magazine published in his country, and does illustration work for Outland Entertainment, Paizo, Goodman Games, and Gallant Knight Games. You can contact him at: gcurti@live.com.ar\nInstagram: Gercurti\n letterer - Ed Dukeshire\n  Ed Dukeshire is a designer and Harvey-nominated letterer working in the biz since 2001. He has lettered comics from mainstream to creator-owned favorites, including Hulk, X-Men, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, TMNT, and ShadowHawk for publishers like Marvel, Boom! Studios, Image, and DC Comics.\nInstagram:edukedw\n Editor - Felix Nunez\n  A freelance illustrator/ graphic designer and graduate from William Paterson University. Apart from being an editor, he's also a childhood friend. He has read my scripts and provided feedback as well as designing my logo, t-shirt, and some prints. While supporting and encouraging my vision, Felix has been a tremendous help in my creative journey as I embarked on this project. Being able to work with your childhood friend only makes this project much more special and meaningful.\nInstagram:felixnunezart\nWHY?\nI felt compelled to talk about the wide variety of struggles that affect people with mental illness by conveying them through the unfortunate experience of one man. I was inspired by my family members and some friends whom deal with mental illnesses such as depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  Tackling the uncertainty inherent in not being able to trust your own mind is something I vividly express in this story.  Mental illness is real, and this is my interpretation of one person's struggle with his psyche.\n WHY KICKSTARTER? \nI'm coming to Kickstarter to help raise funds for a small print run of at least 200 copies of ENLIGHTENMENT. The book is 100% complete and ready to print. Through Kickstarter, it is my desire to get the book into the hands of as many people as possible and would love your support in helping accomplish this goal. \nPREVIEW OF ENLIGHTENMENT!\n 4 PAGE PREVIEW LINK! \nPLAN\nAs mentioned previously, the book is fully penciled, inked, and lettered only requiring printing.  By pledging to this Kickstarter you can be the first to have ENLIGHTENMENT in the palm of your hands with exclusive features such as autographs, stickers, bookmarks, prints and much more. Through the aristocracy comics email list, you would be updated on the status of this project as well as be notified on future projects. Once the funding goal is reached I will be able to ship the product in a quick and satisfying manner.\n PROJECT BREAKDOWN\n                     I set the goal for this project at 1000 dollars, fully aware of the fact that the total investment is beyond that. This is my first attempt at Kickstarter and I have decided to prioritize having a successful launch and getting the comic to as many people as possible even if I have to take a monetary loss. More than the money, I have invested a lot of effort and time and I'm very passionate about just being able to release it into the world. Also, I need to prove myself if I'm ever going to tackle more ambitious projects with higher funding goals in the future. I am confident that my project will stand out enough to convince you amazing people that your pledge was well invested. I have worked very hard on this project and feel as though it is a worthwhile venture.

Cooper and lettering by Colin Bell. \n The Tale...\nHans is a novelist, struggling to complete his latest work. His sister Retha is looking to reassess her life after the end of a long term relationship. Seeking space and perspective, they travel to the forest and the old cabin they used to vacation in as children. However once there, things quickly take a sinister turn. Hans finds passages in his book he has no memory of writing while Retha becomes increasingly drawn to a mysterious presence in the woods. As time passes, their behaviour becomes erratic as both siblings appear unable to escape their own stifling obsessions. What is causing these odd transformations? Is it the isolation? Or has the forest drawn them back for a reason?\n From the team that brought you The Edge Off...\nHouse of Sweets is a pastoral psychological horror, loosely based on the fairy tales of the Brothers Grimm.\nThe Kickstarter has a target of \u00a31,400 which will be used to cover printing and production costs.

Now, a Santa-skeptic FBI agent must team up with her wannabe-elf ex-husband to save their son--and Christmas!\"\nIn addition to the super-sized 40-page main story, the book includes:\nKickstarter-exclusive bonus material\nFREE U.S. SHIPPING!\nDigital making-of material and theme song\nHigher tier backers get:\nSketch cards\nLimited edition commissions by Fabio Ramacci\nA cameo in the book as a Mall Santa or evil troll\nWhen Mrs. Claus dies in a tragic toy accident...\nSanta loses his s#!t on the town of Christmas, Vermont...\nAnd while FBI agent Ellie Tewskberry tries--and fails--to bring him down...\n\nHer son, Byron, runs away to the North Pole to find his dad, a wannabe elf who left the family years ago. Instead, Byron finds trouble:\nDesperate to find her son, Ellie infiltrates A.S.S.--The American Santa Society--the national Union for Mall Santas. Soon, she finds herself fighting an age-old war alongside some... colorful allies.\nBut Santa escapes justice again. And just when all seems lost, Ellie's estranged husband re-appears... \nAnd now...\n\nStill not sure?\nTry before you buy!\nWanna download the first issue free?\nWHY, JUST CLICK HERE!\nOr click this obnoxious yellow button:\nMiss Any of Our Previous RED XMAS Campaigns?\nCatch up with our 72-page RED XMAS: TRIPLE PLAY, reprinting our NEARLY SOLD OUT first three issues. This is just the meat and bun, hon--no bonus features in this burger.\n(Gotta have those extras? Our BLIND BOX tier includes the 64-page RED XMAS: O HOLY CRAP! (Issues 1 & 2) and the 40-page RED XMAS: SILENT, BUT DEADLY, NIGHT (Issue 3)--plus a bunch of other surprises.\nVariants\nOur standard cover by Fabio Ramacci and Ilaria Chiocca took our breath away. But we know you collectors like your variants.\nFirst up is our \"Lady and the Tramp\" variant by colorist Emilio Pilliu, which depicts the, uh, reunion of Ellie and her husband, Witherspoon.  \nUh, careful, Ellie. That sauce is hot.\nNext up is an exclusive variant by artist Gian Carlo Bernal of Crescent City Monsters fame. If you've read CCM, you know this guy can draw!\nThe Sketch Cards\nAt the $100 level, Fabio will draw you an exclusive sketch of a character from RED XMAS on a size A5 card. Here are some of the awesome cards he whipped up last year:\nCOMMISSIONS!\nSketch card not big enough for ya? Snag a one-of-a-kind commission featuring a RED XMAS character from Fabio Ramacci in standard comic board size. \nIf you want something more complicated than a couple of characters from RED XMAS, drop us a line and we can totally work it out (fair warning: there may be an additional fee, depending on what you want). Last year, Fabio rocked this one for a backer:\nFrieda and Santa battle some creatures that are totally not Ewoks.\nThe Process Junkie Edition\nAvailable as an add-on to any print tier: a B&W print version of some of the digital process rewards included in all tiers. The full script printed alongside the layouts, with some of the 'naked' inks to boot, so you can see how a book like RED XMAS comes together. 70-pages minimum (likely more), extremely limited edition, hand-numbered and signed by Clay. \nMock-up only.

Ready to join the fight?\nOr, just listen to these fine people of exquisite taste: \nFRIED Comics is a proud purveyor of offbeat, irreverent pulp fiction since 2013, and a labor of love for Clay Adams and Alexandre O. Philippe.\nSo far, we have six successful Kickstarters under our belts. (And between us we have a lot of belts. ) So, we're stoked to return to the scene of the crime.\n\nClay Adams is a writer and filmmaker who's funded six projects on Kickstarter with FRIED Comics. His directorial debut, THE BOY SCOUT, was nominated for Best Short at the Golden Egg Film Festival in Los Angeles, and his feature script, THE ECLIPSE, placed second in the horror category of the FADEIn Awards. He has written and directed for television and holds a BFA in Dramatic Writing from NYU. When Clay first met Alexandre, he thought, \"My, what a sophisticated European.\" Boy, was he wrong!\n\nFilm nerd/director Alexandre's most recent movie is 78/52, an acclaimed documentary about the shower scene in Psycho, playing theaters now. He holds a Masters Degree in Dramatic Writing from NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and has written and directed numerous award-winning films and documentaries, including THE PEOPLE vs. GEORGE LUCAS, DOC OF THE DEAD, and THE LIFE AND TIMES OF PAUL THE PSYCHIC OCTOPUS. When Alexandre first met Clay, he thought, \"My, what a stupid American.\" Boy, was he right!\nFabio comes to us from Rome, Italy, where he has published with Star Comics and Sergio Bonelli Editore. He recently contributed to the horror anthology Modern Dread, which was successfully funded on Kickstarter. Our resident Italian Stallion likes alt rock and (we assume) makes a great cappuccino, but all indications are that he ain't that Fabio.\nIlaria is an Italian comic artist and colorist. She has published two euro-manga style books with Kasaobake as co-author and co-artist; she's done a bunch of covers as a digital painter and now she's working as a colorist for many secret projects worldwide - no joke!\nRyan is a writer, artist, and alum of the The Comics Experience School. He successfully Kickstarted his debut comic, SUNMAKER, and contributed art to the ComixTribe column 'The Proving Grounds.'  He loves Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, ninjas, teens, mutants and turtles.\nIn the grand tradition of failing upwards, Mick has turned not bathing into a signature look and doodling into a paying gig. Trophy husband/father by day and night, the little moments here and there are devoted to the doodling. Having successfully funded a Kickstarter of his own (ROVERS), and with books to be published next year, Mick is in danger of enough success he might have to shower again.\nUgh. Just... ugh.\n But enough about us. You wanna see...\nThe Package\nWe've gotten our fair share of comics that arrived mangled by the mail carrier.\nYou pay premium prices on Kickstarter, and you deserve better. That's why we've started using Gemini Comic Mailers:\nThese babies are sturdy. They require a little more money, a little more time (and a lot more tape!) but it's worth it to make sure your comics arrive in pristine condition.\nAnd if somehow your comic still gets roughed up?\nFrieda will replace it free of charge. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe're digging deep into our pockets to pay for the preview and put aside money for the printing. Now we're asking for your help in covering production costs. We believe in paying our artists a fair wage, and hiring collaborators of this quality isn't cheap. \nBy supporting this project, you're joining us as producers. In return, you'll receive all Kickstarter-exclusive perks, credit in the book, behind-the-scenes \"making-of\" material, and early access to the finished story.   \nFair enough. Where will all the money go?\nFirst, we'll put it in a big pile and dive in, Scrooge McDuck-style.\nThen we'll:\nPay Kickstarter taxes and fees\nPay our artists a fair page rate\nPrint the book and ship it to you\nIf we're fortunate enough to raise more than our goal, we'll use that money towards production of the RED XMAS collected edition. \nHoo-ray! Win-win.\nOur Evil Plan:\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: 12 Days-ish (Dec 4th-Dec 18th)\nKickstarter Funds Released: ~Jan 1\nDigital Rewards Released: April\nBook Goes to Printer: April\nBook Printed and shipped to Fried Diner ~Apr 30\n\"$#it happens\" buffer - 1 month (~May 31)\nFrieda and our sweatshop workers (AKA Frieda's kids) pack and ship - (~June 1-June 30)\nExpected delivery to US backers - 2 Weeks (Early July)\nExpected delivery for International Backers - 4 Weeks (late July)\nThanks, Hon!\nWe're not asking for a million dollars.\nWe just want to give you some holiday cheer, put a cool book in your hand, and entertain you for a bit.\nSo find a pledge level you like and pre-order. We'll make more comics.\nAnd, as always, if you leave a comment on our Kickstarter page that says, \"Frieda sent me,\" we'll send you an extra-special gift.\nOh! And finally:\nWe heard somewhere that Kickstarter campaigns do better when they have pictures of cats on the page. So, here's a picture of Clay's cat:\n\"I said, Pinot Noir! Get this out of my face.\"\nThanks for supporting! And remember...", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny Kickstarter comes with risk, but know this: we have a track record of finishing what we start.

We're back with the Second Volume of Frankenstein for Mayor. Finishing the second volume allows us to collect both of the volumes in to the complete 150 page graphic novel. \nIn the first volume, Frankenstein was brought back from the dead a second time. He's introduced to the modern world, including his own legacy. He's also introduced to the town known as Transylvania that's become steeply divided between witches, werewolves, and vampires. The Count of the region and town is his former arch-rival, Dracula. The werewolves have recently lost their candidate in the first ever election held in the town.  They've resurrected Frankenstein in hopes of adopting him as the next candidate to take on Dracula in the election. After seeing the oppression and suffering of the werewolf people, especially the werewolf refugees, by the vampire upper class, Frankenstein reluctantly agrees. \nIn the second volume, Frankenstein must learn how to win an election against a heavily favored incumbent. Frank is joined by his long time friend, Mary Shelly, former werewolf police officer, Gustav, and head priestess of the witch's coven, Indigo. Together they have to uncover evidence of Dracula's past crimes to release them to the public. Here's a preview of what's to come:\nCover of Volume Two\nPURPOSE\nThe books are completed, but we need your help to getting books printed.

You (and over 170 backers like you) helped bring the digital series Night of the Mullets to print for the first time ever! The entire NotM teams THANKS YOU from the bottom of our hearts! \n\nMy name's Boaz, I'm a screenwriter, and I'm obsessed with stories. Movies, novels, non-fiction, comic books, even jokes have always fascinated me, on a structural level: I\u2019m a sucker for telling \u2018em, listening to \u2018em, and talking about why they do or don\u2019t work. \nAll my life I\u2019ve tried to get as close to the craft of storytelling as I could. During the heyday of VHS and dawn of DVD I worked as a clerk at Austin's world-famous Vulcan Video. I attended film school, worked in commercials, directed a feature comedy, created a blog, and spent years writing dialogue for anime, cramming English into Japanese mouth-flaps on shows such as Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok, Shadow Skill and UFO Princess Valkyrie. I\u2019ve written over two dozen screenplays and currently have a TV series in development at a major Hollywood studio.  \nAnd... I\u2019m the creator/writer of Night of the Mullets, the comic book series we offered right here for the first time ever in physical form! \nTHE ORIGINS OF \"NIGHT OF THE MULLETS\"\nNight of the Mullets began its life as a screenplay in the early 2000's. The story was inspired not only by the giant, Texas-sized cockroaches that kept surprising me in various kitchens growing up, but also the movies I loved\u2026 from ultra-cool sci-fi satires like Alex Cox's Repo Man to the face-huggers of Ridley Scott's Alien to the body-snatching paranoia of John Carpenter's The Thing and Philip Kaufman's Invasion of the Body Snatchers (that freakin\u2019 dog still haunts my dreams!)  \nIn 2008, after a draft of the screenplay made it to the quarterfinals of the Austin Film Festival, some producers approached me about making a Night of the Mullets film. But ultimately, despite the fact that it was envisioned as a low-budget creature-feature, the budget was simply too low to do the story justice. So I turned my attention to other projects, and continued my pursuit of a career in the storytelling industry.  \nPLAY\n\n(above: Mullet walk-mechanic designed by Jason Gary, 2010) \nBut over the years, Night of the Mullets kept nipping at the back of my skull, and eventually I returned to it, with the goal of adapting it into a comic book, where the story could finally scuttle out of my brain and infest the minds of others.  \nAnd ultimately, after a lot of hard work by a fantastic team of artists, we ended up with a fun product we're all very proud of, which will look amazing sitting on your shelf!  \nMEET OUR TEAM OF ARTISTS: \nInterior Artist Valentin Ramon with his alternate first issue cover!\nOriginal cover for issue number 1 by Jim Mahfood!\nOriginal cover for issue number 2 by Grim Wilkins!\nOriginal cover for issue number 3 by Farel Dalrymple!\nOriginal cover for issue number 4 by Michael Ramstead!\nOriginal cover for issue number 5 by Ulises Fari\u00f1as!\nThe incredible talents of our lettering crew!\nAnd of course the TPB cover by Alchemichael\nWHY SUPPORT THIS PROJECT?\nIf you're like me, you love discovering content that's off-the-beaten path. At the edges of discourse we often find viewpoints far removed from what's accepted or expected. In my youth I found these unique perspectives in the pages of comics such as Shade the Changing Man, Concrete, Madman, Cerebus and Akira, each offering weird, off-kilter, challenging (& critical) outlooks on a world that's too often simplified by popular \"inside-the-box\" narratives.\nBut while they were once risky, today's comics and genre films have become fodder for big-budget tentpoles, with manicured commercial messages that say little about life. Whether intentionally or not, the mainstream is gentrifying the margins of our collective consciousness, and the only way to push back against its \"formulaic creep\" is to empower independent voices whose stories share some insight into the human condition, so that others might feel inspired... or even included at all. \nInjecting varied viewpoints into the cultural bloodstream is vital to society as a whole, to fortify discourse and keep the body-politic healthy. The content I aspire towards creating (with the help of collaborators and friends) aims to feed the fringes and \"keep the periphery weird,\" in order to keep the cycle of discourse from growing stagnant, and to ensure future travelers have far-out destinations to venture to! \nSO WHAT\u2019S IT ALL ABOUT?\nNight of the Mullets is the story of a down-on-his-luck guy named Gabe who teams up with an all-female resistance known as \"The Hairforce\" to fight a hairy alien invasion that's been going on for centuries.\nThat's right: the hairdo-you-love-to-hate is actually the by-product of an intergalactic infestation that's happening right under our noses (and also right above our foreheads).\nThis means that while some of your neighbors' mullets are natural (or \"terrestrial\"), others are in fact camouflaged xenosites: parasitic puppet-masters feeding on the male brain, treating their hosts like rental cars, pushing them on to get the grey matter pumping and juices flowing!   \nEarly designs by Valentin Ramon\nMullet \"ground zero\" is Crater Springs, TX, where the bugs have been landing for centuries, and where local oil baron Elwood Dix has discovered that the mullet queen's veins contain a valuable fluid that can be converted to energy. And being that he's the richest man 'round these parts, Dix has corrupted the local authorities, to ensure they'll stop at nothing to put his nefarious plans into motion! \nA wild-n'-hairy romp that mashes up the body-snatcher and zombie genres with creature-features like Critters, Tremors, Gremlins, The Blob, The Deadly Spawn and many more, the series features incredible illustration by artist Valentin Ramon (D4VE, Hot Damn, Born in Hell, Z), whose high-quality, full-color artwork will suck you into a rich world of vibrant characters and crazy critter shenanigans.  \nThe trade paperback is 100% complete and ready to print! From 2015-2018, the series appeared on the digital-only platform comiXology, but artwork this amazing deserves to be experienced on the page, in full glossy color, which is why we're setting it loose upon the world! \nCheck out all that work! But don't look too closely - there's SPOILERS in there!\nThis gorgeous book collects the entire 5 issue run with a brand new cover by Michael Lee Macdonald (Island, Heart of Weirdness, Blood and Stars, DISMAS, etc.):            \nI know I'm biased but darned if that ain't one handsome cover!\nAND... included within the TPB's pages are all the original covers from comiXology's run, as well as exclusive extras not found in those digital issues... including pin-ups, pencils and back-of-the-book features designed to include you, the audience, so that you can be directly associated with our project for all of posterity!  \nSO...

($25) level and above will be eligible for our stretch goal rewards: This means that when the campaign reaches these marks that go beyond our initial fundraising target, you'll get extra swag!   \nBesides going towards recouping production expenses, your support allows us to bring down the overall printing cost (read more about printing costs here). What this means is that the more friends you enlist in our campaign, and the more friends those friends enlist, the more generous we can be with our stretch rewards!   \nAnd when you join the Night of the Mullets family, you'll also be added (unless you opt out) to the GOOD GOLEM MEDIA mailing list, where you'll be first to know about our upcoming comic and other media projects!      \nThanks for taking the time to read this kickstarter campaign page! I hope you join our adventure and tell all your friends, so we can continue to widen our audience of fellow enthusiasts who love weird and exciting content! Who knows, if this goes well, we might even try to create a first person Night of the Mullets  video game... or maybe even put a crew together to film the opening sequence! Let's do this stuff!  \nPLAY\n\n (above: Hmm... there's something strange going on here!!)\nAnd remember: this collector's edition TPB is limited and may never be reprinted - so make sure you get your copy... and don't forget to help spread the word, so we can add more generous gifts! After all, these bodies aren't gonna snatch themselves!        \nAND ONE LAST THING: ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe comic book pages are 100% finished! There's no risk of the project not reaching fruition - the entire book is laid out and ready to print, the artists have all been paid, and we're simply trying to get the word out and grow our audience, so we can afford the largest print-run possible! \n\nHowever, there are still risks, including unforeseen third-party delays, printing problems, or lags in getting the additional materials into the \"Party Out Back\" section in the time advertised, etc. \n\nBUT... given my experience in bringing low-budget films and commercials in on-time and under-budget, as well as my general OCD-fueled attention to detail, I'm confident any and all issues will be minimized and mitigated.\n\nI've done my research, consulted with friends and mentors who've been through this process numerous times, and I am ready to nip any problems in the bud. Throughout the process of putting this campaign together, I've done my best to keep things simple, make conservative estimations, and allow plenty of room for error. \n\nIn other words, I'm confident that should we be lucky enough to get funded I will do my utmost to deliver the book and all rewards in a timely and well-packaged manner, to your satisfaction - and to communicate openly throughout the entire process!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Critter", "descp": "Get the Ebook Trade Paperback (in .pdf format) collecting all 5 issues of NIGHT OF THE MULLETS, with extra exclusive content not available on comiXology... but without any pesky bells or whistles or stretch rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital .pdf Ebook of \"Night of the Mullets\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2020"}], "stat": ["29 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "The Thing!", "descp": "It's why we're here!

Our goal is to make awesome art and products that embrace the magical and fantastic.\nWe both grew up at a time when the holidays meant cards - a mantel full of them.  We still love getting holiday cards, but even more we love giving them. We love cards that reflect our special view of the universe. For years we made our own cards by hand, but 4 years ago we wanted to do more. We  wanted to share our cards with the world so you too could give your friends and family cards that reflect the weirdness of the holidays. We\u2019ve had 3 successful Christmas card campaigns. The first campaign was for HP Lovecraft-inspired Cthulhu mythos cards. The second was was for cards inspired by Robert Chamber\u2019s King in Yellow. The year before last we finished our \"trilogy\" with Christmas cards inspired by Lovecraft's Dreamlands.\nThis year we explore older Christmas myths and invite the Krampus to come play with us.\nWhat is the Krampus?\nIn central European folklore, St. Nick has a dark counterpart in the form of a anthropomorphic beast-man called the Krampus. Santa gives good little boys and girls presents and toys, but the Krampus has scarier \"treats\" for naughty children.  Be bad and you might escape with coal in your stocking but more likely the Krampus would beat you with his switch of birch sticks. If a child had been particularly bad, they could be carried away in the Krampus' basket, taken back to his lair for a torturous end. It seems horrific but don't worry, St. Nick is totally on board with this horrible beastie and his methods.\nThe Project\nWe are creating Krampus Christmas cards, gift wrap and ornaments.\nThe Cards\nWe have 5 cards planned this year. The card paintings are all finished. We have chosen a printer and costed materials. Each of the 5 by 7 inch cards will come with its own holiday red envelope. Heather has been hard at work making the cards  beautiful. This she's been highly influenced by classic Victorian Krampus art with a little 1930's Weimar Republic imagery thrown into the mix. The images are all large hand-painted watercolors with a classic illustration feel to them . They will be printed on a heavy 15 pt (130 lb) velvet cover stock (the same as our previous cards). Just like previous years\u2019 cards they are meant to look like \"normal\" Christmas cards when viewed across the room on the mantel. It\u2019s only when you get closer that their true nature becomes apparent.\nKrampus Card 1 - Krampus Wreath\nKrampus Card 2 - Greetings from Krampus\nKrampus Card 3 - St. Nicolas's Krampus\nKrampus Card 4 - Krampus Defeated\nKrampus Card 5 - Modern Problems Krampus\nThe PDFs\nLike previous card campaigns, we will offer a PDF of the cards for those backers who would like to print their own cards, or for our European backers who want cards for Krampusnacht. Everyone who gets a physical set of cards also gets the PDF. PDFs are provided in both US and EU standard sizes to match standard paper and envelope sizes. The PDF is for the cards only, there will be no gift wrap or ornament PDFs.\nThe Gift Wrap\nThe Cthulhu gift wrap proved very popular so we are doing Krampus gift wrap this year.  The 18\" x 24\"  gift wrap comes in five folded sheets. It folds down to 9 x 12 so we can fit it into a standard mailer. The last gift wraps were printed on a 70 lb. high quality matte stock. The paper was gorgeous with a great \"touch feel\" but could be a little hard to wrap due to its thickness. We are looking into alternative paper thicknesses, but if we can't find a paper we feel is of as high a quality we will use the same paper again this year.  A single sheet will wrap a small or moderately-sized box. It\u2019s perfect for wrapping books. We are starting with five sheets of a single design, with a stretch goal of having five unique designs in the pack.\nThe Ornament Set\nThis year we are trying our hand at ornaments. The set comes with 3 different vintage-style ornaments. They are full-color die cut images backed with heavy card board and are approximately 3.5 x 4.5 inches.\nThe ornaments\nOriginal Art\nWe are also offering reward levels featuring the original art. Each piece of art comes with a set of cards, ornaments and gift wrap. The original paintings are large pieces measuring 11\" x 14\u201d\u201d, rendered in watercolor on 140 lb. watercolor paper. They have been painted to fit standard mats and frames. \n Gift Tags\nWe have a set of 6 gift tags (2 each of 3 different designs) that are a special reward for our backers either as a PDF or professionally printed on card stock (2 x 3 inches). To receive them you have to back the campaign for either any physically product or PDFs and you have to give us a shout out on the internet in social media or group or forum or a community. To get more details read Update #2.\n2 sets of three tags\nStretch Goals\n$6,500 Printed Interior\nAt $6,500 we will add holiday wishes with festive type and charming graphics to the interior of the cards.\n$7,000 Printing on envelopes\nAt $7,000 we will add stunning holiday art to the flap of every envelope.\n$8,000 Krampus envelope seal\nAt $8,000 we will add a  2 x 3 inch die cut seal printed on a paper sticker.\n$10,000 5 different wrapping paper designs\nAt $10,000 we will add four new original gift-wrap patterns for a total of 5 single sheets featuring different designs. \nThe 4 additional designs\nPrevious Year's Cards\nFor those of you who missed our earlier campaigns, previous years\u2019 cards are available!\nThe Cthulhu Mythos Pack Set (5 cards)\nThe cards are professionally printed in full color on a thick 130 lb velvet cover stock and come with a matching envelope and seal.\nCthulhu Mythos Card 1 - The Snows are Right\nCthulhu Mythos Card 2 - Lovecraft Claus\nCthulhu Mythos Card 3 - Ho Ho Migo\nCthulhu Mythos Card 4 - Merry Yithmas\nCthulhu Mythos Card 5 - The Innsmouth Carollers\nChthulu Mythos Envelopes and Seals\nThe King in Yellow Pack Set (5 cards)\nThe cards are professionally printed in full color on a thick 130lb velvet cover stock and come with a matching envelope and seal.\nKing in Yellow Card 1 - The Day Has Come\nKing in Yellow Card 2 - No Mask\nKing in Yellow Card 3 - Twin Suns\nKing in Yellow Card 4 - Behind the Moon\nKing in Yellow Card 5 - The Dragon Wreath\nKing in Yellow Card Envelopes and Seals\nThe Dreamlands Pack 1 Set (5 cards)\nThe cards will be professionally printed in full color on a thick 130lb velvet cover stock and come with a matching envelope and seal.\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 1 - Santa Toad\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 2 - Yak Riders of Inganok\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 3 - Moonlight Sledding\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 4 - Love Gugs (Under the Mistletoe)\nDreamlands Pack 1, Card 5 - Ulthar Cats Want In\nDreamlands Envelopes and Seals\nThe Dreamlands Pack 2 Set (5 cards)\nThe cards will be professionally printed in full color on a thick 130lb velvet cover stock and come with a matching envelope and seal.\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 1 - Sarkomand Starlight\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 2 - Cavern of Flame\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 4 - (Santa vs.) The Black Galley\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 3 - Happy Zoogs of Zoogville\nDreamlands Pack 2, Card 5 - Ulthar Cats Want In\nDreamlands Envelopes and Seals\nThe Cthulhu Mythos Gift Wrap Set (5 cards)\nThe 18\" x 24\" gift wrap comes in five folded sheets. It folds down to 9 x 12 so we can fit it into a standard mailer. It is printed on a 70 lb. high quality matte stock. There are 5 different designs. \nThe Cthulhu Gift Wrap pack (5 designs)\nRewards \nWe need you to become our partners\nThis is where you come in. We need your help to offset around 2/3 of the printing costs. We would like to have enough funding to print cards for both the Kickstarter rewards and to stock them for next year. Timelines are tight but we have our printers' assurances that printing will start right after the Kickstarter finishes and we can ship cards out in good time for you to send them for the holidays. We want to get them to you by the end of November or the start of December. We have been told that we have the fastest turnaround of any campaign that our supporters have backed. Help us to achieve our vision of making the holidays a little weirder. You will get your own beautifully printed cards for starting a new holiday tradition of your own.\nTiming and Shipping Costs\nShipping costs are high. We charge only for the cost of packaging and shipping, and in each of our past campaigns we have underestimated shipping costs and have paid the price. Christmas is coming and we have to move fast. The day after the campaign ends, surveys go out. The next week we tally up the totals and tell the printers that the files that they have been sitting on are good to go. Everything is printed in the USA and delivered by truck to our door. Fourteen days after the campaign ends, Kickstarter pays us; the balance of the printed rewards costs can be paid and the rewards shipped to us. Shipping arrives a week later, in mid-November. If anything goes wrong we have a chance to fix it and be ready by the first week of December. Because of these time lines, shipping has to go as fast as possible. Everything is shipped in a rigid package to ensure your rewards reach you undamaged. For rewards in the North-West we use First Class mail (2- 3 day delivery time), for the rest of the country we use USPS flat rate Priority mail (again, with a 2 - 3 day delivery time). We use rigid packaging to protect the art.  We want your rewards to arrive pristine and as fast as possible for you to be able to use them in the Christmas season. As a result of rising postage rates, it now costs a dollar more to ship a single card than the cost of the card itself. \nInternational shipping\nWe have made the tough decision that we will not be shipping internationally with this campaign. Between VAT and changing US commerce laws dealing with tax collection as well as some experiences we had with foreign shipping in the last campaign, we just can't.  If you do live outside the US, we would still like your support and we ask that you consider getting the PDFs. We can guarantee that Europeans will have their PDFs in time to use for Krampusnacht. \nWho are we?\nHeather paints the pictures, Daniel handles the rest. \nDaniel Gelon\nDaniel has over 30 years of art experience. He has  done illustration, UX, graphic design, production and art direction. He  has illustrated Magic cards, created logos for DC comics, art directed  Dungeons and Dragons books and has worked on various video games. He is  obsessed with machines made of paper.\nHeather Hudson\nHeather Hudson is a fantasy artist with a traditional sensibility and a love of early-20th century popular culture. She\u2019s worked on tabletop and hobby games  including Hasbro's \u201cMagic; the Gathering\u201d and Pagan Publishing's modern  Mythos RPG \u201cDelta Green.\u201d Past Lovecraftian projects she's illustrated  include \"Casino R'lyeh, the Lovecraft Poker Deck,\" and \"Mother Hydra's  Mythos Rhymes.\" Currently she divides her time between commissioned  illustration, personal projects and creating her own fantasy world  somewhere between Oz and the Dreamlands. She has a fondness for illuminating monsters.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 4th time on this carousal. \n\nWe run extremely fast turnarounds to make the holiday season deadline. There are a lot of moving parts. The final files are in the printers hands before the end of the Kickstarter. The day after the campaign ends surveys go out and the printers get out final count for the jobs and it takes several weeks for the jobs to arrive to us. Heather and I fold sort and collate everything by hand but we do our best at hacking through the rewards to get them out in a timely manner. The process could gum up at any point. We know this and this will be our 4th time doing this. We know all the timing and have all our systems in place best we can. We also have enough wiggle room to do expedited printing with the same printer or an alternate printer if things really go south. The ornaments are new to us this year as well as the printer we are working with on them but they had good recommendations so we don't anticipate problems. We are confident that we will have product in time to get it into your hands with time to send out for the holidays.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "A card of your own", "descp": "You want just one card.

Well, to call it \"struggling\" is generous.\nHis girlfriend has begun to bring up the dreaded subjects of marriage and kids. (He's settled on the tried and true tactics of deflection and feigned hysterical deafness.)\nHis brother has just died. Yeah, he was an ass, but still, y'know, family.\nAnd then there's the fact that he's lost his mind. At least Ned hopes he's lost his mind. What else could explain the hallucinations? This morning, on the streets of Manhattan, he started seeing creatures. Monsters; Grotesqueries; Demons; shambling, crawling or oozing along with the usual NYC sidewalk crowd. No one seems to notice them. But he sees them. \nAnd they see him.\nAnd while some might turn out to be more lost than menacing, a ten foot tall fanged and tentacle-waving nightmare asking for directions to the nearest subway station is no less disturbing. Ned's lost his mind, right? That's what he hopes. Unfortunately...\nNed and a new friend\n  As you can guess from the title, NED is not the name of a person you'd expect to be the ruler of a Pit in the bowels of Hell. (Actually, I'm not sure I want him near the bowels of anything.) Or involved in the supernatural at all for that matter. He agrees wholeheartedly, and would prefer it not be so. But in this new, original 144 page graphic novel written and drawn by me, I don't give him a choice.\nIt's a funny (to us) and frightening (especially to him) story of an average guy discovering the world is so much stranger than he thought, and his family (himself included) are way more connected to the darker, scarier side of reality than he knew or would ever ever want. The darker side, it turns out, doesn't want him either. \nThe book!-- Or at least what it looks like in Photoshop (if we go HC).\nThis first volume (the story does continue) runs over 130 pages of story; as I draw, I keep adding pages, letting scenes breathe so the page count is not set in stone. There's a great thing about creator-owned and Kickstarter: No editor saying \"Can you have this five pages fit into three, even though it screws up the storytelling and kills the gags and any suspense?\" It'll be soft-cover (fingers crossed for the hardcover stretch goal), and there'll be extras of course, like behind the scenes goodies; of course the THANK YOU page listing the name of every backer; and guest pin-ups by Mike McKone, Tom Raney, Matt Clark and others to be announced. And a forward by Louise Simonson.\nIn 30+ years working in comics, besides various work on VALIANT books, Deadpool, Black Panther and the BAT-books, I've been lucky to have had extended runs on some great books with amazing writers. Peter David's AQUAMAN. Judd Winnick's EXILES. GOTHAM UNDERGROUND with Frank Tieri. RED LANTERNS with Charles Soule. SECRET SIX with Gail Simone. I love comics; it's all I've ever wanted to do since I can remember wanting to do something other than soil my diaper... though I guess that wasn't really a conscious decision. (I swear.) And all I want to do is just keep making comics. My own comics. It took over twenty years to get back to doing my own stuff, and I'm happier for it.\nI'm the not-so-cute one without the fur\nTHE VIDEO: Please check out the video, or if you have, I hope you got a chuckle out of it. It's amazing what a newb can do with iMovie; cool program. (For any Megalopolis fans, there is an \"easter egg\" from it in there too.) And here's some here's some serious bit I cut from the video to keep it shorter; and some outtakes:\nPLAY\n\nThe music in the main video up top is UNDERTAKER by Son of Dave, who was nice enough to say \"okay\" when I asked him if I could use it for this. His songs have been featured in the TV shows Breaking Bad and Preacher. You can check him out on Bandcamp, Spotify or Youtube. Really cool stuff. And the soundfx I layered in were royalty-free from Soundbible: Tasmanina Devil (Daniel Simon); Devil Dog Crazy, Child Scream Sound & Upper Cut (Mike Koenig).\nPlans are to print in the US, with the goal of printing minimum 5,000 copies. All backers will be listed in a THANK YOU page in the book; and each book will come with a custom NedLOP bookmark and postcard inside (just because I think they're fun). The $25 pledge level will get you the physical book; $35 (and all levels above) adds a Kickstarter exclusive full-color illustrated bookplate signed by me.\nSHIPPING- \nUSA- $10\nCanada- $15\nThe Rest of the World- $25\n About some of the premium levels:\n$85 - REMARK-- This is simply a b&w full head-sketch that's done on the inside front cover or first blank page of the book. Backer's choice of character. (People use the term \"remark\" different ways; this is how I mean it.) **Amount is limited**\n$195 - SKETCH TIME-- This is more of a con-style 9x12 sketch; it's the size I work at conventions when I'm sitting in Artist Alley. Single figure with a simple background. Below is an example of a 9x12 done recently. **Amount is limited**\n9x12 con-style commission done recently at a convention\n$375 - BIG-TIME SKETCH TIME-- This is a full 11x17 illustration, like a cover for print. Single figure with a simple background. Below is an example of an 11x17 done for a previous campaign. **Amount is limited**\n11x17 single figure done for a previous Kickstarter\n*NOTE*  If you'd like to do a bigger, more complex, (multi-character, detailed background, a jam-board laid out, etc), message me before pledging and we'll discuss it and come up with a pledge amount. Below are a couple examples of more complex commissions.\n11x17 multi-character commission with detailed background- $700\n11x17 single character with crazy-detailed background- $500\n SHIPPING- Note that there is an additional shipping charge for the commissions (not the REMARK of course; that is done in the book itself) as they are shipped separately:\nUSA- $20 addt'l\nCanada- $25 addt'l\nRest of the World- $35 addt'l\n Hardcover is always the big request by backers, so I hope we make it.\nA Kickstarter exclusive mini-print (all new image just for the print) ships with the book\n Just those for now; I don't like to jinx it. Concentrating right now on my first goals. If we do really well, I have some other more substantial ideas, like more story...\nHell... or in close proximity thereof\nThanks for checking out my project. It will only be done because of you, and it's impossible to say how much, funded or not, I appreciate everyone who supports this project.\nNED, Lord of the Pit and related characters \u2122 & \u00a9 James Calafiore", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my third Kickstarter. It's been a few years since the success of LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS with Gail Simone, and I've been itching to get back to creator-owned, especially something I created from scratch. But I did want to makes sure at least part of this project was in the can before the campaign, and about half the 130+ pages are done. And I'm continuing to work as the campaign runs. Just to be safe, as life has an annoying way of intervening, I'm allotting 4 months for completion of the book (including colors, lettering, production etc). Then I'm at the mercy of the printer's schedule, followed by shipping. Hopefully all of this will take no more than six months. Like I said, life can be very obstinate about the plans of mice & men, but I think this is a safe deadline.

He does what any heroic firefighter would do and goes in to save lives. Well, while searching for any sign of people still in the lab the building buries him  until he is later reborn and has to figure out how and why he is brought back.\nThis is issue 1 of a full blown trilogy which is already completely written! This Deluxe edition includes 25 pages of an action packed story that showcases multiple points of view from different characters all over Seer City. We plan on making larger issues in the future to get the story told at a better pace.  \nWhy I wrote this story.\n My uncle is a retired firefighter, he was literally the first person from my life that I added to this story. Firefighters risk their lives for others DAILY. He made it through years saving others and doing that it comes with a price mentally and physically. Though we don't dive deep into that aspect we do dive into what it means being a hero and the consequences that comes with being a hero. On top of all of that this is part of a 1200 page trilogy I wrote and I'd like it told! Also, it might be bias, but the story is pretty freaking bad ass! \n FIRST FIVE PAGES BELOW! \n 5 MORE PAGES!!!!!!!!!\nRewards!\nThe Seer Chronicles Deluxe Edition Physical/Digital.\nOur Variant Cover by Todd Rayner\nSigned Copy of The Seer Chronicles Deluxe Edition.\nSocial Media Shoutout!

Below are a couple of pages from the solo series! INK is about a talented tattoo artist by the name Shane Murphy. He is visited by a mysterious character a day after his win at the Tattoo Convention and the visitor brings Shane a key to a whole new life. You're now saying to yourself, \"A key?! What the hell are you talking about?!\" Let us learn ya something.\nThe visitor is more than a mysterious character he is actually the current holder of the key to the gates that separate Earth Realm from a dark nether like world known as The Noctem Realm! This realm comes into play not only in INK but later on in The Seer Chronicles and other comics we are looking to pump out! When the visitor arrives at the tattoo shop he gives his power to Shane and becomes the new gatekeeper and is called INK as the key is a tattoo that is magically inserted into his forearm. Once the old owner releases the key's powers they die. Shane now must battle with the decision of dying and leaving his beloved girlfriend of 5 years or accepting the duties that come with being the gatekeeper.\nCheck out two pages below!\nUNLOCKED!\n2nd Stretch Goal Unlocked!\n3RD STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED\n\n HALLOWEEN REWARD!

In celebration, and as a thank you for backing and believing this project, we've created two stretch goals:\n$8,000: Consent stickers. If we surpass this amount of funding, every backer who is already getting physical rewards in the mail will also receive some Dr. Faith-y stickers about the important meanings of the words yes and no.\n$12,000: Consent zine! At this level of funding, each backer who is already receiving a physical reward in the mail will also receive Dr. Faith's to-be-released zine Unf*ck Your Consent.\nAbout this project\nDr. Faith's newest book is all about boundaries and consent. \nKickstarter's challenge to \"break\" their system by using it in an unexpected way inspired us to make our boundaries more flexible, specifically around the price of the book. \ntl;dr: We're offering a sliding scale of $10-20 for Unf*ck Your Boundaries and a workbook that goes with it!\nAbout the book\nAt its core, this book is about unf*ckening our interactions with others. It contains these parts, and will leave you with some seriously badass skills at holding your own boundaries and understanding and respecting others'.\nWhat are boundaries? What is consent? Why are these things important? What are they not?\nHow do our boundaries get f*cked up? This section covers some heavy background, from family to culture, with a whole lot of gender thrown into the mix, because, you know, #metoo.\nWhat do boundary violations look like in practice? Learn to recognize them like a champ. Also learn to spot patterns of extreme, controlling boundary busting.\nUnf*ck your boundaries! The second half of the book contains much excellent information for understanding and communicating your own boundaries, troubleshooting, holding yourself and others accountable, and building a life where your boundaries aren't too strict or too soft, but can be just right for you.  \nUnf*ck Your Boundaries by Faith G. Harper, PhD, LPC-S, ACS, ACN is a 128 page, 5x7 inch paperback book, illustrated by Trista Vercher and printed in Illinois.\nAnd there's a workbook! Real therapist exercises to fill out as you explore how to become a champion communicator and respecter of boundaries.  \nAbout the rewards\nThe sliding scale price!\nThe basic reward for this project has two parts: Unf*ck Your Boundaries and its accompanying workbook. The cover price is $9.95 for the paperback + $4.95 for the workbook zine, so the regular price for both would be $14.90. \nWe are offering these books on a sliding scale, and invite you to pay anywhere from $10 to $20. The calculation of what you are able to pay, as well as what the books are worth for you, is totally up to you.  \nWe have long offered sliding scale on our own website as a way to make our books accessible to a wide range of readers. The lowest end covers our costs and still allows us to pay the author a royalty. The higher end essentially subsidizes the lower end. We've found that when people are offered a sliding scale and pay what works best for them, we typically end up earning an average that is very close to the actual cover price.

The books we love best are the ones, like Unf*ck Your Boundaries, that we wish we'd been able to read back when we first started. We are scrappy, rapidly growing, worker-owned, and based in Portland, Oregon.\nThank you for supporting independent publishing!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're very good at producing books that look and read great, and at sending them to you relatively on time.

Your family, friends, and your magical powers are gone. You awaken to a familiar but different world. You don't know why this is happening. The only thing you know is that the monsters of New Orleans are involved. \nFollow our hero, Jonas, as he battles these monsters to regain the life and powers he once had. But the things he will have to do may turn him into the same monster he is out to destroy.   \nThis Kickstarter campaign is to fund the printing of issue #2. But don't worry, you can also pick up issue #1 in this campaign!\nThere will be 28 pages of amazing black and white art and story with quality gloss paper that will make the artwork pop. Here's a look at the regular and variant cover of issue #2.\nRegular Cover (left) / Variant Cover (right)\n Gian Carlo Bernal is an artist and lives in the Philippines with his son and wife. In 2014 after 11 years as a graphic designer he left his job to become a comic book illustrator. He's never looked back. Gian has drawn for other Kickstarter comic book campaigns such as the Last Days of Kevin and Ronin. He's been quoted as saying \"And now I am happy to be working on Crescent City Monsters. I will draw until I die, my body rot and I will come back as a zombie and draw comics again.\"  \n Newton Lilavois is a Haitian-American who lives in New York City with his wife and daughters. By day he's a computer programmer. When he's not writing code, he's writing stories. \nAs an eleven years old boy, Newton used to draw comics and sell them to classmates. As an adult Newton decided to fulfill his dream of creating comic books and Crescent City Monsters was born.\n WHY DID I CREATE THIS STORY?\nAs a Haitian-American I wanted to introduce the rich Haitian Voodoo lore to comic books readers through more authentic lens. Mix that with my love for dark gritty stories and the urge to create a zombie story, and you have the delicious gumbo called Crescent City Monsters.\nWHAT ARE OUR FANS SAYING:\n\"Newton Lilavois\u2019s story keeps you hooked and eager to see its direction. With an amazing ending that leaves you wondering and wanting more. He has done an amazing job on mood, character personalities and over all story that never loses interest. Gian Carlo Bernal\u2019s cover had me hooked at first sight. His detail and style is in a class of its own for me. As soon as you see it, you want to open the comic. And yes, the inside is as detailed as the cover. These two amazing guys are a hard hitting tag team destined for delivering great books.\" - Tell Diam\n\"I love horror as a genre and I definitely think there should be more horror comics out there. I walk into a comic book store and there\u2019s a tiny horror section if there is any. I also love the historical period setting crescent city monster is placed in. I definitely want to see where the story will go!\" - Leona Kumagai\n\"Take it from a guy who has been reading comics for 50 years - this is one of the very BEST! Amazing art, stylish prose and an exciting, fascinating plot. The best thing I've read in decades!\" - Vic Casados\n\"Absolutely loved this amazing story and unique artwork!! Definitely look forward to the next chapter in this masterpiece from the dream fury crew.\" - Chris Mason\n\nWe're accepting pictures of fans holding their copy of Crescent City Monsters as the campaign continues. Feel free to submit yours. We want this collage to be full as possible.\n\n\n WHY KICKSTARTER?\nKickstarter is great for independent creators like myself who need access to funds and want to find an audience for their awesome projects. In 2018, when my first Kickstarter project was successfully funded, I was introduced to over 200 amazing new fans. \nI've been a Kickstarter backer since 2013 and I love the platform. I've backed over 150 projects.  So, besides using the platform for my own creative endeavors, I believe in the idea of supporting other creators via crowdfunding on Kickstarter. \nWHAT WILL THE FUNDS BE USED FOR?\nExcept for a few last minute text changes, issue two is complete. The artwork, lettering, and design is all paid for so the funds will be used for printing issue two. \n\nCHECK OUT A FEW PAGES\nArtwork by Gian Carlo Bernal\nArtwork by Gian Carlo Bernal\nArtwork by Gian Carlo Bernal\nArtwork by Gian Carlo Bernal\nArtwork by Gian Carlo Bernal\nCheck out were it all starts!

This is my second Kickstarter and I'm familiar with the printing and shipping process so I believe my schedule is well thought out, Except for a few more minor editorial changes the comic book is done so backers will only be waiting for the printers and myself to ship the books out. I've taken steps like making sure the printer is shipping from within the United States to make sure slight delays will not throw us totally off schedule. I've also buffered some time in the delivery date for some unforeseen circumstances. I acknowledge that even with all that said there could be something beyond my control or the printer's control that could cause a delay in fulfillment.

I could use your help to bring these two great publications to press!\nKenttucky Pussy by Sexton Ming and J.T. Dockery\n                A project 15 years in the making, Kenttucky Pussy is a comic book that combines the talents of noted rock n roll bohemes Sexton Ming and J.T. Dockery.  Originally conceived in 2004 as an illustrated poetry book to be published on JT\u2019s Hanging Dog Productions imprint, \"Kenttucky Pussy\" is a classic DIY guts and bones effort: the guts provided by Sexton Ming\u2019s inimitable poetry, hung on a skeletal system of JT Dockery\u2019s equally inimitable graphic narration.  (You thinking \"Fifteen years is a long time. Why did it take so long for this book to happen?\"  As you might expect, it's a story unto itself, which we'll relate in JT's words in a future update!)  \nYou might also be asking :Who is Sexton Ming and why should you buy a comic with an off-color title based on his poetry?\"   Die-hard 90s garage punk fans will know most of this, but for the uninitiated:\n              Sexton Ming, along with Billy Childish, and others such as Tracey Emin, founded the Medway Poets in 1979.  Ming continued on writing, performing, making art & music, etc. from then to today, publishing books, putting out records & exhibiting paintings. He was a staple of the stable of artists releasing works on Billy Childish's Hangman imprint throughout the 1980s and otherwise beyond, proving himself to be one of the leaders of post punk garage rock revivalism & expressionism/surrealism by any means/forms necessary all the way back when post punk garage rock revivalism & expressionism by any means/forms necessary wasn't cool.\n\"Kenttucky Pussy\nYou came out of your Mother's womb. \nHer placenta she ate\nYou were the runt\nOh Kentuckykitten\nYou are tough but\nA bit on the bendy side.\nOh Kentucky Pussy.\nSmell the mouse.\"\nKenttucky Pussy will be 32 page plus cover black and white comic book with a projected run of only 200 copies. (It's like... limited... man...!) \nArtist (Dockery) and Author (Ming) circa 2000\nSketchbook Picture Sleeves: Volume 1 2016-2019\n              Since 2016, Nix Comics publisher, writer and artist Ken Eppstein* has been selling 7\u201d records with hand drawn picture sleeves taken from his sketchbook.   It started as both a fun way to dust off his dormant artistic skills and as a way to raise some money for publishing Nix Comics titles by adding some value to the huge pile of 7\u201ds without picture sleeves that always seems to spontaneously generate in Ken's living room.  It became an ongoing art project.  This book will contain the first 120 picture sleeves drawn in that time, each one with a unique spin on the song title or artist\u2019s persona.  \n*That\u2019s me writing in the third person\u2026 Cuz parallel structure makes for some weird shit when you\u2019re both a publisher and artist.\nThis sketchbook will be 7\"x7\", 128 pages (color) and features an intro by Nix Comics contributor and fan favorite, Darren Merinuk.   Excerpt here:\n\"These cartoons are following the trail blazed by garage/punk rock (and related genres) itself: simple, stoopid, irreverent and willing to go upside your head in pursuit of a laugh, and once in awhile to maybe make a thoughtful point as well. \"\nRewards:\nThe Basics:\nFor helping Nix Comics out with a $10 pledge you will receive a copy of \"Kenttucky Pussy\" \nFor a $15 pledge you will receive a copy of \"Sketchbook Picture Sleeves: Volume 1\" \nFor $20 you will receive both new books!\nLimited Extras!\n NEW!

No photoshopped in corners or borders. No spelling corrections. No apologies!  What you see is what you get. (Obviously what you're paying for is the artwork more than the record.) Most of the records aren't particularly collectible, but are fun/cool and in pretty good shape. That said, I'm willing to answer any questions posed to me about the records. Just message me!\n Allen Toussaint: Country John:  (with a guest appearance by Dee Dee Ramone!) This one goes out to all the artists who complain about how hard it is to draw horses, and I ASSume (Har!) mules...  The secret is to only draw half a horse and cover up the remaining hard parts with an Amish dude..\n Alvin Cash & The Crawlers:  A really cool R&B dance tune on the late great Andre Williams record label.  The flip side is the equally cool instro Twine Time, co-written by Williams \nBobby Freeman: C'mon And Swim: While I'll be the first to admit not being a Spielberg expert, I've never seen it mentioned anywhere that the famous poster art for Jaws was clearly a riff on the scene where Julie Adams is swimming in the Black Lagoon as the Creature peers upwards at her.  Anyways, pairing Freeman's happy dance 60s craze tune with classic horror is kinda what Nix Comics is all about!\nCarl Perkins: Shine Shine Shine:  Making a liar out of myself already, this one is pretty much a straight riff on the album photo for \"Country Boy's Dream\" on Dollie Records.  You should check out that stuff if you are hungry for good hard to find Carl Perkins stuff.  I think it holds up well when compared to his Sun Records material.\nThe Coasters: Yakety Yak:  I have a bad habit of drawing pictures of vomiting people/animals and wondering why they don't sell.  I mean... C'mon...  am I the only one who thinks a yak yakking is funny!?\n The Coyote Men: Monkey Glands:  This record was originally part of a double 7\" set, but I lost the other one somewheres.  Anyways, around 100 years ago there was a trend for men to get monkey glands sewn into their own nuts to promote virility...  Which somehow reminds me of the overly macho dudes making noise in comics these days.  No thank you! also, an uncommon self portrait.\nThe Creations: I'm Mad:  A great Norton Records EP that was almost lost when Hurricane Sandy demolished that great label's warehouse. (I bought a ton of \"Sandy Survivors\" There are a lot of those in the book and available as rewards)  The art is a tribute to Mad's Don Martin, natch!\n Bobby \"Boris\" Pickett  & The Cryptkicker 5: Monster Mash:  Every October I look forward to hearing this song at random places, like in the kitchen utensil section of Target or some such. \n Danny Zell & The Zell Rocks:  Youngster Meets The Monster:  This sandy survivor reminds me of staying up late at night with my little B&W TV in my bedroom watching late night horror movies which sometimes scared the snot outta me! (Dirty clothes pushed up against the gap at the bottom of the door to prevent light leaking out and alerting my mom!)\n Dwight Twilley: Nothing's Ever Going to Change So Fast:  He's gonna change clothes fast cuz he's been caught in bed with that gunsel's girl... Get it!?  OK, kind of a stretch.  The non-Twilley characters are inspired by Anya Davidson's great 70s-set crime graphic novel \"Lovers In The Garden\"\n The Egyptians: Party Stomp:  I used this Sandy Survivor record to grapple with my fear of groups of children.  Is there a phobia for that?  Like I like some individual kids, but in groups of 3 or more I find them fuckin' terrifying.  More terrifying than clowns, for sure. \nEsquerita: Dew Drop Inn:  This sleeve features a portrait of Esquerita poking his head outta a window at the famous New Orleans night club, the Dew Drop Inn...  Which I thought was clever... but once I finished I found myself wondering if this Georgia resident meant a different more local to him Dew Drop!\n The Everly Brothers: Wake Up Little Susie:  So, Don and Phil were totally satanic cult leaders, right?  It makes sense to me...  and I WANT IN! \n The Fools: Psycho Chicken:  So, fair warning, this hilarious jab at the super serious Talking Heads isn't a great record.  I mean... yes the song is silly, but moreover this record plays with a lot of noise/fuzz.  Buy it for the Hitchcock spoof art instead!\nJackie Lee: The New Watusi:  I assume that this is the same Jackie Lee, whose hit was \"The Duck\" but these R&B dance tunes are more instrumental than vocals centered.  (I know... Who cares?  Just dance like you got your spacesuit on!)\nJean Knight: Let The Good Times Roll: I hope Jean Knight doesn't mind me hijacking her cover of an R&B classic for a somewhat dark political statement.  (For the record, I'm not advocating chopping anyone's head off, I just think that the folks in power should remember that, push come to shove, it's an option for those not in power.)  \n Jean Knight: Mr. Big Stuff:  By the way... Jean Knight is gorgeous!\n The Larks: The Jerk: An easy pun, not so easy to draw smoke letters.  Came out alright, though!  I did this one a few years ago and I'm a little surprised no one has bought it off me.\n Little Johnny and the Silvertones: Rock 'Til The End of Time: I've done a few superhero mash-ups for this project, and looking back at them now I'm a little surprised at how often I've reached into Legion of Superheroes catalog for inspiration.  (This is their foe the Time Trapper... Who lives at the end of time... Right?)\n MOTO: Skinny Head:  OK, I confess that I did this one because I saw so many people on-line talking about how much they love the character MODOK.  Those people apparently don't also love obscure garage punk bands....\n The Mystreated: There's No Escape:  Apparently there wasn't any spellcheck either....\n The Olympics: The Bounce:  Another Legion of Superheroes reference with Bouncing Boy.  Oddly, when looking through reference images on google for good ol' Chuck Taine here, I found one where the artist (Fan artist I hope) drew him super buff, broad shouldered and skinny at the waste... with a six pack no less!!!  He's the fat kids' superhero!  Don't try and take him from us!!!\n The Olympics: The Slop:  This sleeve combines my interpretation of the classic comic book monster \"The Heap\" with a take on the \"Latrine Monster\" stories told to me at summer camp by counselors who I am sure were tired of campers taking midnight pee runs.\n Patsy Cline: Strange:  I also used basically the same gag for a Sun Ra single.  (That one was more of a Ditko riff as opposed to this one that mimicks Patsy's Greatest Hits art)  I guess now that you are most of the way through looking at these it's OK to let it spill that I constantly reuse jokes.  If it was funny once, it will be funny forever, right?\n Rachel Sweet:  OK... Drawing the hibernation pods on the Nostromo, which are pretty much all white, and a xenomorph, which is pretty much all black, was hard...  But getting Rachel Sweet's sideways pony tail done while she is pictured laying down?  IMPOSSIBLE!\nRufus Thomas: Do the Double Bump: While doing these write ups, I realized that I have 5 pieces that imply some sort of romantic relationship between people and animals.  7 if you count the Creature and a Werewolf.  Just to be clear... These are jokes. I don't think it's cool to screw animals.\n Sam And Dave: Wrap It Up:  A recurring problem I have had to work around with these sleeves is that I use cheap markers and most of the browns available are too dark to use as skin tones without risking an unintentional and unwanted racist caricature.  I cured that problem by buying a variety of more expensive water based brown markers.  The problem cropped up again with this sleeve where I wanted a black granite casket.  Went gray instead!\nSam Cooke: Trouble Blues:  I had a few good puns lined up for this sleeve, but found myself overcome with sadness over Cooke's gone-too-soon life and did this fairly straight take instead.  I was kind of bummed that the corner tore when I pulled it from my sketchbook, but really it's kind of appropriate.\n\n The Spitballs: Telstar:  I guess until I did this piece of art, it never occurred to me that Telstar was the inspiration for the appearance of the Deathstar in Star wars.\nSue Saad and the Next: Gimme Love, Gimme Pain:  A promo single for an LP that that ended up in the buck bins of every record store in the country.  It's not that Sue Saad and the Next were bad, they just weren't good enough to merit an 80s sized press run of LPs.  Looked cool, though.\n Sweet: Fox on the Run:  OK, so this actually has two intended science fiction references:  The obvious X-Files one and the hand is supposed to be like the sucker tipped hand of the Martian in the 50s war of the World movie.  I believe!\n Sylvain Sylvain:  This split portrait of Sylvain is one of my favorites, using both how he looked when the single was released and in his New York Dolls persona.\nTammy Wynette: The Wonders You Perform:  My intent with this sleeve was to combine a couple jokes... George Jones as a giant monster and Tammy Wynette dressed up as a superhero steeped in paganism while singing a gospel song.  The real comedy ended up being me misspelling Wynette and botching the lettering on the song so bad that I had to do a tape-over.\n Tom Robinson Band: 2-4-6-8 Motorway:  OK, it's a dumb joke, but I had a lot of fun drawing the Count.  Have you ever noticed how weird and psychedelic the inside of his cape is???  Go look it up!\nTom Robinson Band: Another example of doing a straight take despite a zillion puns coming to mind.  I love the first two TRB albums on Harvest records...  They are my idea of well done political punk/new wave.\nTommy Roe: Dizzy: Do I get a little high using cheap markers to hang these pieces together?  Yeah, sometimes.  It doesn't stop me from doing spot-fuckin-on self potrait work and X-Men fan comics.... \nThe Vikings: Such A Love:  I don't know for sure whether or not Fran Tarkenton and Alan Page had a love affair, I just know that drawing heart shaped eyeballs inside of a football helmet was a lot harder than I thought it would be.  I ended up pasting some hearts on.\n The Who: Whiskey Man:  With all due respect to Pete Townshend and his song writing abilities, I think the best who songs in terms of being dark and brooding and all the while still funny were written by John Entwhistle.  (Also, yes... The superhero suit is Monkees inspired.)\n 12\" Art Rewards (Not in book!)\n\n\nYA MISSED IT!\n Tiny Pictures of All of the Sleeves In The Sketchbook", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere aren't a lot of risks involved in the production.

They've invented a time machine, one that projects moments in time onto the present. But when the machine malfunctions, the family home turns into a shifting death trap where the Roschlers' past regrets are put on display. Can they escape this death trap? Can they escape themselves?\nPage 1\nWho are we?\nKyle Lawrence -   is the script master for Crumple and has been working at the project for nearly three years. He's also the campaign manager. Kyle's comics have been featured in ComicBookHour's One Comic to Rule Them All, Back From the Depths' Hallowscream 2018 and Oneshi Press' Winter 2018 Anthology. \n Bo Christian - the colorist and is a former US Air Force Structural journeymen, which means he enlisted to be Bob the Builder instead of GI Joe. However he wasn\u2019t really good at that so he decided to become a comic book writer/artists (which, depending on who you ask, he\u2019s not very good at that either). He has been part of two anthologies; Oneshi Press\u2019s 2018 anthology and Stache Comic\u2019s Everafterward a reddit community based anthology. \n Mac Radwanski (Artist) is a comic book artist. As a kid, he dreamed about being Batman, or drawing comic books for a living. The latter part worked out. He published such books as \"Doc Dino\", \"Runners\", \"The Face and the Hand\". When not drawing, he likes to play my guitar, or relax with some video games.\" \nWhat are we making?\nYour pledges go toward the creation of Crumple #1, the first in a three part comic book mini-series about a malfunctioning time machine and the poisonous power of regret. Luckily, the first 8 pages are already finished and are available to read right here!\n\n\nPage 2\n The Idea\nCrumple was born out of a nightmare, of a loved one becoming trapped inside a wall and suffocating. From there the idea was given form on scripted pages and tempered through writes, rewrites and critiques into its current form brought to life by artist and colorist Mac Radwanski and Bo Christian.\nPage 3\n Timeline\nOnce the project is funded, it should take approximately two months for our artists to work their magic. Then the pages go to the printer, and then comes the work of shipping everything out. We plan to have everything arrive during October, a perfectly spooky month for a horror comic.\nPage 4\n Budget\nPayment for art and lettering: $1200\nPrinting: $1500\nShipping costs: $1.75 to ship each comic + 50 cents for each envelope) x 500 copies printed = $1,125 \nBusiness cards: $10 for 250 \nTotal: $3,835\nPage 5\n What this means to me \nI came up with the concept for Crumple about 3 years ago and have spent that time doing rewrites and rewrites, gathering talented people to bring the project to life. To me Crumple is a beginning. A future career in comics where I continue to connect with people through stories is possible with just this one project coming to fruition.

On the left side of the road there is the anger that we don\u2019t allow ourselves to feel and express (which makes us sick and ruins our relationships) and on the other side we have anger that is over-expressed (which makes us sick and ruins our relationships). If you have veered off onto one side, you want to course correct back to the middle, not overcorrect to the other side.\nAren't we all pissed off about something right now? We're not wrong to be. But how do we use that anger to change the world instead of letting it poison our own lives?\nAbout the book\nUnf*ck Your Anger: Using Science to Understand Frustration, Rage, and Forgiveness by Dr. Faith G. Harper, PhD, LPC-S, ACS, ACN is a 5x7 inch, 128-page paperback book, illustrated by Trista Vercher.\nThis is Dr. Faith's ninth book! In it, she uses her trademark combination of science and swearing to shine a light on this much-felt but little-discussed emotion. She tackles topics like:\nAnger's evolutionary function and why we need it even though we often get carried away with it\nThe human brain's nine rage triggers and how to figure out your main ones\nThe close relationships between anger and depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety, trauma, and self-harm\nTons of tools and exercises for managing your anger in healthier ways\nSteps for using your anger to create social change\nA new 5-stage model for practicing forgiveness\nA little about the origins of this book: It started out as a 32-page zine (if you don't know what that is, it's pronounced \"zeen\" and is like a stapled pamphlet but cooler) called This is Your Brain on Anger, which evolved into becoming one of the chapters in Unf*ck Your Brain. We've been steadily reworking and expanding those chapters into full-fledged books in their own right, in order of popularity\u2014starting with anxiety and depression, and now it's anger's turn. (If that doesn't give you a snapshot of our national psyche, I don't know what does.) The book will be over 4 times as long as the zine/chapter and completely rewritten \u2014 it contains a few of the same big ideas but is it's own entirely new thing. \nA spread from the book, showing an illustration of a brain throwing unhealthy anger in the trash, with a framed \"healthy anger\" poster on the wall, and the text \"Much better!\"\nA spread from the book's chapter on using your anger for social action, showing an illustration of brains participating in a march, holding a sign that says \"enough is enough\"\nA spread from the chapter on forgiveness, showing two brains hugging it out.\nAbout the author\nThe author poses with one of the classic focal points of anger discussed in her book.\nDr. Faith Harper is a trauma-informed therapist with a PhD and a growing number of other degrees and certifications. She is the author of eight books including the bestselling Unf*ck Your Brain. She lives in San Antonio, Texas where she has a private practice, trains other clinicians, and writes prolifically. She proudly identifies as a woman of color and an uppity intersectional feminist.\nAbout the publisher\nThe day we got 11 pallets of books delivered to our building.\nWe are Microcosm! Since 1996, we've been publishing and distributing books and zines chosen to put your power in your hands. Today we are independently distributed and don't sell directly to Amazon. We have 13 workers, over 400 books in print and over 10,000 titles in our distribution, an office and storefront in Portland, Oregon, and a whole lot of ideas, energy, and heart. Every day, we take our anger at structural inequities (and the ways the publishing industry upholds them) and work to channel it into building something better. \nAbout the rewards\nWe have a lot of Dr. Faith books here, plus many great books by other authors that we have the pleasure of publishing. Enjoy!\nThe workbook \u2014 at only $5, this is definitely not the main event. It can stand alone... kind of. But trust us, the $10 book is where it's at. You can add extra workbooks to any reward level for $5 a pop.\nUnf*ck Your Anger \u2014 This is the book itself! You're gonna love it!\nThe ebook \u2014 comes out a bit later, in January, 2020. Why? Piracy. Which leads us to...\nPiracy Forgiveness \u2014 This reward level is a grant of general amnesty for any past piracy. You'll get a copy of the ebook, put a little money towards any Dr. Faith ebooks you've downloaded without paying for in the past, and hopefully walk away feeling a little lighter, free-er, and less likely to avail yourself of unauthorized free digital downloads in the future. \nUnf*ck Your Day-to-Day\nNot sure what's up with you, but know your brain is jacked and want some basic, baseline help?

If it's you, read all about them:\nUnf*ck Your Anger\n This is Your Brain on Anxiety \u2014 A small but potently helpful Dr. Faith manual on the care and healing of an anxious brain\n This is Your Brain on Depression \u2014 Dr. Faith walks you through the science of depression and what you can do about it\n This is Your Brain on PTSD \u2014 Derived from the Unf*ck Your Brain book, this zine takes a deeper dive into the many faces of post-traumatic stress disorder\nI Love Workbooks\nIt kinda took us by surprise, but it turns out that a lot of you really, really love workbooks.

This book brings together the entire gritty ordeal, from the discovery of Black Jack's body to the bullet-ridden final showdown. \nThe comic began life in 2006. Having just graduated from art school in Cincinnati, Brian found himself out west in San Diego. By day he worked at a camera shop, and by night, he wrote and drew the adventures of Scar. Originally conceived as an ongoing series, 10 years later and back in Columbus, Ohio Brian inked the last panel of the 13th and final issue of his crime drama comic. Now we bring all 13 issues together for Ruffians for your bookshelf, so you can read the entire saga of Scar's pursuit for justice. \nWhat people have said:\n\"Ruffians is the kind of book that has the potential to appeal to everyone from superhero-obsessed fan folk to jaded indie fans, from \u201ccute critter\u201d enthusiasts to teenagers who shop at Hot Topic.\" - Popmatters.com\n\"...you can't for the life of you stop reading it!\" - Small Press Newsroom\n\"To say that Ruffians is a fun read is to demean it and over-simplify the concept of the series.\" - ThePullBox.com\n\"I absolutely loved this comic.\" - TeamHellions.com\n\"...ambitious, intriguing, smart, and features impressive art, crisp dialogue, solid characterization, and expert story construction.\" - FourColorApocalyspe.com\n\"...really entertaining and has a little of everything from violence, witty dialogue and characters that feel unique and relatable.\" - ComicBastards.com \n\n\n\nLast Call\nOriginally conceived in 2012 as a means to draw more attention to the site, The Daily Shot was a single panel comic posted every day on the Drunken Cat Comics homepage. Over the years, the format and posting regularity would change until the site eventually relaunched in 2015 with a regular multi-panel comic format. \nLast Call is the sequel to 2014's critically-acclaimed collection, Never Stop Drinking. It will collect the remaining unpublished comics from the site's original posting cycle, as well as some new strips, into one book. \nThis book will also include the out-of-print mini comic, The Life and Death of Mr. Burger, a comic that dares to ask the question \"what happens when a good burger goes bad?\" and caused one reviewer to state, \"I didn't like the potty jokes or prison rape jokes or setting cats on fire. But I did like when the burger tied a girl on the train tracks while dressed as an old-timey villain.\"\n\n\nDevil's Milk\nFinally, Devil's Milk continues Brian's series about adulthood and all the fun and frustration that comes with it. \nWe last left our hero with the birth of his newborn daughter, Izzy, and this book will pick up where The Big Year (our last successful Kickstarter) left off.  Brian's first two award winning auto-bio comics received rave reviews and this book will continue the story of his life as a parent, father and comic creator in Ohio.\n\nComics in this book will include tales about:\nbirth\nliving with a newborn\ncrying\nthe joys of sleep deprivation\nraising children\ncoffee \npooping and dirty diapers  \nliving with cats\nthe joys of communication\ngardening\nMother\u2019s Day\nthe discovery of hands\nrolling over\ntacos\nfirst steps\nand all the other things that make life worth living\n\nWhat people have said about Fear of Flying and The Big Year:\n\"Fear of Flying needs to be put next to Blankets on the graphic novel shelf.  Its a beautiful open examination of what we all feel and a much needed positive note at the end to help other believers carry on.\" - TeamHellions.com\n\"I laughed, I cried, I felt the feels... The beautiful life experiences he illustrates, from the mundane to the miraculous made me a little more hopeful about the future and my place in it.\" - EvetteMakesThings.com\n\"Canini, to his credit, manages to pinpoint and accentuate the joys and quiet triumphs of everyday life in a manner that feels unforced and maybe even a bit charming.\" - FourColorApocalyse.com ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHonestly, there aren\u2019t any.

I made the decision to bring the series to this platform for two reasons: to allow readers to pre-order the book before it goes to conventions, and to make it easy for me to reach my readers across the country, as I can't travel as far as I'd like to for conventions. Plain and simple. All funds from this campaign will go towards production of the second issue, and printing the first issue. \nArtwork from Issue #1\nPage 1, art by Stan Yak\nPage 1, colors by Robert Nugent\nPage 2, art by Stan Yak\nPage 2, colors by Robert Nugent\nPage 3, art by Stan Yak\nPage 4, art by Stan Yak\nAbout the Team\nWriter and creator, Stefani Manard\nI am a writer.

Vagabond was created in 2015 with the intention of providing a welcoming platform for comics creators of a variety of backgrounds and skill levels to share their work, and since then we have grown into lively community of contributors, collaborators, and supporters both locally and internationally.\nKindred cover by Stephanie Haught\nSince Vagabond's inception, we have released 9 issues featuring over 40 artists and writers, with the number of contributors growing with each issue. With \"Kindred\", our 10th issue, we wanted to celebrate the sense of community and family that has come to define us. We asked contributors to reflect on what family means to them, and the result is 17 comics from both new and returning contributors spanning a diverse range of both styles and subject matter. \nThe contributors for this issue include: Kate Atherton, Duncan Barton, Sequoia Bostick, Brienne Broyles, Vanessa Cardinali, Julia Coffin, Allison Gajewski, Brian Gleine, Cassandra Harner, Clare Kolat, Thomas Masaveg, Kristin Ousley, Ashley Ribblett, Mike Rickaby, Alyssa Alarcon Santo, Rachel Smith, Dan Rafter, Lucy Rose Till-Campbell, David Waldman, \ncover by Stephanie Haught\nBelow are examples from some of the comics that will be included in this issue:\nExcerpt from December by Lucy Rose Till-Campbell\nExcerpt from Super Wrestle Battle by Duncan Barton\nExcerpt from The Minotaur Makes a Friend by Dan Rafter, Vanessa Cardinali, & Mike Rickaby\nExcerpt from Looking Forward to It by Sequoia Bostick\nExcerpt from Blood by Cassandra Harner\nExcerpt from Weekend with Dad by Ashley Ribblett\nWe typically fund everything out of our own pockets and with earnings from shows, but with the higher costs that come with color printing, we need your help. We are asking for $3,500, most of which will go directly towards printing the books, and the remainder being set aside to cover shipping, Kickstarter fees, and the creation of rewards. \nAll backers that pledge $5 or more will receive a PDF version of Kindred.\n$12 will get you a physical copy of the book, along with the PDF version.\nFor $20 we have a merch package that includes a digital and physical copy of the book, along with an enamel pin, button pack, and a Trashcan Fire sticker. All backers who pledge $20 or more will also have their names featured in a thank-you section in the back of the book.\nMerch Package\nExclusively for this campaign, we will be offering a variant cover version of Kindred featuring art by our pal and guest artist, Heather Mahler. There will be a limited number of these available in a $20 tier that also includes an enamel pin, button pack, and Trashcan Fire sticker.\nVariant cover feat. art by Heather Mahler\nWe have two $30 options available, both including rewards specifically created for this campaign.\nThe first includes a screen-printed tote bag with art by longtime Vagabond contributor Clare Kolat, featuring characters from her comic \"Let's Go!\" created for Kindred.\nTote bag feat. illustration by Clare Kolat\nThe second includes an embroidered \"Vagabuds\" beanie, designed by Vagabond co-creator Amalia DeGirolamo.\nVagabuds Kickstarter exclusive beanie\nFor $80 you can get the Editors' Choice Package, which along with the book includes three of our favorite previous issues of Vagabond, everything included in the merch package, and a surprise merch item.\nEditors' Choice Rewards\n$100 gets you both physical and digital copies of a subscription to all books released in 2019, the vagabuds hat, the tote bag, the merch package, and a honorary Trashlord plaque.\nTrashlord Rewards", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll art and comics from contributors is created and in hand, meaning that content for the book is already guaranteed.

This year, I did it!\nUsually, someone on social media makes a prompt list of suggestions. And I'm sure they put a lot of thought into that list...\nI ignored them. Because I wanted to draw gods and spirits.\nHi, I'm Kelci Crawford, and this is a relaunch of Gods & Spirits: A Sketchbook on KickStarter!\nWhy a relaunch? Because the first time around, the goal was a bit too high and the timeline too short. The demand for the book was there \u2013 there just needed to be some adjustments.\nWhat's this campaign for? Well I'm looking to put these Gods and Spirits into a sketchbook to sell to backers and convention goers alike.\nNow don't worry - these gods and spirits already agreed to get drawn, so I don't have to wrestle them into a book.\nHere's the breakdown of what's needed:\n$150 for an ISBN and Barcode\n$95 for printing 20 books\n$130 for shipping to backers\n$140 for miscellaneous or emergency (this goes to KickStarter\u2019s use fee, international shipping, ink cartridges, and/or art supplies used to make commissions)\nRewards include early-bird specials, commissions, and even copies of the previous Inktober book, Witches: A Sketchbook.\nThere are also prints available:\n(Left: \"The Forest Spirit.\" Right: \"Buffalo God\" limited edition. Both 11x17 inches)\nPlus there's a new reward that wasn't in the last campaign: an original 11x17 inch piece of art that comes framed. It's called, \"The Horned God,\" and was the basis for some convention merchandise that's now out of print:\nSTRETCH GOALS:\nIn the initial run of this campaign, stickers were part of the reward structure. This has been changed so stickers are now a stretch goal.\nIf we make it to our initial goal, extra funding will go towards printing THESE stickers through StickerMule:\nIn the previous launch, I mentioned that if you were a U.S. citizen and you voted in the midterm elections, you would get a bonus reward in your backer package. I still plan to honor this commitment, so if you voted, send your \"I voted\" selfie to kelci@kelcidcrawford.com.\nAs always, Patrons who support me on Patreon will get extras in their packages when they also back this campaign.\nThis campaign is going to be short, so if you have the means to give, please do so!\nIf you\u2019re broke, please share this campaign with your friends! Every share helps more than you know.\nThank you very much for checking out this campaign!\nYou. Are. Awesome.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a relaunch of a campaign that ran last week - if the goal is not met this second time, I'll consider the project dead and move on to the next one.\n\nThat said, if we do meet our goal, awesome!\n\nI've had six successful campaigns before this one, so by now I know what to expect and how quickly to deliver things. But as long as backers reply to their surveys ASAP, their rewards will be sent out sooner - the goal is to get 99% of all rewards sent out before the holidays.\n\nIf we reach our goal and then hit our stretch goal, stickers will happen.

STAY TUNED FOR RELAUNCH DATE**\nAh, Inktober, the artist challenge to make a new ink drawing everyday during the month of October. This year, I did it.\nUsually, someone on social media makes a prompt list of suggestions. And I'm sure they put a lot of thought into that list.\nI ignored them. Because I wanted to draw gods and spirits.\nHi, I'm Kelci Crawford, and this is my eighth project on KickStarter (and here's hoping this will be a success just like the previous campaigns)!\nWhat's this campaign for? Well I'm looking to put these Gods and Spirits into a sketchbook to sell to backers and convention goers alike.\nNow don't worry - these gods and spirits already agreed to get drawn, so I don't have to wrestle them into a book.\nHere's the breakdown of what's needed:\n$150 for an ISBN and Barcode\n$140 for printing 50 books\n$300 for printing stickers\n$300 for shipping to backers\n$155 for miscellaneous or emergency (this goes to KickStarter\u2019s use fee, international shipping, ink cartridges, or art supplies used to make commissions)\nIn exchange for your support, I\u2019m offering something new that I haven\u2019t done with campaigns before: STICKERS!\nThe following designs will become stickers printed through StickerMule:\nThese stickers will be roughly 4 inches high, so clear some space on your sticker surface of choice!\nOther offerings include early-bird specials, commissions, and even copies of the previous Inktober book, Witches: A Sketchbook.\nAlso included...POSTERS.\n(Left: \"The Forest Spirit.\" Right: \"I Am The Land.\")\nPatrons on Patreon will also get a bonus goody in their reward packages (along with their relevant patron rewards).\nAnd if you're a U.S. backer, and you VOTE this Tuesday, email me a picture of your \"I voted!\" sticker to kelcidcrawford@gmail.com and you'll also get a bonus item in your package. Awesome, right?\nThis campaign is going to be SUPER short, so if you have the means to give, please do so!\nIf you\u2019re broke, please share this campaign with your friends! Every share helps more than you know.\nThank you very much for checking out this campaign!\nYou. Are.

To make matters worse, political tensions are on the rise as the leaders of the world struggle to make sense of what has happened and to find answers for those of us left behind. \nAlongside a confused populace and rising political tensions, a new population has begun to rise from the very soil beneath our feet to replace the millions of people that have disappeared. \nEnter... The RAVAGER demon\nAs the political leaders of the world grasp at straws for answers, thousands are brutally killed and pursued by the plethora of demonic forces that have crawled their way up from the pits of Hell. Finally released from their confinements in the darkest corners of the abyss. \nAnd for those who are lucky enough to evade the initial wave of lesser demons released from the pit... we are only safe for a small window of time. After all, four legs are faster than two...\nEnter the Bloodhounds of Hell\n HELL HOUNDS are brutal creatures that never stray from the pursuit of their prey. Once a Hell Hound catches your sent, she holds it for life and you will always be on the run. They will never stop or give up chase. \nHell Hound\n In this grizzly landscape, we will follow the story of Lucas Callahan. A former U.S. Marshall who finds part time work in New Mexico as a private investigator. When the world is turned upside down, he will struggle to make it back home to his family in this new world where every new sunrise brings with it a new set of challenges and malicious threats to confront. \nYou can never really know... Who's who?\n With demons possessing and wearing our bodies like human meat suits one can never really be too sure who they are dealing with...\nHuman Meat suit\n The Bells of Hell has a host of characters to introduce right off the bat with Issue 1 of 3. A personal favorite of the creative team is known simply as... The Butcher. \nYou friendly neighborhood Butcher\n Formerly known as Bobby Mclair to the locals of Pinewood California, Bobby was the last one on the local Police radar when folks began to disappear from their small cozy town tucked away inside a quaint fishing village on the coast. \nBobby served on the neighborhood watch, was a retired veteran, and a member of the local youth church programs. On the surface he was an upright and outstanding citizen. \nHe often donated truckloads of meat to the local homeless shelters...\nFree of charge.\nLong Pig on the Menu...\n Bobby was eventually apprehended but released after serving five short years due to a technicality on the prosecuting attorneys behalf. Once released from Prison, it was more of the same. \nMarshall Callahan's five year old son would pay the price this time.\nLucas would be blamed by his wife for his lack of oversight and the disappearance of their child. After Marshall Callahan takes matters into his own hands the rampage of Bobby Mclair is finally brought to an absolute end...\nMarshall Callahan is forced to resign from the force after 7 years of loyal service and faces a divorce from his wife of ten plus years. \nThe only upshot? At least the butcher is dead and gone. \nBut in a world were evil is rising from the pits of Hell is it rational to believe that the life of Bobby Mclair has truly been ended? \nTime to play\nVARIANT COVERS: \nVariant #1 featuring our Arch Angel Michael\nVariant #2 featuring our Hell Hound\nVariant #3 featuring our REVENANT demon\n And our final variant is of course.... THE BUTCHER\nFinal Variant\n In conclusion, if your into dark horror stories, we may be the fit for you. Issue one is a part of a 3 story arc involving our retired U.S. Marshall Luke Callahan as he struggles to grasp a foothold on reality in a world that has been turned upside down, and infested with demonic forces of malicious intent... all the while wondering if their is a higher power at work or have we all just been forgotten and left behind to die? \nEarly concept art\n The first Issue is black & white inks completed by one artist. The story was conceived by a group of individuals more than a decade ago and is finally being brought to fruition through a concentrated effort and support through crowdfunding programs such as Kickstarter and the wonderful community that exists within it. \nWe are truly exited to bring this story to life all the while supporting our local ecosystems and wildlife across the globe. We will be working in conjunction with Print Ninja to publish this comic and the proceeds (after publication fees, mailing, and team fees) will go towards WWF and their wildlife conservation/anti-poaching efforts across this wonderful planet. Our wildlife is not unlimited and they need our help to ensure their future for many years to come. \nFor over 50 years WWF's mission has been to save and preserve our wildlife. It should be noted that between the years of 1970 and 2012 our wildlife has seen a decline of almost 60% due to numerous factors including illegal poaching, deforestation, climate change, and a host of other issues.

Don\u2019t bother leaving the lights on, for oftentimes the worst of what the world has to offer comes cloaked within the brightest shaft of sunlight. \nThough the terrors of formless darkness are infinite, there\u2019s a special horror out there held within each day. From the peculiar stranger behind you on a morning run, to your family beach vacation that refuses to end, these twelve tales will have you fleeing the light for the numbing embrace of night.\nImage from \"The Account Of Gavin McNabb\"\nIn between painting and creating graphic novels I often find myself drawn to writing short works of horror fiction. The twelve terrifying stories in Darker In The Sun are not your typical \"bump in the night\" type tales, oh no, their horror goes far beyond simple fears in the dark. They've been hidden away for far too long, they're hungry now, and it's time to let them out to play.\nThe Book!\nA selection of stories included in Darker In The Sun: Stories Of Daytime Horror: \n\u201cBeyond The Verge\u201d - A Marshal in 19th century Texas is charged with the territory\u2019s first census. Too bad the job isn\u2019t as easy as it seems. \n\u201cRepast\u201d - Two estranged men reunite after decades apart to remember a friend that died. So what if their memories of that fateful night don\u2019t quite match up? \n\u201cThe Account Of Gavin McNabb\u201d \u2013 The crew of the Polyphylax is restless and eager to leave the secluded atoll where they\u2019re moored. Tensions threaten to boil over while a Naturalist makes a terrifying discovery. \n\u201cCome Away, O Human Child!\u201d \u2013 A pacifistic father hunts an inhuman creature through the forest, convinced it kidnapped his beloved daughter. To what ends he does not know. \n\u201cMatchmaker\u201d \u2013 Tara just wanted a meditative bike ride on those beautiful old country roads. A simple question from a stranger sets her on a path toward pure evil. \nImage from \"Repast\"\nI have illustrated this book in a style I think you'll find befitting the sometimes rough, often brutal, and always dark nature of the stories. The twelve main illustrations in the book will also be printed in a small postcard set available in the \"Whispers In The Evening Heat\" tier and above. Send one a month to your mom and creep her out for a whole year.\nImage from \"Come Away, O Human Child!\"\nI'm asking for $2500 to cover the printing costs of a luscious limited edition, softcover run of Darker In The Sun, BUT I have all sorts of frills planned if we can hit funding early and push through my fantastic stretch goals.

I'm Jeffrey Scott, creator of NOTLD, and who just happens to be deathly afraid of scarecrows. Allow me to introduce you to my latest terrifying tale;\n                                       What the Comic's About!\n        Old Farmer Dan is gentle soul, content to tending his land, sipping on his moonshine, and living his last days in peace. But between the local hard partying teenagers and crazed, gun toting rednecks, poor Dan can't even get a good night's sleep, let alone the life of leisure he desires.\n     Fed up and pissed off, Dan decides to put the fear of god in these kids the way he knows best (besides toting his shotgun). Scarecrows dressed up as any teenager's greatest fear; an angry Father! \n      But when an actual group of angry father's die in a nearby fiery explosion, things begin to take a terrifying turn. For you see, those dead dad's ashes hold a strange and awesome power.....and led by the fearsome Pumpkin Face, Dan's Scarecrows begin to take on a life of their own.\n            Where Did The Idea Come From?\n    Previously me and Yakov Levi, whose comic Tales From The Whorehouse of Horror I've written for, were trying to think of a scarecrow based story for that publication. While we couldn't find a story that fit the tone of that particular series, I still loved the idea of killer scarecrows. \n       Scarecrows always scared me as a kid (and honestly, still a little now). Contorted limbs, beady black eyes, expressionless features; they're the stuff of nightmares. \n        Taking away the talkative types like Freddy Krueger, most of the great slasher villains have one thing in common; a mask that obscures their features, leaving blank terror where a face is not. Scarecrows don't even need a mask. Their face IS the mask!\n    We needed a reason for the scarecrows both to come alive, and have a desire to kill teenagers. The old slasher tropes of sex and trespassing felt a little tired, so I wanted to give it a spin. Who hate's teenage boys more than anyone else on Earth?\n      Angry Fathers, especially redneck angry fathers! One explosion later and  you've got four furious ghosts to possess four terrifying scarecrows. \n Finally, since the majority of the story is set on a farm, it made sense to make the protagonist a farmer. I've always loved the elderly nutty character in horror movies (think Crazy Ralph in Friday the 13th) and thought it would be a lot of fun to turn one into the hero. Hence, the creation of Old Farmer Dan. \n   The goal for this comic is tell a classic horror story in a new way. Horror is in a pretty good place right now, but there's still a glut of demonic possession, paranormal haunting, and torture movies crowding market. While I enjoy all these genres, they aren't the kind of stories I wanted to tell. Hopefully Night Of The Living Dads can deliver something different, in all its pumpkin headed, blood soaked burlap awesomeness.\n                       WHAT YOU GET\nThe most important part of any crowdfunding campaign is what you're going to get for you're money. I tried to price fairly here, while still charging enough to get the money to get this book made. \n$5-Digital Copy $5 will get you a digital copy of the book, sent upon completion in the summer of 2018. While the book's still currently being drawn, you can expect 22-25 pages of Scarecrow Slaughtering madness, delivered right to your email upon completion. \n$10- Print Copy Get a Print Copy of Night Of The Living Dads. Right now this is going to be a very small run, and this Kickstarter very well might be the only place you're going to pick up a physical copy of the book, at least for awhile. \n$15- Signed Copy And A Signed Poster For $15 I'll sign your book and toss in a signed poster of the cover. Fair warning-my handwriting's the kind that would kill a man if I were a pharmacist. \n$25- Variant Cover $25 will get you a limited edition signed variant cover edition of the comic, the normal signed comic, and a signed print. For comic completionists.\n$50-Cameo Get a cameo scene in the book. Ever wanted to see what inked immortality felt like? Now you can! Includes everything in lower perks as well.\n$30-$100-Advertise We're dedicating four pages of the book to advertising. $30 will get you a quarter of a page, $55 half a page and a $100 a full page. Includes everything but the cameo.\n                 Meet The Creators\n                         Jeffrey Scott-Author\n          While Night Of The Living Dad's is my first solo comic, I've been writing comics for about 2 years now. I've co-written 6 stories with the brilliant and twisted Yakov Levi over at whorrorcomix.com (huge nsfw warning). Despite some initial setbacks, we successfully funded and released a printed anthology of those stories last summer, Tales From The Whorehouse of Horror #1.\n      In addition, I'm also the founder of Head On A Stick Productions, with which i've produced such comics as The Circus of Reefer Madness and Slashermania, as well as such films as Don't Fuck In The Woods and Betsy. I'm publishing NOTLD! under Head On A Stick Productions as Well.\n    I've also been in horror journalism for a number of years, currently writing weekly articles over at horrorfuel.com and being named a 2017 horror journalist to watch by Horror Freak News.\n   Other than writing a bunch, I watch a lot of movies (especially 70's and 80's horror), read a lot of books (especially horror comics and true crime), and generally try and live as fun a life as I can. I hope that fun shines through in my comics. \n                                          Rick Hershey\nRick Hershey is an illustrator, graphic designer, writer, and tabletop game publisher. He has worked in the gaming industry for nearly 20 years providing work as a freelancer for a multitude of clients including Wizards of the Coast, Dreamworks Entertainment, Pinnacle Entertainment, Fantasy Flight Games, Steve Jackson Games and many more. Mr. Hershey currently owns and operates Fat Goblin Games.\nHis art really brings Night Of The Living Dads alive, and I couldn't have asked for a more talented or fitting artist to draw these pages.\n                                    Thanks For Checking Us Out!\nEven if you don't contribute to the campaign, thanks for taking the time to check us out.

They are fully prepared for shipping, delays, and other beasts that appear on the KickStarter horizon.\n\nFulfillment of orders will fall 99% on Kelci (as Christian gets the script ready for the end of Validation, and handles whatever responsibilities are demanded from her day job).\n\nKelci is also in the process of two comics-based commissions outside of Validation. At least one of these commissions should be done by the time the campaign ends its funding period (the 1-week campaign and the 2 weeks KickStarter takes to finalize charges). But Kelci has been freelancing for 5 years now, so they know how to juggle multiple things at once. Still, these outside commissions may cause some reward delivery delays. \n\nThis is also why one of the higher rewards include being drawn into Validation itself. Usually Kelci offers to do individual character sketch commissions, but they felt it would be better (on the time frame and on the comic) to offer being drawn into Validation instead.\n\nUpdates on fulfillment (or delays) will be posted a minimum of once a week on this campaign page, to keep backers in the loop.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THANK YOU!", "descp": "You'll get access to the KickStarter backer-only posts with future updates on this campaign.

No problem! You can pick up all the books here, including the KickStarter Exclusive Limited Numbered Variants! (while supplies last). Already own the previous books?

What happens when mankind is able to transcend their physical limitations? The natural becomes supernatural. Welcome...to the new enlightenment!\nStaunch Industries is the leader of technological advancements in energy, teleportation, and space travel, thereby becoming the prominent provider of Earth\u2019s consumer energy. The \"Ambition\u201d is their preeminent space station that resides in the most hostile environment known to man, the Sun\u2019s corona. Staunch Industries is also in the business of creating genetically engineered worker clones who possess a low-capacity for sentience. In an curious turn of events, Staunch Industries has inadvertently revealed themselves to be the subject of an outside force that has been, presumably, steering them towards a greater purpose.\nAzarus, a prototype of genetic engineering, is a splice between human and animal DNA. Per the organization's protocol, Azarus and other worker clones are created without sexual organs in order to keep them isolated from other clones and to ensure they stay focused on their work.\nCommander Rielle, one of the lead officers on the Ambition, was conceived naturally and destined to not receive the same social opportunities as her genetically engineered counterparts. Navigating between the true identity of her birth and adoptive parents, Rielle finds herself in the darker underbelly and larger social implications fostered by an enterprise like Staunch Industries.\nPage 16 Issue #3\nWho are the talented people that came together to make this epic Issue #3?

Art & music by J.R. Mounts\nFor every cloud...\nGetting old sucks. \nAngus Hort is an elderly, retired widower. He's just received word his brother has died, and he has never felt more alone. When an alien crash-lands into his barn, Angus befriends and nurses this wounded creature, finding a reason to live. However, monsters are coming, and it'll take all his experience and wisdom to save Dubuque, the world, and each other.\nJ.R. Mounts, weirdo\nA new kind of old story\nI'm J.R. Mounts, a storyteller. I've been an independent musician and comics creator for years. I'm best known for my parody comics series, Fried Pickle Noir which is best described as \"Sin City meets Veggie Tales.\"  I do others, of course, but that one is my meal ticket so to speak, as I'm often called \"The Pickle Guy,\" rather than by name. It's a living, lol. Since 2010, I have traveled around the U.S. at various conventions, promoting my creator-owned indie comics. What I draw, write, and create is all-original content. My stuff may harken back to things that sound familiar, but I'm hoping to put a fun spin on everything I do.\nAs a storyteller, I like to mess with convention, creating things people might not expect. Rather than writing & drawing about superheroes and beautiful people, I choose misfits and characters people can relate to and care about. I've done this before in both my \"Fried Pickle Noir\" and \"Scairy Tales\" comics. One of my best works was also a successful Kickstarter-funded project called STUCK IN MY HEAD, about a happily married man with such a crappy job that all he does is daydream about killing his co-workers. Funny, profane and profound.  It was a finalist for Best Graphic Novel at the Dragon Con Awards. Find out more about those works at my website: (www.scairytalesnoir.com)\nSilver Linings logo\nWith Silver Linings, my main characters are the elderly. I choose to emphasize the importance of respecting the elderly, who are often left to watching \"Matlock\" reruns and getting senior discounts. The elderly are rarely the subject of Hollywood movies or best-selling novels. In Silver Linings, we see that every old person has a story to tell and frequently have no one to tell it to.  My hope is to entertain, yet shed light on all the treasures of experience these old folks have to offer us. I guarantee, every one of them has a story or four that will amaze you. \nThis will be a matte cover paperback, approximately 75-80 page graphic novel, 8x10 in size, full color.\nUPDATE 1-31-18 STRETCH GOALS!\nStretch goal\nThe campaign has met it's goal minimum which guarantess every reward in the Kickstarter, which is the only shot right now to get a book. If the campaign reaches $3000 by February 16th, I'll create a collection of all the black & white sketch rewards in a printbook for every level that supported the book/cd set and higher. This 8.5x11 paperback can also be used as a coloring book if desired. The book will have however many pages I'm doing for all the black/white original sketch reward supporters so if I get 30 sketch supporters, it'll have 30 images, etc... Stretch goals are always tricky but since we have some time, anyone can spread the word or even upgrade if they wish to get their own original art sketch.\nUPDATE 1-29-18\nHere's some awesome interviews all about this new project:\n http://rsrgentertainment.com/random-sht-random-guy-episode-184-silver-linings-with-j-r-mounts/\n https://youtu.be/SI_8xfwWVAc\n(Back book cover) A game...alone\nThe Story\nIn Silver Linings, the main character, Angus Hort, is a lonely old man. Years ago he was a farmer, married to his wife Katie. Since her death, and now the recent news of his brother's passing, he feels that all life around him is slowly dying and whittling away into nothing. He and the few remaining old men live in single-room condos they call Widower's Row. Angus chooses to constantly visit the porch of his abandoned house on the dead farm land he refuses to sell. Just as Angus thinks he's done with life, something crashes into his barn: an alien.\nBut this is no oridnary alien like he's seen in the movies. This wounded and timid being communicates to Angus telepathically. Through mental telepathy, they can convey intentions, feelings and images, creating an instantaneous understanding of one another and a way to help each other survive. Soon, Angus and his new friend, whom he'll name \"Skip,\" for the way it walks, bond in a way Angus has never known before. This odd little being from the stars gives Angus what he's needed: a reason to live.\nHowever, space monsters with a deadly hunger threaten to destroy the world. Soon, it'll take the ingenuity of those old coots and all their experience to defend our very existence.\nIt's along the classic lines of storyteling in E.T. from Spielberg or Super 8 by Abrams, only with old people. I've had the honor of knowing some of the best \"geezers\" around in my life. I've had them as family members, friends, clients, and acquaintances, even pets. This story is my way of honoring them all.\nAs I get older, I feel I can relate to this story and wanted to express how alone we could feel without someone to grow old with. Even an alien.\nAngus Hort and his best alien pal, Skip (concept sketch)\n Sketches & Concepts\nAngus Hort and some of the geezers he knows\n  Hort Farm...the abandoned land where Angus's equally abandoned home sits. Empty since the day his wife died.\n  The geezer pals of ol' Angus Hort. Pictured are Duane, Claude, Silas and Bill.\n  The Broots, as in \"bad roots,\" as Skip explains. To Angus, they're brutes of the worst kind. Hence, the play on words.\n COLOR!\nThat's right, COLOR. Not only will this book be my first completely sequential art epic, this also marks the first time I've ever attempted to do an all-color project. Color scares me. Black and white is much easier for me to manipulate, since it leaves much to the imagination, whereas color is one-and-done as to explaining what you see. However, I really think Silver Linings calls for color to convey the emotion and weight of the story in a way I've never done. I've always said that if I wasn't scared, I wasn't trying my best. So, to stay true, I'm pushing my boundaries once again for what I think may be my best story yet. This one should have me scared outta my wits.\nI was inspired to try out watercolor specifically when I had the fortune to appear at Dragon Con and saw my neighbors, Carla Wyzgala, on one side, and Caleb King behind me. Not only were these two simply amazing talents at watercolor, they were just awesome people whom I'm honored to call my friends. Add my Copic markers and my fascination with the watercolors of Mike Mignola (Hellboy) and Bill Watterson (Calvin & Hobbes), and it was only a matter of time before I'd try to find my own color \"voice.\" Time will tell.\nSkip and the Broots, the species he's come from.\n  Watercolor test for possible interior page.\n   Crayon test for coloring Skip\n MUSIC!\nCd art for front/cover\nBut wait...there's MORE! This project comes with a full score of music, written by me, with orchestrations and performances by two of my best pals, Mike McQuade (piano) and Tom Mathes (percussion). All original music. Acoustic instrumentals that are the score to this poignant story. I love music and the way it affects film. No Spielberg movie would be the same without the melodies of John WIlliams. Here, I'm attempting to convey emotions and actions for each page without a single lyric. \nMy best music mates Mike McQuade (left) & Tom Mathes (right)\nHere's ROUGH basic garage guitar/drums demos of what to expect melodically. The actual tracks will have acoustic guitars, piano, fiddle and drums. \n\"Silver Linings\"--This is Angus Hort's theme and title theme of the story. It's a play on words from the classic expression that there's always a positive way to look at everything, such as \"every cloud has a silver lining.\"  This whole story is about the importance of appreciating the elderly. Grouchy Angus Hort learns this for himself as well, when an alien from space gives him a reason to live life to the fullest.\n  \"Pulling Yellow\"--This is Skip the alien's theme. This song captures Angus bonding with the alien he calls Skip, who communicates with him telepathically through feelings rather than words. These emotions create  back-and-forth mental images between Angus and Skip which convey what they want to say to one another in an instant. During this song, Angus teaches Skip how to weed the dying yellow leaves from the green, called \"pulling yellow.\" It's a metaphor of their friendship.\n   \"Eds the Feds\"--As in any coming-of-age alien story, there's a military faction out to capture Skip and to annihilate his species. They stand for Earth Defenders, nicknamed \"Eds the Feds.\" Funny names or not, these guys are not to be messed with.\n \"Sowing Seeds\"--This is a reprise and orchestral change of the \"Pulling Yellow\" theme. In this melody, I want readers to picture the simple joys and quaint lovliness of life in a small town. \nThere's a total of 14 songs planned. The soundtrack score will be constructed as if we were all playing in a barn or small bar area, and the only instruments lying around are guitar, piano, and drums. They'll convey a range of emotions without the use of anything electric...a real challenge for me!  \nRewards\nAs in any campaign, your support will not go unnoticed!

This story ran as a webcomic from October 2016 until January 2018, with 65 pages of full-color urban fantasy action, as Charlie & Clow team up with a demon and his witch lover on their butt-kicking romp.\nAnd now, The Case of the Wendigo is coming to print\u2026 if we meet our fundraising goal!\n\u201cHold it!\u201d You might be saying. \u201cWho the frick are you to ask for money for a book like this?\u201d\nI\u2019m Kelci Crawford, the creator of the Charlie & Clow adventures, including The Case of the Wendigo. I also created other projects and got them funded on KickStarter (here\u2019s the KickStarter pages for Seeing Him, Johnson & Sir, Thoughtful Dinosaur, Validation Buttons, and the latest project, Witches: The Sketchbook). So this isn\u2019t my first KickStarter rodeo, y\u2019all.\nWhat this campaign is aiming to do is raise funding for getting The Case of the Wendigo to print. This 70-page book will include fancy additions like:\nretouched and remastered comic pages \na showcase of how a page gets made, from script to final design \nbehind-the-scenes sketches \ncharacter biographies\nand other goodies!\nHere\u2019s what we\u2019re looking to get funding for. Brace yourself for numbers:\nat least 30 copies of the book \n$35 for set-up fee with the comic book printer \n$30 for shipping the books to me \n$150 for shipping the books to backers \n$50 for miscellaneous fees, expenses, and other things that might pop up.\n(You may have noticed that an ISBN and barcode were not included. That\u2019s because Witches: The Sketchbook raised enough money on its campaign to cover the cost of the ISBN/barcode for this campaign.)\nNow here's the stretch goal(s): My friend Chloe and I want to make a one-shot comic starring Claudia and Acrudon, the resident witch/demon couple of The Case of the Wendigo, and extra money raised in this campaign can help towards fairly compensating Chloe for her work during production of this short. (Here's a KickStarter update on our agreement)\nIf you can give, that\u2019s fantastic! If you\u2019re broke, please share this campaign with your urban fantasy-loving friends. Every share and every little bit helps.\nThank you for your support!\nYou. Are. Awesome.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs mentioned, this isn't my first KickStarter case. I know to expect the demons of Printing Errors, Shipping Costs, and Delayed Reward Fulfillment.\n\nThe first two demons can be easily slain. The third will take dedication on my part, especially since a good portion of these rewards are commission-based.\n\nThere is also the issue of remastering the comics pages. They won't be redrawn from top-to-bottom, but there are some that will require heavy doctoring. This will be worked on as the campaign is running, and if pages are still not finished, that will be announced when the campaign ends.\n\nAt any rate, any snag in operations will be posted in update form here on the KickStarter page, to keep backers in the know.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "THANK YOU", "descp": "Your name will get listed in the Thank You Section of the book.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "THE CASE OF THE PDF", "descp": "You get the $1 rewards and the PDF version of The Case of the Wendigo.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "CHARLIE & CLOW PDFs", "descp": "You get the $1 reward and the PDF versions of Charlie & Clow, Charlie & Clow: The Bonus Arc, and The Case of the Wendigo.

Final Hours Stretch Goal Surpassed!\nOnce the campaign is over, you can continue to support this project by clicking here. Thanks! \nYou got us to goal with time to spare and then zoomed right past it. If we make it to our stretch goal, I will make you a supercut of all the #CatsOfSelfishLife. A SuperCat, if you will. Need I say more?\nWe are in SALON!! Thrilled to be interviewed in Salon about not having children,  pronatalism, and why a woman is never too old to be criticized for her choices. \nLots of great press! Thanks to Salon, Kveller, EcoSalon, Ravishly, Nylon, Bust Magazine, Real Simple, Grok Nation, Out of the Box Podcast, We're {Not} Having A Baby, New York Women In Film and Television, Laura Carroll, Flight and Scarlet, The Rinky-Dink Life, The Lux Letter. \nHi there! That's me by the Old Stroller Corral in my hyper-family-friendly neighborhood\nWhy is our society so terrified by women who want to control their bodies and their lives?\nMy name is Therese Shechter and I'm making a documentary about choosing not to have children in a culture where motherhood feels mandatory.  \nThere is so much judgment and stigma towards people without children!! We've been called selfish, immature, immoral, unnatural. Yes, people can be rude, but why are they so rude? My So-Called Selfish Life will shine a light on the powerful cultural and historical forces behind the message that every woman\u2019s most important (and perhaps only) role is to reproduce.\nHaving children is still the most admired thing a woman can ever accomplish, the thing that gives women their value. Who profits from that, and what we can do to shift that conversation?\nAlong the way, we'll introduce you to the funny, moving, and sometimes incredible stories of a diverse group of people including: \na Red State couple under pressure to procreate from unexpected sources\nthe childfree founders of a LGBT seniors' community \na college student on a 5-year quest to get her tubes tied \nan artist and rapper searching for her Golden Girls family\nand a woman whose unsuccessful fertility treatments led to a life transformation  \nYou\u2019ll also take an irreverent trip though the worlds of history, politics, pop culture, pregnant Barbies with removable bellies, Bonobo aunties, social media MommyJackers, and \"ubermother\" Ivanka. \nAs a woman who made the decision to remain childfree, I am also walking this road\u2013and I want to bring you along for this pivotal journey. This is the third documentary in my trilogy about women and identity, which includes I Was a Teenage Feminist and How To Lose Your Virginity. \nRead more about our very talented human and feline team here, including gifted cinematographer Iris Ng (who would make this film all about cats if we let her).\nBUT, HERE'S THE THING: If we don't reach our goal, we don't get the money. If we don't get the money, we can't make the film. We're counting on you!\n***\nThat feeling when...you want to tell the Stork to take a hike.\nDid you know that having children is the only way for women to reach their full feminine potential? No? Me neither.  \nIn 2014, almost half of all American women between the ages of 15 and 44 had never had children, an all-time high. So, why is choosing not to have children seen by so many as a threat, a decision made by the immature, the unfeminine, the selfish? \nWe live in a world where femininity is tied to childbearing, where reproductive rights are under constant attack, and where society demands women have children\u2013but only if they are the \u201cright\" kind of women. \nThis is a conversation about gender, class, and race, and how that defines women's identities and places value on female lives. Want to know more?\nFirst we have to reach our Kickstarter goal to get the money we are raising. Please help us reach our goal and make this film!\n***\nShanthony models her Golden Girls rings in a scene from our film. Get your own ring by backing this project (check out Rewards to your right)!\nWe're listening to you. All 3,748 of you! \nMy So-Called Selfish Life bubbled up out of the hopes, frustrations and energy of the 3.748 of you who responded to a survey we created to learn about your experiences. YOU inspired us, contributed ideas, shared love for the Golden Girls, and became subjects. YOU have helped us tap into a hidden and powerful reality of life for people who don't want children, and into the shame and silence of going against the mainstream. This film belongs to YOU. \nMy first documentary I Was a Teenage Feminist ignited a movement to redefine feminism for the 21st century, and How To Lose Your Virginity sparked conversations about sex in communities all over the world. Our new project is no less than incendiary! \nCalling all cat ladies, favorite uncles, crones-in-training, and the people who love you! We can't make this film without your support. Back this film to make it a reality!\n***\nPoet and Memoirist Molly Peacock in a scene from the film. Get a signed copy of her childfree memoir by backing this film!\nYou have the power to change the conversation!\nThere is little if any funding for independent media that focuses on the lives of women, especially a film that asks the questions about motherhood that you\u2019re not supposed to ask. You have the power to challenge the way we think about women\u2019s roles in society, by making a generous donation to fund the creation of this film.  \nMost of our money so far has come out of my pocket\u2013but now I'm out of resources. Your backing will help us raise the $42,000 that will take us to the next level.  \nYou can donate as little as $1 or help by spreading the word to everyone you know using the SHARE button! Every dollar, post, email and tweet gets us closer to our goal. This is not just a film, it's a movement. \nWhat your support will provide:\nWe will finish filming with our far-flung subjects this winter, and create a rough cut in spring and summer of next year. Having a rough cut in hand will be the crucial next step to getting significant finishing funds support and international distribution deals so we can complete the film in 2019. Through this process, we will continue to build a platform to tell your stories, amplify your issues, and grow this movement. \nWe are thrilled to be at this point in production. Thank you for helping us get to our goal and get this film into the world. \n\u2013Therese, Iris, Marin, Eryn, Chanel, Jason, Melissa, Patricia, Marj and the whole Selfish cast and crew!\n***\nSome of our fabulous rewards:  \n      ***\nWhat people have said about my previous documentary, How To Lose Your Virginity:\n\u201cShechter\u2019s movie, with a breezy, watchable, funny delivery, walks us through the simple argument baked into the very term virginity \u2014 one that we still use freely \u2014 the idea of a woman\u2019s body as an object for transaction.\u201d \u2014 Salon\n\n\"A breath of fresh, comedic air.\" \u2014 Tribeca Film Institute Blog\n\u201cSmart!\"\u2014 Elle Magazine\u201c\nI learned so much and felt validated in many of my private feelings.

Situated around a castle, this Transylvania has endured for centuries under one man's rule, Count Dracula. The city has grown divided over time by three factions. The vampires have become the upper class and rule in their own favor. The witches have stopped voting since the leader of the coven was taken by the Nazis during World War II. The werewolves live in the outskirts of the city and are continually oppressed by the vampire police force. \nMyron, son of the Wolfric who is head of the werewolf clan, has demonstrated and stirred the city to unrest. To peacefully quell any rebellion, Dracula has decided to hold the first election in Transylvania's history for mayor of the city. Unfortunately,  Myron has been charged with killing another vampire while in werewolf form. With few other options, Wolfric has asked Indigo, head of the witch's coven, to resurrect Frankenstein in hopes of convincing him to run in the election.\nHere are pages 7 through 17 to give you a feel for the book:\n                  Where is the Money Going?\nThe majority of the money will go to the creators of this book to help pay for Pencils, Inks, Colors, and Lettering.\nAs a writer, I've committed to paying for more than half of the book up front.

However, a small portion of the funding goal is intended to provide a substantially reduced page rate to the creators who've decided to join Matt and me on this crazy campaign. Stretch goals are coming and are designed to help us give something more both to you, our generous donors, and to the writers and artists who've come aboard to help us realize this...er, this nightmare.\nTHE THANK YOU\nThanks to The Gothsicles for use of their song \"Unbekannt in Deutschland\" in our campaign video. Lean more about the new album at this link.\nAnd, if you've read this far, thank you for considering a pledge to help make this nightmare a reality.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest challenge when assembling an anthology is collecting work on time from the creators, especially when many of them are contributing their work to this project at a significantly reduced page rate and have to juggle this alongside their better paying jobs in order to keep the lights on. In order to mitigate the risk of late or missing stories, we've given the contributors ample lead time to deliver their work. We hope to deliver the book ahead of schedule, but our campaign is designed with a long lead to keep from shipping the books late.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Digital Sampler!", "descp": "At this tier you get a DRM-free PDF Sampler of stories from THIS NIGHTMARE KILLS FASCISTS!

Here you'll find all the hit trans content you crave: the weird stuff, the stuff that goes to uncomfortable places, the stuff that highlights little-known kinks and contradictions in the trans experience, and most importantly, the stories about trans people having a good, maybe sad time. \nBig talk! But what does it mean in practice? Here's a sampling of the stories in We're Still Here:\nAn evening discussing the terrors of Donald Trump at a Japanese bar for trans men\nA trans woman uses MDMA (with complex results)\nA trans woman visits her grandmother for Christmas (with complex results)\nVisual essay on sex work, trans masculinity, and testosterone \nA practical guide to using paganism to navigate workplace terror \nTrans women pilot giant robots with impeccable synch ratios \nToxic masculinity haunts a friendship between a butch lesbian and trans man \nA devotional essay about angels beyond gender or understanding \nTwo trans women named Sweetness and Lightning blow up a car, watch Akira, and live happily ever after\nIf none of these appeal to you, that's okay: we\u2019ve assembled roughly 300 pages of stories from creators both emerging and established, all of them driven by effective narrative, gorgeous art, and sardonic whimsy. We intend this to be the gateway drug to trans comics: a gathering of creators that represents many of the divergent roads that trans comics in the twenty-first century might take. \nWe would like this anthology to be swiftly made obsolete by many, many others like it!

In the mainstream comics world, one of us in an anthology can too easily stand in for all of us--assuming that there's an effort to include us at all. Our hope is that this book will showcase just how diverse the body of work trans creators are doing actually is (and that it'll make it easier for future books that propose alternate, maybe better takes on what's interesting in trans comics work to exist.) \nYour pledges also help to forward the conversations between artists and their work that we need. I mean really, you guys: being trans can get lonely! And we mine some of those lonely experiences in our work, sometimes in isolation from the cis creators and friends who're working right beside us. This is why having trans friends, for a trans person, is vital. Being connected to the work of fellow creators who're hacking away at the same problems is no less vital: makes life better and proposes new possibilities and solutions all at once.\nLet us get less high-minded, though! If you back this project, we can pay each of the creators involved in this book. This is not negligible! Additionally, for those emerging trans artists we feature here, you're helping to provide needed publication credits and credentials that make it easier to build careers in the editorial gatekeeper-rich comics world. \nAdditionally: once the book is successfully financed and we've made back our production and editorial costs, we intend to donate some of the proceeds from each copy of the book sold to Trans Assistance Project (https://www.transassistance.org/) and Sylvia Rivera Law Project (https://srlp.org/). By helping to finance this book, you make it easier for us to do that effectively. \nWe've got you covered! :D Most of the money we're raising will go to cover the costs of printing the book, and to pay the artists. \nOur base page rate for finished art from contributors, at the present moment, is $25/page. At roughly 300 pages of artwork, that's going to be around $7,500 in artist payments. Obviously this is not nothing! (But it\u2019s short of what we\u2019d like to be able to pay--see the section on stretch goals below.)\nBeyond that, the money will go to covering the costs of printing the book itself, as well as shipping copies of the book to contributors everywhere. Additionally, we\u2019re raising money to pay some of the incidental costs of production (including ISBNs, printers\u2019 proofs, and a book cover.)\nHere\u2019s a full breakdown:\n$7500: Artist fees\n$6000: Printing & drop shipping (~1000 copies, 6\" x 9\" and estimated 304 pages, full-color PB)\n$2000: Shipping + Miscellaneous fees\n$1500: Kickstarter + payment processing fees\nTotal: $17000.\nWe will have more information about this once we've launched--the first priority is to get to $17,000! But at present, the rough expectation is that stretch goals will happen roughly every $2,500 to $3,000 above the initial goal, and each stretch goal will result in the artists' pay rate being increased by about $5/page across the board. This means that most of the stretch goal money will, to the extent that it's possible, go directly to the artists. We'll have more information on this as soon as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe began working on this anthology way back in summer of 2016. We spent most of that year and the early months of 2017 carefully assembling our list of contributors (both from solicitations and from an open call for submissions, to try to get as many creators as possible on board.) As we prepare this Kickstarter text, the bulk of the work on the anthology is underway, with several of the finished pieces already received and others in process, with delivery expected through July and August 2017 and a projected pub date of either very late 2017 or very early 2018. \n\nBoth editors have published professionally for some time, and it's a given--especially with fifty-six artists!--that delays will be inevitable! But we've built expected delays into our editorial and production timelines, and at present we\u2019re on track to meet all of our deadlines for finishing the editorial and production work by early Fall 2017.\n\nIn terms of the risks of the Kickstarter itself: both the editors of We're Still Here have previously published successfully Kickstarted anthologies (ALPHABET from Stacked Deck Press and Nerve Endings: The New Trans Erotic from Instar Books.) Believe me that we are both *very, very aware* of the potential challenges involved with running a successful Kickstarter and fulfilling rewards to all backers!

He wakes up to find himself in his own personal hell surrounded by the people he killed. Freed by Soul Collector, Soku, he discovers the only way he can live in an afterlife free from his victims is to find the mythical City of Lost Souls.  \nAs if that wasn't hard enough he also finds himself being hunted by creatures from the other side, determined to bring his soul back to be tormented. With nowhere to hide and no idea where to run he must begin his hunt for the city of lost souls.\nAs we reach issue 5, things have taken a turn for the worse. With Matt in a horrendous position which will forever change things for him and his victims.\nBelow are the first 5 pages of issue 5. There are no spoilers if you have never read City of Lost Souls before but enough to get you excited if you have.\n           A4 PRINT\n T-SHIRT\n  \"It\u2019s horror at its purest, but it excels beyond packing a visceral punch as the story is steeped in original, engaging mythology and characters you\u2019ll actually enjoy spending time with, even just to see what dastardly deeds they get up to next. There\u2019s a lot going on here, and even though it\u2019s not for the faint of heart, it\u2019s most definitely rich in imagination. It\u2019s a story where the violence has a warped sense of purpose, and you\u2019ll want to read it over and over again.\"\n5/5 DREAD CENTRAL\n\"Although City of Lost Souls unflinchingly showcases the utter nadir of human nature in bursts of brutal fury, the dialogue manages to mine a vein of dark humour that prevents it becoming too disheartening, while the artwork continues to delight in the gleeful depravity of onomatopoeic viscera.\"\n9/10 STARBURST MAGAZINE ISSUE 418  \n\"Scary stuff.

It's dark, gritty and disturbing.\"\nTORATHENA\n\"Some fairly extreme ideas are starting to roll out across the pages of COLS but there is an underlying point to it all where the worst aspects of life, death and everything in-between are laid bare for us to experience & ultimately learn from. The dialogue from James maintains the same brutal, honest and sharp edge to it while Janine\u2019s artwork has become more highly detailed and visceral since the previous issue\u2026..adding another unsettling dimension to Matt\u2019s story. Grim, gruesome and great is how this all combines and this twisted tale continues to twist.\"\n8/10 COMICS ANONYMOUS \n\"A dark twist on the age-old hero\u2019s quest but without a hero; a Dante\u2019s Inferno without Dante and a final page that only ramps up the promise of further bloodshed in future issues... Dark in tone and in humour.\" BLEEDING COOL \n\"What we have here in prospect is a meditation on redemption, on morality and mortality. A story that\u2019s taking on some big, serious ideas with a punky haircut, a flick of the V\u2019s and a whole lot of spit. It\u2019s a book packed with ideas and quirks and charm, laced through with a wicked sense of humour and an irreverence in which it glories.\"\nGEEK RETREAT \n\"Very cool, I felt dirty reading it in a good way. A dark comic series with so much potential.\"\nBROKEN UNIVERSE\nWhen we reach \u00a31700 you will get a whole other comic.  \nI am part of the editorial team of Comichaus. Within that anthology series I write, Karyn Shade. A story about a female private eye from Glasgow, which is also a City of Lost Souls spin off set in the same universe.  \nSo for your stretch goal, I will be doing a special 19 page collected edition of the first story, Karyn Shade: Beyond Forth. If you have pledged for a print comic you will receive a print copy, digital pledgers will get a digital version.  \nThis collected edition will only be available to the people who have pledged for the Kickstarter. So this will be exclusive to you, it is a full story and will never be reprinted in this format.  \nWritten by me, art by Jessica Byrne and cover by legendary comic artist Glenn Fabry.\n      James McCulloch - Writer  \nJames McCulloch is a film blogger, musician, and comic book writer from central Scotland who spends far too much of his time watching bad films and eating Doritos\u2026 When he\u2019s not doing those he writes horror comics and plays bass in She Burns Red.\nwww.grandmasterwook.co.uk\n Janine Van Moosel - Artist\nJanine Van Moosel a Freelance is Artist and Illustrator from Scotland specialising in portrait art and storybook illustrations.

Will Jack conquer Tommy's mind and exact his revenge at school?

Or will Jack win at his game of death?\nIssue 3 FUN & GAMES cover by EMAN\nWhy do this Kickstarter? \nWe currently have a booth at San Diego Comic-Con, and want to be able to get TOMMY out to a wider audience. This means a big print run, especially of the long awaited issue 3, plus special runs of 1 and 2, and getting out butts to SDCC to show the world!\nWhy do this project? \nTOMMY was born of a brainstorm session (meaning pizza and beer) between John Ulloa and Juan Navarro, talking about their childhood, and how awesome, but also rotten it was. Raised in the 70s and 80s, it was a different time, and teachers were a different thing. Nothing is worse than being a kid, and not being heard! So this became a story a story that for the last few years, has been loved by so many!\nA look at issue 3 opening:\n        Why is now the right time? \nWith finishing issue 3, we knew TOMMY for now, is DONE. So now we could go forward and get the word out, get people involved, and eyes on the book because now we have this completed project for them to see!\nThe Various Covers we've done over the years!\nWhy are you the right person for this project? \nI'm the co-creator along with John Ulloa. Also, the artist. We have full control of the project. I head up not only Tattoos and Comics in Hialeah Gardens but also the studio as the EIC/COO and give all my time to making and selling comics, so we can now provide better customer service and ability to get comics out to folks!\nWhat format do you want the product to take? \nREAD ON YOUR ELECTRONIC DEVICE TOO, YOU HEATHENS!\nSingle Issues will be our first major push to get it out to folks at SDCC, with very cool VARIANTS, different artists and people involved.

But speak, we shall! Longtime music marketer, Eric J. Cockrell, has amped up the volume to help breathe new life into Blister, sharing the band\u2019s story with the angsty account, garage band banter and hardcore observations of lead singer/guitarist, Bert Brixley (AKA Blister). \nBlister is a teenager in a punk band looking for his place in an evolving world. He thinks he\u2019s got things figured out, but he is continually challenged by everyday issues\u2014you know\u2026 girls, jerks, and the age old question, \u201cAm I punk enough?\u201d Can one ever really be punk enough? Answers to these questions and how Blister navigates his world along with his conspiracy theorist best friend and bandmate, Harvey Schnieder, whom he refers to as a \u201cperpetual fifth-grader\u201d puts punk in perspective and rebellion within reach. \nSix Page Preview\n          Who Am I?\nMe squinting into the sun, as I do.\nMy name is, Eric J Cockrell.

I regularly creates and publish work through this label. I have done work on anything from books and comic books to album covers to logos and letterheads.  I'm also a traditionally trained Illustrator, having graduated from The American Academy of Art in Chicago, IL with a Bachelor's Degree in Fine Arts, his major in Commercial Arts and Graphic Design.\n\nMy Profile on Comic Vine: https://comicvine.gamespot.com/eric-j-cockrell/4040-83055/\nPLAY\n\n5 Reasons Why This Blister Kickstarter is So Rad\n1. 32 pages of a super honest look at those teenage years, and set in the greatest decade to grow up during, the 90's! \n2. The book contains the entire Angela story, and an extra four page story illustrating how fun it was to connect to the internet in the 90's (SPOILER ALERT: it sucked). Commentary in the book brings you back to the 90's for a little world building. \n3. Every reward tier comes with the audio drama, taken right from the novel, with sound effects that set the scene and bring you into the story. \n4. Every reward tier includes an actual Blister song, and it's really bad ass. \n5. You can go way beyond the awesome comic and get the bad ass novel it's based on. \nCome for the comic book, at $10 with free domestic shipping (including the digital enhancements), stay for the novel at the $25 and above tier.\nWhat Do The Rewards Look Like On This Thing?\nThe rewards on this Kickstarter help make this whole ordeal an experience.  Read about Blister, listen to Blister, hear Blister's song.  Take this Blister project to the next level.  During the Kickstarter I will also release one of the Blister stories in a serialized format, for your reading enjoyment.\nALL REWARD LEVELS INCLUDE THE DIGITAL PACKAGE & ACCESS TO THE SERIALIZED STORY.\n\nHere's a sampler of the Digital Package\n On To Those Rewards!\nNEW REWARD TIER!  CALLING MUSIC PROFESSIONALS!\n      If this sounds really awesome (or even pretty cool), it's time to pledge. \nThis book is my favorite thing that I've ever worked on.

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Fidget Cube!\nWe can't do this without you!\n        Questions?\nAsk away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.\nFeedback?\nGot a creative idea you think we should implement with Fidget Cube? Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo.
