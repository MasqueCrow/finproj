It\u2019s a real-time live action game which means that it has to be played at 10pm in your local time zone. Written and Directed by Jed Shepherd (writer and exec producer of HOST - \u201cThe Scariest Movie of the last Decade\u201d - Dread Central & \u201cThe Genre Phenomenon of 2020\u201d - Forbes) in partnership with Visible Games & Limited Run Games. The game takes inspiration from the works of Manx screenwriter Nigel Kneale and the blurring of fact and fiction in the found footage movies from the last 25 years. However, unlike previous games in this oft-forgotten genre we\u2019re creating a horror experience that aims to truly chill your blood and send full motion video games screaming into the modern day.\nStarring Emma Louise Webb, Haley Bishop, Jemma Moore, Radina Drandova and Caroline Ward, GHOSTS features terrifying creature design by Trevor Henderson (SirenHead).\nHey, I\u2019m Jed and I\u2019m making a video game called GHOSTS.\nLast Halloween, frustrated by the neverending lockdown situation in the UK, like a lot of people I turned to video games for escapism. Looking specifically for horror games to freak me out, I re-discovered the live-action video games (FMV) of the 90s. Titles like Night Trap, Phantasmagoria and Double Switch (featuring the utterly superb Corey Haim), games that dared to try something a bit different and really pushed the capabilities of the game systems of their time.\nIt suddenly dawned on me what I had to do - I had to make a live action video game starring my friends Emma, Haley, Jemma, Radina and Caroline and make it as scary as hell. I want to make you afraid of even looking at your Nintendo Switch but feel absolutely compelled to play the game anyway to help the ladies survive.\nI contacted Visible Games to see if they were into helping me make it and posited the question: What if it was LIVE?\nWhat if it's hard-coded into the narrative of the game that you have to play it at a certain time? What if everyone in your time zone is playing the game at exactly that moment? It would make it an unprecedented terrifying event.  Wouldn\u2019t that be cool?  Luckily Visible Games have the unique skills to pull this concept off and make this unique feature a reality.\nWe took the idea to Limited Run Games and I\u2019ve never heard a faster YES in my life. Their support has been legendary and their reputation of delivering superior games is second to none. They will be releasing the game on all formats early next year.\nBuilding the team to help make this has been so much fun and I went to the absolute best to visualise the \u2018antagonist\u2019, THE LONG LADY. Designed by SIRENHEAD creator Trevor Henderson, I\u2019ve genuinely got the best people on the GHOSTS train!\nYou\u2019re probably thinking \u201cJed, why don\u2019t you just make a movie? Why a live-action video game?\u201d. My answer is: Why Not?\nSo as not to reveal too many spoilers, we have to be a little careful about the information you receive this early on. What we can say is ...\nYou play a TV producer, operating the outside broadcast van for a failing cable channel called FrighTV. Their flagship show is GHOSTS. It\u2019s the only thing people want to watch on the channel anymore. A show that in its heyday captured millions of viewers on a major channel. Viewers were glued to their screens as the presenter with a team of eager ghost hunters explored haunted locations around the country.\nOver the years, GHOSTS ratings began to drop which ultimately resulted in the show being dropped by the network and languishing on various freeview channels until it was purchased by FrighTV and re-branded for re-launch in 2022. The channel is littered with terrible adverts and trailers for movies you\u2019ve never heard of and never want to watch.\nAs the cast explore the location, you not only need to worry about their safety, the noises you hear around the van and the strange neighbours, there\u2019s also the urban legend of THE LONG LADY. Sightings of THE LONG LADY on this very street have chilled the bones of residents for decades. She appears in times of tragedy, looking through the windows of houses on the street. It\u2019s said that if you look directly at her face, you die. Curtain salesmen do gangbusters here.\nEvidence submitted via a recovered mobile phone\nAbove is photograph 2 of 3 taken from the discard mobile phone.\nPhotograph 3 of 3\nYou are the outside broadcast producer, in charge of what is shown to the viewers at home who have remained loyal to the show throughout all the lean years. The show is LIVE so you have to think on your feet and react to every moment to keep things interesting.  In front of you will be all of the camera feeds streaming from cameras installed in the most haunted location in London as well as heart rate monitors for the cast. What gets sent to the LIVE feed is your choice and can affect the future of the show (and perhaps the safety of the cast). You need to keep the show entertaining and you will have various tricks to employ to help you \u2018spice up\u2019 the live show.\nYou also have various documents, videos and audio files, collected throughout the years from this local community that you need to decipher to help understand the grave situation. Perhaps something you discover will stop the horrifying events from unfolding.\nThe full terrifying real-time version of the game is only playable at 10pm in your local time zone. If you load up the game before 10pm you\u2019ll be met with a classic test card. If you can crack the \u2018test\u2019 you will have access to an unlockable pre-watershed version where you can breathe and save your progress, but once you hit 10pm all bets are off! There are consequences for all of your choices though. Playing it safe is not always the best option.\nWhen playing GHOSTS, if you leave your station at any point, the game notices the lack of movement and it will end your session. Desertion of duty means the cast will be killed off. You are responsible for the lives of all involved so make sure you\u2019ve had a bathroom break, got plenty of snacks and most importantly turn off the lights!\n\nHaley Bishop is an American actress, based in London.

It\u2019s important to note that the exclusive Graham Humphreys artwork will only be available with these Kickstarter releases, so don\u2019t miss out!\n GHOSTS for Nintendo Switch by Limited Run Games \nGHOSTS for Playstation by Limited Run Games \n\nIf you want a little bit more oomph to your GHOSTS experience we have also teamed up with the amazing FRIGHT RAGS to offer an exclusive t-shirt too as part of our pledge tiers! \nGHOSTS for Playstation with exclusive Fright Rags Tee \nGHOSTS for Nintendo Switch with exclusive Fright Rags T-Shirt \n\nThe Collectors Edition of the game features a host of items that we can\u2019t wait for you to get your hands on. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of everything you get!\nThe GHOSTS Collectors Edition by Limited Run Games \nThe GHOSTS Collectors Edition by Limited Run Games comes with ...\nPhysical Game for Nintendo Switch or Playstation\nDigital Key for GHOSTS (Switch, Playstation, PC or Xbox)\nExclusive Graham Humphreys GHOSTS Cover\nGHOSTS Logo Sew on Patch\nExclusive Limited Edition GHOSTS T-Shirt from Fright Rags!\nGHOSTS Sticker Sheet\nThe Long Lady Acrylic Standee\nVHS Collectors Edition GHOSTS Clamshell Case (to hold all the contents)\nDocumentary \u2018The Making of GHOSTS\u2019 on Blu-Ray\n1 of 1 Polaroid taken by the Cast and Crew during the filming of GHOSTS\nThat\u2019s right! The cast and crew of GHOSTS will be armed with Polaroid Cameras throughout the shoot and you will receive a one-off polaroid taken by them. It could be anything from their time behind the scenes or an exclusive to you look at how we achieved the special effects. One unfortunate person will get a cursed polaroid of the face of The Long Lady.\nYou asked and we delivered. Limited Edition GHOSTS Jumpsuits are now available as part of the higher tiers ... including personalized ones too! \nNow, this one is something special. Either we will include a photo of you in the game itself or you will work with Jed and Visible Games to have your voice featured in the actual game! Yes, you will be one of the callers during a phone-in segment of the show. This is LIVE remember. Perhaps you\u2019ve seen the The Long Lady before, strange memories from your youth that you\u2019ve blocked out until now. Maybe you\u2019re experiencing supernatural manifestations and want to talk to someone about it.  Maybe you\u2019re just low-life prank caller! You will be immortalised in this one of a kind game.\nIf you want to check what items you will receive in your pledge, we've created this handy matrix for you to check too.\nSince Limited Run Games will not be shipping backers their physical copy until 2022. We have decided that shipping costs for physical items will be charged to backers after the campaign has concluded. \nShipping will be charged after this Kickstarter finishes and this will be based on actual costs incurred to ship and is collected via our pledge manager system. This allows us to charge fairly for all backers and avoid a \"one size fits all\" mentality to shipping.\nAt present we have been advised that the shipping to the US and Canada should be around $5 whilst shipping to the RoW will be around $20.\nWe are working directly with Limited Run Games and will be using their fulfilment centers and partners to ensure that your order ships quickly and the DDP is included so that you can get your physical rewards without any extra hassles!\nBecause GHOSTS is 99% live action, production needs to begin before we can offer you screenshots or gameplay footage ... and even then we're going to be super careful that we don't want to spoil any of the surprises we have in store for you!\nWe have carefully calculated our budget so that we can afford the best of the best for this production. We have already heavily invested in creatures being fabricated by the Jim Henson Creature Shop and securing the services of our cast, stunt professionals and visual effects team.\nWe estimate that 55% of our Kickstarter funds will be put directly towards the production itself which is shaping up to be a huge affair. 35% of our funds will be used to produce the items that are being handled by the fantastic Limited Run Games.\nThis leaves around 10% which we will use as both a margin of error and for marketing purposes, but we hope you spread the word too!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFirst and foremost we absolutely love horror and gaming! However, obviously at the moment we're fully aware and taking as many precautions as we can against Covid-19. All members of the team will be taking regular lateral flow tests supplied by the London Medical Laboratory in order to ensure a safe working environment.\n\nWe are also working alongside industry leading stunt coordinators Lucky 13 Action (https://lucky13action.com/) who will ensure that all stunts will be performed in accordance with all regulations.\n\nAfter the shoot takes place then it's down to editing at the same time as finishing up the engine for the system. We will post updates frequently with regards to our progress. We truly believe GHOSTS will be one of these games to overcome the trying times and become a landmark moment in FMV gaming.\n\nThis motivation, above all others, is what drives us.\n\nIn terms of timing: we are targeting Feb 2022 for release. However, it does depend on our funding amount. The higher we go, the more hands we can bring \"on deck\" and get to work quicker. Ultimately, it is far more important to deliver a game that meets the expectations of our fans than to hit a date. We have already built a significant portion of the game, but we do have a lot of work to do.\n\nWe have carefully budgeted this project and believe that our funding goal is realistic to provide you with the experience you deserve.

Players eventually learn what a high die roll means versus a lower die roll. The same treasure or effect comes up multiple times during a campaign. Or the table just doesn\u2019t fit with the vibe or mood of the game. All of these Harsch Tables are designed to give your game a mysterious edge that can greatly benefit or terrify the players in unexpected and creative ways.\nA number of these tables were designed to work in Dice Monster Dice\u2019s upcoming Harsch Kingdom game setting. Some notes and rules regarding gameplay in the Harsch Kingdom setting are included in this supplement. However, these tables can easily be used in any fantasy game setting with little or no adaptation. (Most of the results from these tables are setting-agnostic, and we\u2019re willing to bet that if we didn\u2019t tell you, you wouldn\u2019t have even noticed!)\nLet these Harsch Tables inspire your next gaming session, even if you don\u2019t roll to use them. Maybe there\u2019s a result on the Magic Misfire table that catches your imagination. Perhaps a member of the ettercap hunting party seen in the distance (Random Events) inspires you to create a unique NPC for your party to encounter. Or maybe that hobgoblin has come looking for his missing finger bone your player found on the Random Treasure/Items table three sessions ago.\nCalling for your player to roll a percentage will never get old at your game table with the Harsch Tables.\n\nUPDATE!\nThanks to you, we've met our Stretch Goals!\nStretch Goal #1 - $450 - New rules for  death and death saving throws.

His escape is just the beginning of this nightmare of a journey he's thrown into. \nAlthough Jonas escapes his outer-dimensional prison, there are other supernatural forces that see his existence as a threat and they plan to eliminate that threat.\nChapter four continues to dig deeper into the dark world of Crescent City Monsters and its characters. The story also explores how Jonas deals with having everything taken away from him while trying to figure out why a bounty was put on is head.\nCheck out more previews pages:\nTHE BOOKS\nWe're half way through completing issue four and part of the Kickstarter funds will be used to pay artist Gian Carlo Bernal to complete issue four.\nThis Kickstarter campaign will also help fund the printing of BOTH the trade and hardcover that collects issues 1-4 AND for individual copies of issue #4! So, if you already have issues 1-3 and want only issue 4, we've got you. \nThe hardcover and trade will be 100+ pages of amazing black and white art and story with quality gloss paper that will make the artwork pop. The plan is to make the hardcover slightly larger than the trade so you can enjoy a closer look at Gian Carlo's amazing artwork.\nCreator's Edition (PDF)\nIncluded in all tiers will also be a bonus Creator's Edition PDF. This PDF will contain the line artwork and script for issue #1.\n$16K:  DayBlack & Crescent City Monsters \nWe're collaborating with Keef Cross, the creator of DayBlack, on a crossover with Crescent City Monsters. The first stretch goal will be a PDF of a 10-12 page crossover comic book drawn by Keef Cross added to every reward tier if we reach $16K. We're excited about this collaboration because of the incredible synergy between DayBlack and Crescent City Monsters. The story will take place before chapter one of Crescent City Monsters circa 1962, so we'll dig more into Crescent City Monster's main character, Jonas, and his life before the bounty was put on his head. For those of you who are new to DayBlack you'll be introduced to the main character, Merce, a former slave who was bitten by a vampire in the cotton fields. Four hundred years later, he works as a tattoo artist in the small town of DayBlack. Check out dayblackcomic.com for more of  Merce's story. \nArtist Gian Carlo Bernal and writer Newton Lilavois recently won the 2020 Glyph Comic Awards for BEST ARTIST, BEST WRITER, BEST COVER, and FAN AWARD FOR BEST WORK for their comic book series Crescent City Monsters.\nWHY DID I CREATE THIS STORY? \nAs a Haitian-American I wanted to introduce the rich Haitian Voodoo lore to comic books readers through more authentic lens. Mix that with my love for dark gritty stories and the urge to create a zombie story, and you have the delicious gumbo called Crescent City Monsters.\nWhat are the fans saying?\n\"Great beginning and refreshing comic that has a great story to tell. The story placement is awesome and gives off a true world experience to the characters also great art as well.\" - Terrance S.\n\"One of the best comic books I have read in years. I purchase 500 plus comics per year, and this one is by far my favorite of 2020. The story has me completely hooked and anxious for more. The art work is phenomenal .\"- James J.\n\"An amazing original tale! I've always been into supernatural comics like Blade, Midnight Sons, Ghost Rider, Doctor Strange, Man-Thing, and Crescent City Monsters takes it to a sophisticated level!\" - Jesus S.\n\"Absolutely love the story line and the illustrations are definitely amazing! Would love to see the comics in color. Great job overall hope to see more soon. :)\" - Tiesha S.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with every Kickstarter there are risks involved in fulfilling the rewards. Chapter four of Crescent City Monsters is currently only half way through so there's always the risk of project delays due to book production. Based on our past Kickstarter history, the risk of production delays is small. Gian and I have been working together for the last three years and we are experienced in meeting our Kickstarter deadlines. With our previous three Kickstarters, we've always either delivered early or on time.\n\nWe've taken into consideration things like post office delays.

This year, the Vamps have created the first ever Vampire-made Kickstarter to save Human Halloween by delivering the holiday straight to you. It's Halloween delivered nationwide.\n\n\nWe Vampires know how difficult it can be to communicate.  There are hunters everywhere.  That\u2019s why our human familiars - Vampire (dot) Pizza - have spent the last four months since the pandemic began helping us and also restaurants that need it. They've partnered with some of the best locally owned pizza joints in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Philadelphia and New York to get my secret messages to you.  Nobody ever questions the pizza guy, right?\nIt\u2019s an awesome partnership.  The restaurant delivers chapters of my master plan for you to play and solve.  In exchange, we order their delicious human food.  My cover shop restaurant partners have reported huge increases in sales because of their work together.  If a good human or two benefits because of our Vampire Revolution, well, I suppose I can live with that.  In an undead sorta way. \nFor HH2020, VDP is doing things a little differently.  They love Halloween and want to go nationwide to help fill the void left by so many cancellations.  But, being familiars for just a few months now, they don't have restaurant partners everywhere quite yet.  So, order your experience here.  When you receive it in the mail, you'll find instructions on how to recruit your favorite neighborhood pizza place to join our #fangforce.  Think of it as reverse trick-or-treating and a great way to support local businesses that need us now more than ever.  By joining us for Human Halloween and the 1st Annual Vampire National Convention, not only will we save the best hunting night of the year, but VDP will be able to partner with more restaurants and be ready to deliver Chapter 3 to you in way more places.  \nYou can read more about Vampire (dot) Pizza in Forbes, Eater and Business Insider, to name a few.   \nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTo get our nationwide #FangForce signed up fast enough for Belle and her Production Vamps to get everything produced, assembled and in the mail to you by Halloween.

Millions of viewers were riveted to every episode\u2014often watching through their fingers\u2014as the uncanny events unfolded. After three seasons the show ended\u2014but the memories lingered.\nThough the quality of the episodes were hotly debated among fans and authorities from Stephen King to Guillermo del Toro, virtually all who tuned in agreed that the series\u2019 most memorable elements were the paintings and sculptures showcased within. Chillingly introduced by the writer-host in his inimitable voice, these macabre masterpieces were the works of artists Thomas J. Wright, Jaroslav Gebr and Phil Vanderlei, and have remained the stuff of dreams and nightmares for generations. \nJaroslav Gebr's stunning work for the Night Gallery pilot film.\nA 25-Year Treasure Hunt\nA quarter-century ago, an intrepid duo of dedicated Night Gallery historians banded together to dig deep into the history of the series. Co-authors Scott Skelton and Jim Benson wrote Rod Serling\u2019s Night Gallery: An After Hours Tour, which provided the definitive history of the show\u2014but sadly went to print without a single illustration from the series. Taylor L. White, publisher and proprietor of the genre emporium Creature Features, joined the search to bring the original paintings and sculptures to light.\nFor two and a half decades, this trio followed a trail around the world to discover the whereabouts of the paintings. The intense search grew to include a host of fellow aficionados, collectors, and historians, who painstakingly tracked down the whereabouts of each artful artifact, most presumed lost to the ages.\nArt Not Found in Ordinary Museums\nNow that search is complete, and Creature Features is proud to present the results: Rod Serling\u2019s Night Gallery: The Art of Darkness, a deluxe art book measuring 11 x 11,\" comprising 316 pages with more than 300 illustrations, including every painting ever shown in the Night Gallery. This includes in-depth commentary and background from the artists themselves, plus never-before-seen concept art and memorabilia. \nFinding the paintings and licensing the artwork from NBC Universal has been a long, painstaking, and expensive process. Academy Award\u2013winning writer-director Guillermo del Toro has joined the cause with an introduction to the book and offering access to the original paintings from his own vast personal collection.  The introduction has been penned by Anne Serling, Rod's daughter and author of her own book, As I Knew Him: My Dad, Rod Serling.\nThe book includes rare behind-the-scenes photos, promotional materials and concept sketches.\nAuthoritative, Exclusive, One-of-a-kind.\nThe result is a revelation, revealing the extraordinary talents of its artists while also tracing the surreal, riveting mystery of how these priceless treasures were lost, then found\u2014for you, the reader, to be amazed by. Every image has been personally reviewed and approved by the Night Gallery Artist himself, Thomas J. Wright. \n\"The Late Mr. Peddington\" before and after restoration.\nWith the paintings now documented and the mysteries solved, we are now dedicated to bringing this book to you, the fellow fans of the fantastic, who are willing to take the final step of support to bring this book out of the darkness and on to your coffee tables and bookshelves. \n\nThere have been substantial costs in retrieving, photographing, and restoring the paintings, not to mention licensing, writing and designing this deluxe book. Now we stand poised at the printers in need of your support. Your pledges will insure that we can produce a world-class, one-of-a-kind volume, and make it available for all of the fans, like you, who have clamored for it.\nThank you for considering our project. Our gratitude extends into the unknown.\nOur Team\nAuthors Scott Skelton & Jim Benson share the title of world\u2019s leading authorities on this series since penning their first book Rod Serling\u2019s Night Gallery: An After Hours Tour for Syracuse Press in 1998. That led to co-producing the VHS release for Columbia House, producing a Night Gallery documentary for the Mystery Channel and consulting on the complete DVD release for Universal Home Video in 2007. Scott and Jim teamed up again to produce a \u201clost episode\u201d from reconstructed segments for the Season Three DVD. Under oath, they still assert that Night Gallery is their Favorite. Show. Ever.\nArtist Thomas J. Wright (billed as Tom Wright in the early \u201970s), created 101 original paintings that embodied the supernatural shenanigans in the shadowy realm ofthe Night Gallery. His career began as illustrator on a pair of Alfred Hitchcock films and two more with Robert Wise before he made the jump to directing on the 1985 reboot of Serling\u2019s Twilight Zone. His storied career includes helming over 30 years of television, including contemporary hit shows Supernatural and N.C.I.S. Tom still shows the same wicked grin when fans admit to being deeply scared by his work. \u201cThat\u2019s the idea,\u201d he deadpans.\nDirector Guillermo del Toro needs no introduction having won three Oscars for his work on The Shape of Water to say nothing of his genre masterpieces Cronos, Pan\u2019s Labyrinth and Pacific Rim, to name a few. His devotion to Night Gallery is well-documented, with interviews and commentaries on the 2007 DVD releases. Del Toro credits his first viewing of \u201cThe Doll\u201d as a key moment in his blossoming creativity (along with some unfortunate side effects). There\u2019s no better evidence of his devotion to the series than the five original Night Gallery paintings currently residing in his vast collection of genre artifacts.\nScott Skelton, Jim Benson, Tom Wright, Anne Serling, Guillermo Del Toro, Joe Sikoryak, Taylor White\nAnne Serling is the author of As I Knew Him: My Dad, Rod Serling. Anne serves on the board of directors of the Rod Serling Memorial Foundation and has been published in The Twilight Zone - The Original Stories; and The Twilight Zone Magazine in which she adapted two of her father's teleplays into short stories. She has launched the imprint Rod Serling Books as a showcase for her father\u2019s works. Anne\u2019s poetry has been published in The Cornell Daily Sun and Visions, other writing has appeared in Salon.com and The Huffington Post and she is currently writing a novel: Aftershocks.\nDesigner Joe Sikoryak has been leaving his dirty fingerprints on American pop culture for decades. As an art director in the music industry, he designed definitive soundtrack albums for Star Trek, Mission: Impossible, Lost In Space, the Jaws series and nearly 800 others. He\u2019s also designed hundreds of books, magazines, posters and film titles, and now is thrilled to frame The Art of Darkness in a deluxe edition worthy of Tom Wright and Rod Serling\u2019s vision. He blames his unholy love of flush-right type on\u2026 Night Gallery.\nOver four decades, Creature Features was known as a leading purveyor of movie magic and genre greatness with a legendary store in Burbank that attracted fans and pros alike. Its publishing imprint has produced such popular and award-winning titles as The Fantasy Worlds of Irwin Allen, The Outer Limits at 50, The Making of Star Trek - The Motion Picture and FXRH.  Owned and operated by Taylor L. White, Creature Features continues to produce cast & crew reunion screenings, genre-themed art exhibits and the Sleepy Hollow Film Festival in Tarrytown NY. But The Art of Darkness may be its greatest achievement\u2014a maniacal, globe-spanning project that has lasted for 20 years to this day.

I went with the $1,750 top tier in support of an ex friend. Also because it included the sketch drawing of Rod Serling by Tom Wright. Shipping was $90. As the campaign wound up I patiently waited (I'm local. I was going to pick it up. he could keep shipping)Then as all or most of the rewards were announced sent out I was asking about the sketch. Taylor became pretty squirrely about the sketch, with various excuses. The first was \"You know this is worth more than you paid?\" Each time I asked, there was a different excuse. Ultimately, he suggested that artist Tom Wright was senile, forgot about it etc. The kickstarter campaign had a picture of it. When he told me to come and pickup, the book was all that he had. Nothing else. The next day I asked if all the other rewards were done. He said yes. I said let me know when it's all together so I don't have to make multiple trips for something I paid $90 to ship. His response was literally \"WTF Keep the book and Get cancer, I will refund your payment\". Who tells someone to get cancer? That didn't happen. He demanded the book back.

The Occult! \n Second-Hand books? \nSaxon\u2019s Second-Hand Books is a supernatural adventure written by Ash Deadman (Murder Most Mundane, The Hanged Man, Cadavers: World Gone To Hell).\nSet in a Neo-Victorian London, beautifully realised by the art of Gustaffo Vargas (Manu, L1ma, Trujillo, Crayta: Sunset). \nDonald Arthur Saxon operates a second-hand bookshop in an \"up and coming\" area of London in the 1870s. He doesn't sell many books, but he has a nice sideline solving supernatural mysteries. \nThanks to a secret he is keeping, he has an unmatched insight into the paranormal.\nHaving investigated a haunting at her home, Saxon teams up with Charlotte Thompson, a young widow with an appetite for danger. \nShe brings to his attention information regarding an increasing amount of mysterious events around the city.\nThey realise the events are all linked by an occult symbol and each event is more deadly than the last. \nSaxon\u2019s Second-Hand Books #1 launches a 5-part miniseries that leads our heroes on a tour of London's spookiest places as they get ever closer to the person behind these nefarious goings on.\nIt features reference to real life hauntings and ghost stories in a city known for its terrifying history. The story draws on horror and mystery inspirations to deliver a fast-paced tale set in a time period when people were fascinated by the occult.\nREWARDS\nSaxon\u2019s Second-Hand Books #1 is a 28 page full colour comic book, available with 2 different covers. \nSachi Ediriweera variant cover\nGustaffo Vargas cover\nOriginal character design art\nDMR free Digital version of the book\nFaye Stacey's art print\n\n\nPhysical bundle of Mad Robot #1s\nSo... what is SAXON's secret?.......\nSTRETCH GOALS PRINT PACKAGE!\nWhile we were putting together the project we were concerned that our creative team had become somewhat male-dominated.

Lets go!\nThe Vapor is about a troubled kid  named Lester who lives in a small town that becomes the victim of  supernatural happenings.  This otherworldly presence corrupts specific  locals and Lester finds himself in the middle of it all. This comic is inspired by the surreal and horror of contemporary society. Take a left turn with the comic artist and writer, Anthony Pugh, to a strange scenic route in...The Vapor.\n\"Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering, fearing,  doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before.\"  -Edgar Allan Poe\nInspired by actual events in history and personal experiences, The Vapor is a juxtapose of 80's horror films and indie comic art. Over the years as an illustrator, artist and muralist, my work has had this reoccurring character, a disheveled man like child. A character that haunted me  every time I drew him. What was his story? I've always been fascinated with lore and urban mythology, from Bigfoot to UFO sightings. Pulling  from some urban lore and an actual personal experience I tethered these concepts  into one crooked story. This is the nightmare at the corner of your  eye, the shadow behind the shower curtain, cruel thoughts creeping into  your daily life. This is ...The Vapor...\nCover Art\nPreview Art Sneak Peak!\nRewards\nNote: The $45 reward is a chosen random art piece done on varied sized 4\"x6\" masonite, with ink and acrylic.\nNote: For custom artwork, request something preferable comic book orientated concepts, I love drawing monsters and ol spiderman. But, open to whatever topic.\nNote: Both the Digital illustration and Digital Cover illustration will be a digital file, PSD, JPEG or PDF that will be uploaded for you to download onto your computer. I can illustrate a character for your comic or a character for you anime, use the image how ever you want. Feel free to ask questions about these rewards.\nNote: All rewards will be mailed in sturdy mailers\n\n What am I trying to do?\nTo find support and backing of this short series of books. Though this story and concept is far from the mainstream industry, I'm hoping to find an audience and support through Kickstarter. Aside from making the comic, I'm developing the mystery and lore of this world by also creating paintings, mini-shorts and illustrations. I have been developing this story for the past year but working with this character for over 15 years. I have issue  1 completely done and 2 more comics planned for 2020.\nWhy should I back this project?\n Well, first and foremost  you are supporting an independent creative vision, and a comic written and illustrated by one creative who has poured his heart into an idea. Secondly, your support helps this  creative bring this book into the competitive foray of the comic book  industry, companies like Marvel and  DC have the backing of corporate  money from Disney and Time Warner, something my lovely self cannot even compete with. So, every dollar isn\u2019t taken  for granted. And lastly, new voices only benefits comics all around, supporting my comic contributes to the wonderful spectrum of culture and diversity in the comic book industry.\nThis comic book is DONE, drawn, inked, lettered and ready to be sent to the printers! So, as soon as the campaign is done we can  get 'er printed and fulfill the rewards.\nWho is this guy?\nMy name is Anthony Pugh, artist residing in Brooklyn, New York. Over the past ten years I\u2019ve worked on many projects doing a bit of design, illustration, paintings, comics and mural artwork. This is my second Kickstarter campaign and when this concept hit me,  I wanted nothing but to bring this into reality. Bringing all my  influences from Horror movies and old Creepy Comics. I grew up in  Minnesota and started doing graffiti on freight trains, I experienced a few weird spooky nights at 3am with the vapor of paint twisting ones mind. Pulling a string through  all of this and conjuring something strange to paper. I hope you join me  and help me out on this comic book.

From award winning comics to the only Native comic shop in the world to the original Indigenous Comic Con, Native Realities has paved the way for Native Creatives to express themselves in positive and dynamic ways.\nIn 2016, we founded the Indigenous Comic Con as a way to bring attention to the incredible work being done by Native Creatives that goes beyond the traditional assumptions of Native art.\nWhy is this important?  Let's take a little trip through history...\nNatives In Pop Culture\nFor more than 400 years, Native people have been portrayed in negative and stereotypical ways in popular media.  From the Noble Savage to the Crying Indian, the realities of Native existence have been misrepresented and worse erased from the collective consciousness.  These portrayals have had significant repercussions on Native communities and specifically Native youth as there is a direct correlation between negative representations and damage to self-esteem, self-worth, and self-determination.\nFor many decades, Native artists and creatives have had a difficult time pushing against the confines of the identifying images Western society has perpetuated for several centuries.  The rise of the Indigenerd has allowed for Native Creatives to begin to dictate a new Native and Indigenous identity: one that is not bound by historical tragedy but rather is grounded in tradition, resilience, and celebration; an identity that  moves toward a bright and brilliant future.\nIndigiPop X\nBeginning in 2019, the Indigenous Comic Con became IndigiPop X, a pop culture festival celebrating the numerous aspects of Indigenous identity in pop culture.  Not just comics but futurisms, food, music, theater, and many other forms of creative expression.  Our main objectives for the festival have always revolved around two goals:\n Supporting Native Creatives - Native Creatives are the bedrock of our Indigenous communities.  They bring their traditions, values, culture, and aesthetics to everything they create.  Our work revolves around fostering a space where Native artists and artisans can explore and experiment in pop culture media, expand their professional networks, and find a larger audience with which to engage.\n Supporting Native Youth - Native young people have many obstacles due to systemic oppression, poverty, and lack of resources.  Our work is dedicated to showcasing and promoting positive and dynamic representations of Native people that can inspire and empower Native young people in becoming the superheroes of their own stories.  We want to unleash their imaginations so they can build better worlds for themselves, their families and their communities!\nThese goals are the core of our work and have guided our projects and collaborations for more than a half decade. \nRewards\nNow for the good stuff...with help from one of our most incredible sponsors, Meow Wolf, we are able to offer some great rewards!  You can get cool rewards but also you can spread the word. \nSo why run a Kickstarter?\nHere's the crux of it all...\nFor four years, we have run successful events that have drawn crowds from the southwest and around the world.  From Albuquerque to Denver to Melbourne, our conventions have brought joy, celebration and Indigenerdity to Natives and non-Natives alike.  However, we think we can bring this work to more people and crowdfunding is the perfect platform for us to engage a wider audience to learn about this work and, more importantly, support this work.  \nThrough this support we will be able to:\nExpand our programming to bring more Native artists to the festivals.  This includes more chefs, more wrestlers, more illustrators, more game designers, more writers, more actors...more Native Creatives in all areas where they are underrepresented.\nMove beyond Albuquerque and the southwest. There are so many locations we want to  explore and so many invitations from Native communities we have had to turn down because we don't have the capacity to be in all places.  With extra support we can offer more mini-cons and bring IPX to communities who are excited about this work.\nDevelop more projects, products, and offerings.  All our profits from our past conventions have gone back into developing comics, games, collectibles and more that feature Native and Indigenous characters and communities.  The more we are able to raise, the more we can expand our offerings throughout the world. \nAllow community and supporters to have a stake in the work.  Perhaps the most important reason: you!  By supporting IPX and all our pop culture work, you are actively engaging in changing the representations of Native and Indigenous people throughout the world.  You become a shareholder in our success!\nImagine how awesome would it be if the kids and community at Pine Ridge could meet and hang out with Eugene Braverock or the voice cast of Navajo Star Wars? \nHow much of an impact would it have for youth and elders at White Lake learn more about Indigenous Futurisms from Elizabeth LaPens\u00e9e or Drew Hayden Taylor?\n What if the world could see all the brilliance and complexities of Native people through the art of Tim Truman, Weshoyot Alvitre, or Jeffrey Veregge?\n Supporting IndigiPop X is not just helping to host a convention, it is a way to change the perceptions of Native and Indigenous people through pop culture!\nSupporting this Kickstarter means you are supporting all our efforts from festivals to comics to networks to distribution.\nSupporting Native and Indigenous people is more than just going to a powwow.  It is more than just liking a cause on Facebook.  It is more than just supporting Standing Rock.  It is supporting Native and Indigenous Creatives and expanding the opportunities to promote and develop their work, their craft, their networks.\nWhere does your support go?\nIndigiPop X Events: ABQ (March 2020) and SoCal (October 2020), as well as our future events into 2021 and beyond!\nWork and connections for Native Creatives\nSupporting Native youth to participate in a life-affirming event\nNative Realities Team\n Dr. Lee Francis 4\nLed by our Founder, Dr. Lee Francis 4 (Pueblo of Laguna), Native Realities has been changing the face of pop culture since 2014.  Known as the Stan Lee of Native Comics, Dr. Francis has been responsible for producing more than a dozen Indigenous-centric comics, founding the Indigenous Comic Con, and opening Red Planet Books and Comics.  He is an award-winning designer and writer and has spent more than two decades working with Native youth and communities in developing positive narratives and dynamic representations\nAaron Cuffee\nMr. Cuffee (Montauk/Shinnecock) has been with Native Realities since its founding and currently serves as the Chief Creative Officer and Director of Operations.

It stars Jeanie Marie, matriarch of the Van Helsing clan (and hero of issue one), as a young girl.  Following a string of cattle mutilations, Jeanie\u2019s father, brothers, and local ranchers form a party to find out who has been feeding on their cattle.  They fear the source to be supernatural.  Jeanie, frustrated at being left behind and compelled by dreams and visions, sneaks out of her house and into the woods, armed with an old rifle and a machete.\nSoon she encounters a pair of shape shifting were-creatures, and is forced to do battle against a much stronger foe.  Meanwhile, the hunting party has tracked a larger band of the creatures into an underground cavern, and is now trapped and outnumbered.\nBlood Will Out is written and illustrated by Tony Morgan, cover artist for the Chronicles of Van Helsing series, as well as artist for Issue One.  It is based on characters created by Adam Watson.  It will be a 32 page issue comic with full color interiors.\nChronicles of Van Helsing: Blood Will Out Cover\nWhile this is set in the Chronicles of Van Helsing world, it is a self contained one-shot that does not require any previous knowledge in order to enjoy.\nChronicles of Van Helsing: Blood Will Out Page #4\nEighteen of thirty-two pages are currently completed.  Due to the time involved in hand painting each sequential page, we estimate that the project will be fully completed in April of 2020.

Everybody has one and NOBODY likes it! To us, they are the enemy. That\u2019s why we invented VaBroom!\nNo more annoying dustpan lines or bending over. With VaBroom, just sweep into a pile or line. Then tilt to the side, and the the pressure activated switch on the nozzle turns on the vacuum power! That's right, just suck up dirt and debris and then drop it in the trash.\nIt's that easy! Just Sweep, Suck and SEE YA! \nVaBroom is lightweight, but POWERFUL!  So we ask ourselves, will it suck?  \n Step 1.  Sweep \nStep 2.  Suck \nStep 3.  Eject into trash. See-ya! \n\nOverview:\nCapacity\nVaBroom can hold approximately 1 cup of debris at a time. That's about 2,367 Rice Krispies\u00ae! \nPower Source\nVaBroom is powered by four (4)-AA batteries. On average, get over 500 uses per charge!\nMotor and Impeller\nVaBroom boasts a 14,000 RPM motor with specially designed impeller to create powerful suction while remaining lightweight.\n\n\nOur Design Challenge: \nCreate a lightweight cleaning tool with built-in powerful suction, that effectively eliminates the need for a dustpan. \nPLAY\n\n Product Testing:  \nThe nozzle design evolved from sequential testing to maximize suction and ease of use.  Additionally, we tested numerous combinations of motors, impellers and power sources to dial-in the best solution while keeping VaBroom lightweight.\nPLAY\n\n Refinement:  \nOnce the proper function was achieved by our engineers, our industrial design team then completed an iterative approach at refining VaBroom.  Customer surveys were completed with hundreds of participants and improvements were developed based on direct feedback from the user.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nForm and Function:\nThe last step was to make VaBroom beautiful.  Now that function had been maximized, we wanted to give VaBroom a modern, sleek look -- again, based on feedback from hundreds of users, we arrived at our current colorways, textures and finish.  \n\n\nWelcome to Enhance Product Development, the creators of VaBroom. Here is where we work each day, coming up with unique solutions to some challenging problems. You might be asking, who is Enhance? Well, within our team you'll meet dog lovers, little league coaches, wedding DJs, beer connoisseurs and karaoke rock stars.  \nThough we come from varied backgrounds, one passion we all share is a love for innovation. At the heart of that passion is a drive to develop meaningful solutions that resonate with our customers. We are curious, inquisitive, analytical, quirky, and sometimes a little edgy. We enjoy the open collaboration with our clients and tend to push the boundaries of conventional thinking. Our focus is to offer cost effective solutions with intrinsic value that create results.\nLastly, it is our enthusiasm that truly sets us apart. We actually love what we do and look forward to putting that enthusiasm to work for you, our backers!  \nSo from all of us, we thank you for considering backing our project and we will be providing you with updates on our progress in the weeks and months ahead!\nWe need you! And no, we're not just saying it. We really need your help. Without your support we can\u2019t start the production of VaBroom and tie up the last loose ends in development.

On the evening of January 20, 1931, Liverpool insurance agent William Wallace is called away from his home for a mysterious business appointment. He returns two hours later to find his wife, Julia, bludgeoned to death in their parlor.

But if you still have questions, we\u2019re here to answer them!\nYes, it\u2019s a comic book with 24 pages filled with chills, humor and a little real-life pathos. \nWell, do you like\u2026\nFun comic books like Sabrina, Saga and Crossed?\nFun movies like Evil Dead 2, The Breakfast Club and Beetlejuice?\nFun TV shows like Stranger Things, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina and Friday Night Lights?\nThen you\u2019ll probably like this comic too! (However, if you don\u2019t like fun, we have a tedious copyright disclaimer written in our best legalese that might be right up your alley!)\nFive teens take on H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s monsters and their small-town high school \u2026 They\u2019re just not sure which is worse.\nMiskatonic High is an ongoing series packed with light horror, tongue-in-cheek humor and the amazing artwork of Ryan Mendoza (who can draw just about anything with a tentacle).\nParental advisory: There\u2019s so many great series for young adults nowadays that you might be fooled into buying this for your five-year-old, but this series is rated PG-13 and more for teens and above.\nIn the rustic hills of a small New England Berkshire town lies the prestigious Miskatonic High School. When the Community Service Club goes on a field trip, they\u2019ll be launched on a terrifying adventure that will change their lives while birthing an evil into our modern century. \nThis is the beginning of the six-issue first season of the new high school horror series Miskatonic High.\nWe hope so, but here are some unbiased reviews.\nJenn Marshall of Sirens of Sequentials said:\n\u201cMiskatonic High is a fun story that balances everything you want in a good horror story. There is some gore, but not so much that you get overwhelmed. The jokes are funny, but they don\u2019t make the story feel like a parody of something else. It was well thought out, and I cannot wait to see where it is going to go next.\u201d\n\u201cArtist Ryan Mendoza brings a level of detail to the story that perfectly compliments the writing style. It fits the spooky storytelling by adding shadow to hide monsters, and the detail in the backgrounds make you want to spend time on each panel.\u201d \n\u201cThe monsters are very Lovecraftian. \u2026 Because they have that Lovecraftian feel to them, the monsters really are both written and drawn in a way that affected my Lizard Brain.\u201d Read the full review\n\"...so many tentacles...\"\nThe Pullbox called it \u201cthe bastard lovechild of John Hughes & H.P. Lovecraft.\u201d (We\u2019re pretty sure they meant that in a metaphorical way, because if that\u2019s literal, well\u2026 ewww.) \nHere\u2019s more from Paul\u2019s review: \u201cIt brings a mismatched group of high schoolers together, throwing them against evil the likes of which you\u2019d find in a dusty tome full of impossible to pronounce names. The beauty is in the execution. Despite some pretty heavy themes -- mounting madness, eternal torment, human sacrifice -- Mike Shea\u2019s story stays fairly tongue in cheek. [Artist Ryan Mendoza] knows how to get his Lovecraft on. So many tentacles\u2026\u201d Read the full review\nMiskatonic High #1-6 will be available as a collected edition and issue 1 has been approved and will soon be available digitally on Comixology. So they think it\u2019s pretty good, too.\nBefore you back Miskatonic High, check out some of the rewards we have to offer. We offer shipping to anywhere in the world, but shipping costs are separate from the reward costs.\n\nStretch goals\nWe've completed two stretch goals and are working on our third:\n\nHelp us unlock this reward by sharing this Kickstarter with a friend or classmate who likes fun comics  or Lovecraft-style horror and ask them to give us a try. Just send them  this link: http://kck.st/2VBd3db \nOf course. Here\u2019s the first few pages of Miskatonic High #1 so you can see if you like it.\nStick with us as through the six-issue first season, Alex, Matt, Sarah, Simon and Ren will travel through time to come face to face with Abdul Alhazred and his Necronomicon, descend into the darkest pits under the earth, and learn what is really going on in the public library when no one is looking.\nSo please join us for the fun!\nWe\u2019re raising funds to pay for a small print run for our Kickstarter backers and the old one lurking down in the basement. But comics are expensive to make. Printers, the Postal Service and shipping supplies will be taking most of what we raise. Kickstarter takes their percentage, as does payment processing. If anything is left over, we might go nuts on McDonald\u2019s Dollar Menu!\nIs that an existential question, because we haven\u2019t gotten that far in AP English Lit yet. \nYes, there are two guys working hard to bring Miskatonic High to life. The comic was written and lettered by Mike Shea and drawn and colored by Ryan Mendoza. We\u2019d say more about ourselves, but we\u2019re actually really busy putting the finishing touches on issue 6, the last issue in Season 1! \nSo you can feel comfortable getting invested in Miskatonic High, because you\u2019re sure to find out the answers to what is really going on!\nAdditionally, you can follow Miskatonic High on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. Plus there's a Miskatonic High website where you can sign up to our mailing list for the latest updates.\nAdd-ons\nWe've gotten some questions about add-ons, and they're a little confusing (mainly to us, but it doesn't take much to confuse us), so here's the simple explanation. The only add-ons we have at this time is:\nAn extra copy of our standard issue 1. Each additional copy costs $5.\nAn extra copy of our 8.5\" x 11\" print from the second stretch goal. Each additional print costs $2.\nIn order to buy them, simply go to the top where it says \"Manage your pledge.\" It'll take you to the level you pledged. In the pledge amount box, just add $5 for each additional copy you want and/or $2 for each additional print.\nAfter the campaign ends, you will receive our survey, which will tell you that you have extra money to \u201cspend\u201d on add-ons. You just need to let us know how many extra issues/prints you want then (according to the tutorial that I found on Google which is hopefully not even older than the box of baking soda in my fridge...wait, I never put a box of baking soda in my fridge!). \nThat's simple, right? If you have any additional questions, just let me know.\nAttribution\n\"Hey guys, who did that amazing music in your video?\" \nGlad you asked, it's a track called Wizard by Jahzzar, which is available on the Free Music Archive. We edited the track to fit our video.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe cover and pages for the issue are completed and are just waiting to go to print.

Great in coffee with a splash of rum for a Coffee Grog too!

This unique honey varietal provides a bright, citrusy flavor that not only sweetens but enhances the flavor of every tipple it touches.\nTropical Red \"Fassionola\" syrup: A vivid red syrup once used by many a tiki bar for adding intense tropical flavor to Hurricanes, Zombies, and Punches.

Once these are in production, we will be shipping internationally through BGReynolds.com\nQ: Will these syrups work without alcohol?\nA: Most definitely! As a sweetener in your coffee, or a non-alcoholic punch. We'll be sure to include a few teetotaler safe recipes in the booklet!\nQ: What is the kickstarter exclusive glaze for the mug? Standard?\nA: The kickstarter exclusive glaze will be up for vote in a kickstarter update.

Doctor Galapagos is our hero, our mystic battle man on the spot. He seems wildly capable of facing any and all hand to hand combatants. But Dr.G isn't just battling hundreds of angry trolls or brigands all at once, he's also fighting an unseen, unknown, psychic menace. He's finding his grip on reality becoming more and more tenuous, just when he needs it the most.\nThe tyrannical warlord known as The Smog Emperor has made his way through the previously impassable mountain range known as the Great Mountain Shelf.  His forces pass like wildfire through a mostly peaceful region, subjugating the people and laying ecological waste to the lands he conquers. Can the Red College and the allied forces of the land turn the tide? Can Dr. Galapagos keep his cool, stay true to himself, hold on to his love, and defeat the Smog Emperor all at once?\nThe Secret Voice is my own personal version of an epic fantasy saga. Because I'm me, it's a trippy, sometimes discursive affair that's just as focused on the sense of space and atmosphere as it is on the big picture plot stuff. This is me pouring all my love of adventure & fantasy narratives, artcomics, manga, and eurocomics into one misshapen container. It's about a big olde fashioned land war driven by the invasion of a despot; it's about a bunch of weird psychic warrior monks; it's about wild kung fu magic battles; it's about monsters and supernatural beings. But it's also about someone in over their head and not being honest with themselves or the people they love, and figuring out how to own their mistakes.\nAlong the way there are brigands, underground kingdoms, cities under siege, mass warfare, kung fu, psychic battles, talking animals, ghosts, and more monsters than you can shake a stick at\u2013and that's just in the first book!\nThe Book\nI've been working on The Secret Voice off and on for a while now\u2013in that time it's run as a webcomic, been published with other material as a series of comic books, and now I'm ready to collect the first big chunk of it into the first of three graphic novels. \nVolume One collects the Secret Voice material from issues #1-3 with newly remastered color and art in early chapters, as well as an additional 30+ pages of new comics and a section of backmatter and pin ups from some of my favorite artists. It's going to be flipping awesome!\nRemastered art from issue #1\nThe book we're looking to make is 160 full color 8.5x11\" pages, packed to the brim with comics and art. The base tier of funding we're asking for is $12,000, which is enough to make a beautiful softcover book with some spot varnish on the cover and nice paper inside. If we can hit $15,000, everyone gets a fancy hardcover book.\nAs I mentioned above, the book doesn't just have a ton of wild comics in it, it also has supplemental production art from the various stages of working on the story, a map of the Secret Voice world, and pin up illustrations by some of my favorite artists working today: Farel Dalrymple (The Wrenchies), Fran\u00e7ois Vigneault (Titan), Michel Fiffe (Copra), Sammy Harkham (Crickets), and Simon Roy (Prophet) have all contributed images for the pin-up section!\n The Rewards\nIf you look to the right there, you'll see a list of rewards and reward configurations. We tried to come up with every possible combination of rewards, so check that out closely for the exact tier that best suits your needs. Here's the various pieces of the puzzle:\n Exclusive Enamel Pin & Embroidered Patch\nA cool embroidered patch with an exploding troll head, and a Kickstarter-exclusive severed troll arm enamel pin can be yours! \n(If you want to combine a patch and/or pin with a tier that doesn't already include one, just pledge that item's amount more than the tier, and when the Kickstarter is over, there will be an exit survey allowing you to note which ones you paid for) \nDigital PDFs\nA high resolution DRM free PDF of The Secret Voice Volume 1 delivered straight to your email door.\nBookplate Editions\nA limited number of illustrated bookplate editions signed by the author will be available. \nEarly Bird Pricing\nSave money & get a free bookplate edition ( with a design that is exclusive to Early Birds) by being one of the first backers!\nSilkscreen Print Bundles\nGet the book and a beautiful 8x10\" silkscreened Secret Voice print!\nRetailer Tiers\nAre you a comics retailer? Have your own shop and want multiple copies to sell? Maybe some key Study Group Comics titles as well? We got you, at a wild discount (50% on The Secret Voice book & something like 80% on those older titles)!\nSketch Edition\nThe book plus a nice ink drawing on thick 8\"x10\" paper. Subject negotiable, within reason, but I reserve final say on what I draw.\n Original Art Editions\nThe book plus one page of original Secret Voice art of your choice! First come first serve. \nThe Money\nThe money, where does it all go, you ask?\nWell, if we're printing 2,000 copies of the book in softcover then about $9,600 goes to basic printing and freight costs. Another $1,000 goes to production costs for the book designer and color assists. Kickstarter takes about $930, and the rewards like the prints, bookplates and patches eat up the rest. It's a pretty tight ship.\nThe Stretch\nStretch Goals! You gotta have em.  Why? BECAUSE WE GOT FULLY FUNDED in just over a week!\nGOAL #1: if we hit $15,000, the book becomes a fancy hardcover instead of a semi-fancy softcover.  \nLET'S DO THIS!\nGOAL #2 ANNOUNCED: KESHI SET!!\nWell, as we leave stretch goal #1 in the dust and head into our final week of the Kickstarter (! Yep it ends this Wednesday), I figure we might as unveil one more stretch goal on this bad boy. Honestly, we could add a dust jacket or a sewn in bookmark ribbon or something but I feel like that would be gilding the Lilly. This book is already going to be awesome. Why don\u2019t we do something a little different? Do you remember M.U.S.C.L.E. Figures? Those little squishy rubber wrestlers many of us played with as a kid? I was in love with them! They had so many different imaginative designs, it seemed like a literal universe of wild characters. And I\u2019ve always wanted to make my own.\nWell, when we hit the $18,000 mark that will unlock STRETCH GOAL #2: The Three Piece Keshi Set! (Keshi is what that style of toy is called in Japan, where they originated)\nSculpted and cast by master Keshi Maker Eric Nilla ( http://ericnilla.storenvy.com/ ), the set will contain three 2\u201d rubber figures: Doctor Galapagos, a Troll Warrior, and The Creep. The images here are just for reference, the final designs may vary slightly. Eric does great work with the sculpting and casting and he will translate these designs into something that makes perfect sense as a classic style Keshi figure. The Keshi set will probably have to be sold for more than this after the Kickstarter, but for all of you awesome peoples I\u2019m going to price it at a flat $30.\nSo I\u2019m going to assume that we are going to hit the 18k mark and just open up pre-orders for the set now. There will be a tier that\u2019s just the Keshi Set + shipping added to the reward options. If you want to add the Keshi set to any of the reward tiers that have already got shipping factored in to the pledges, DON\u2019T change your reward tier. You can actually just adjust your pledge upwards by $30 with no change in shipping. If you just got the digital tier, you can add $36 to your pledge to cover the Keshi Set + shipping, that should be enough. If you want to take this time to add a patch and or pin to your order, now is the time to add on those dollar amounts as well!\nWhen the Kickstarter is all over, I will be sending out surveys so everyone can confirm which add ons they paid for, no need to send me a note now, just fill out your exit survey next week!\nOk, stay awesome! I\u2019m stoked about this rubbery reward!\nLet's Do This!\nPlease spread the word on social media, and check out the reward tiers. See which one fits your needs and PLEDGE EARLY! The sooner we hit our goals, the sooner we can consider our stretch goals!\nThank you so much for taking the time to read this, and thank you for your support.\n-Z", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHonestly, there's not much in the way of risks here. We're currently finalizing the designs for the book so we can send it to the printer as soon as this Kickstarter ends. All the new work and revisions of old work are all done. I've successfully fulfilled an even more complicated KS before this, and even if I hadn't, I'm planning to use a Kickstarter fulfillment service for shipping.\n\nThe only potential issues that could pop up are with the printer being overseas, sometimes the shipping can take an extra minute, but we're giving ourselves enough time that that should not be an issue except in the most extreme situation.\n\nMy goal is to have the books in hand this fall for convention season, and packages shipped out before the book debuts at any shows I might attend.\n\nI've been self-publishing Secret Voice for the last several years under the Study Group Comics label, but for the collection I'll be partnering up with my friends at Floating World Comics. Floating World is both an amazing shop and an excellent comics publisher.

It\u2019s so comfortable, you won't even notice it.\nWith Snorelax, you'll wake up feeling better. Your partner will wake up happy. And you won't become a snoring statistic (1 in 4 couples sleep apart and snoring is the #3 cause of divorce in the U.S.) \n65 years of combined medical experience went into creating Snorelax. Our founding Medical Doctors created the perfect way to wake up refreshed. Every morning. Their revolutionary design is patent pending.\nThe Buzz\nHow We're Different (It's Comfortable!)\nWhat you've tried before vs. Snorelax\nSnoring solutions abound. So what makes Snorelax different?\nComfortable - Snorelax are easy to apply and comfortable to wear \u2013 and they're quick and painless to remove. No pulling your beard, no sticky adhesive on your skin. It\u2019s the most comfortable solution on the market today.\nNon-invasive -From mouth guards to tongue suction devices, invasive snoring solutions are everywhere. Snorelax is gently applied to the face, not in your mouth or up your nose so there is nothing to fall out during the night. It also doesn\u2019t hurt. \nHelps you Breathe - Not all solutions are created equal. Snorelax not only stops your snoring, but improves your breathing during sleep.  (Exploding pillow anyone?)\nBeard Friendly!\nWear Snorelax, comfortably, with or without a beard.  They won't pull your facial hair and stay on all-night while wearing them.  Watch our brief video below, about applying Snorelax, wearing them with a beard, and removing them.\n\nPLAY\n\nWith or without a beard, Snorelax stays on all-night comfortably\nEasy-to-Use\nSnorelax comes with a scored backing which makes it easy to peel and apply. The graphic indicators make placement easy and it's organic shape fits perfectly to the contour of your face.\nSnorelax is easy and painless to apply\nPLAY\n\nWhy Snorelax?\nDid you know you\u2019re not alone? 64% of people say that their partner snores. Like many snoring sufferers, you and your partner may have tried some crazy gadgets, chin straps, nose plugs, and mouth-guards.\nSnorelax are different. They\u2019re non-invasive, comfortable and effective from the moment you apply them. You can move your mouth freely, but when you relax they hold your jaw in place. You can sleep in any position you like, and Snorelax stay on all-night long.\nImprove Your Health, for Good!\nWe spend one-third of our lives sleeping. How we sleep impacts our health. Snorelax improves the way you breathe so you can sleep better.\nAccording to Harvard Medical School* snoring can actually lead to death.\nStroke, Heart Attack, and Dementia can be related to snoring and airway obstruction.  Even the non-fatal consequences are nothing to mess around with: headaches, low sex drive, obesity, anxiety, depression and more.\nSnorelax are easy-to-use and can greatly improve your health and quality of life. We\u2019ve designed them to be high quality,yet inexpensive, so everyone can afford to improve their health.\nSave your Relationship\nIf you\u2019re the partner of someone who snores, you won\u2019t be surprised to find out that snoring is the #3 cause of Divorce in the U.S. It goes beyond annoying, it\u2019s disruptive and causes 1 out of 4 couples to sleep apart.\nWe\u2019re here to help. Your partner will stop snoring and you'll love the quiet. Plus, check out our reward packages for the deep sleep mask and the meditation cards. It\u2019s a way for you and your partner to reconnect and relax together. Bring on the bliss.\nWake Up with Energy\n  There isn\u2019t enough coffee in the world to make up for a bad night\u2019s sleep. Snoring leaves you exhausted and sluggish. With Snorelax you\u2019ll wake up in the morning feeling happier, more refreshed, and ready to tackle the day.\nHow it Works\nSnoring is more than just noise. The noise is annoying and stops you and your partner from getting the restful sleep you need. But, when you snore, a lot of other bad things are happening inside of you.\nIf you snore, it means you\u2019re not getting enough air. When you sleep your muscles relax and your jaw drops back, obstructing your airway. The abnormal airflow causes turbulence and vibration which is heard as snoring.\nTypical snorer with airway obstructed\nIf you are a snorer, your heart, brain and other vital organs are not getting the air they need. Snoring is our body\u2019s siren indicating that something is terribly wrong; don\u2019t ignore it!\nSnorelax doesn\u2019t just stop the sound of snoring, it solves the problem. Snorelax comfortably supports your jaw so you can breathe better and sleep in any position. They improve your sleep quality and enhance your next day's performance. Snorelax gently adheres to your skin and is beard friendly.\nSnorelax provides support to keep your airway open and sleep silent\nOur Technology\nSnorelax utilizes a unique patent-pending technology to eliminate snoring. Years of research and testing went into the development of Snorelax. (Our team has tried dozens of other \u201csnoring solutions\u201d over the years, only to leave them under the sink collecting dust). The result of all of our work is a rigorously tested product that gives instant snoring relief.\nShare Snorelax\nOur rewards are designed to improve your health and relationship and thank you for your support. \n\nWhether or not you can financially contribute to our campaign, one of the best ways to support us is through social sharing.

Please note that if you live outside of the U.S., you may be responsible for local duties, fees, and taxes. \nOur Story\nSnorelax fulfills the personal quest of our founding team of Medical Doctors to end snoring.\nUnhappy with existing treatments and products, they decided to create their own solution for snoring.\nIt had to be comfortable, easy to use and produce fast results. All at an affordable price.\nAlong the way, they gave prototypes and samples to their friends to test. People kept asking for more, saying it was saving their marriages and improving their quality of life.\nYears of innovation and testing later, Snorelax was perfected.\nOur founders refined their prototypes to the Snorelax you see today: soft yet strong; slim yet stable; comfortable yet effective in eliminating snoring.\nKickstarter will enable us to reach the minimum order quantity required and produce the first commercial run of Snorelax. We need your help. \nTimeline\nWe\u2019ve self-funded the technology, design, development, and testing for Snorelax. Every dollar pledged will go towards manufacturing, quality assurance, and packaging. \nComfortable and no grip loss with a beard.\n\n\nFAQ\nWe're standing by to answer your questions, but here are some of the most common inquiries we receive:\nI have facial hair.  Will Snorelax still work?\nYes!  Snorelax works on all faces, with or without facial hair.  We do not recommend using Snorelax if your facial hair is longer than 1 inch, but rest assured that our R&D is aggressively working on creating a version intended for long facial hair.\nDoes it pull on the skin...is that what it's doing?\nDefinitely NOT.  Snorelax adhesive is created with sensitive skin in mind, as not made with natural rubber latex.  Snorelax adheres to the skin, comfortably, and keeps your jaw from dropping when your muscles relax.  Your skin will not feel pull or tightening when wearing Snorelax.  Our adhesive is intended for long term wear.\nDo you have other colors?\nWe sure do.  Snorelax comes in Midnight Black and Tan.  Who knows, we might even be able to offer Snorelax in clear!\nDoes it work for both men and women?\nAbsolutely!  Snorelax works on anyone.\nWill Snorelax work if I have been diagnosed with Sleep Apnea?\nSnorelax does not cure or treat Sleep Apnea.  Snorelax improves breathing by preventing obstruction from your jaw dropping.  Please consult your physician for Sleep Apnea treatments.\n* https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/snored-to-death-the-symptoms-and-dangers-of-untreated-sleep-apnea-2017021311159\n\nTrack our project on Kicktraq!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSnorelax isn't some far-fetched idea pieced together in a garage.

Unfortunately those he has killed do not see it the same way.\nHow can David's conscious ever be clean when the sins of his crimes literally haunt him?\nThe goal of this Kickstarter is to raise funds for the printing of issue #1 of the new Ghost Assassin ongoing series.  The first issue of Ghost Assassin is print ready.  All artwork, coloring, lettering and graphic design for the first issue are complete.  Issue #1 is a 32 page full color comic written by Adam Watson with artwork by Joel Cotejar and Charles Carvalho with coloring by Edward Bola and Gulliver Silva.  The cover for issue #1 is penciled by Joel Cotejar with coloring by Ceci De La Cruz.\nThis is the first time that this series will be presented in a full length ongoing format.  The 10 page \"Prelude\" story will be represented as a back up tale in Ghost Assassin #1 with new lettering.  This Kickstarter is an opportunity to do a soft relaunch of Ghost Assassin in an ongoing format, the way that it was originally intended to be.  Ghost Assassin is a character driven tale that incorporates elements of the crime, suspense and supernatural genres.\n Any surplus raised by this campaign will go towards finishing the production of issue #2.

In 2013, I set out to make The Mill at Calder's End and created a Kickstarter campaign to raise $32,000. The campaign was a fantastic success and I raised over $65,000.\nThe Mil at Calder's End was an official selection at over 60 film festivals worldwide and won 14 awards, including the 2015 Grand Jury Prize for Best Animated Short at the Seattle International Film Festival. In addition, I was honored to have Guillermo del Toro purchase the Grimshaw puppet for his personal Bleak House collection. \nThe puppet was also personally selected by Guillermo for the traveling museum exhibition At Home With Monsters, which premiered here in Los Angeles at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), and continued on to Minneapolis Institute of Art and then on to the Toronto Art Gallery of Ontario (AGO).\nREVIEWS OF MY EARLIER GHOST STORY PUPPET FILMS\n\"THE MILL AT CALDER'S END IS TOLD WITH A PASSIONATE SENSE OF STORYTELLING IN A MEDIUM THAT BOTH ENSHRINES AND REINVENTS THE OLD CLASSICS.\" -Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth, The Shape of Water, Hellboy)\n\"BREATHTAKING...AN INNOVATIVE AND ENGAGING USE OF PUPPETRY...\" -Sir Richard Taylor, Weta Workshop (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings)\n\"CREEPY...FILLED WITH SOME REALLY COOL HORROR IMAGES... I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS...\" -Rick Baker, Special Make-Up Effects Artist, Winner of Seven Academy Awards\n\"HAUNTING AND ATMOSPHERIC...IT IS VERY RARE THESE DAYS THAT YOU SEE AN ORIGINAL STORYTELLING FORMAT, ESPECIALLY ONE THAT SUITS THE SUBJECT MATTER SO WELL...\" -Mike Mignola, Creator of Hellboy, Contributing Artist for \"The Mill at Calder's End\"\nBACKGROUND\nThe Haunted Swordsman is a passion project that is heavily influenced by the films of Akira Kurosawa, the Lone Wolf and Cub manga and film series, the classic Japanese ghost story films Kwaidan, Ugetsu, and Kuroneko, among others, as well as visceral, immersive films like The Revenant and Mad Max: Fury Road. \nI have always had a great love of puppetry and traditional in-camera special effects. The work of Jim Henson (The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, and his Storyteller television series) is a great inspiration to me and I am hoping to bring his sense of wonderment and artistry to The Haunted Swordsman.\nIn 2012, I was honored to work with Heather Henson (Jim's youngest daughter) on my first film. Heather produced The Narrative of Victor Karloch as one of the short films for her Handmade Puppet Dreams Film Series and was a guiding force in helping me create the haunted world of Victor Karloch.\nTHE FILMMAKING APPROACH\nThe Haunted Swordsman will be told with the traditional Japanese theater puppetry technique known as bunraku. Each puppet figure is controlled by three (or more) puppeteers dressed in black and hidden behind each character. It is my goal to make a film that celebrates practical effects and therefore there will be very little computer generated imagery in the final film. In my first film, The Narrative of Victor Karloch, I utilized several silent film era camera techniques, such as a shot of a miniature ship on a stormswept ocean (which, in fact, was made up of painted flowing garbage bags). For The Mill at Calder's End, the Apparition (see below) was puppeteered in a water tank.  I plan to continue to use many more of these 'old school' techniques to give a hand crafted look to The Haunted Swordsman.\nFrom my experience working as a special effects artist in Hollywood for over twenty years, I have been fortunate to work with the most talented creature effects artists,concept artists, and puppeteers in the industry.\nThis film celebrates two of my great loves: the art of puppetry and suspenseful storytelling. I promise that The Haunted Swordsman will be unlike any puppet film you have ever seen before.\nThe Apparition puppet (voiced by Barbara Steele) filmed in a water tank for THE MILL AT CALDER'S END.\n  Preparing a pre-dawn location model shot of the windmill for THE MILL AT CALDER'S END.\n    Production Stills from THE MILL AT CALDER'S END. A combination of practical sets, greenscreen composite shots, miniatures (including a Model T on a converted exercise treadmill), and the full size \"Bramblegore\" creature.\n  For THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN. Lead sculptor Arjen Tuiten (Wonder, Pan's Labyrinth) details the severed head of the Navigator character. This will be the full size insert version for the animatronic head.\n  ABOUT THE FILMMAKERS\nKevin McTurk | Director\nA professional creature effects artist, cinematographer, model maker, and puppeteer, Kevin McTurk has been working in the effects industry for over 20 years.

Every frame of this film is essentially an effects shot. The \"actors\" of this film are the sculpted puppet characters that are controlled by three puppeteers dressed in black (or green screen) behind each puppet. Therefore, one of the single greatest challenges is how to film the puppets and hide the puppeteers from camera. There will definitely be a number of shots that will require \"rotoscoping\" ( digitally erasing puppeteers from the shot, frame by frame). In addition, every element of the puppet world - wardrobe, props, and sets - must be custom built for the film.\n\nIn terms of production scheduling, \"THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN : SHORT FILM ONE\" should be completed within a 6-8 month time frame.The shooting schedule could possibly be delayed if puppeteers and/or technical crew members are unavailable on shoot days due to better paying jobs or out of town work and would therefore force us to reschedule. But the ultimate goal is to start shooting this fall and reach post production in the spring/early summer..\n\nHow will the Kickstarter money be spent?\n\nHere is a short breakdown of the budget: \n30% Puppet Construction,Costuming,Sets,and Props \n30% Cast, Camera/Lighting/Stage Rental/ Crew \n20% Post Production (Sound Mixing/Digital Compositing/Color Correction)\n20% Kickstarter Rewards and Shipping\n\n\nTHANK YOU in advance for supporting THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN.. \nYour contributions will enable this project to take creative risks and deliver a vision that few have ever attempted!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "MESSAGES FROM THE SWORDSMAN", "descp": "For our minimum donation you'll win our heart-felt gratitude, access to exclusive THE HAUNTED SWORDSMAN updates, and an online \"Thank You\" credit for the world to see at TheSpiritCabinet.com.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "THE MILL AT CALDER'S END DOWNLOAD", "descp": "Winner of over a dozen festival awards including the Grand Jury Award for Best Animated Short at the Seattle International Film Festival, THE MILL AT CALDER'S END is a gothic ghost story inspired by the work of Edgar Allan Poe, M.R.

Choose any prints you want with our numerous packages. \n My goal as a comic book writer is to write for the big boys, but I've been accused of being \"too pushy\" and \"out there\" with my ideas each time I get in front of them.  \nI always told them I'm not going away, and with your continued support as readers and collectors we continue to be a tiny thorn in the face of corporate comic cliffhanger complacency.\nJoin the Faro Comics Universe, where the readers get to help create the new posters with your passionate and perverse feedback.\nI tell everyone I meet that FARO is the greatest adventure story ever written.  So if you want the chance to call me an arrogant asshole then pick up a copy and tell me I'm wrong.\n I have a body of scars, and scars of bodies in my wake from 20 years of working in the industry of rare and exotic art acquisitions.\nIt has been the greatest and most stressful moments that make for the true nature of the stories you will read from us.\nI hope you love reading it as much as I love writing it.\nThanks for making it this far and always remember,\nIt doesn't matter where you're going,\nIt doesn't matter where you've been, \nAll that matters\nis now.....\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe got this, it's all about deadlines.

To us, \u201cScience\u201d is more than a word - it\u2019s a big idea or a burning question. Science is a way of thinking about the world and ferreting out it\u2019s secrets.\nBut how do you write a small book about something so huge?\nWe realized that what most excited us about Science were the stories. The true-life tales about answered questions and discoveries, the \u201cAh-Ha\u201d moment when everything came together...\nThe \u201cEUREKA\u201d moment.\nScience is full of amazing stories about huge discoveries by great characters and we want to tell these stories in the only way we know how: through clear, accessible prose and beautiful, graphic art.\n\u201cEUREKA\u201d is more than an art book with a Science theme. \u201cEUREKA\u201d is  about some of the stories and characters we find so compelling. Albert Einstein and his imagination. Galileo and the Tower of Pisa. Grace Hopper and the first computer bug.\n\u201cEUREKA\u201d will be written and drawn by Dane Ault and Ashlie Hammond, who have been writing, drawing and publishing kid\u2019s books for years under the name Monkey Minion Press. This is our first Kickstarter.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nWe\u2019ve been publishing books, greeting cards, and posters under the Monkey Minion Press banner for years. But of all of our projects, \u201cEUREKA\u201d is the biggest challenge.\nWe want \u201cEUREKA\u201d to be a celebration of Science and scientists, and it will be, but we also want to make a book that reflects our excitement about Science in general. We want a hard-bound, beautifully off-set printed book that will hold up to many re-reads and flip-throughs, and look great doing it.\nHowever, high quality, hard-cover, full-color books are expensive to produce, so we need your help to make this project happen.\nWhat kind of book will I get?\n\u201cEUREKA\u201d will be at least 44 full-color pages of hard cover Science goodness. We plan to print our books through Regent Publishing because we know what they can do. (They printed our friend Cody Vrosh\u2019s books and they are beautiful.)\nWe want \u201cEUREKA\u201d to be a case-bound hard cover book with a full-color printed and laminated cover. The interior paper is a medium-weight gloss paper with full color offset printing. This book is going to look great on the shelf and feel better in the hand.\nWriting and Sample Page Layout\nWhat kind of prints will I get?\nA preview of a few of the Giclees.\nWe\u2019re printing the 6\u201dx6\u201d Giclees through a local Portland printshop called ColorHausPDX. We\u2019ve worked with them extensively in the past and know that these guys can deliver high-quality, beautiful work. \nThe art prints will be 6\u201dx6\u201d giclee-printed on heavy 100% Cotton Rag photo quality paper using high-quality archival inks. These giclees will look nice and bright on your wall and they won\u2019t fade or yellow over time.\nRewards\nSHIPPING\nIn the US, we'll be shipping your books USPS Priority Mail so we can track  each package. If your package comes to you damaged or fails to arrive, let us know and we'll do everything in our power to make it right.\nPosters will be shipped separately to avoid damage. We'll ship them USPS 1st Class Parcel Post in a very sturdy cardboard tube. In the past, we've used this tube extensively to ship art for MMP with good results.\nOutside of the US, we'll ship your rewards USPS 1st Class Parcel Post.\nADD ONS \nSTRETCH GOALS\nThis project is all about \"EUREKA,\" and so our stretch goal plans are mostly improvements to the book. We'd love to add new scientists and more pages. Dane dreams of printed endpapers and bookplates. Watch for updates to get more specific information when we get closer to our goal!\nIf you made it this far\nThank you so much. Your support means everything to us. Really.\nIf, like us, you are excited about Science and want \"EUREKA\" to become a real book, please share this with your friends, family, enemies, casual acquaintances, and people on the street.  \nVideo Music: \"Schroedinger's Cat (Instrumental)\" by PDX Broadsides.

The subjects of this body of work are strong females inspired by classic 70's rock stars. Each page is filled with passion and intensity that is rarely collected in print.

You love it; you hate it - either way, you can blame me.\nIf we fund this thing, I'm gonna finish writing, make the art for, and do the sound and video editing for Season 1 of of Edie Ellen Poe, consisting of six episodes MINIMUM. Plus, a Kickstarter-exclusive PIxar-esque bloopers mini-episode. That's right! A special super-secret mini-episode just for you, because that's how much I love you. \nThese Might Be Episodes:\nThe Little Girl Who Lives in the Cemetery  \nThe Pied Kitten of Hamlin  \nThe Wormhole Ate My Sandwich: an overdue spellbook, a closet, and peanut butter sandwich.\nA Very Edie Ellen Poe Halloween Birthday Special  \nHome Sweet World Domination Center\nCatburglars \u2018R Us\nThe Bat Cave (No, not THAT Bat Cave.)\nPoe to Poe; a young Eddie Allan Poe pays a visit.\nFrankenEdie\nThe Dolls on Dead Hill\nA Dress with Flowers on It. Origin story. Involves a funeral parlor and a heist.\nHere's a Map.\nSome More Awesome Things This Series Will Contain:  \nStuff on this map. Stuff NOT on this map (imagination stuff!) Maybe some cows. Also, a skeleton who jumps rope.\nAnyone else grow up in dairy country?\nWTF is a \"moving storybook?\"\nIt's part read-aloud picture book, part voice-acted animation, part stick puppet theater. Everything is better on a stick. You know it's true.\nOh, look! Splatters! The images are hand-painted?! Cool.\nTell me about the Rewards Goodies!\nNew reward level! Check it out! For a $50 pledge, you will get a special 7\" x 9\" softcover commemorative book of Teddy Bears, the pilot episode of Edie Ellen Poe. This will be a special edition available through Kickstarter only. All pledge levels $55 and up will get the book automatically!\nNecklace: There's gonna be a necklace. In STEEL. Yep.\nPrints: Then, there's the Kittens of the Apocalypse!\nJust like the one hanging above Edie's bed!\nTell me another reason this is cool.  \nI'm a girl (well, I was one when I was really short.) Tim Burton. Edward Gorey. Charles Addams. Neil Gaiman. Not girls. You get it.\nWho is this appropriate for?\nDo you know this phrase? \"They're creepy and they\u2019re kooky, Mysterious and spooky, They\u2019re all together ooky...\" It's appropriate for you.\nBooks What I Made\nI have self-published two books. (These are made of good old fashioned \"paper.\")\nDeath's Daughter and the Basket of Kittens is a coming of age tale about the Grim Reaper's daughter, Belladonna, and her four death-absorbing kittens: Strife, Pestilence, Famine, and Fluffy. I made this with the help of 190 cool apocalyptic cats who funded my first Kickstarter!  \nNo kittens are harmed in this book. Everyone else is fair game.\nThis looks like trouble.\nDeath. Kittens. Basket. The trifecta.\nUntimely Death Alphabet, published in September 2011, is a collection of cautionary tales of small children about to meet their untimely demises, told in pictures in the shapes of letters of the alphabet.\nMy, what a big cover you have, my dear!\nThis picture brought to you by the letters Y and F. (They're the shy ones.)\nI love print books. But I wanted to see some stories moving around! So - MOVING picture books! Science!\nThe Money. Really?\nReally. \nI put off figuring out how much this was going to cost until the last minute because I knew it was going to scare the sh*t out of me. (My least favorite kind of horror!) It still does. It's a lot for someone's first foray into a new medium. But I thought a season should have at least six and a half episodes. You deserve no less. So here we are.\nLabor Costs\nThese Kickstarter funds would make the it possible for me to make a full season of Edie Ellen Poe. Basically, you are hiring an extremely small production company. Named Martha. My salaried rates are fantastic. I love eating beans and working weekends.\nSupplies\nI need a non-shitty video camera for the puppetry sequences. My phone kinda worked for this pilot, but... let's face it, this pilot episode is not going to make it onto an iMax screen. \nI also need microphones for Edie (whose voice lives in a different time zone from me) plus Raven t (whose Transylvanian accent is slaughtered by yours truly.) Plus more pixel real estate (AKA hard drives).\nPrizes! I mean, rewards!\nGotta make 'em. Gotta ship 'em. You deserve no less.\nUncle Sam.\nAuntie Oregon.\nKickstarter. They take a cut. You knew that, right? It's substantial (8.5-ish% of it all) but without them, you and I would be meeting in that back alley behind the pizza shop. The one that smells like dog poo? \nLet the diabolical fun begin!\nApocalyptic, maniacal love to you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have some experience doing sound and video editing and animation. I have worked through most of the learning curves using newer versions of the software, so I believe this presents no major obstacles.\n\nI have art making and story telling skills. And a vision. And tenacity, and a knack making things work. And making them attractive and funny.\n\nThe biggest challenge is that things could take longer than I think. I'm no fool to think I've learned everything there is to learn, but I'm trying to be realistic.\n\nAbout the goodies: I have administered one Kickstarter's rewards (for Death's Daughter and the Basket of Kittens) successfully (and learned a few things about envelopes and shipping along the way) so I think that part isn't likely to have too many snags.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Martha Hull\n2 created \u00b7 13 backed\nMartha Hull, artist, writer, necromancer.

Our goal is to highlight filmmakers's creative attempts to show the undead in new and unexpected ways. Zompire is ALL independent films. It's clever, innovative, horror filmmaking for intelligent audience members. It all takes place in an awesome neighborhood movie theater. If you love movies, we think it's the most fun you can have in October. \nComing to the festival? You can get ticket packages with exclusive T-shirts, lapel pins, pendants, shot glasses, and more by pledging at one of the \"ATTEND\" reward levels. If you just want a ticket, but no exclusive merchandise, you can click here to buy plain tickets.\nWhether you can come to the festival or not, we have some awesome rewards you can take advantage of, while supporting the wonderful world of Independent horror.\nOur Occult researchers have decoded the strange words inscribed on the Legendre sigil. These are names of 10 infamous directors... er, necromancers, who have assaulted the world with Undead menaces. (This is an homage to some of our favorite filmmakers.)\nSTRETCH GOALS\nSTRETCH GOAL $4,000 \u2013 The official Pre-Party will be Thursday, October 9th at the Lovecraft Bar 8-10 pm. If we reach this first stretch goal, we'll also have Undead entertainment by the lovely ladies of the Critical Hit Burlesque troupe, and give a $100 cash prize to costume contest winner.\nSTRETCH GOAL $5,500 - In order to be successful, filmmakers need to have the resources to make and market their films. Most festivals charge submission fees and just submitting a film to the major film festivals adds up fast for struggling filmmakers. However, most independent films need this kind of exposure to get funding for feature projects or find distribution for their works. Zompire has always been a low budget operation, so we have never had the ability to offer cash prizes that would assist filmmakers where they need it most. If we reach this stretch goal, we will award cash prizes to all 4 of our award categories:\n$150 Horde Award - Audience Choice, chosen by blind ballot. \n$150 Le Gran' Zombi - Awarded for overall excellence \n$150 Abby Normal Award - fresh perspective or other innovation\n$500 Tombe D'Or - the film that best exemplifies Zompire. \nSTRETCH GOAL $9,000 \u2013 If we reach this funding goal, we will award the following higher cash prizes to all 4 of our award categories: \n$1,000 Tombe D'Or  - the film that best exemplifies Zompire. \n$300 Horde Award - Audience Choice, chosen by blind ballot.\n$300 Le Gran' Zombi - Awarded for overall excellence \n$300 Abby Normal Award - fresh perspective or other innovation\nBrian just said, \"If you love watching the short blocks at the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival, you'll love Zompire, even if you think you don't like zombie or vampire movies.\" It's the same aesthetic: great indie short and feature films coming from student filmmakers, small studios, and everything in between.\nThe Clinton St. Theater has been a Portland fixture since opening in 1915. They are wonderfully quirky neighborhood theater, devoted to supporting Independent film. Photo courtesy of Dominique Lamssies.\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nKickstarter is great for getting the word out about niche events like Zompire. These amazing films deserve to be seen by a wider audience of cinephiles, and we're hoping Kickstarter will help us bring them more attention. Over the past couple years, we have put a lot of money into print and online advertising, but traditional media is expensive and has not reached the enthusiastic audience we need to ensure that the festival continues. We need to do something different, so we're turning to Kickstarter.\nWe have discovered from our H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival & CthulhuCon campaigns, that Kickstarter can bring together an amazing community of fans and can make the festival more fun for you through participation. It's also more fun for us because we can make cool stuff for you, which in turn gives you exclusive keepsakes of a fun weekend, complete with bragging rights!\nPutting on a festival is expensive. There are a lot of expenses behind the scenes that really add up. This will be our 3rd Zompire as organizers, and we really want to continue to bring quality independent horror to Portland. Unfortunately, the first two were not very well attended, and the 2013 festival was financially disastrous for us personally. We questioned whether or not we'd be able to continue putting on the event. This year is make or break. \nThe final reason is the most important! We have heard through underground sources that the Vampire Wizard, Zappardo, is raising an undead army to raze the City of Portland on the same weekend as the festival. Just like organizing film festivals, defeating undead armies is expensive! Your support will give us the means to produce unique forms of protection and undead domination to thwart Zappardo's evil plans. Help us help you to not die a grisly death at the hands of his vile revenants!\nOur exclusive Kickstarter rewards will help you survive the Undead assault! Shown is the Undead Domination Kit etched box, string of beads, mockup of pewter amulet, and T-shirt.\nLegendre's Sigil of Undead Mastery - this amulet is a key component of the bayou wizard's power, and is said to have origins as far back as the druids of the Celtic Isles. Passed from hand to hand, from trader to trader across the globe, this symbol takes the form of your choice: either a lapel pin or a pendant. Amulet is 1\" in diameter and cast in solid pewter with a red highlight, courtesy of Arkham Bazaar - Lovecraftian novelties and other oddities, and Queen Penguin Productions.\nT-shirt, Work Shirt, Hoody - features the ancient Sigil described above, printed in red and white by Sigh Co. Graphics, purveyors of unique apparel and accessories. The full sigil is also encircled by the mystical names of 10 of the most powerful Necromancers from the Colonies to Italy, and beyond. These powerful wizards have unleashed some of the most notorious Undead on the world, including the Pittsburgh zombie outbreak of 1968, the opening of a gate of Hell near New Orleans, the Vampire epidemic on the streets of London in 1931, and more.

The films shown at Zompire are not your father's zombie and vampire flicks. You won't see the same tired premises from the last 100+ years of horror cinema. This is all new from the twisted brains of today's brightest and hardest working storytellers, without the constraints of box office figures or committee movie making. Without independent filmmakers, Hollywood would have no one to steal great ideas from. This Halloween season, you could spend all your time watching reruns of classic horror films in theaters and on TV, but why not enjoy these fantastic films you've never seen before, and may not have the chance to see again? Please join us and support the vitally important genre of independent horror cinema.\nYou'll also be supporting independent theaters! Portland is blessed with several historic, independently-run movie theaters that offer an alternative to the homogenous re-makes and dumbed down fare that Hollywood provides. Most independent and family-run theaters are constantly on the verge of closing down. Whether you come to our film festival or not, attending other festivals and seeing films in these smaller venues keeps alive an important outlet for independent film. Without these establishments, you'd never be able to see indie films on a 50 foot screen with like-minded patrons of the arts.\nThe Louisiana origins of the Legendre Sigil and Undead Domination Kit\nIn the early 1800s, the notorious pirate Jean Lafitte and his charming brother Pierre ran their smuggling business out of a small blacksmith shop in New Orleans. This was a risky business, fraught with danger from not only the authorities, but also from those who perceived they had been cheated or conned by the brothers Lafitte. Death was rampant from Grand Isle and Barataria Bay to New Orleans, and it was whispered that the dead had a way of coming back to extract vengeance. The practical Pierre had engaged the services of a bayou wizard whose dank cabin, covered almost completely in spanish moss, stood hidden deep in the Louisiana swamp near Bayou Saint Denis. This wizard was notorious for his skill in the arts of Necromancy. During a renovation of the famed Blacksmith Shop, an old wooden box was uncovered by one of our associates in New Orleans. After viewing the contents, they knew it would be better to bring the box to us to study, than to let it become lost in the pages of history. We believe this box belonged to Pierre, and its ancient secrets were used by him and his brother to both ward off spectral attacks on hot, still, moonlit nights in Barataria Bay, as well as to fight back with their own newly risen undead minions.\nWho is Zappardo?\nOne of the few confirmed photos of Zappardo and his undead bride. In order to prolong his evil, he slit the throat of his fianc\u00e9e and sacrificed them both in an unholy rite that brought them back from beyond as bloodthirsty monsters.\nHis origins are shrouded in mystery, but our sources tell us he is a powerful and ageless vampire, who practices the dark arts of necromancy. He may be the legendary alchemist, the Comte de St. Germaine. Others believe that he is the Roman Centurian, Longinus, cursed with eternal life. Still others say, along with Vlad Tepes, he may be the inspiration for Bram Stoker's Dracula. Did he whisper undead secrets in the ear of John Polidori and share his carnal tales with Sheridan Le Fanu?

Like the H.P. Lovecraft Film Festival he founded in 1995, Zompire features amazing independent short films that challenge conventional filmmaking and storytelling. Many great films have premiered or been showcased at Zompire over the years, including The Revenant (2009 premiere preview cut; Directed by D. Kerry Prior), Dellamorte Dellamore (1994), the & Teller short films (directed by Frank Ippolito and Teller of Penn & Teller), and many more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhether or not our Kickstarter funds, the show will go on. Zompire will happen this year, at least. If our campaign is successfully funded, production and fulfillment of rewards will begin immediately. In addition to organizing events like this one, we have also been in the screen printing business for 12 years. As such, all T-shirts and apparel items will be produced in house, with the same quality Sigh Co. Graphics shirts are known for. We know what we're doing here, so we don't expect any delays in production. We will also be producing the Undead Domination Kit boxes in house, and have already constructed a prototype, so we know what tasks are involved in its production. The amulet lapel pin/pendant will be cast by a reliable independent creator that we have used for multiple projects, so we have a high degree of confidence that the production of the amulets will go smoothly. One possible danger when it comes to fulfillment stems from the possibility that our campaign may be *too* successful. Since all of the rewards are being produced by independent creators, including ourselves, instead of being mass-produced by large companies overseas, it is possible that a large quantity of orders will slow down fulfillment. If that happens, I'm sure you'll understand that the production of rewards will necessarily take longer. In any event, we expect that all backers who attend the festival will be able to pick up their rewards in person at the show.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "New Horror Film Festival for Portland, OR!", "update_content": "Greetings to our Zompire fans!\nWe have been getting questions about the future of Zompire: The Undead Film Festival and if it's happening this year.

I wrote it in 2010 and Viper picked it up for digital distribution in 2011. \nThe project came out digitally in 2012 to great reviews. Here's just a small sample of them:\n\"...five of five stars, it is awesome and well worth getting...this one is well worth the couple of bucks you will spend. Overall truly fun to read, and extraordinarily well done. I need to go find the physical copy of this comic book so I can add it to my own library.\"- Comics Forge\n\"Nohelty does a wonderful job pacing this series, letting the second half of issue 2 take you full steam into Ichabod\u2019s insanity (or maybe reality). There simply is no middle ground. When trapped with other asylum members, both alive and dead, Ichabod devises a way out of entrapment that relies on the literal \u201cintestinal\u201d fortitude of a slayed \u201cmonster\u201d to give then a lifeline of hope out of their pit of despair (for the obtuse, he climbs out of trouble using entrails \u2013 damn you obtuse and your obtuseness). Issue three becomes even more insane; once outside of entrapment Ichabod and his followers find a deserted wasteland (i.e. welcome to the apocalypse, kids). From here things just get stranger with Dune-like sandworms and a town that seems to be anything but salvation.\"- Ain't It Cool News\n.\"..I\u2019m glad I got the chance to read Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter. The journey is a strange one but I couldn\u2019t help but be enthralled the entire time.\" - My Comic Network\n\"IJ: MH is not just a visually cool-frightening book to look at. It\u2019s pretty mental too.\" - Buy Indie Comics\nWHY DO I NEED YOUR HELP IF I ALREADY HAVE A PUBLISHER?\nBecause I DON'T. I had a publisher yes, but those days are long past. \nWhile my ex-publisher was putting out the book electronically, I was ecstatic about the reviews and outpouring of support. But there was always something missing: a print run. \nI'd been trying to set up one ever since I started producing the book. In fact, we produced eight pages of never before seen content just for the trade!\nEventually, I was told that my publisher wouldn't put the print run together unless I funded it myself. I politely asked for them to relinquish the rights back to me so I could explore other venues, which they graciously did. \nNow the book is wholly mine again, and I'm raising money to get this book out there into your hands. Because to me, comics are meant to be felt, touched, and held; not read on a computer screen. \nAND THAT'S WHAT BRINGS ME TO YOU...\nI'm not asking for money in order to make a project. I've already made a project. It's finished. But it's a tremendous financial burden to pay everybody associated with the book, which I did. Thousands upon thousands of dollars. And I just don't have more funds to get this book out the door. \nWhat I need is your help to get the book printed, onto book shelves, to conventions, and into your hands in the way I've always meant it to be viewed. \nIt's been my dream since I was a kid to see a comic book in print, and the only way that will happen is with your support. \nSO WHAT'S IN THE BOOK ANYWAY? \nVolume one will bind the first four issues of Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter. \nA WORD ABOUT THE RECONNED REWARD TIERS: \nWe know they are high, really high, but getting you into the book as a character isn't a small amount of work. Regardless of the tier, it means redrawing pages that are ALREADY DONE. Remember, Ichabod's been done for years now. It even had an e-book run. \nPeople have been reading and enjoying it in a very specific way since 2011, and we're changing all of that for you. It also means delays in fulfillment as we rework all the pages. \nIt also means paying my artist his page rate for a second time, reworking panels, and whole pages just to fit with the story. \nLong story short, YES we know it's crazy high. YES we know most people wouldn't go for it. \nHowever, I also know people blow $10,000 on executive producer credits on movies and this is a way cooler.\nFor the rest of your life you'll be able to pull this book off the shelf and say you took an EXISTING property and the creator changed the entire mythos just for you. \nYou can say the creator rewrote, the artist redrew, and the book was reprinted with your face and name instead of what every person's been reading since 2011. \nThat's CRAZY AWESOME!!! Way better than some executive producer credit. \nFINALLY: \nFor those of you wondering if you should up your donation and get the sketch cards -- here's a taste of what you'll be getting. They are, objectively, awesome! \nTHE BUTTONS ARE EQUALLY AMAZING!!! \n AS IS THE POSTER!!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risk is if we don't raise the money.

On my own I've put together six mini-comics and zines, and contributed work to three small anthology minis.  I've sold minis at Fluke in Athens and Heroes Con in Charlotte.  I'm coming to Kickstarter to ask for some help with a project I'd like to try.  \nThe backstory: About a year ago I met a really wonderful woman who is originally from Strasbourg, France.  She wants me to travel with her to Strasbourg and the surrounding areas to meet her friends and family.  I would like to turn this adventure into a project. Now, I may not be as technically proficient as Craig Thompson's Carnet de Voyage, but I would like to try something similar: a sketchbook & diary comic detailing my time there: the places we visit, the countryside, her friends, the food, anything!

Well, for one I've never traveled outside the United States!  My viewpoint on the piece is one of a person who has read extensively about the world but has seen little of it.  For most of my life I've lived the southeastern US and only recently have I been able to travel to a couple cities elsewhere in the country, mostly for work.  Also, most art projects and comics are about the experience of visiting Paris, other pastoral regions of France, but not much on this northeastern tip of France.  (I'm excited to be so close to the Black Forest, a place that has figured so prominently in Western stories and storytelling). I've been working on my French, but I've only started to learn in this last year, so I imagine there will be some funny and embarrassing times with my attempts at the language.\nMy goal is this: to create a 20-30 page book of these adventures.  The amount I raise will determine the quality of the book.  I normally work in a DIY, print at a copy shop style, with the occasional screenprinted cover.  I would like to do the screenprinted covers myself, but have these books be more professionally printed.  \nThat's my pitch!

Books should never be thrown out when others can continue to enjoy their stories for many more years.\nWhat is the money used for?\nWe are asking for your help in funding the website and app. The money donated will be used for creating and maintaining the site and app. It will also go towards purchasing books for the site. We want to make sure there is a selection of good books that people want to read. Everyone has a different preference of what they like to read, so we want to have all types of books available from the start, whether they be fiction, nonfiction, poetry, history, educational, religious, children\u2019s books, etc!\nThough we have experience in programming on web and app platforms, some of the funds will be used to recruit others to help build the site. The goal is to have BookCoin available on the web, for iOS in beta form by early 2015, with an Android app to follow.\nWhat is the \"coin\" system?\nThe strength of BookCoin lies in the coin system. Each coin is worth one book; you get a coin for sending a book and use a coin to get a new book. Coins never expire, and books on the catalogue are available on a first come first serve basis, meaning no waiting lists! The coin system promotes a catalogue of quality books. One has the incentive to post books others want because they receive a coin for only the books they send out. Don\u2019t see a book you want right now? Don\u2019t worry: the catalogue is always changing and expanding.\nThe coin system is unique to any other trading site and provides lots of benefits. Trading using a coin system allows for a large catalogue of books to chose from and provides a safe, fair environment. Shipping is always paid by the requester of the book, and a shipping label is emailed to the sender. Because one cannot purchase more books then they have coins, it ensures that users will spend their coins wisely and also be encouraged to list quality books.\nOnce a user requests a book, his coin is put into a waiting system. The coin is then transferred to the sender once the book is shipped and marked \u201creceived\u201d or after a reasonable time after being shipped.\nIs it free and secure?\nThis website is free to join and all your information will be kept safe and secure! We will never give out any of your information without your consent.\nIs BookCoin expandable?\nBookCoin will provide an expandable base for a large group of users. The more users there are, the more books that are listed and the better opportunity to find exactly what you are looking for. Books and corresponding coins will initially be offered by the funds raised and coins will be given to supporters of BookCoin to use on books of their choosing.\nWhat experience do we have that will help us implement this project?\nKevin has a BS in Mathematics and a minor in chemistry. He has experience in programming on web platforms, programming for Android, for iOS, and for embedded micro controllers in assembly language and in C. Kevin\u2019s experience as president of the Math Club in college has given him administrative and team leading experience that will benefit this project.\nNicole is a Senior in college working on a BA in English with a concentration in creative writing. She loves books and has a vision for a free, easy to use book trading platform. Nicole has lots of books she wants to trade, but has not found a good, online platform to do so. This is where BookCoin comes in!\nWhat is our vision for BookCoin in the future?\nOur vision for the future of BookCoin is to see a great site and app expand into something book lovers use and adore. Our hope is that a successful site and app will allow us to give more coins to dedicated users as we personally upload more books to the catalogue. We may also introduce a BookCoin market for T-Shirts, bookmarks, and notebooks on the website! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe greatest challenge of BookCoin is the initial construction of the site and app. We want to build something expandable and robust from the start. We\u2019ll use the funds raised to assemble a team of specialists in web platforms, database, and apps design to help with the project. Once constructed, there will be nominal operational expenses of maintaining the site. As it expands to a larger number of users, the site will be maintained by donations from users.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Kevin J Cotton\nFirst created \u00b7 4 backed\nKevin Cotton graduated from CBU with a B.S. in Mathematics and a minor in Chemistry.

Polidori. The series consists of thirteen volumes of 96 black and white pages each. We have already translated the first three volumes - Forgotten Crimes, Children's Crusade, Small Miracles - as well as a special issue titled 'Obsession' that is an introduction to the main series and will be printed as a limited collectors paperback. The complete series of Desdemona comics will be published monthly by September 2014, in electronic format. They will initially be available through DriveThruComics, and later throughout ComiXology too. Your help is needed to help us to bring this awesome Italian heroine to you! This Kickstarter will raise funds for us to pay the members of our crew involved in this project: translators, graphic designers, editors, authors and illustrators, as well as cover shipping costs of the pledges and fund an audio-comic of the same series. Should the project be successful, we're planning to print the full series of Desdemona. Believe us, Desdemona is worth being read!!! \nLonCon3, August 2014\nHave in mind that by backing Desdemona's project you aren't just giving someone money, YOU are supporting our dream to create something that we want to see exist in the world!!!\nThis is an opportunity not only to help us in this project, but also to become acquainted with what we publish. \nWho is Desdemona? \n For our English-speaking readers who do not yet know - DESDEMONA METUS is the heroine created by the great minds of the Italian writers Andrea J. Polidori and Giuseppe Di Bernardo. She is a true heroine, an authentic figure of hope in our daily lives, who does not have super powers but a gift, the most precious and important gift of all: she knows how to bless the soul of her listeners. Reading the adventures of Desdemona Metus is to immerse yourself in unsolved mysteries, enigmas of the past and secret societies: all set in a grim, urban reality within the Italian city of Florence, where Desdemona lives and works. \n Florence is beautiful and shimmering yet dirty and dark. It's a city to explore carefully: there are alleys that hide heinous crimes and disturbing mysteries which, like its many gardens, are jealously guarded within ancient walls. Despite its status as a fashion capital, the Florence depicted by Polidori and Di Bernardo is a cruel, dark and medieval city, leaving lasting impressions upon every visitor, whether great or detestable, just as it does with Desdemona.\n Desdemona is the young radio DJ who hosts The Sleepless, a radio show where our heroine gets to know the absurd and mystifying characters of Florence who call into her live broadcast. She is the daughter of Isaiah Metus, a university professor with a troubled past and obscure connections. The two find themselves in constant conflict, as she blames him for her mother\u2019s death: a tragic event that caused the mysterious form of insomnia that plagues Desdemona. \nRead more about Desdemona's thirteen episodes at our website.\nSo if you want to enjoy DESDEMONA\u2019S intriguing series, by all means spread the news. Tell your friends, your family, even those to whom you owe money! Talk about her! Write about her! Do whatever you can to help raise awareness of Desdemona\u2019s adventures, so that all of us can enjoy the path that leads to the series\u2019 conclusion. Because Giuseppe Di Bernardo is a writer worth reading, and Desdemona is a book worth fighting for.\nDESDEMONA paperback exclusive issue will contents an introduction of the series by our publisher, the 30 pages short story 'Obsession', an exclusive interview with the author Giuseppe Di Bernardo, and a series of exclusive drawings showing Desdemona's trip to London.\n More images for Desdemona series:\n Below panels from issue #05 - artwork by Alessandro Scacchia\nDesdemona in the Italian news as L'Insonne:\nWatch Desdemona TV show pilot\nFunding\nAll the money raised by this project will be used to pay our crew for the work done up till now and towards the future publication of Desdemona.

Chibi album sized poster!\n\n\nHi, I'm Daniel de Sosa. I'm an American cartoonist born in the San Fernando Valley, and have been living in London for the past four years. I'm trying to publish the first 5 chapters of my fantasy comic series Oi! Tales of Bardic Fury in a beautiful one-colour manga sized volume. The first five chapters make up the first arc of Oi! and tells a self contained story about the forming of Iron Age Ireland's greatest rock band.\n\n\nSo what's it all about eh?\nOi! is inspired heavily by my passions for rock music, history, and ancient Gaelic culture and mythology. Traditional Irish music and poetry to me is the most beautiful in the world and more people need to know about the cultures great musical history. Iron Age Ireland was a culture controlled by mushroom chewing druids, where music was considered a form of magic, and even had the power to overthrow kings. Druids were like hippy cult leaders and Bards were like rock stars.  The more I researched and learned about ancient Irish society, the more ideas and characters began popping in to my head. I had to create a story in this setting. Soon Oi! was born.\nHurling in the rain\n\nThe story begins with Bryan, who has  has recently graduated from the great Academy of Tara, where he spent 12 years training to become a fully fledged bard.\nTo complete his training, Bryan must pass his final test: a year-long work placement in a tiny fishing village in the north called Oi, that has not been able to afford a town bard for 20 years. Bryan thinks it will be a laid back vacation chugging mead on the beach and laying with peasant daughters. Little does he know how wrong he is.\nHere's some of the characters Bryan meets in the town of Oi:\nServius of Sicilia-the sardonic town slave.\nFishbane and dolphin friend, Star Seal is the village druid. He doesn't swim, water just likes to be around him.\n Aideen \"The Mean\" O'Riada, Star Seal's older daughter, captain of the town hurling team and a savage beast.\nRhiannon O'Riada, Star Seal's youngest daughter, and set to inherit the village ahead of older sister Aideen because she was born with 'selkie hands.'\nIf this sounds interesting to you you can read the first two chapters FOR FREE online HERE.\nI am intensely passionate about these characters and telling their story.\naren't they just adorable?\nmodel sheet and concept art\nWhy so blue?\nThe ancient Gaels and Celts loved covering themselves in blue paint made from the woad plant. \nJust imagine of all that blue inky goodness inside.\nIf you are going to get this this story the way it should be seen, it needs to be printed in woad-coloured ink. I have been printing my comics for the past few years using a risograph machine. Riso-printing gives a unique effect and feel halfway between old offset printing and screen printing. Oi! volume 1 will be printed in riso because I want each page of this book to look and feel like a vintage gig poster.\nExamples of finished pages in mono-blue scale.\nThis all sounds super groovy. What do you need me for?\nThough I have already completed the first two chapters of Oi, it has taken 18 months to accomplish. This is because I have only been able to work on the comic in my free time outside a full time job. I write, pencil, ink, shade and letter the comic all by myself. Each page takes an estimate 6-10 hours to complete, depending on the complexity. It is work that I love doing, but I need your support to fund the completion of this comic at something quicker than a snail's pace. If this campaign is successfully funded, I will be able to focus the next 4 months of my time entirely on completing the next three chapters of Oi! Volume One, and bring the rest of the story to you at a much faster rate. I will also be able to get it printed up for you using the gorgeous risographic process, and sent to you in manga-sized book that I guarantee will stand out from anything else on your shelf.\n Additionally, I want to update some of the art in chapter one, which was drawn over a year and a half ago, to match my current style. Quite frankly, I've gotten better at drawing since it was made.\n If you liked the first two chapters so far,and can't wait to see what happens next to Bryan, Servies, Rhiannon, Aideen and Star Seal, even the smallest donation from you will help to make this book happen.\nDo I get some kind of reward for backing this project?\nHere are some of the cool things you can get for backing this project:\nOi!

We love how it turned out, and we hope you do, too. \n Greetings, and welcome to the world of Into the Void. This is Joe, and Jim and I are the creators of this all-ages action-adventure book. \nWhy Into the Void?\nAfter years of writing low-budget sci-fi/horror films, like \"Sand Sharks\", I wanted to devote myself to something that I could actually share with my kids. That's when Jim and I decided to revive an old webcomic of his called \"Into the Void\". From the beginning, the character designs were super-fun. We spent almost 12 months doing some universe-building and outlining the first 12 issues of what (we hope) will be an ongoing series.\nWhere does the money go?\nA very small amount of the money will cover Jim's art materials. While Jim and I both enjoy webcomics, we strongly feel that you just don't get the same experience as you do with a printed book. The majority of the money will be spent printing the first issue of Into the Void. We want to be able to put this book into people's hands so they can enjoy the book. \nWe will introduce stretch goals if we meet our fundraising goal that will help with the production of issue #2.\nIs this a kid's book?\nNo. While it's appropriate for all ages, it's not a book for kids. Think Indiana Jones, Doctor Who, or Star Wars (the original series only, please). Into the Void has that same gee-whiz fun feeling.  \nWill the book actually get finished?\nInto the Void issue #1 is completed and ready to go to the printer just as soon as we hit our goal.\nThank you so much for your consideration!\nFollow our progress on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/ITVComic", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've already selected a printer, and all the pages (except the credits page) are ready according to the printer's specifications.

He'd begun this hunting trip with high hopes of slaying a dangerous animal. Little did he know, that there is no more dangerous animal than a prey that can think and improvise. Little did he know, that he would be that very prey.\nShort Summary\nMy name is James Mascia, I am an English teacher at a high school in Maryland who is passionate about writing novels and comics for children and teens. I like coming up with new ways to interest young people in reading.  \nWe are working on a project called \"The Most Dangerous Game\". Some of you may be familiar with that title as it is the name of a short story penned by Richard Connell in 1924. The story is about a man who gets stranded on an island with a hunter who had grown bored hunting animals and therefore turned to a more challenging prey: human beings. When we are fully funded, we will be creating a version of this story with a science fiction twist to it, in which our main character, Rainsford, will crash on a planet run by a crazed alien who also hunts humans.  \nThe graphic-novel will be told in the style of a sci-fi thriller, in which the characters are pitted against each other in a fight for survival. It is my hope that by creating this, it will interest young people in some of classic tales.\nYour pledge will help get this graphic novel into the hands of students, and will help grow an interest in reading classic stories. With that in mind, what we plan on including inside this book is a teacher's guide, complete with comprehension questions, essay topics and lessons that can be utilized in the classroom. \nCharacter Concept Art - Zaroff\nWhat We Need & What You Get\nBy pledging to this project, you will help in the creation and production of \"The Most Dangerous Game.\" It will be used to pay the artists (So far, Satine Zillah, Michael Dolce) for their work on the pages and cover as well as the printing and distribution of the books themselves.

Here are some things that people have said about it.\n\"From the very first word until the last, Mr. Mascia had me enthralled within the world of teenage angst, super powers, evil villains, and trying to find oneself.\" - Danielle , Reviewer for Coffee Time Romance & More\n\"High School Heroes is definitely a cute, easy read that appeals to the comic-book side to everyone.\" - GloriousBooks.com\n\"Surprisingly Fantastic!\" - ReadingTeen\n\"Mr. Mascia has a great writing style and story telling ability. I was immediately interested, and my attention was held throughout the entire story.\" - Glata Grindstaff\nThe Poe Murders sells out at virtually every comic-con I have attended in the last year and has brought the works of Edgar Allan Poe to many students who had never read him before. This graphic-novel will get just as much intricate attention as my other projects to make it the best it can possible be, but that can only be done with funding.  \nOther Ways You Can Help  \nIf you are unable to contribute, please at the very least \"Like\" the page, and share on Facebook, Twitter and Google+.

If this stretch goal of $4150 is met, when LOVF is released, I will follow the course of my previous manic travels, this time on a book tour. I'll give talks, present slideshows, and sign books in NY, DC, LA, SF/Bay Area, Seattle, and Portland. Along the way I will post a daily webcomic tour diary on Facebook about the events, the people I meet on the way, and my memories from the 2012 mania that almost killed me. At the end of the Tour this comics diary will be published as a limited edition, signed and numbered minicomic.\n The LOVF Tour Diary mini has been added to the rewards, as well as a few more tiers to help support this tour. All Pledges at the $50 level or more will receive the Tour Diary for free.\nMy expenses are pretty bare-bones. I'll be couch surfing, getting cheap flights, dining in when possible, etc; anything to keep the costs down. I'm also not including the Kickstarter fees on this one, because I figure: hey, you're buying me a tour, I can at least pay the tax.\nLOVF Book Tour Stretch Goal: ($4150 total)\nTravel: $850\nLodging: $300\nFood: $500\nTOTAL -=> $1650\nLOVF is the sketchbook companion of a man literally losing his mind. In one month, following several personal tragedies, I was triple-diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder, PTSD, and crippling arthritis. As a self-professed over-achiever, I made sure things only got worse from there.\nWith wild energy, promiscuity, criminal activity, and substance abuse, this became a full-blown manic episode... all of it captured by LOVF, my trusty sidekick. Homeless and broke after losing all my stuff to punk rock heroin dealers, I suffered more misfortunes: getting beat up in the street, running from the law, and getting dragged out of a creek and into a mental hospital.\nLOVF is a travel journal.\nOff my meds I had only the sketchbook for art therapy. I filled it with cartoons, schemes, portraits, quotes, and an illustrated diary of my stumbles from Portland to Brooklyn, DC, LA, San Francisco, Seattle, and back. It\u2019s a psychedelic, Kerouacian meltdown of cross-hatching, spattered marker, crayons, glitter, tape, nail polish, white-out, fingerpainting, rain, wine, stickers, and word balloons.\nLOVF is a mirror. \nA bottle of lithium stabilized me and gave me new insights into identity. I cross-hatched and re-cross-hatched, painted in new figures, connected the dots, and reverse-engineered a full narrative from the notes of my three-month manic spree. It's like I found the diary of a homeless, crazy man and turned it into a comic book.\nLOVF is a 168-page, full-color, 5.5\u201d x 8.5\u201d, squarebound book.\nWith Kickstarter support, this one-of-a-kind art book will be counterfeited in multiple copies -- or as they say, \"published.\" Fantagraphics (who put out my most recent book, Couch Tag) will be covering most of LOVF's publication costs. But in these times of strange publishing markets, I paid for the rest with this Kickstarter:\nPublishing costs: $1600 (books, finishing , scanning)\nKickstarter and other fees: $250\nShipping: $500 (yikes! it's the sad truth...)\nNew Markers: $150 (many a pen has made its last mark in LOVF)\nTOTAL -=>  $2500\nI'll be posting Facebook updates as I finish the drawings for LOVF. If you'd care to follow me I'm \"Blue Fuzz\" on Facebook.\nMore about the Rewards\nThe 32-page mini LOVF New York: Destination Crisis contains material that will be reprinted in the book. But it is an art object unto itself with a three-color silkscreen cover, published by Robyn Chapman at Paper Rocket. Speaking of which, the LOVF Poster will also be printed by Ms. Chapman with three colors on heavy paper, 10\"x14,\" mailed in sturdy poster tubes. This poster was designed from images in the book by Jesse. Signed limited edition of 50.\nPlease note that the LOVFer is economically priced as a thank you bonus, yet in limited quantity. One per person. The small drawings included will be of random sizes, on random subjects, in random styles. I plan to make all of these at one sitting during one of my hypomanic weeks, so I can't tell you how many drawings you'll get, but they will be done on colored paper with pens, markers, paint, coffee, stickers, paper cutouts, glue, and whatever else seems right. I call this Hypomarkia. (No actually I don't.) All drawings will be suitable for framing, in the 2\"x3\" to 6\"x9\" range. (Drawings are not for sale individually -=> only as part of the LOVFer package, priced at $44, because I will be 44 when this book is published.) \nHere's what some people have said about my other books:\nCouch Tag\nA deeply affecting memoir   -- Comics Bulletin\nBeautiful and scary   -- The Comics Journal\n...Sucks you totally in and will leave you often nodding in empathy   -- Forbidden Planet\nThe Night of Your Life\nThat rare blend of pointed humor and specially brewed whimsy   -- Association of Alternative Newsweeklies\nAs sure-handedly and lucidly drawn as the subject matter is crooked and curious   -- San Francisco Chronicle\nAll Rewards are shipped free in the US.

I've actually been avoiding it so that I'll be able to tangle with the emotions it brings up WHILE I'm finishing the end chapter. If LOVF gets funded, it will give me the time and psychic focus to finish the book. \n\nAdditionally, living with severe pain and other arthritic problems has reduced my ability to work. I still need to finish the last 40 pages of this fully painted/cross-hatched art/comic book.

Us. We do the boring stuff.\nWe work in a wee studio in Sydney, Australia. It's nice here. Sometimes there is free chocolate. If this Kickstarter doesn't get funded, probably there will be less chocolate but THAT IS NOT GOING TO STOP US FROM MAKING COMICS. (Please help us get this Kickstarter funded.)\nWhere's the money going? That\u2019s the thirty thousand dollar question.\nWe were lucky enough to be able to create Vamp off the skin of our backs, but in order to bring Revamped to life, we need a little help from our friends.\n\nBefore we do anything, there\u2019s the 5% fee to Kickstarter. THEN there\u2019s another 5% processing fee since we\u2019re not a US-based project. (Boo.) This automatically cuts $3K from our budget.\nAnd so: $27K. With some of that, we\u2019re hoping to print both softcover and hardcover copies of Vamp. Setting and printing them locally, we expect that to take up around $9K of our budget.\nThen, we\u2019ve also got to sort out the art prints \u2013 again, with local printers (to save on shipping from them to us, and because BUYING LOCAL IS RAD) we\u2019ve put aside $1100 there. Them\u2019s gonna be some REAL NICE ARTS.\n\nThere will be some handling and packaging costs, but because we love you kids so much? We\u2019ll probably just sort that out ourselves. Those guys who put in extra for shipping outside Australia are the best \u2013 it can get spendy to ship things outside of our big old island.\nOkay! We\u2019re down to like $17K, and we haven\u2019t even started Revamped yet!\nWith the remaining funds, we\u2019ve got to illustrate all 88 pages of Revamped. Then (as with Vamp) we\u2019re converting it to both app and ebook, so we need to pay our programmers for that one. We\u2019re also doing another spooky soundtrack available for app readers, and our awesome audio guy needs to be reimbursed for the hours he spends locked in a soundproof box.\nThat should cover it.\n\nAnd if we get even more??? WE WILL SEND YOU ALL SO MUCH LOVE.\n\nTo begin, our stretch goals will involve sending cool stickers and postcards to our physical reward backers, but above $40K we\u2019ll have to come up with some bonuses for everyone!

As such, we've selected one of the best vendors available in Print Ninja (www.printninja.com). Their customer service is the best in class and they've received rave reviews from other Kickstarters. As part of the process, we'll receive both a digital and physical proof of the book prior to printing. This will allow us to identify any issues before we go to press.

Around the globe, people are celebrating this momentous occasion in many different ways, but no one honors Godzilla better than his homeland of Japan. The Big Godzilla Special Effects Exhibition will display original props, suits, production art and memorabilia in one centralized location - and it's only on display in Tokyo for two weeks. \nExhibits like these are rarely seen by westerners and only a small fraction of the English speaking world has ventured to the land of the rising sun to view them. They return home with tales and photos of movie history and have had them published in fan magazines and on websites for decades. But with recent advances in technology, we can now share these stories and images in beautiful high definition.\nPrevious displays of Godzilla props in Japan\nIf successfully funded, Kyle Yount, the host of the Kaijucast will travel to Japan to document the Big Godzilla Special Effects Exhibition and interview key members from Godzilla's sixty-year history. The images and footage collected will be edited into a feature length documentary that will be available on YouTube titled Hail to the King: 60 Years of Destruction. If we meet some stretch goals, this documentary could eventually be available through Video On Demand services.\nTHE TEAM\nKyle has assembled a fantastic team to manage the campaign and get the ball rolling here in Portland. The campaign will be managed by Mikhail Hamilton, an amazing event coordinator who will keep our deliverables on track and everything in check both during the campaign and after it is successfully funded. Assisting in communication with our contacts in Japan will be our interpreter, Naoko Horikawa. Without a native Japanese speaker here on our team, correspondence with our friends in Tokyo would be next to impossible in such a short timeframe. We also have an awesome group of artists and fans who are helping to create some of the incredible perks for the campaign. Seriously, check out those rewards to the right!\nTOKYO BOUND\nOnce in Japan, Kyle will meet up with another talented group. In addition to being fans of the kaiju genre, Jim Ballard and JR Lipartito operate ACTV Japan and will be capturing the experience and interviews during the four-day visit. Their shooting style and eye for detail will provide the documentary with a cinematic level of professionalism. Their experiences in shooting SciFi Japan TV will be key. Definitely check out the video below to see the skills they will bring to our documentary.\nBACK IN THE USA\nAfter the journey, Kyle will return to Portland and connect with long-time friend and supporter of the podcast, Martin Vavra. Martin runs Galaxy Sailor Productions, a Portland-based video production company. Together, they will begin the arduous process of transforming this raw footage into the feature-length documentary. The target date of completion is November 3rd, Godzilla\u2019s birthday and the sixtieth anniversary of Gojira's 1954 debut.\nMONEY TRAIL\nHow does your donation help make this project a reality? The $8,000 goal covers Kyle's flight to Japan and room & board in Tokyo, compensation for our filmmakers (who are pretty much doing this for a song), creating the backer rewards and the fees involved with a fully funded Kickstarter campaign. Without reaching this modest goal, the project cannot become a reality.\nSTRETCH GOALS! [Updated 07.29.2014]\nThankfully the project is fully funded! Now, as mentioned previously we do have stretch goals! \nSTRETCH GOAL #1 RAISE $9,500 - ACHIEVED!!!\nOur first bonus level for this project was to hire the camera crew for one more day of filming. Obviously, this means we are bringing back approximately 50% MORE footage for the documentary. We have some really great shots we want to get and interviews that we want to film. Which brings us to....\n STRETCH GOAL #2 RAISE $13,000 - ACHIEVED!!!\nWith this goal, we get a fantastic opportunity to reach out to the familiar faces to Godzilla fans, actors. The details are a little blurry right now, but with this funding we have a chance to speak to key cast members more than we did before. \nSTRETCH GOAL #3 RAISE $17,000 - ACHIEVED!!!\nIt's not only a lofty goal but it's also a big stretch, but I want to emphasize the importance of this goal. I am by no means a skilled photographer. Hitting this mark allows me to bring a photographer along, my friend and lifelong kaiju fan, David Eric Dopko. Recently David was taking photos at G-FEST XXI and I was very impressed with his skills. David will also be documenting the documentary by taking stills and assisting me with the additional video that must be shot outside of our time with the camera crew.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTime is of the essence! Without a doubt, our biggest challenge is the ticking clock of funding this project, traveling to Tokyo and documenting this exhibit in a very short timeframe. If we meet our goal, we will only have four days in Japan to capture this monumental opportunity. \n\nAdditionally, time also comes into play once the team assembles back in America. With less than three months to create the documentary, Martin and Kyle have their work cut out for them but they are excited to have the opportunity to work together.\n\nOf course other challenges exist - the team will need to keep backers updated and coordinate with the creative collaborators to make sure the backers get their perks on time for donating. But while the entire team is fully committed to making this project a reality, only your donation can get this documentary off the ground. Please help us celebrate Godzilla's legacy by contributing to this independent documentary and thrilling kaiju fans around the world.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "Final Mecha Monster Backer Level Update", "update_content": "Hello!

Thanks for stopping by! My name is Sam Midwood and I was born in a funeral parlor in Brooklyn. Now, let me tell you why we\u2019re here\u2026\n\nI\u2019ve written a mini-series called THE PROJECTIONIST and I need your help, your generosity of spirit, to breathe life into issue #1. That\u2019s 24-pages of supernatural detectives, tough-as-nails cops, poltergeists, clairvoyants, goo-guns, and shadowy corporations. Oh! There\u2019s also a dog named Ivan (after Ivan Reitman director of Ghostbusters) who... well\u2026 OK, I won\u2019t spoil my favorite bit in the book for you. But, I will tell you a little more about...\nTHE PROJECTIONIST takes place in a world where ghosts exist and everyone knows it, in a society that polices its dead. Our central character is private detective Ethan Plane -- Ethan has the ability to ASTRAL PROJECT. While traveling outside of his body, Ethan is mistaken for a fugitive spirit and forced to go on the run from paranormal cops. If captured, Ethan will be doomed to suffer an eternity in some hellish afterlife.\nWTF is ASTRAL PROJECTION?!\nASTRAL PROJECTION is the art of traveling outside of one's physical body. You've heard of people having out-of-body experiences? Astral projection is having an out-of-body experience, but, on purpose.\nETHAN PLANE Pin-Up\nWTF is NECROPUNK?! \nNECROPUNK is the aesthetic. It is a world saturated in death. A society drunk on formaldehyde. The Dead are creeping into The Land of the Living and, little by little, eating it away. Buildings are decaying, subway tracks are rotting, the faint whiff of ether fills the air.\nWITH THIS KICKSTARTER we will be producing the first 22-page issue of THE PROJECTIONIST six part mini-series in digital and print formats. The script is all ready for art, we've got a good price on a small but quality print-run, and we are beyond excited to get this first book out to you fine souls.\nTHE TEAM\nDAVID DAZA (Pencils/Inks)\nPencils & Inks -- David Daza. David is a machine. Aside from banging out 22-pages in under 48 hours for the Reddit 48-Hour Comic Challenge, David's credits include STAR WARS: The OLD REPUBLIC (Dark Horse), TRANSFORMERS (IDW Publishing),  and Buckaroo Banzai (Moonstone). Collaborating with David is pure joy. He knows what I'm looking for even before I do. I could not ask for a better artist to ride this ghost train with. Check him out right here.\nMARTA MARTINEZ (Colors)\nColors -- Marta Martinez. Marta is, pardon my French, a bad-ass. She has colored BATMAN, SUPERMAN, IRON MAN, CAPTAIN AMERICA, WONDER WOMAN, WOLVERINE, ad infinitum.  Marta is a genius.You give Marta a couple of notes and she comes back with a masterpiece. She's also in a rock band.Check her out right here.\nSAM MIDWOOD (Words)\nWords -- Sam Midwood. What can I say about Sam that hasn't already been said by Sam himself?! While Sam is no stranger to writing -- he wrote his first play when he was nineteen and produced it in big bad New York City -- this is his first, but most certainly not his last, comic book. He also LOVES to talk about himself in the third-person.\nPAGE 2 of \"THE PROJECTIONIST\"\nTHE MONEY\nWhere does the money go? It goes primarily to the artists -- David and Marta. I don't take a penny. Each page costs roughly $220 to produce, which is relatively cheap considering the level of talent we have.The rest will go to cover the cost of a small print run, backer rewards, and shipping.\nHow to a make a pledge? Simply click the green BACK THIS PROJECT button. You will be asked to enter your pledge amount and select a reward tier. You will then go through the Amazon checkout process.\nFAQ\nWhat if I have other questions? See the KICKSTARTER Frequently Asked Questions right here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPlenty!

Rotting to death with no one believing his story, he is rescued by what appears to be a guardian angel.\nTraveling back to the beginning of time, Professor Kane becomes THE FARO, and takes over the world as its ultimate warlord, until he is destroyed by The Wrath of GOD.  \nAfter his supposed \"Death\" Faro wakes up in a New York City brothel on the eve of the Civil War, where he appears to look 20 years younger.  The guests in the brothel on that fateful night, a young and brash John Wilkes Booth and a then Presidential hopeful Abraham Lincoln.  \nFARO starts out as a time travel story, slowly morphs into a wild and erotic love story before culminating in the ultimate tale of redemption.\nThere are a lot of indie comics to choose from, that's why I wanted to really explode onto the market by doing FARO 1 in a graphic novel format.  Using 26 artists across 5 continents, it took 7 months from the day we were funded till we had a beautiful bouncing baby book.\nThe small success of FARO has gotten me into the ranks of the Miami based monsters at CREATURE ENTERTAINMENT which has lent me the talents of two of their top mercenaries, Jeff Dekal, who will be doing the cover, and Jose Varese, who will be drawing the very dark and disturbing scene -- The Origin of Domina Palms\nInterior sketches from Jose Varese\nThe Ravenous Jose Varese will also be drawing the poster for FARO -- Chapter 3.  \nAs a special limited reward,  Jose Varese & Pat Broderick will be doing BLANK COVER COMMISSIONS, either for a FARO blank or any superhero blank of your choice. \nWe hope this is the first of many FARO CREATURE FEATURES.\nSOLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!-- Now go design your own commission and immortalize your vision\nDrawing the second half of FARO 2 is Tampa's silent warlock, the great Pat Broderick, who kicked some natural ass as one of the all star artists on FARO -- Chapter 1.\nAfter a look into a dark fate for New York, Pat's scene takes you to post-Civil War New Orleans, where a new game is proposed that has Abraham Lincoln captured and Congress wiped out in an attempt to take over the Gulf of Mexico.\nPaolo Pantalena Original Art Available\nThe only hope for Lincoln's New America lie in those still loyal to his cause, who must uncover the connection between the French Emperor, the KKK Militia, and The Circle, the elite group of trillionaire time travelers who've been stranded in the aftermath of FARO 1.\nFARO, as always is aided by his friend & sidekick, MUZIO the MAULER, as well as a new addition to the crew, Rachel Rain -- the Ace of Blades.\nWith the campaign for Chapter 2 officially underway, we are proud to announce that Chapters 3,4 & 5 are already in pre-production, so the future of Faro is bright.\nRemember, this isn't just a story, it's a ride through an immortal's insanity\nThanks for being a part of our world and we hope you enjoy reading Faro as much we enjoy making it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge to FARO 1 was coordinating so many artists schedules and making sure the right pages went to the right colorists and letterers.
