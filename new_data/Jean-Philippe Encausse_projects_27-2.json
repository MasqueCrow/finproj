[{"backer": "Jean-Philippe Encausse", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Introducing Gamma, the ultimate all-climate jacket. Gamma Jacket is a durable, lightweight, insulated jacket that doesn\u2019t compromise function or fashion. Building on graphene's amazing properties, Gamma is your everyday jacket, your travel jacket, your activewear, and your going-out jacket. \n\nBack us today and discover why Gamma is the only layer you'll ever need whether you're hiking the Ko\u02bbolau ranges in Hawaii or skiing in the Swiss Alps or biking to work.\nWhether you are hiking in the mountains or popping into town for a coffee, the heat-insulating design will warm you up in a matter of seconds. Gamma is the only jacket you\u2019ll need all year round, all around the globe.\nGraphene is what makes Gamma unlike any other activewear. Graphene is a nano-lattice - just one atom thick, yet it\u2019s stronger than diamond. Known as \u201csupreme graphene\u201d for its long list of properties and benefits, graphene is the thinnest, strongest, and most flexible known material.\nBy infusing a graphene layer into the Gamma Jacket, we were able to create a new kind of outerwear. Gamma functions as a winter jacket, a cool-weather jacket, a windbreaker, a rain jacket, and activewear all at once.\nWhile traditional synthetic insulation is the standard, it\u2019s nowhere near the level of warmth that a graphene-infused jacket has. Gamma takes graphene-integrated clothing to a whole new level of modern sustainability and style. Lightweight, all-seasonal, strong, and breathable.\nGraphene\u2019s thermal properties have been called revolutionary. It is able to adapt to your body almost like a second skin. Graphene moves heat through its latticed structure, evenly distributing it around your body. In warm weather, it expels heat and wicks moisture to keep you cool.\nGraphene conducts heat from your body and Gamma\u2019s built-in heaters and channels it throughout the jacket. In cold weather, it evenly distributes heat to your entire upper-body. In hot weather, it expels heat through its permeable pores.\nWith Gamma, you won\u2019t have to wear multiple layers or bulky coats. Gamma\u2019s graphene layer will regulate its temperature based on your environment, so you\u2019ll stay comfortable in temperatures from warm to frigid.\n\nFrom city strolls to hikes to snowsports, Gamma will keep you at your ideal temperature.\nGamma is equipped with 3 carbon fiber heating elements built directly into the jacket. When your body heat isn\u2019t enough, you can supercharge Gamma\u2019s graphene layer at the push of a button.\n\nWithin seconds, the heaters will begin to warm the jacket, and graphene will distribute the heat to your entire upper-body. Graphene\u2019s thermoregulating properties also ensure the jacket won\u2019t become too hot.\n\nGamma\u2019s built-in heaters will keep you warm and comfortable even in sub-zero conditions. No need for more layers, even on the coldest days.\n\nGamma\u2019s heaters are powered by any power bank. Just plug it into the USB-A input in the inner pocket and the jacket will begin to heat up.\nCombined with graphene's thermoregulating properties, unlike other materials, Gamma will never overheat or ignite. Even if you leave the heater on or fall asleep in the jacket, there is no risk of burns or overheating.\n\nGamma's built in heater comes with 3 adjustable temperature settings that you can cycle through with the press of a button to help fight every kind of cold!\nThese are estimates tested in ideal conditions and may not be precise as various conditions including temperature, your power bank's efficiency, etc. may affect the final achievable time.\nThe carbon fiber heating elements won\u2019t restrict your movement or weigh you down. Because the jacket doesn\u2019t contain any electrical parts or batteries, you can machine wash it without the risk of damage.\nGamma contains many pockets, including several hidden pockets, making it practical at home and safe while traveling. Anything you used to stuff in your tote bag can now be stored in your jacket.\nHead to the campground, office, or airport with everything you need close to your body with Gamma's secure pockets.  \n\nGamma\u2019s fit is fully adjustable to ensure your comfort and to protect you from the elements, whenever you need it.\nAdjustable drawstrings in the hood and waist lock in heat and protect against wind. \nVelcro cuffs and a high neck secure your wrists and guard sensitive skin.\nBuilt-in fingerless gloves to protect your hands without hindering your grip.\n  Tired of heavy jackets and puffy layers?\n\nGamma is the solution. Graphene isn\u2019t just the strongest known material. It\u2019s also the thinnest. At one atom thick, it\u2019s lighter than air\u2014literally. This makes Gamma incredibly lightweight and flexible\u2014perfect for folding, storing, packing, and shoving in your backpack. Traveling with Gamma can save heaps of space in your luggage, especially for minimalist backpackers.\nNote: as we continue development and prototyping, Gamma's final weight may either increase or decrease as we build out our final product and fabric mix. \nGamma weighs as much as the average hoodie. Yet, it can keep you warm as well as a thick winter coat.\nGraphene, a material stronger than diamond, can resist almost all forms of damage. It's scratch-proof, puncture-proof, tear-proof, and abrasion-proof. Feel safe in Gamma knowing you can wear it in the toughest conditions.\nGamma resists surface wear caused by rubbing or scratching, resisting scuffing or tear. You can expect Gamma to still look like fresh and new after years of heavy use.\nNote: Gamma has not been tested / certified to be bulletproof, cut-proof, or knife-proof and should never be used as a safety device. We also do not recommend as a complete replacement over a certified motorcycle jacket as it does not have padding or shielding. \nGraphene is able to expel heat without letting cold air inside the jacket, so you\u2019ll never feel that sticky, sweaty feeling you get from most shells, rain jackets, and winter coats.\nGraphene\u2019s semipermeable structure also makes Gamma the ideal jacket for warmer weather in autumn and spring. Gamma will keep you cool when the sun comes out by releasing excess heat\u2014graphene knows when to do this by detecting and reacting to your body temperature.\nIf you\u2019re using Gamma as sportswear, graphene will pull heat and moisture away from your body, moving it to the outer surface of the jacket and expelling it into the air. When you\u2019re on the slopes, jogging, or ice skating, Gamma will keep you feeling cool while maintaining your core temperature.\nDon\u2019t worry about working up a sweat in Gamma. Graphene is 100% anti-odor, meaning no odor-causing contaminants can grow on the jacket.\n\nGraphene interacts with sweat odors and neutralizes the smell through ionic conduction, efficiently removing bad smells and neutralizing any harmful substances on its surface.\nWith Gamma, never worry about your jacket smelling like sweat.\nGamma was built for unforgiving alpine conditions. Combining the naturally wind resistant and water resistant nature of Graphene's compact atomic bonds and our proprietary weave, Gamma is waterproof and windproof. \nWhether you\u2019re strolling in a light mist or stuck in a monsoon, you can count on Gamma to keep you dry and warm.\nEven though Gamma is lightweight and thin, its graphene infused technology is effective up to 50 Miles per hour / 80 Kilometers per hour winds.  Gamma is an absolute must whether you're just road biking or doing some high altitude skiing or hiking.\n\nDid you know that harmful UV rays can penetrate many light jackets, windbreakers, and raincoats? This can cause burns and skin damage when outdoors for long periods.  Gamma is UV-proof and keeps your skin safe from the sun when you're outdoors. \nGraphene repels UV light, also helping you to stay cool in the sun. \nGamma is designed and sized for a comfortable yet slim look. The tailored fit is neither too loose or too tight, creating high flexibility for the wearer. \n\nAll our sizing and designs are unisex so your sizing may not map. Make sure to take measurements. Sizing will be selected at the end of the crowdfunding campaign through surveys.\nWe charge no restocking fee for size exchanges, but customer must ship the product to us at their own expense. Depending on reshipped address, we may pass on part of the cost of reshipping up to $15-25 USD. Jacket must come back unwashed and in brand-new condition with no visible scuffs, marks, or discolorations. \nThe story of Wear Graphene started back in 2004, when graphene was first discovered. Graphene was such a monumental discovery \u2014 the strongest and thinnest material on Earth \u2014 that it earned its discoverers a Nobel Prize.\n\nAbout 10 years later, scientists first began to understand how to incorporate graphene into fabric. \n\nThis is where we come in. Our team is composed of young visionaries that want to make a change in the world by innovating new products using cutting edge materials. Our team believes that high fashion and technology can be combined to bring smart clothing to the next level.\n\nBut we knew that with graphene, our smart clothing would do more. It\u2019s also anti-odor, UV-proof, waterproof, wind-proof, damage-proof, and so much more. It\u2019s the most versatile and high-performance jacket ever made. And we think it looks pretty cool too.\n\n The Gamma! We have to fast forward to show you all the features and pockets in one go!\nPLAY\n\nUntil recently, we have focused our marketing for Gamma in Asia. Now, we would like to grow our presence overseas, starting on Kickstarter to \u201ckickstart\u201d our brand globally. Our existing supply chains and processes will allow us to manufacture and fulfill your order quickly.\n\nWe hope that you share our passion for smart and sustainable clothing and choose to become a backer of Gamma Jacket!\n\nWear Graphene is a Hong Kong-based team of scientists, designers, and business people who are dedicated to changing the way you wear clothes. With a focus on innovating through technology and sustainability, our team has developed a completely new type of graphene-infused smart clothing that we\u2019re very proud of.\n\nThe team is excited to launch our first product to a global market with Gamma Jacket.  \nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp. Since 2012, Backercamp has helped 5,000+ creators make their projects a reality, raising over $300MM through crowdfunding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have had ample experience in design, manufacturing, and sales in the past.

Full of LEDs, smarts and no larger than regular dice, they can be customized to light up when and how you desire. Incredibly strong, smooth and sharp, they work for several hours at a time, after which you can simply recharge them with the accompanying case. Pixels know which way they roll and can communicate with your phone or tablet via Bluetooth. This means they will work with Roll20, Foundry or any one of your favorite online platforms.\nPLAY\n\nDepending on the design you select, the LED lights will either shine through the entire face (Midnight Galaxy and Aurora Sky) or only through the numbers (Onyx Black and Hematite Grey).\nPLAY\n\nBecause of all the electronics and the battery, Pixels tend to be slightly heavier than regular dice of the same size. As a result they feel really nice in your hands, sound like proper dice, without being nearly as heavy as metal dice.\nAurora Sky Pixel next to a few other types of dice\nWe\u2019ve put a lot of effort in Pixels to make sure they are just as easy and convenient to use as regular dice. We\u2019re really excited to have been able to fit all the electronics inside such small packages.\nOnyx Black Set next to other types of dice.\nPLAY\n\nDice are made to be rolled, tossed, thrown and dropped. Fortunately, Pixels are really strong and don\u2019t expect you to be careful handling them; all the electronics are encased in very tough resin. Your Pixels will last for many years!\nBecause Pixels are cast in resin, there are no screws, no flaps, no parting lines anywhere; the dice are perfectly smooth! Programming and recharging the dice are both taken care of wirelessly, a significant technical challenge in such a small form factor, but one that we strongly believe was worth it!\n In fact, Pixels are fully waterproof! :)\nPixels are, above all, great dice for your table games. This means that balance and fair rolls are just as important to us as all the fancy electronics inside. We have dedicated a lot of time, design and testing to make sure they are as fair as possible. With a combination of small counterweights and precise attention to the finish of our edges, we\u2019ve already made Pixels surprisingly well balanced. And of course we will continue to improve the balance before release.\nPLAY\n\nFairness comparison with well-known brands (Comparison Data Credit of Mark Fickett)\nPixels speak Bluetooth. This is how the companion app communicates with the dice to reprogram them. It is also how the dice communicate back with the app to report what you rolled. In this early version of the app, we use the functionality to have your phone play sound effects based on your rolls.\nPLAY\n\nHowever the Bluetooth protocol used by the dice isn\u2019t proprietary, and many other apps will be able to talk directly to the dice as well. We are already in talks with D&D Beyond, Roll20, Foundry, and a few others to integrate Pixels directly.\nPLAY\n\nAnd while the dice can connect to your phone or computer for extra fancy features, that is not at all a requirement. Once you\u2019ve customized your Pixels, you can put your phone away and just use them for as long as you want. Or until you get tired of the color scheme and decide to try something new ;)\n\nIt was very important to us that Pixels be \u2018dice\u2019 first and foremost, and that design philosophy extends to the software side of things as well. They are just as easy to use as any other dice. Just pick them up, roll them, and they\u2019ll light up! That\u2019s it.\nThe dice use a small rechargeable battery. The battery, while absolutely tiny compared to a typical cell phone, is large enough to power the dice for several hours. In fact, in our tests, we\u2019ve averaged 5 hours of use on a single charge. And if you only use Bluetooth but don't have the dice light up, then you can easily record more than 20,000 rolls on a single charge (Check out the video in the Balance section).\nPLAY\n\nOnce your session is over, Pixels will recharge conveniently in the accompanying case. Every single Pixel will come with its own charging case, and every set will come with a larger one.\nPlace the die in its case. Make sure the highest face is up (20 in the case of the D20) and it will recharge in an hour or so.\nThe lid of the case contains a small magnet that will prevent the dice from turning on and lighting up during transport. Don\u2019t get us wrong, glowing pockets are cool and all, but not being able to flex your flashy dice isn\u2019t; we wouldn\u2019t wish that on anyone.\nBattery Voltage over ~1000 rolls.\nThe To-Go case next to the standard individual case.\nAny 7-dice set you get will come with a To-Go carrying case. This larger case has its own battery, and room for 8 dice. It will be able to recharge all your dice 2 or 3 times before needing to be recharged itself. Great for when you are not necessarily close to an outlet or if you just want to keep your dice topped-up while you play.\nPLAY\n\nThe case will let you carry any set of dice. Want a full set? No problem. Need to have 8D6 for some reason? You got it! The case and individual chargers both use the same insert system, so you can customize the dice layout as much as you want.\nPLAY\n\nPixels are completely customizable. Thanks to the accompanying app, you are in control of how the dice light up. Want to create a quick colored theme? No problem! Prefer a colorful set of patterns instead. Go right ahead! Using the accompanying app, you can control exactly how the dice light up and when.\nPLAY\n\nUsing a Condition -> Action system (similar to IFTTT) you can describe exactly under what condition you want the dice to light up or even your phone to play sounds (if connected).\nPLAY\n\nAt any time you can easily preview your creation directly on a die and make sure the result is exactly what you want.\nRoll20, Foundry and D&D Beyond are all working with us to ensure Pixels are supported on their platforms.\nWe are also discussing potential integration with Fantasy Grounds.\nIn addition to the planned Official Integrations, we are committed to keeping the Pixels' API completely Open Source and available on Github.\nAll of Pixels Software and Firmware code is available on GitHub.\nThis means that even if we are not supporting your favorite platform directly, you will be able to use 3rd party integrations, or even better, write your own.\n\nPixels will allow developers to write their own apps, and do that even for commercial purposes. If you are interested in writing games / apps / integrations that use Pixels, consider one of our limited Devkit D20 Addons.\nIf you are a developer, grab one of the D20 Devkit Addons and receive a sample shortly after the campaign ends.\nAlthough every Pixel can be used as a Dev Kit, if you grab one of those addons, you will receive an Early D20 so you can get a head start on development.\nPixels are not only Open Source, but also Open Hardware! Pixels wouldn\u2019t exist without the open-source and open-hardware communities, and so we think it the right thing to do to share our work as well.\nPixels Design Files are also Open Source\nMost of the design files are already available on Pixels Hackaday.io project page, along with multiple prior prototypes and documentation of our adventures getting to the final versions of the dice.\nThe \"core\" of a D20 Pixel\nIf you are interested in using Pixels, have a question or suggestion for future updates, or just want to show your support, stop by our Discord!\nThis is also the place were we tend to share the most up-to-date developments. \n\nPixels have also appeared in the following publications:\nPixels use RGB LEDs that are individually controlled to give you the most flexibility possible. Choose dice that will either glow entirely (brighter overall), or only through the numbers (more readable when lit) and let your creativity decide how they light up. \nClick on the image below to check out high-res pictures of all the available designs.\nHead over to the Pixels website to see High-Resolution pictures.\n\nCan't quite find the exact combination of dice you need? Add one or two more singles to your pledge. \n Eager to start integrating Pixels with your app? Grab one of the limited Early Devkits!\nAll the rewards consist of a combination of Single dice and 7-dice sets. For instance, if you pledge at the 1 Die level, you get 1 single die. If you pledge at the Set level, you get 1 set. If you go for a 2 Set + 2 Dice, you get 2 sets and 2 singles. What those singles and sets are is up to you! You get to pick the size and design of each.\nIf you are not able to get exactly the combination you want from the rewards, we will also offer Addons. Want a Standard Set with 2 extra dice? No problem: Back at the Byte level and tack on an extra Single die! All Addons will ship at the same time as your rewards.\n\nNot sure which level to back at? Here are some suggestions:\nPlease note that the rates below are estimates, exact shipping costs will depend on your country and shipping speed. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first physical product that we will be bringing to market, so there is no question that many challenges are still ahead of us. This is why we have been working with a manufacturing partner to help us through the process and pair us with reputable and reliable manufacturers. At this point, we have two manufacturers lined up and able to begin production.\n\nBased on the feedback we got from factories, we expect to ship rewards in 12 months. However, please understand that this is an estimate. While we hope start delivering rewards sooner, we fully expect to have many issues along the way, no matter how hard we try to avoid them, and so it possible that it will take us longer to finish production. After all, getting this far was anything but easy and there is no reason to think that things should change during production! :)\n\nWe are, however, committed to making Pixels a reality and to keep the entire process transparent. This was a passion project before it was a product, and seeing the excitement spread throughout the community has almost given us a sense of duty to making flashy-connected-dice happen in the open.

But smell? Not really! \nSmell Inspector is a developer\u2019s kit and ready-to-use electronic nose gadget in one. For anyone working on smart systems - from developers or scientists to tinkerers. Immediately usable for manufacturers who want to control their production environment and the quality of their products.\nSmell inspector is a digital nose, which works with the same principle as a human nose. Train it and create your own specific use case for single gases, gas mixtures or smells.\n\nComponents\nSmell Inspector\nThe gadget contains Smell Board iX16\u00d74 with four Smell iX16 detectors, can be connected to a PC, tablet or smartphone and can be operated with the Smell Annotator software. Compatible with Arduino and Raspberry Pi.\nSmell Board iX16x4\nElectronic board with four Smell iX16 detector chips, providing full functionality to read signals from all 64 individual detectors every 1.8 s and send them out in ASCII format. Can be integrated into different mobile or stationary appliances. \nSmell iX16\nThis is our core invention: The first multi-channel gas detector chip designed to conquer the mass market. The sensor elements contain fine-tuned carbon nanomaterials which make the chip highly sensitive, small, energy efficient and affordable. There are four Smell iX16 detector chips on the electronic board. The current version has 64 detectors (16 channels per detector chip) with a size of less than 1sqmm (0.08sqinch) each. Further miniaturization and / or increasing the number of detectors can easily be done. The detector chip Smell iX16 only needs 1 \u00b5W of power supply. It can thus be powered by various host devices, energy harvesters or batteries. Smell iX16 is designed for use in unlimited miniaturized electronic and IoT applications in various areas. The detector chip has a high sensitivity to different gases and VOCs.\nSmell Annotator\nSmell Annotator is an AI based software used to detect, annotate and digitize smells with the Smell Inspector as well as to recognize annotated smells. Digital smell patterns are produced by 64 independent gas detectors. Through artificial intelligence our technology learns to recognise particular smells. This can be compared to the way information is processed in our olfactory system. Smell is initially collected and analysed in the olfactory bulb. For recognition and remembering the cortical brain areas get involved. This evolves over our whole lifetime with more and more \u201edata\u201c processed. The same principle is realized in the Smell Inspector supported with the Smell Annotator software which uses machine learning algorithms.Currently, Windows and Linux systems are supported. Android and iOS will follow.\nGoals\nIntroduce an innovative product with a disruptive technology to the market\nOffer a low cost embedded platform for smell detection and recognition\nProvide companies with a great tool for fast prototyping of products related to smell\nEnable engineers, researchers, designers, makers, tinkerers, software developers\u2026 to create new products and services in relation to smell\nGive a boost to the maker\u00b4s world / DIY community\nBuild up a worldwide developer\u2019s community for smell related applications\nCreate a world\u2019s largest digital smell database\nSingle Pack: Pick a single Smell Inspector Developer's Kit to build your unique smell-related application and start the digital smell revolution.\nExplorer Set: Connect to your friends, makers, developers, scientists and choose your Explorer Set to invent great smell-related applications and products in a common, open and creative lab environment.

It is a joint effort of a multidisciplinary team of researchers and industry experts with expertise in physics, chemistry, electrical engineering, bioengineering, software development, industrial engineering, marketing and business development in collaboration with the German excellence university TU Dresden and German Life Science Inkubator, who along the years have worked together in several projects sharing the same vision about smell recognition.\nFrom the left: Marcel H\u00e4ndler (M.Sc.), Julius Hickl, Viktor Bezugly (Ph.D.), Birte S\u00f6nnichsen (Ph.D.), Vyacheslav Khavrus (Ph.D.), Andreas Werner (M.Sc.)\nWhatever happens on the way \u2013 we will keep you informed. \nBuilding a hardware product is hard and we may face unforeseen events that are going to delay us. As we have done in the past on our Facebook and LinkedIn page and our email list, you can count on one thing: we will always keep you updated on our status and potential delays at least one update per month on Kickstarter.\n\n Technology Evolution\n5 generations of detector chips, 3 generations of PCB, 3 versions of software - from research to product\nThe technology is based on more than 10 years of research at TU Dresden which is a reputable German university. We have produced several kinds of prototypes (detector chips as well as circuit boards) as it can be seen in the pictures above. Currently we are in the middle of the process of producing our first serial sample. To this end we are working together with Turck duotec a renown German EMS company. Current pilot projects are underway at Turck duotec GmbH, the American sensor manufacturer Centaur Analytics Inc. as well as at the German renown technical universities TU Dresden and TU Munich.\nTesting the first printed detector chips on foil mounted on the second generation Demo Board in our gas measuring chamber.\nThe laboratory and measuring equipment has been designed and manufactured in-house and is the result of an intense thinking process and hard working hours in the laboratory.\nPreparing the equipment for the in-house production of our nanomaterials. The production and fine-tuning of the nanomaterials for the detector chips Smell iX16 is one  of our key know-hows.\nWe have intensely analysed different kinds of smells. Using a simplified smell testing setup we could reliably test different gases, VOCs and smells: \ngases and VOCs: ammonia, nitrogen monoxide, phosphine, carbon dioxide, water vapour, ethanol, acetone (and other ketones), isopropanol, toluene, hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, 2,6-dimethaxy-phenol, 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol, guaiacol;\nsmells: different perfumes, chocolate, wine, vodka, coffee, tee, lemon juice, onion, garlic, banana, orange, potato, meat, fish (also spoiled banana, orange, potato, meat and fish), trash container.\nThe boards that you see on the pictures are real working prototypes tested by us and our partners. We are 80% ready to have the final product in our hands.\nThe production will follow these steps:\nComponents purchase\nWarehouse\nSMT\nAOL\nSmell iX16 detector chip production\nQuality control for Smell iX16\nComplete system assembly\nTests\nQuality control packaging\nShipping\nBack us now and help us make the Smell Inspector a reality!\nThe board design is in the final stage and our engineers are checking the electrical schematics and all the components to finalize the PCB development. Nevertheless, the Smell Inspector is not yet ready for the final users, as we still have some tasks regarding  the hardware and software:\nvalidation of Prototype B of the hardware,\nproduction of the test series,\nextending Smell Annotator software to Android and iOS,\nupscaling the quality control for the Smell iX16 detector chip production,\nextending our pre-set data collection to include smells for the most requested community application (stretch goal 1),\nsetting up and standardizing the digital smell database (stretch goal 2).\nKicking off a big production entails high set-up costs. As a startup company, we can only get it done with your help. Next to building our community this is why you are so important to us: Only if enough supporters back our project by pre-ordering the Smell Inspector, we will have enough funding to produce, assemble and ship the Smell Inspector. With a treshold of \u20ac27,800 ($33,760)we would be able to validate prototype B of the Smell Inspector and start the production of the test series. \nIf all goes as planned, we will be able to complete production on schedule, ship the Smell Inspector to you in November 2021 and build a worldwide Smell Inspector community.\nSo \u2013 are you ready to become a Smell Inspector yourself?\nSpread the word! Encourage friends to become a Smell Inspector, too! \nThank you for being part of the smell digitization evolution!\nThe Kickstarter video was produced with support by ravir FILM.

We fine-tuned every bit to fit agile maneuverability into a palm-sized robot pet. You can bring Bittle to life by assembling its puzzle-like frame and downloading our demo codes on GitHub. You can also teach it new skills to win prizes in our community challenges. Bittle makes a perfect tool for learning, teaching, researching, or a surprising gift to impress your family and friends. Bittle is not a toy for small kids. We recommend parental guidance to appreciate its rich content and avoid damage or injury.\nBittle walking on the desk\nEvolving with an open-source gene, Bittle is an open platform to fuse multiple makers' gadgets into one organic system. With our customized Arduino board coordinating all instinctive and sophisticated movements, you can clip on various sensors to bring in perception. You could also inject artificial intelligence capabilities by mounting a Raspberry Pi or other AI chips through wired/wireless connections.\nBall tracking with an intelligent camera mounted on the head\nBittle is the second product of OpenCat, sibling of Nybble. Backed by a worldwide user group, you can find many tutorials and project ideas on the Internet. We make constant but tiny progresses every day. You can follow our social media (Instagram/Twitter @PetoiCamp) to get more frequent updates than newsletters. By posting on our forum, you can contribute to the community or simply make your wishes heard. We are always drawing the blueprint for futuristic robots! \nSelf-righting after falling from a slope (triggered by an infrared remote)\nBittle is a palm-sized robot that moves with four legs rather than wheels. Legged motion gives it more freedom to navigate unstructured terrains, and expresses the joy of life whenever it moves. Such dynamic maneuverability was only seen on a few luxury robots from the best labs or tycoon companies previously, such as Boston Dynamics Spot or Sony Aibo. We came up with a grassroots solution to simplify the system to make it affordable and mass-producible.\nWalk the dog. Click the image to see a longer clip.\nBittle is a compact system of five major components: body frame, actuator, electronics, battery, and the software to coordinate all the hardware to perform varied tasks. \nBody frame\nWe designed Bittle's interlocking frame as a 3D puzzle with very few screws involved. Most body parts are symmetric for simplicity and aesthetics.  \nPuzzle-like body frame. Click the image for the full assembling animation.\nIt's a pleasure to assemble and disassemble Bittle for teaching or maintenance. On average, it takes about one hour to put together the body from scratch.\nBuild a robot dog on your own!\nEach piece has gone through tens of iterations with 3D printing. We then use high strength injection-molded plastic to provide the best protection from collision and dust (it's NOT waterproof!). In the stress tests, the assembled robot can take an adult's stepping without breaking any components (do NOT try this at home!).  \nRolling down a step. Click the image for the full review video.\nWe also designed Bittle to be soft. Besides the elasticity of the material, the spring-loaded upper legs flatten the shock on joint servos to protect their gears. Bittle usually survives regular collisions. In the extreme cases, it will disintegrate at the designated \"weak link in the chain\", which is easy and cheap to reinstall or replace.\nPassive compliant joints\nWe designed the frame to be compatible with most 9g servos. You could order the \"Bittle Shell\" perk alone to compile your spare servos into a beautiful action figure!\nActuator\nWe visited several servo manufacturers and iterated many times to find the optimized parameters. It will be model P1S, a slim, fast servo with a controllable angle of 270 degrees.\nP1S servo\nWe use nine P1S servos to actuate Bittle. Eight of them are for walking joints, and one is for head panning. We will also include one spare servo for replacement, as brushed motors are consumable after a certain period of wearing. You may order the \"Bittle Servo Set\" perk if you expect to use Bittle intensively for teaching or researching.\nElectronics\nBittle is driven by NyBoard V1, a customized Arduino board with rich peripherals. We fully utilized the chip of a regular Arduino Uno to coordinate sophisticated motions. The board can drive at least 12 PWM servos, and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) is used for balancing. It stores \"muscle memory\" and detects body status (orientation and acceleration) for balancing. We provide an infrared remote to trigger basic movements. The board also listens to string commands from the serial port, such as \"walk\", \"sit\", or more detailed instructions for individual joints. \nNyBoardV1\n\nNyBoard V1 is a revision of NyBoard V0 that has been driving 2000 Nybbles all over the world. We continue to provide a 2x5 socket on NyBoard V1 for mounting Raspberry Pi. It powers the Pi and communicates with it through the serial or I2C network. The Pi gives Bittle the ability to analyze more sensory data, get connected to the Internet, and make decisions by itself. Due to Bittle's small size, it best fits Pi Zero and Pi 3A+. For larger Pi models, you will need to tilt the Pi and 3D print some supporting structures. \nRaspberry Pi 3 A+ and Pi camera on Bittle\nThanks to the Arduino and Raspberry Pi community, you can find many customization ideas for Bittle. There are four Seeed Grove sockets on NyBoard V1 for extensible modules. To make installation easier, we designed Bittle's head as a clip to bite on those modules. That explains why we created a dog out of OpenCat this time. We will compile a \"sensor pack\" perk, including an intelligent camera module, a gesture sensor, a PIR motion sensor, and some other useful sensors. There's also a screw hole inside Bittle's head for fixing additional modules. \nExtensible modules\nWe developed a Bluetooth dongle for wirelessly uploading codes and controlling Bittle from PC or smartphone Apps. We also developed a WiFi dongle for wirelessly communicating with Bittle. You can play with Bittle without messing around with cables. Wireless is also essential when you are studying balancing related motion planning. You can even utilize the computational power of a remote \"brain\" without being constrained by Bittle's size and cargo capacity. The dongles are compatible with our previous Nybble model. We will include one extra set for our Nybble backers as a \"Thank You\" gift. You will need to provide your email and order ID for Nybble in our later survey.  \nBluetooth and WiFi dongles\nFurthermore, we are developing an ESP32 development board with native Bluetooth and WiFi connectivity. We have made a functional beta version called the \"BiBoard V0\" perk for developers. We expect a considerable performance boost, and you are welcome to join our exploration.\nBiBoard V0\nSoftware\nBittle is driven by our OpenCat code. It has 3K lines of Arduino codes excluding 3rd party libraries. It defines the minimal data structure and algorithms for performing quadruped motion. We also provide example commander and parser in Python so that you can send instructions from other devices. The code is already running on thousands of small quadruped robots, including many variants of OpenCat.  \nThe OpenCat codes are open source on Github\nYou can program Bittle at different levels in various coding environments, such as C in Arduino IDE and Python in the terminal. We are collaborating with TinkerGen, a STEM education company that kindly developed Codecraft (a graphical coding environment) for Bittle. They will also provide a free curriculum for you to learn programming in Codecraft and create a wide array of educational and fun projects with it!\nYou can code in Arduino IDE, Python, Codecraft, and many other environments\nWe plan to refactor Bittle's code between the production and release it before Bittle's delivery. You may start to explore the current OpenCat repository on GitHub to get familiar with the framework. We will announce new community challenges with huge prizes in the community section!   \nBittle climbing up a step under realtime instructions sent through Bluetooth\nBattery\nWe designed a Li-ion battery pack with a built-in charging and protection circuit. It can slide into the track underneath Bittle and tune its center of mass. It can power Bittle for at least one hour of continuous walking. It also has an RGB LED to indicate the battery's status.\nLi-ion battery with onboard charging and protection circuit\nWith the slide-in installation mechanism and an anti-reverse plug, it's not too hard to switch batteries. You may order extra batteries for uninterrupted researching or playing. With some reconfiguration, it can also power our previous Nybble models.\nYou can check this 30-min interview by Hackster.io for all the cool features. \nBittle is a perfect example to show \"small is big\". We wanted to encourage people to free their creativity and make wonderful things from limited resources. We have a growing community since the release of the OpenCat demo. We have @petoicamp on social media to update our fans about the progress of the project. After the launch of Nybble, we built the forum on our site (petoi.com) to discuss the project, showcase DIY models, and add function modules. \nPetoi Camp, the OpenCat forum\nLooking back at all the challenges we went through, the community was the most significant support that encouraged us to continue. We got thousands of backers to bring Nybble to life. Fans all around the world volunteered to translate our documentation into their languages. And many developers added new features to OpenCat. We cannot wait to see what Bittle will bring to us!  \nAn Android App (Code&Robots) developed by one of our fans\nTo make our community more productive, educational, and rewarding, we will launch an online challenge for all OpenCat users. You can find our proposed rules in this forum post and give suggestions before it officially starts. In short, we will define several tasks that can be measured quantitatively, e.g., programing Bittle to get onto the highest step. You have to both demo your solution and teach others to validate your entry. On the first day of each month, we will announce the world's record-breaker and gift a free Bittle or Nybble to the winner!\nWho will be the first Bittle backflipper and enter our Hall of Fame?\nBittle standing on my fingers\nBittle is 20cm x 11cm x 11cm in dimension. It weighs less than 280g but can carry up to 450g cargo under its belly. With proper programming and calibration, It can run faster than two body lengths per second. Bittle can remember tens of instinctive motion patterns and can perform more fancy tricks with realtime instructions. \nBittle (250g) trotting with an iron cargo (465g)\nP1S servo uses a coreless motor, alloy gears, ball bearing, and plastic case. It's 8.4V compatible, high speed, and has a controllable range of 270 degrees.  \nBittle on a treadmill\nNyBoard V1 has an Atmega328P with 16MHz CPU, 2K SRAM, and 32K flash. We also added an 8K I2C EEPROM, an IMU, a servo driver for 12 PWM servos, an infrared receiver, and a buzzer. It has a 2x5 socked to mount on a Raspberry Pi. \nBiBoard V0 has an ESP32 with 240MHz dual-core CPU, 520KB SRAM, and up to 16M flash. It has built-in WiFi/Bluetooth, 12 PWM servo pins, an IMU, an infrared receiver, an audio amplifier, and a speaker. It has several communication ports to connect to other devices.  \nThe Bluetooth dongle is compatible with Windows, macOS, and Android. It can also work on IOS with some auxiliary software. It can be used for uploading Arduino sketch or communicating with the NyBoard. The WiFi module can host a simple WebUI and communicate with the NyBoard. \nBiBoard V0, NyBoard V1 with Raspberry Pi 3 A+, and NyBoard V1 with a Bluetooth dongle\nThe intelligent camera module is our ODMed product. It integrates multiple vision recognition algorithms running on its ESP32 dual-core processor. It can return recognized human body, objects, and symbols through serial/I2C/WiFi at a rate of 25fps or 50fps. It can even stream video through WiFi. We will also include a deck of symbol cards. You can refer to this link for more information.\nIntelligent camera module and the symbol deck\nWe compiled the sensor pack with Seeed studios' Grove modules. You can refer to this link for more information. \nWe have been residing in the factory for six months and commit to staying until we start to ship Bittles.    \nSpark Erosion Machining (EDM) for making precise molds\nWe have finished 95% percent of the injection molds of the body frame. The lead time for injection production is one week. More funds are required to make the mold for the optional silicone tail and paws. The lead time is one month. We will provide their 3D printing files if they cannot catch up in time. We are still optimizing the parameters of servos for longer life-span. The lead time is at least two months. NyBoard V1 and battery are production-ready, and the suppliers are waiting for down payments for mass production. The lead time is 45 days to 50 days. We also need to design a sturdy and compact packaging box for international shipping. The lead time is one month. \nProduction schedule\nOpenCat started as the founder Rz Li's pet project in 2016. After the demo video went viral in 2018, he devoted all his time and resources to bring this sophisticated and cute robot to the public. He founded Petoi and successfully crowdfunded the Nybble project in 2018. All the earnings have been put into the fulfillment of Nybble and the R&D of Bittle.\nWe are still fulfilling Nybble orders for a worldwide audience\nOur mission is to bring affordable robotic pets from fiction to reality. We grew from a single maker to a company that can collaborate and negotiate with manufacturers to get the best solutions to our needs. We have many more cool ideas in mind, and Bittle is another small step towards our ideal shape of household robots.\nNybble and Bittle\nYou can help to bring this project to life by backing a wide selection of perks. The main perk for this campaign is the Bittle kit, available from $195 for early bird backers. We will include a free set of wireless dongles for our former Nybble backers.\nBittle kit (the final contents are subject to change)\nBecause there's no shopping cart on Kickstarter to combine your orders, you can refer to the following tables and compare their contents. Pick your base perk, then add the price of your add-on items to your pledge amount during checkout. You will also need to pay the shipping of your base perk during checkout. The extra shipping cost will be covered by us! Make sure you take note of what you ordered! \nTable of perks\nYou can decide your base(composite) perk from the following table, then add extra items according to your needs. \nContents of composite perks\nYou will also need to provide your account ID and payment method to secure your pledge. Kickstarter campaign is an \"all or nothing\" game. Your credit card will only be charged if we can meet the campaign goal during the period. You will receive a survey for your shipping address and other information, such as your preferred color, add-on items, and your Nybble backer ID. \nWe will ship your packages from our Chinese factory with reliable international couriers. Your government will collect the customs tax/fees upon delivery. Note: It can be expensive for some countries and areas. We are very grateful for your support and hope to bring you a unique product ASAP!\nIt has been a fantastic launch! With only a short notice of prelaunch, our initial goal of $50,000 was fulfilled within one day! It is a historical moment for me, for Petoi, and for everyone who loves robotics!\nA brief celebration on the factory's roof\nReaching the original funding goal will help us continue finalizing the R & D of Bittle. We just paid for the mold of silicone tail and paws, and will include them as standard components in the Bittle kit. But we need more funds to pay retainage, prepare for the inventory, break-even, and pay ourselves.\nBody language of \"excitement\"\nPlease shout out to your friends and network that we are setting a STRETCH GOAL at $200,000.  If we meet our stretch goal, we will gift one Grove module in the Bittle kit (even if you didn't back the sensor pack) to encourage you to utilize Bittle's extensible features. Of course, the module should not overlap with the sensor pack. You can browse this list and tell us your favorite. We will pick the most popular one. \nKickstarter is an open platform that reaches different kinds of people with varying interests. Bittle is an open platform to help people realize many dreams in robotics. We have a perfect match in user groups, and the resonance can make our ideas better heard by the world. We are highly interested in your feedback on the design, and how you will train and hack Bittle.\nWe also need your help! We focus so much on Bittle's deliverables that we barely have the budget for ads and marketing. We need your voice to spread out the news to reach more people. The more orders we get, the more leverages we have to negotiate with suppliers for the best quality and production priority. The more users we have, the more fun you get when everyone pitches in and builds applications upon Bittle.\n  Dr. Rongzhong Li (Rz)\nFounder and CEO \nRz is a physics PhD and computer science master. He previously taught computer science at Wake Forest University.\nRz is a maker with broad interests in art, literature, and science.

He helps supervise Petoi's management and development.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHardware products are especially \"hard\" to deliver compared to pure software products. After two years of experience with Nybble, we foresee the following risks and are working hard to mitigate them. \n \n* Supply chain, cash flow, and inventory management\nAny delay in the supply chain could halt production at any stage. We try to solve this by carefully estimating the lead time and divide sequential dependency into parallel processes, and moving the most challenging tasks to our top priority. \n \nNow we need the final push to finalize the designs and make down payments to kick off mass production. However, Kickstarter funding is an \"all or nothing\" game, and the funds will only arrive weeks after the campaign. So we lowered the funding goal a bit to negotiate with our manufacturer earlier during the campaign. They can start to prepare the materials earlier, given our crowdfunding progress. \n\nThis time we include batteries to avoid users' confusion in picking the right ones. However, the production for 2S Li-ion batteries requires an MOQ of 5000 units. It's a sizeable one-time investment, and the storage of many batteries is also risky. We will rent a dedicated room to store the batteries. We will also optimize the production process to reduce the lagging period between stocking and shipping the batteries. \n\n* Certificates and international shipping \nBittle needs to go through several standard tests for importing and exporting certifications. The tests may take up to two months after we send the final products. We took the advice from our experienced manufacturers that the specifications should not be too exceptional. We will reserve Bittle's full dynamic potential to make it a more stable product. \n\nThe breakout of COVID-19 is adding another layer of uncertainty for production and shipping. The factories are subject to close should any case was reported in the area. The international couriers are also having a hard time arranging oversea shipments. There may be a longer wait time between our shipping date and the delivery on your side. \n \nWe will ship Bittles worldwide through international couriers that can provide reliable tracking. Backers will be responsible for paying customs and duties. The amount varies by country or region. We may have a few customers canceling their orders if the fees upon delivery are too high. So we want to make sure everyone knows about the shipping policy before they order. \n\n* Team development\nWe currently have two people working full-time on the project.

When time is up, the very side with heavier goods to the balance scale (the side of the balance is lower) wins.\nMagnetic Crane - Transferring Race\n\u2696\ufe0fThe players can use the magnetic crane kit to scramble for the goods in the central area and move them to your own stacking area.\nThe game is over when all the goods are moved out. The very side who moves heavier goods wins.\n\ud83d\ude21Build a 3\u00d74 wooden block wall in the Obstacle Area. Players will take turns to throw wooden cubes using Armpal robot arm and try to destroy the wooden block wall.\nA total of 3-N rounds are performed according to the number of players (the wooden block wall should be restored after each throw).\n1 point for each block shot, the player with the highest score wins!\n\ud83d\udca3Build a 3\u00d74 wooden block wall in the Obstacle Area. Players will take turns to throw wooden cubes and try to put them into the Armpal Scale Box controlling the robot arm, 5 throws for each player.\n3 points for Box 1, 10 points for Box 2, and -5 points for accidentally knocking down obstacle blocks.\nThe player with the highest score wins when all the throws are done!\n\ud83c\udfc69 Blocks in the Kick Off Area for each player to carry the wooden blocks to the Scoring Areas within the 3-min game. Successful transportation to the right areas gain points, and the player with the highest score wins when time\u2019s up!\nEach successful placement of a wooden block in the Central Area will get 1 point. The 3-Points Area and 5-Points Area are the Scramble Areas, and the very side with the block at the top of the pile in these areas when time\u2019up will get the corresponding scores.\nWhen players accidentally knock down the wood cubes which are already in the Scramble Areas, corresponding points should be taken from their final scores.\n\ud83e\udd1dTwo people operate a device (each person with one of the 2 handles) simultaneously , each group of players transports wooden blocks from the Stacking Area to the Central Area within the 3-min game, and the group with more wooden blocks wins when time\u2019s up.\n\ud83e\udd1c\ud83e\udd1bPlayers will pass the wooden blocks in a circle controlling their Armpals.\nWatch out! Don\u2019t drop it!\nThe 2 players who dropped the wooden block while passing it will fail the game and the other 2 players win!\n The new Cannon Kit emphasizes the sense of simulation like the existing kit, so it will have a firing principle that is completely different from other firearm model toys \u2014\u2014 this might probably the closest one to real ammunition in the current market!\nFor the new cannon kit, we designed ammunition containing bullet, case, primer, and even powder (replaced by spring energy storage). At the same time, we designed the components for delivery and return. And also, a series of institutions of shelling (throwing shells).\nIn addition to controlling the aiming of the robotic arm during operation, you will also use the two triggers on the handle of the control unit, one of which is used to fire and the other is used to deliver the bomb. 5 Rounds of ammunition can be loaded at once. \n *The Cannon Kit is currently undergoing verification and finishing work, will be available for purchase at special price for ALL BACKERS ON KICKSTARTER on pledge manager when the campaign ends. \nArmpal is a set of wooden assembled, non plug-in tabletop game.\nReducing the difficulty of the assembly process to the lowest level, the most complicated tool you\u2019ll use is only a screwdriver, which make ArmPal well-adapted to a very wide age range.\nWe have designed a multi-axis operating system for Armpal that is beyond imagination. \nYou can easily use your hands to cooperate with the manipulation machinery to complete complex operations.\nIf you want to experience the joy of manipulating machinery without leaving home, this set of tabletop game must be a very good choice.\nAs a set of mechanical-themed tabletop game, you can find armpal ingeniously integrates gear transmission, hydraulic transmission, pulleys, magnets, and multiple mechanisms. \nThe visualized design enable us to enjoy the whole working process of movements with all the beautiful mechanical structures.  \n\nThe optimization of the production process is also an important part of the design work.\nThe laser cutting of the main wood knot structure can ensure smooth edges, and makes it easy to be taken apart without tools.\nFor better gaming experience and longer life of the mechanical structure, we\u2019ve done a lot of work. Besides the strengthened structure and decreased wear and tear, special windows were designed to maintain the hydraulic transmission system with simple steps.\nIn just a few steps, the entire hydraulic system can be rejuvenated to counteract possible liquid evaporation.\n Our designers try to assign hand-made models to the attributes of the game. Such products can bring people back to the real world from mobile phones and the Internet, increasing face-to-face communication between people.\nThe time spent playing with family or friends is full of happiness. And what is even more amazing is that this game is made by yourselves!\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.\nCrossprom.com lets you find matching cross-promotion friendly campaigns, streamline partnerships, follow schedules and mentions, retarget your visitors, and increase your conversions.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur design team has a rich product experience.

You need a simple cutting edge, but there\u2019s none within easy reach. We designed Dagr specifically for that situation, to be the knife that\u2019s always with you wherever you go. It\u2019s compact enough to ride along amongst your keys, but sharp enough to help with your everyday cutting tasks.\nDagr is engineered to protect it's blade when not in use with a tightly-threaded protective cap. When closed, it can be easily attached to your key ring, carabiner or shock cord \u2013 what ever carrying method you prefer. When needed, it can be unscrewed from its cap and either used alone for maximum flexibility or be re-attached to the cap to create a longer, more substantial grip area if needed.\nWhen not in use as a knife, Dagr is an always ready, non-contact tool for use in public spaces, activating elevator buttons, light switches, gas pumps and ATM\u2019s.  Both Stainless and Titanium are easily disinfected when needed.\nDagr\u2019s blade and cap parts are each CNC turned from solid 304 stainless steel or grade 5 Titanium stock. 304 Stainless is a preferred grade for use in the production of surgical instruments, Grade 5 Titanium is a favorite of the aircraft industry for its additional strength and lighter weight. Both are ideal materials for the job, will last forever.\nRegardless of size, knives are all about blade sharpness and the ability to cut stuff when needed. Dagr\u2019s blade is .5\u201d (12mm) long and .07\" ( 2mm) thick, allowing it to be used both for paper-thin materials and heftier, thicker materials like cardboard, leather or even twine & lanyard cord. TSA does not allow any sharp objects on planes, but Dagr can be places in checked luggage. Details can be found here! \nDagr's permanent blade can be easily re-sharpened with any whetstone, providing many years of service.\nOur shop is ready to begin production as soon as the project ends and can produce several hundred Dagrs per week. Though we will begin shipping as soon as parts are complete, we setting August as our target to begin shipping, and shipments will continue as parts arrive.\nOur worldwide shipping method will be by US Post. We've had a very high success rate with USPS on our past projects, but please note that we will not be able to track shipments beyond the US border. We'd be happy to make alternative shipping arrangements with tracking at an additional cost if you require - just let us know.\nBy supporting this project you will not only receive an AWESOME knife, but you will be helping to keep a small community of independent shops (including ours!) up and running in these challenging times. Our future success as creators here on Kickstarter depends on making sure our local independent shop ecosystem is able to pull through this shut down. It\u2019s a good cause and we all appreciate of your support!\nFor those of you new to our projects, our name 'Onehundred' comes from the 100 mile radius around our Saxonville, MA studio where we seek out talented New England manufacturers, many are 50+ year old independent shops. Manufacturing locally not only insures quality and helps maintain a stable manufacturing community, it also lowers our carbon footprint by about 60% by not having to ship materials or finished parts around the world.\nLearn more: onehundred.co", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working with all of our local production partners for several years now. They do quality work and being that they are close by, we're able to visit them often to resolve any issues if they arise. The biggest risk to beginning shipping on the stated date, though, is their production capacity and scheduling of other work at the time of our actual order. \n\nOccasionally, our smaller production runs may be delayed in favor of larger orders - a variable we can't always control. We never know in advance how many pieces we'll need to produce or if our shops will have an opening for our project when we are ready for production. Additionally, the manufacturing world is in considerable flux at the moment. Though our preferred shop is excited about working on our project and a revery capable at what they do, we can\u2019t be 100% certain they will be able to complete the work when the time comes.\n\nFor those of you who are new to our projects, we have a lot of product development, manufacturing & crowdfunding delivery experience.

For many this product was intended as a gift for the holiday season, and it is entirely within reason for you to have expected it to arrive at that time. Under normal circumstances it is a challenge enough coordinating manufacturers, suppliers, and the like to meet a deadline - moreso when your business consists of one person managing it all.

My dad had every intent to deliver this before the holidays, and did what he could to meet that promise. Of the many factors that dragged this out so late - I assure you none of which were intentional. It has all been at the whim of circumstances, of which neither he nor I had the ability to speed up.

You don\u2019t just save money with the SwitchBot Curtain, you do your part for the environment by retaining your existing curtains instead of throwing it away.\n\nWe support 99% curtains\nSome smart curtain solutions only support a single type of curtains. Others are too bulky or require tedious modifications to provide a power source.\nThe SwitchBot Curtain supports different track types such as U-rail and I-rail, and also rod types. It is also wireless. Just clip it on and you're ready to go. It is that simple. \nWe even handle that \"BUMP\" for extendable rods and rails\n Rods, retrofitted\nThe round rails allow the SwitchBot Curtain to glide smoothly along the rod. Just clip on the rails and you're all set.\nFor those of you who have a longer rod with a bump where the rod extends, we've got that figured out. The SwitchBot Curtain is not affected by such bumps.\nInstall in seconds\n U Rails, retrofitted\nThe SwitchBot Curtain has hooks for U-rail. It is simple to attach the respective hooks to the rails.  \nInstall in seconds\n I Rails, retrofitted\nThe SwitchBot Curtain has hooks for I-rail. It is simple to attach the respective hooks to the rails. \nInstall in seconds\nOpen and close the curtain at your fingertip. We offer intuitive App control for iOS and Android, with weekly/bi-weekly updates following feedback from you. OTA firmware update is also available for better user experience.\nIntuitive UI\nSmart living is powered by your voice commands. Wouldn't it be great to just say it?\n\"Alexa/Ok Google/Hey Siri, close my curtain please\" (Hub is required)\nEven with SwitchBot Curtain, you'd probably still instinctively draw the curtains by hand some times. When it senses you drawing the curtain, the SwitchBot Curtain will kick in and do the work for you. We call this Touch & Go.\nSwitchBot Curtain makes even the conventional way to draw a curtain smarter.\n\nA wireless remote button add-on for you to place anywhere. \nHold it or mount it. Your say.\nDouble-sided curtains are very common and we have been getting a lot of enquiries about how to use the SwitchBot Curtain with these. You could get two units and part the double-sided curtains from the middle. Or, you could try out this tip from the King of Retrofit! Attach the top curtains with a velcro strip or a strong clip so the curtains will move as one. Then install the SwitchBot Curtain on either ends to let it work its magic!\nSo your next question is probably where to find a velcro strip. Good news is, we believe so strongly in retrofitting that we will ship every SwitchBot Curtain with a velcro strip in the box as a standard accessory.\nThe SwitchBot Curtain is so small that it hides nicely behind your curtains. It will work in its own way without getting in your way.  Likewise, we keep the sophisticated mechanism within the body of the SwitchBot Curtain, giving you fast and easy installation so you can enjoy the benefits it brings.   \nSize fits in your palm.\nInstead of a wired system, the SwitchBot Curtain is a wireless solution. It uses a rechargeable battery that lasts 8 months depending on the usage. This means you only need to charge it once or twice a year! \nWhat's more, you can forget about having to charge it by getting the solar power strip add-on. Sunlight will ensure the SwitchBot Curtain is charged up for its daily work routine.\nOur SwitchBot Curtain is very complicated from the inside so it is so SIMPLE for you on the outside.\nOur SwitchBot Curtain is very complicated from the inside so it is so SIMPLE for you on the outside.\nIn the box, 2 types of hooks will be there for your preference.\nSwitchBot Hub Mini\nHub for SwitchBot Curtain and a universal Infrared remote control (Recommended)\nWhy we need your support\nWe have finished the development of the SwitchBot Curtain and we are excited to get it into the market to you. However, we cannot bring this product to life without your support. We need to raise funds for the raw materials and components needed to start mass production of the SwitchBot Curtain.\nFind us on GitHub: https://github.com/OpenWonderLabs/\nA few years ago, we shared the possibility to control SwitchBot on their Raspberry Pi, OpenWRT board, or PC running Linux based system. It has been a fantastic journey since then with contributions by many users who love to DIY! \nMakers who don't want to use Bluetooth controls can now choose to use our RESTFUL APIs. Moreover, you can use Home Assistant!\nTap on the power of IFTTT + Webhook to create and trigger countless incredibly creative scenarios! \nBoost your creativity! \nDoes the SwitchBot Curtain inspire you to use it in other ways? Yes, we thought it would. That's why we are sharing the STL files to build your hooks after the campaign!\nBesides adapting the SwitchBot Curtain to work with any rods and rails, you can also use create hooks to extend the SwitchBot Curtain's function! We came up with wacky ideas such as using it to open and close the door,  and building a cam cable to mounting a small action camera or the OSMO Pocket. We are excited to see what creative ideas can you come up with!\nBe creative with your cat.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nIt took us 2 years to have everything ready. We don't want a bad product for you.\nDevelopment and testing \nThe SwitchBot Curtain is not possible before we develop, craft, and test tirelessly in the past 2 years. We tried and tested thousands of rods and rails, and found every possible way to stress test it. \nWe listen. We fix. We iterate.\nValidated thousands of rods and rails\nThe roller coaster test\nSwitchBot Curtain is strong!\n2017 to now\nChoose one of the add-ons for each add-on pledge\nPress kit is available here. \nThe words\nThank you SwitchBot community!\nSwitchBot has grown since our last successful campaign.

One night after reading before sleeping, he realized that he cannot even turn off his bedroom light and close his curtain on the bed. This led to the team evaluating all kinds of self-proclaimed smart switches and curtains in the market. Our first thought was to have a robot butler. Yet, the reality is that despite years of robots making the news, we have not seen a real robot that in our homes. Thus, we began our adventure to create a useful, simple and convenient bot. SwitchBot is the fruit of our labor.

All were filmed at E3, along Venice Beach, and Hollywood Boulevard in June 2019. \nForget just hearing sound. We\u2019re enabling you to feel sound. Woojer is a progressive sensation that boasts an amplified level of immersion. Imagine standing right next to a huge bass cabinet. You know that oomph you feel in your body? That energy pulsing into your bones? That\u2019s what Woojer feels like.  It gives you everything that your headphones simply can\u2019t.  \n\n\n\nSound is air movement that typically spreads as an audible wave of pressure. Headphones gather that audible part, but you\u2019re missing out on the movement. That\u2019s where Woojer steps in. We enable you to enjoy both aspects of sound. \nSimply put on the strap or vest, connect the audio and start feeling the sound. \nAfter all the feedback we received from 70K+ users, we decided to create a new series that everyone can dig.

Getting touch right in the design of objects and products is essential \u2013 this is where the Trill sensors come in.\nThe Trill sensors use capacitive sensing to precisely track finger movements, making it quick and easy to create beautifully responsive new touch interfaces. \nTrill is brought to you by the team behind Bela, the open-source maker platform for working with audio and sensors. With this Kickstarter we want to bring rapid touch prototyping to makers, product designers, interactive artists, instrument builders and synth experimenters around the world.\n\nWe are launching t\u0336h\u0336r\u0336e\u0336e\u0336 five types of sensor (see our Stretch Goals below): \n TRILL BAR, a slider that can sense up to five touch points \n TRILL SQUARE, a touch pad that senses two axes of movement\n TRILL CRAFT,  a 30-channel breakout board that lets you make your own touch interfaces out of anything conductive\nSee the stretch goals section below for TRILL HEX and TRILL RING.\nTrill connects to lots of things\nWorking with Trill is easy. Trill sensors use an I2C connection which means they can be connected to a variety of popular maker boards.  We include a library and examples for Bela, Arduino and Raspberry Pi that give you everything you need to get started. \n\nCreate sophisticated interfaces\nEach sensor has a configurable I2C address that can be set via solder bridges on the back so you can connect multiple Trill sensors together and create complex touch interfaces. Sensing through thin surfaces like vinyl is also possible, allowing you to embed and hide the sensors within your custom interface.\n\nCut sensors to size\nYou can also cut the sensors down to size if you have a specific application that requires a different shape sensor. \n\nTurn anything into a sensor\nTRILL CRAFT allows you to turn anything that conducts electricity into a sensor: you can make sliders or buttons out of copper tape, conductive paint, e-textiles and many other materials such as water, metals and even fruit.\n\nTrill sensors can be used to create all kinds of wonderful interactive devices and interfaces. Over the course of the Kickstarter campaign we will be releasing detailed posts and tutorials that explain how each of these projects were built \u2013 stay tuned!\n\n Sonic Circuit Sculpture by Helen Leigh \nHelen Leigh has created a family of sonic circuit sculptures that use Trill Craft in combination with Bela Mini to create a beautiful series of interactive sound installations. Read more about this project on our blog: https://blog.bela.io/2019/09/19/trill-helen-leigh-craft-circuit-sculpture/\n\n Euro-Trill Modular Synth\nThe Trill sensors are the perfect tools for building synthesisers and electronic musical instruments. At Bela we have created a number of instruments with these sensors already. Below is a modular synth that we created with all three types of Trill sensor and our DIY Eurorack module Pepper.  Read more about this project on our blog: https://blog.bela.io/2019/09/27/euro-trill-modular-eurorack/\n\nVisualising Trill sensors in the Bela IDE\nThe Trill sensors ship with libraries and examples for a variety of popular maker boards like Arduino and Raspberry Pi, but the perfect partner for the Trill sensors is our own maker platform, Bela. \n\nGranulator with Trill Bar and Trill Square\nBrass instrument with Trill Craft\n\nTrill sensors are designed by the team behind Bela, the open-source maker platform for ultra-low latency audio and sensors. Like Bela, the Trill sensors are open-source hardware letting you edit and remix our designs.\nBela launched on Kickstarter in 2016, and empowers makers, designers and musicians to create beautifully responsive instruments and other interactive projects. Our speciality is music: we understand the specific demands of musicians, and we design high quality products that work for them but are also perfect for many other types of product design and making.\n\nTrill sensors use capacitive sensing to track finger position responsively and with high resolution. Each sensor features a microcontroller containing high-resolution analog hardware and custom firmware.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have now (10th October) unlocked our first two stretch goals, Trill Hex and Trill Ring.\nBackers are now able to choose from five Trill sensors for their rewards: Trill Bar, Square, Craft, Hex or Ring (we'll send you a survey after the campaign to get your choices).\nTrill Hex has now been reached as a stretch goal and backers will be able to additionally choose this sensor at the end of the campaign! Trill Hex is a hexagonal, 2-axis x/y sensor. Perfect for tessellation. Trill Hex will make building complex touch interfaces like isomorphic keyboards easier than ever before.\n\n Trill Ring, a one-axis circular slider that can also detect up to 5 simultaneous touches. Perfect for controlling volume, filters and more. This stretch goal was unlocked at \u00a318k.\n\nAlready a backer? Don't worry, you don't need to choose your rewards now - we'll send you a survey when the campaign ends to get your final choices. In the meantime, you can increase your pledge at any time to take advantage of these additional options as they become available (\u00a311-\u00a314 per sensor depending on your reward, check your reward for details).\nTrill comes from the creators of Bela, the open source maker platform for audio and sensor processing, and TouchKeys, which brings expressive multi-touch sensing to the piano keyboard. Both projects were launched with successful Kickstarter campaigns.\n\nBela launched on Kickstarter in 2016 and now sells boards worldwide\nBela empowers makers, designers, artists and musicians to create beautifully responsive interactive systems\nGlobal community of makers in the thousands sharing projects on blog.bela.io \nIntuitive toolchain for creating complex interactive sound projects\n\n  TouchKeys launched on Kickstarter in 2013 \nSells finished keyboards and DIY overlays at http://touchkeys.co.uk/ \nCapacitive touch overlay for any piano keyboard     \n\n\nAll of our activities as a company are about supporting makers and giving them the best creative tools to work with. As a group we understand musicians' needs intimately and make high quality products that can meet their demanding requirements.\nKickstarter is our platform of choice for launching new products \u2013 we know it well and believe it is the ideal way to reach out to our community and the wider world of makers before bringing a product to the market.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are an experienced team that has successfully delivered on two Kickstarter campaigns (Bela Platform 2016 and TouchKeys 2013). We have a proven track record of delivering our rewards in a timely manner and are confident we can do the same with this campaign. Within our team we have extensive experience in hardware and software development as well as existing relationships with trusted manufacturers and part suppliers. \n\nThe final hardware designs of the Trill sensors have been thoroughly tested going out to numerous beta testers in the last few months who have helped to iron out any issues in the design and software support. This means that we are ready to go into production as soon as the campaign ends.\n\nAs with any hardware project, delays could occur due to disruption further up the supply chain. To mitigate this risk as much as possible we are using trusted suppliers and manufacturers that we have worked with many times before.

We don't take that for granted and we're here to create a great game for you to the best of our abilities. \nWhat follows is the original Kickstarter campaign description. Finished Kickstarter projects cannot be edited, so this information will fall out of date over time. For the latest, go to: http://bugbyte.fi/spacehaven \nEmbark on a space voyage with your ragtag crew of civilians in search of a new home. Build spaceships tile by tile, create optimal gas conditions, manage the needs and moods of their crew, encounter other space-faring groups, and explore the universe in this spaceship colony sim for Windows, Mac, Linux.\nSpace Haven combines the emergent story telling components of RimWorld with a tile-based gas-simulation system seen in Oxygen Not Included.\nSurvive your own way. Choose to act like a pirate, slave trader, alien hunter or a force for good.\nWant to be a pirate and attack and steal from anyone you meet? Maybe you want to be a slave trader and capture crew members from other factions and sell them on the market? You could be a notorious alien hunter, fighting aliens aboard derelict ships and scavenging their meat. Or perhaps you're the good guy fighting pirates and helping civilians? Space Haven aims to give you the freedom to role play.\nSpace Haven allows for complete freedom regarding building.\n Customize - Complete freedom to build a spaceship or station of your own desire. Place every piece of ship hull, wall, door and facility wherever you want. \n Functional - All facilities serve a purpose. Crew members will sleep in beds, use toilets, be disturbed by a noisy room and praise you for an arcade machine.\nA functional spaceship can be built tile-by tile, giving you the opportunity to shape a spaceship of your own desire. It can be symmetric and streamlined, or an asymmetrical whimsical looking thing. It does not have to look like a conventional spaceship depicted in sci-fi literature, you are free to design your own, the choice is yours!\nTile-based gas system simulates various gases, temperature and crew comfort on your spaceship.\n Oxygen and CO2 - Keep optimal Oxygen and CO2 levels by building life support modules for your crew members.\n Hazardous gases - Certain facilities and explosions can release hazardous gases. Build scrubbers to purify the air.\n Temperature and power - Build thermal regulators to maintain an ideal temperature for your crew. Build power nodes and set up power distribution throughout the ship.\n Comfort - Building a bed right next to the ship core will disturb sleep. Design your ship for crew comfort.\nThe isometric tile-based gas system simulates various gases, temperature and crew comfort on your spaceship. Humans, plants and facilities react to the conditions surrounding them, giving meaning to how you design your ship and the living conditions you create. Secure facilities, optimize crew survival and well-being, but also think of possible future accidents and chaos generated from crew combat or environmental hazards. \nThe game simulates needs, moods, health and relationships of crew members.\n Skills and traits - Every crew member has their own set of skills and traits. A wimp might get scared shooting a gun, while an iron-stomach can eat anything unaffected.\n Mood - A happy crew member needs food, sleep, comfort, safety and friends. Take something away and their mood will be affected. \n Conditions - Crew members might feel adventurous, suffer from starvation, feel unhygienic, or they simply ate too much. Various conditions affect how they feel. \n Mental breaks - When the stress is too much for a crew member they may suffer a mental break. Some will vent themselves out of the air lock, while others might start a fight.\nIn Space Haven characters aren't mere robots. The game simulates needs, moods, health and skills of your crew members and they develop relationships with each other. Their past life occupation and hobbies will affect their skills and know-how, and they have both positive and negative traits. Witness joyful moments, depression, and drama surrounding different crew members as you journey onward seeking a new home. \nOrganize away teams to explore derelict ships and visit other faction ships.\n Away missions - Equip your crew members and organize away teams to explore derelict ships or visit stations or spaceships of other factions. \n Draft - Draft and move your crew members to attack enemies and save their friends.\n Inventory - Each crew member has their own unique inventory. Equip them with pistols, rifles, grenades and more.\nEquip your crew with space suits and weapons and organize away teams to explore derelict ships and stations. Explore and salvage resources and items; find activated cryopods with someone frozen inside. Visit spaceships or stations of other factions and find data logs telling stories of past spacefarers searching for a new home. \nAliens try to capture your crew members alive.\n Crew combat - Engage in combat with enemy factions or an alien species. \n Aliens - Watch aliens incapacitate your crew members and capture them alive. See them suffer in the alien lair and decide if you want to try to save them or not.\nAliens capture your crew members and cocoon them against walls in their base. See them suffer in the alien lair and decide if you want to save them or not. Explore derelict ships and discover someone from the original crew of the ship captured by the aliens. Events like these create interesting back stories to new arrivals to your crew.\nEngage in ship-to-ship combat, where a hit can snowball into a disastrous event for your crew.\n Battlestations - Watch your crew take battlestations as you engage the enemy in ship-to-ship battle. See your crew load turrets with projectiles, put out fires from explosions, patch hull breaches and repair vital facilities in the midst of battle.\n Tactical - Target the enemy ship engine and stop them from fleeing. See them do the same to you. Engage their turrets directly or try to focus on the enemy ship core and see their ship go pitch black. Build shields to protect your most vital segments of your ships.\nBuild turrets and engage in tactical ship-to-ship combat, where a hit and explosion could cause a snowball effect of fire, smoke, hazardous gases and even hull breaches for either party. All crew members need to work together to win the battle.\nTreat crew member for injuries, diseases and other medical conditions.\n Cryopods - Protect your crew from side-effects of Inter-stellar travel. Place crew members into stasis to freeze the progression of a disease or to await rescue. \n Medical - Treat crew members for injuries, wounds and diseases. Medical conditions affect crew members in various ways.\nYour crew members will become wounded in battles and might catch a serious disease. Set up a medical room, scan for diseases and foreign masses and have your best doctor tend to illnesses and perform surgeries. Hope that your doctor is not absent minded and leaves a surgical tool inside.\nExplore a new procedurally generated galaxy each playthrough.\n Generated galaxy - Explore a new procedurally generated galaxy each playthrough, with planets, asteroids, stations and spaceships of other factions.\n Factions - Interact with various factions all trying to survive and establish dominance their own way. Meet pirates, merchants, slave traders, cultists and more and develop relationships with each. \n Resources - Mine for raw resources and refine them to building materials. Trade resources with other groups you meet.\nExplore a new procedurally generated galaxy each new playthrough, with various factions all trying to survive and establish dominance their own way. You'll meet pirates, slavers, merchants, cults, androids and more. Jump into hyperspace, seek out resources and meet various groups and develop your relationship with them.\n  Type: Single player\n  Genre: Indie, Simulation, Strategy\n  Platform: Windows, Mac, Linux\n  Release dates: Kickstarter Alpha (April 2019), Steam Early Access (Q4 2019), Full Launch (2020)\nWe're taking this seriously. We're not going to put the game on Steam, even as early access, before we have iteratively developed the game to be ready for that. You, our Kickstarter backers, will help us get the game to that point by providing us invaluable feedback as we progress. \nJoin the alpha crew and help us create something beautiful! You will get access to the game once this campaign has ended and Kickstarter has sent us the backer data. \nWe've worked hard for three years to create the architecture of the game, giving us a solid base to build upon. Now it's time to start adding much needed content. As a Kickstarter backer, you'll be able to give us feedback regarding which direction we take the game. Below are a few of our thoughts.\nNote that this list of modules isn't a roadmap and may not all ever be finished. We will do our best to implement as much as possible.\n Role play elements - Expand on game elements allowing you to role play, giving you the ability to butcher aliens for meat, sell your crew members for credits and attack and steal from anyone you see. Role play as a pirate, slave trader, alien hunter, merchant or other.\n Faction relations - Create more depth to factions, their back stories and how they relate to each other.\n Environmental storytelling - Create an environmental story generation tool. Explore ships and stations and find Androids, who overpowered their masters, medical bays filled with corpses, open alien eggs on a research bench with dead crew members around.\n Deep characterization - Improve character interactions, relationships, conditions, traits and diseases to give more depth to your crew members.\n Research - Create a research tree, with new technology to unlock. Research new weapons, shields and facilities.\n Health modeling - Medical beds would have a scanning mechanism. Scan for diseases and foreign masses. Have your doctor perform surgeries and tend to the sick.\n Crew combat - Improve on the mechanics of crew combat.\n Ship-to-ship battle - Implement and improve on the mechanics of ship-to-ship battle.\n Game customization - New game modes, like a sandbox mode or building space stations instead of spaceships. If something annoys you turn it off. Customize your game regarding game difficulty, faction presence and so on.\n Multiple endings - Create more than one way to finish a playthrough, tied to stories. Endless sandbox possibility.\n Modding - Mod support can allow the player base to implement interesting, or experimental ideas of their own, allowing for a richer gaming experience. \n Landing on Planets - This would be a big task, and would require a lot of time. It is something we dream of though. With enough funding we could give it a serious thought.\n Your wishes -  Anything the community thinks up is on the table. We will listen and implement to our best judgement.\nWhile playing, you'll be listening to amazing emotional tracks developed  by Paul Zimmermann. We are very happy to work with someone who can create exactly what we needed to realize our vision for Space Haven's sound. Paul is developing both the music and the sound effects for Space Haven.

We were already practicing it in India, during the Vedic period, 2 thousand years before Jesus Christ. Etruscan and roman citizens, Arabic countries and Spanish people loved to play with faith with those six faces. One of them was a flower drawn (\u01cez-z\u01cehr, in ancient Arab) and, in latin, dice, the dice\u2019s game, and hazard, were designated with the word \u00ab Alea \u00bb. As old as the world, the dice game has not much evolved since. But it was used for a lot of goals. We use it \u201cnaked\u201d for poker, or 421, or for an accessory in games like goose game, parcheesi, or backgammon, or even Monopoly, for making the pawns move forward.", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Show your love", "descp": "Thanks for supporting our project !

That wasn\u2019t the case, we struggled to improve it in a better way, but : \n                - It took really more time than expected and many iterations;\n                - Thus it costed us more than expected before (I remind you that we did not pay ourselves but just our subcontractors).\n                - We also improved the apps and games concepts. And to not burn more and more money that we would need to produce, we went forward by developing firstly with internships (slower and cheaper\u2026).\n                - We also improved the docking station and the dice itself (you can see the minor costs for that).\n\n3) Considering the treasury, we started to reach out business angels, public subsidies, etc. which ones were interested by investing in Dicees. But unfortunately, the crisis brought negotiations to a halt. We are softly restarting to talk to potential investors.\nBy the way, some of you are talking about the project value estimation for a potential investor, I\u2019m not sure that you take all the time, the investment, the market potential, the IP, and so on into account to pretend that nobody would invest that much money in Dicees.

Robots are NOW and you can make them. Robot vacuums, companion robots & UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles)/ autonomous drones have grown in popularity and will soon become an integral part of your life. Be a part of building the future by joining the Maker Community! \nFor autonomous robots, a core technology is LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging Sensor). Ever wonder how a robot can see? How does a robot vacuum avoid walls? How does a self-driving car sense traffic or pedestrians? The answer is LiDAR, a scanning technology that maps objects or space by illuminating the target with a pulsed laser light. \niLidar is the first solid-state LiDAR sensor made for ALL MAKERS from beginner to robotics developers. Overcoming the limitations of traditional LiDAR, iLidar offers cutting-edge LiDAR performance at an unbeatable price, all in one compact sensor module.\nAs Seen On\nInteresting Engineering | Geeky Gadgets | hackster | engineering.com | Connetcted Crib | Brainiacs from Mars | Robotis Gizmos | Trend Hunter | World IT Show | Maker Faire Seoul 2018\n1D LiDAR \nUtilizing a point laser, 1D LiDAR sensors are only capable of measuring distance to one point. While cheap and compact, their use functionality is limited.\n2D LiDAR\n2D LiDAR allows for basic scanning of space. To scan in 2D, most LiDAR sensors require rotation to sense distance on a line across space. \niLidar \nUtilizing line laser technology, iLidar is capable of 2D mapping without requiring rotation. To scan a space in true 3D, iLidar simply needs to scan on the vertical axis. \nIn the video below, you can view iLidar\u2019s performance. Through innovation in short-range LiDAR performance, iLidar provides unparalleled performance cost.\n For more detail information, please download iLidar datasheet.\n iLidar Configurator \nDon't bothered by initial sensor configuration work on your embedded platforms. Plug iLidar into your PC and configure it as you want. Configuration data can be saved into iLidar's non-volatile memory section, and will be loaded at each power-up afterward. Real-time data visualization is also possible with iLidar Configurator. See what iLidar sees.\nOpen Software Development Kit : C/C++  \nHave complete access to iLidar\u2019s open source SDK (software development kit). Plug & play by configuring iLidar with a variety of embedded micro controllers including Arduino, Raspberry Pi, or Jetson.\nThe Hybo team was formed as the robotics club at Pohang University of Science & Technology(POSTECH). As makers ourselves, one of the biggest frustrations was the inaccessibility of a quality, affordable LiDAR sensor. Finally, we decided why not make one ourselves?\niLidar was created for makers by makers. Affordable, versatile and compact, iLidar makes LiDAR technology accessible to everyone. We continue to be heavily involved in the maker community including participating in the Maker Fair and cannot wait to hear about how you integrate iLidar into your creations!\nWhy are we on Kickstarter?\nAll funds raised on Kickstarter will go towards: \n1. Mass production costs for iLidar\n2. Development of SDK & iLidar Visualizer software\n3.

But let\u2019s be honest \u2013 there are no good water guns around anymore. Squirting pathetic water streams after minutes of pumping? That's not what water guns should be like in 2018.  \nWe think that the water gun has the potential to become so much more. This is why two years ago, we set out on a mission: to completely reinvent the water gun \u2013 and take water fights to the next level.  \nThe water gun revolution is already on the way\n You would like to write or post about Spyra One too? Find our press and media kit here!\nSimply pull the trigger and feel the powerful shots. Each water bullet is exactly 30 ml \u2013 about the size of a shot glass. There's no need for paint or target vests to find out who hit whom: the water bullets leave clear water marks on your friends' shirts. Let them fade after a few minutes in the sun and get ready for a rematch! \nCombining range with precision for the first time. If you're older than five, water fighting is as much about pure range as driving is about just getting there. So Spyra One not only matches the range of the top water guns on the market. Its patent-pending valve-nozzle technology also achieves a previously unknown precision: Instead of soaking, Spyra One's water bullets clearly hit their targets at up to 7.5 meters \u2013 that's as far as the laws of physics allow! \nNo protection needed \u2013 it's just water. Because of our specifically engineered valve-nozzle technology, Spyra One requires only low pressure levels to achieve maximum precision and range. You don't need any protective gear to start a fight wherever there's water around.  \nRefilling becomes part of the game. With the push of a button, Spyra One refills the entire tank with water \u2013 25 shots in 14 seconds. Gone are the times where the break to run into the house and refill your tank was the killer of every water battle. With Spyra One, counting your water bullets and refilling strategically becomes part of the fight. \nRefill anywhere, from any water source. Spyra One's pumping system is protected by a water filter, so you don't have to worry about small parts damaging the internals. Just hold the front end of Spyra One into any clean water source \u2013 a lake, a bucket, or your swimming pool \u2013 and push the button to let Spyra One refill the tank.  \nFull control down to the last water bullet. Stop guessing how much water you have left to launch that final attack. With Spyra One's digital display, you just know \u2013 down to the exact number of water bullets left in your tank. When you shoot, it counts down, and when you refill, it counts up again. This way, you never risk running dry in the worst moment.\nAlways know Spyra One's battery status. Spyra One's digital display also tells you when it's time to take a break from water fighting and recharge its integrated batteries. Don't worry: You will probably tire from water battles earlier than Spyra One does. The battery easily lasts for a full day of water fights with at least 45 refill cycles and 1125 shots.  \nFull pressure whenever you need it. Spyra One's integrated pump repressurizes the water automatically during refilling. The tank system then holds the pressure constant from the first to the last shot. Whether you have 25 shots left or just one, you always have full range and precision. All without any extra supplies like CO2 cartridges. And the best thing: There is no need for pumping anymore! \nNo more pumping. Ever. Did we mention this already? It's like magic. While your water fight opponents are still busy working out their biceps to build up pressure, you are 100% back in the game whenever you choose to. You can even interrupt the auto-refill process at any time, ward off attackers, and continue refilling.  \nPLAY\n\nHero Pack: Be the water gun revolutionary this world needs. This is your chance: Choose your own Spyra One and make water fights great again! \nBattle Packs: Pick your favorite friend (or opponent) and get the fight on. Prove your bravery in the eye of cold water with a Fighter Pack of Spyra Ones in your team colors!\nEscalation Packs: Planning a mutiny at that other department at work or a 'different' surprise for your best friends\u2019 wedding? We can\u2019t think of better use cases for these packs. Gather your two football teams and get ready for total escalation!\nColors and shipping\nColors (red/blue): We send out a survey for the colors after the campaign ends - you can pick any combination of colors you like. Example: For an Epic Battle Pack (8x Spyra One), you can choose 6 red Spyra Ones and 2 blue Spyra Ones in the survey.\nShipping: To find out the shipping cost for your country, choose your reward and select your country. Larger packs are more efficient \u2013 so it really pays to find a friend to back Spyra One with you! Through a special service provider deal, we managed to get local rates for both US and central Europe! Yay!\nYou, the community, already pushed this campaign farther than we ever thought possible. We have asked ourselves: maybe we can do even more together? And yes, we think we can! We asked you what your wished were, and carefully deliberated what is possible.  \nWith your help, we decided. If we reach those funding levels together, we commit to deliver the following:\nPOWER SHOT [UNLOCKED!]: The option to release an extra-powerful water bullet after holding down the trigger for a few seconds.\nEXCLUSIVE COLOR: Your Spyra One becomes available in Kickstarter Green. Exclusive for backers, and never available again!\nLOCKED: Stretch goal reached at: \u20ac666,666 (about $775,000)\nSHOULDER STRAP: A modified design that allows to attach a shoulder strap for more comfort in extended water fights and transporting Spyra One.\nLOCKED: Stretch goal reached at: \u20ac888,888 (about $1,025,000)\n\nWhatever happens on the way \u2013 we will keep you informed. Building a hardware product is hard and we may face unforeseen events that are going to delay us. As we have done in the past on our Facebook page and our email list, you can count on one thing: we will always keep you updated on our status and potential delays at least one update per month on Kickstarter.  \nSebastian Walter, Founder of Spyra\nHaving grown up with the 1990s' iconic water guns, Sebastian was shocked to not find any decent models anymore when he was preparing for a rubber boat party in 2015. Disappointed about the state of the industry, he started working on his own vision of a great water gun on nights and weekends.  \nWhen the first prototype was built a few months later, Sebastian decided to put everything on one card. He quit his job as a product designer at a German car manufacturer and set out to build the best water gun in the world. \nIn total, it took more than two years and six generations of prototypes to arrive at a pre-series, feature-complete design prototype of Spyra One. The next step is clear: series production of the Spyra One \u2013 with your help. \nThe modern water gun was invented by NASA engineer Lonnie Johnson in 1990. After two years of developing the Spyra One, we know why: Making water bullets fly through air is, literally, rocket science. Small amounts of accelerated water shot through air are subject to water turbulence and air resistance. The result: spraying.  \nTo achieve Spyra One's range and precision, it was necessary to optimize the valve-nozzle system for laminar flow. This was Dominik's job: the Air and Space Engineer tested countless nozzle shapes, over and over again, in our own 9-meter-long test channel.\nRocket Scientist Dominik implementing a new test setup\nTurning of differently shaped water gun nozzles\nSetup of the nozzle at the test channel\nTesting a nozzle in Spyra's shooting channel\nMeasuring range and spread of the water bullet after 8 meters\nBuilding a water gun in 2018, we can make use of electronics that would have cost a fortune back in the 1990s. The possibilities opened up by modern electronics and software engineering enabled us to implement central features like the integrated pump, the digital display counting your water bullets and a highly efficient electronic trigger-valve system. All of those drastically improve performance and take up less space than their mechanical equivalents. \nArduino-controlled first garage-built prototype\nSoldering the circuit board for a 2018 prototype\nTo maximize the fun you can have with a water fight, range was important but not by far our only focus. We asked around and found that the biggest pain points in previous water guns were #1, cumbersome screwing and refilling and #2, endless, biceps-wracking pumping to build up pressure.\nAn integrated, electronic pump that auto-refills and auto-pressurizes was therefore a must-have for the Spyra One. We tested for pumping speed, sound emissions, and battery efficiency, and ended up with a great pumping system. Watch how Sebastian demonstrates the convenience achieved by Spyra One's pump-tank system in our final prototype: Auto-refill and constant pressure, with no pumping at all. \nPLAY\n\nSince Spyra One is electronically controlled anyways, it was only logical to use that to your advantage with a status display. Now your water gun always tells you exactly how many shots are left in the tank. It's great for strategic gameplay \u2013 and honestly, it's just pretty cool.\nAn early prototype of the digital display\nTesting the display in the final prototype during refill\nWe did not test in the lab alone. You \u2013 the community \u2013 were with us from the start: as roommates who indulged our endless messing with water in the apartment ...\nPLAY\n\n ... Or as testers who subjected the prototypes of our patent-pending technology during trial water fights in our own arena. Watch this fun video we shot for our social media channels where Spyra One competes against two regular water guns in the test arena outside our headquarters:\nPLAY\n\n10 people for building a water gun? When we started building the Spyra One in 2015, we would have never guessed that three years later, the project would evolve into a company that would occupy 10 team members in engineering, marketing and business.  \nWe are here for you! Reach out to us here on Kickstarter, our Facebook page or our YouTube channel. Because shooting us a message is still as easy as hitting our friends with a Spyra One. You have a question? Send it to us: hello@spyraone.com.\nWith our funded campaign, we have a lot of work to do and that means:\nEngineering, production, marketing or sales: we are looking for talented and skilled people. Just shoot us an email at jobs@spyraone.com and tell us:\nWhy you are excited about the Spyra One\nWhat topic or field you are interested in\nWhy you would be the perfect fit for our company\nFor students: From when until when you would like to do your thesis/internship project.\nSince June 2018, we are ready to start the water gun revolution! We have fully functional prototypes that we have shown you here on Kickstarter. We have discussed and confirmed the remaining development steps until series production with our suppliers and partners. If all goes as planned, we will be able to complete production in schedule and ship Spyra One to you next summer. \nWe have done our part \u2013 now we need you! Kicking off a big production entails high set-up costs. As an independent startup company, we can only get it done with your help. That is why you are so important to us: Only if enough supporters back our project by pre-ordering a Spyra One, we will have enough funding to produce, assemble and ship the Spyra One.

Controlled via an intuitive app, web account or voice-enabled devices such as Amazon Alexa, Canvia makes it easy to find art to suit changing tastes, keep you inspired and enliven your surroundings.\nWhy Did We Create Canvia?\nJust as Spotify has revolutionized the accessibility, exploration and experience of recorded music, and services like Netflix have done the same for vast archives of film and TV, we want Canvia to revolutionize the accessibility and experience of art. \nIn order to achieve this though, we realized it wasn't only a question of content - we also needed to create a device and platform that:    \nlooks and feels like authentic physical art (i.e. a painting or print), conserving realistic details such as color, texture and brushstrokes\naugments the experience of art with key information and helpful guidance, avoiding any of the intimidating bars to entry of the art world, auctions and gallery system\nand is connected, interactive, sharable as an experience and - most importantly - flexible for people's changing needs and spaces.\nIn this way, Canvia solves problems with the 'traditional' approach to sourcing and buying art:\nHow Does Canvia Work? \nPLAY\n\nCanvia is driven by Palacio\u2019s proprietary (patent-pending) ArtSense technology that simulates the behavior of a physical painting or high quality print on a digital screen, whatever the environment.\nBuilt-in sensors read ambient visual conditions and this data is used to actively adapt the displayed image. The light-emitting screen therefore appears solely light-reflective, as with physical art, and ensures all images retain a realistic painting or print-like quality (conserving details like texture, color and individual brushstrokes) under any conditions.\nArtSense technology simulates the behavior of a physical painting or high quality print on a digital screen, conserving details such as texture, colors and even individual brushstrokes\nArtSense also enables art selections that better suit an environment and context. In this way, Canvia offers a more realistic and harmonious art viewing experience than any computer monitor or TV; so real, in fact, that it\u2019s difficult to tell the difference between Canvia and physical art. \nDon\u2019t Just Take Our Word For It\u2026\nPLAY\n\nWith Canvia, seeing is believing. If you want to check it out for yourself, request a timeslot for a live demo or video stream at outreach@palacio.life.  \nYou can also find out more on our website, Twitter and Instagram.\nStretch Goals\nThe Art Library\nCanvia is linked to a huge online library that includes artworks from all genres, eras, cultures and media (including photography), offering choices to suit any mood, occasion, context and d\u00e9cor.\nNeed something relaxing for a late-night study session? You can schedule one of Monet's calming waterlily paintings. Friends over for the big game? Go for a George Bellows from one of our 'Sports' themed playlists. Throwing a house party? We've got an explosive Kandinsky or energetic Degas cabaret scene for that.  \nWe\u2019ll be offering two subscription tiers for Canvia: a \u2018free\u2019 tier that currently has over 3,000 works (and is growing everyday), from Old Masters to Modern and Contemporary art, and a paid-for \u2018premium\u2019 tier of famous and upcoming current artists, illustrators and photographers.\nAll artwork is carefully curated and organized into themed playlists (for both vertical and horizontal orientations), or users can create their own. \nOur recommendation engine also helps you find works matching your d\u00e9cor and preferences, and all playlists can be scheduled for specific times of day.\nArtist Engagement \nCanvia is about sharing great art. We\u2019re building up a network of contributing partners - individual artists and photographers, galleries, museums and colleges - to ensure we offer the best art in the world. \nSince starting our outreach activities in March, we've partnered with over one hundred professional artists from across the globe and the list is growing every day. We recognize the great effort of creating art and so contributing artists will receive a share of our revenues.\nIf you're an artist and would like to apply to our library, please contact outreach@palacio.life.\nDevice Features & Specs\nUsers can schedule their own playlists and upload personal images via the app (iOS or Android), web account, USB or MicroSD. Information about an artwork and artist can be added as an overlay, and the entire artwork can be explored through zoom and repositioning functionality within the app.\nVoice integration with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant will be supported, although may not be available with the first firmware/software launch.\nAll works submitted by artists will reside in a closed system, which includes Canvia's secure cloud library, device and app. This will ensure the digital reproductions of artists' work cannot be misappropriated.\nCanvia\u2019s innovative patent-pending design allows customers to select variable frame/mat board widths, wood type and color, offering even more options to match your d\u00e9cor and creative preferences.  \nBlack, cherry, wood and white frame colors will be available for launch; black as standard and the other colors for an additional cost of $25. In order to upgrade your pledges, please follow these instructions:\nNote that the final mass-produced frame might have slightly different dimensions from the current pre-production prototypes due to manufacturing constraints. We will inform backers of any changes.\nHinges at the back allow you to pivot the device and access communication ports for USB and MicroSD uploads while Canvia is still mounted to the wall.\nCanvia automatically detects the orientation and loads compatible playlists.\nVESA mount compatibility affords greater mobility and control.\nWe also have a load of additional features that will be revealed in due course, all geared towards further enhancing the art experience - watch this space!\nThe Team  \nThe team at Palacio brings deep industry experience across connected devices, IOT, cloud technologies and video & image processing, as well as art curation, art direction, advertising and media production.  \nThis confluence of technology and creative thinking drives our innovation and reflects our ultimate goal with Canvia: to combine cutting-edge technical design with an artistic sensibility to create an entirely new way of enhancing and experiencing art in our living spaces.\nWhy we need your help\nWe\u2019ve spent the last year and a half developing, user testing and improving Canvia. We come to Kickstarter with a near 100% pre-production prototype.\n\nWe're now looking for your help to revolutionize the art experience. We can't wait to bring Canvia into homes, offices, restaurants and other living spaces and open up art to the world. \n\nSpecifically, our Kickstarter campaign will help to fund: \nCompleting mold designs for the mat board and chassis \nCompleting an initial mass production and manufacturing run of our first Canvia model\nRegulatory (FCC and CE) certification\nPackaging \nFeedback!

Love solving mysteries? Installing a security camera might seem like an obvious answer for surveillance, but it may surprise you that only 3 out of 10 homes have any sort of security device set up. And, as basic as a security camera system might seem, you\u2019ll be surprised to know that other cameras on the market actually present more problems than solutions.\n eufyCam is designed from the ground up to offer wireless freedom. We eliminated power cables, wall outlets, and the need to drill holes, giving you freedom to install eufyCam practically anywhere. Stick the mount onto any flat surface and eufyCam\u2019s ready to go\u2014in less than a second; or just stick it directly onto most metallic surfaces.\nPlace eufyCam anywhere you want surveillance.\n In developing eufyCam, we made it our priority to offer the longest battery life in the industry to ensure a convenient and top-notch wire-free experience. So it only made sense that we partnered up with Anker\u2014the leader in charging technology\u2014to maximize the efficiency and charging speed of the battery.\nThis collaboration resulted in eufyCam having the power to run for 365 days (or 3 years in Standby Mode) per charge when actively monitoring areas such as your front door or driveway, not idling by in your attic.\nBirds, dogs, and falling leaves can trigger other security cameras into sending you false alarms. We understand that a security camera that sends you excessive false alarms will just be ignored, or even worse, unplugged.\neufyCam reduces false alarms by up to 95% by applying a 3-step scanning and filtering process. First, register your friends and family as trusted faces, then, once someone approaches the vicinity of your house, eufyCam can determine if that person is someone you trust to further reduce the alerts you get.\nAfter this triple-filtering process, eufyCam will send you a notification according to your security level preference, whether it\u2019s alerting you of all movements detected or only when a stranger\u2019s face shows up.\nAll this data processing happens in a flash, so you will be notified in seconds when a stranger is at your door.\n The 140\u00b0 wide-angle lens provides a panoramic view, spanning from your driveway to the front door\u2014with no spots missed\u2014making it ideal for catching people walking past or towards your home.\nTop-of-the-line Sony Exmor sensor combine with large f2.2 aperture to offer around-the-clock Full HD surveillance, recording sharp and bright video during the day, plus crisp and clear Night Vision footage in the evening.\nBased on 2-camera set and 30 days history review package for a year.\nDesigned to protect your home as well as your wallet, eufyCam is a one-time purchase that combines security with convenience. Paying for cloud storage should be an option, not a voluntary-but-mandatory cost to claim your security footage.\nBecause eufyCam records video to local storage, you\u2019ll have easy access to your footage from your smartphone. For Free. Just insert the included microSD card* and you\u2019re all set. Alternatively, by subscribing to our cloud storage plan, you can expand your security options to include simultaneous recording to the cloud.\n*Included 16GB microSD card, which you can expand anytime you want, records approximately 1 year of video on one camera, with 10 videos per day, 30 seconds each. \n*Cloud Storage optional for $2.99/month per camera.\nYour data is for your eyes only. That's why it's secured with AES 128-bit encryption. Access to your footage requires the microSD card to be inserted into the Base Station it\u2019s registered to, and you are logged on to the account tied to the Base Station. So that means you and only you can access the data. Not a thief, not your neighbor, nor anyone from the eufy Security team.  \nConstructed from cutting-edge ASA composite material, which offers unrivaled strength and protection against the elements, eufyCam works perfectly indoors and outdoors. Whether it\u2019s raining, a freezing -4\u00b0F (-20\u00b0C) winter or scorching 122\u00b0F (50\u00b0C) summer, eufyCam will keep watch over your home. \nThe built-in microphone and speaker provides you with direct communication\u2014via your smartphone\u2014to the door. Whether you\u2019re at home or out, speak directly to whoever walks up to your home.\nOpen the eufy Security app and your smartphone becomes a window for high-resolution streaming of what eufyCam sees in real-time.\nMore Capacity - by packing in more battery capacity into the camera \nBetter Power Management - by using advanced battery technology from Anker \nLess Consumption - by utilizing HybridWave technology for 70% less energy consumption  \nThe DNN (deep neural network) algorithms that eufyCam uses are inspired by the human brain, which are designed to see patterns. By recognizing patterns, the DNN algorithms categorize the sensory data eufyCam receives to filter out irrelevant patterns, so only pertinent information is analyzed. \nOnce the patterns are analyzed and determined to be human, the facial-recognition engine kicks in to scan the faces to compare to the database to determine if you need to be alerted or not.    \nThe eufyCam will ship to backers in the U.S., Canada, and 28 European Union countries including the U.K. We will continue to review shipping options for our other backers and keep you posted of any updates. \neufyCam is built with the future in mind, and that\u2019s why we\u2019ll continually develop peripheral products to work with the eufyCam system, starting first with our entry sensor. The eufy Entry Sensor can help prevent break-ins by sounding an alarm and sending you alerts when a door or window is ajar while you\u2019re sleeping, or out and about. Easily installed and monitored with the eufy Security app, the sensor can operate for 2 years with the included CR123 battery.\n To find out how to order add-ons, please read the April 19th entry on the Updates page.\n*Only reward backers can order add-ons. Add-on cameras and sensors can't work independently, need to work with eufyCam HomeBase. \n*One eufy Security HomeBase can support up to 16 eufyCams and up to 34 sensors. Every eufyCam add-on package comes with one magnetic mount and one screw mount.\nWe\u2019re planning to add support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and IFTTT in the near future, via software updates. We\u2019re making eufyCam fully Alexa-enabled, so you can control it with your voice.

Thereafter, production testing and external certification testing will be undertaken to ensure that the Mu One behaves exactly as we expect.\nThen\u2026 (drum roll) it\u2019s \u2018show time\u2019 as we start mass production of the shiny new Mu One and gear up for shipping towards the end of the summer.\nHere's a first look at our initial prototyping of the Mu One in the meantime...\nOur Story\nA few years ago two Dudes wrestled with a sketch.\nA sketch that was about to have life forced upon it.\nIt was the start of a heroic British start-up story. A story that was solving a long overlooked problem of the size of the humble UK plug.\nHaving been unchanged for over 50 years the UK plug was outdated and outsized in comparison to the mobile devices that it served. That changed as the sketch became the Mu and the UK plug size was solved forever.\nThe Mu won Design of the Year, Accessory of Mobile World Congress along with other associated high profile awards for its novel and simplistic form factor.\nBut in reality, the job was only half done.\nUnder the hood, the unseen secondary challenge of the Mu related to the power that it provides. In its first manifestation the \u2018Mu Classic\u2019, the Mu had an output power of 1Amp\u200a\u2014\u200ajust enough to charge a smartphone. Later, the \u2018Mu Tablet\u2019, \u2018Mu Duo\u2019 and \u2018Mu International\u2019 increased the power to 2.4Amp\u200a\u2014\u200anow smartphone and tablet ready. But the enemy of increasing the power of the Mu had two faces: the size of the components on the electronics board inside the Mu that were generally linear to its output, and the heat that it produced. The Mu, being super small, had a very limited enclosure to fit power and to disperse and heat. The impact that the Mu could have over a full range of mobile devices was limited by its essence\u200a\u2014\u200asize.\nFor the last two years, the small team behind the Mu have been working with the major global semi-conductor companies aligning their design to the ultimate pursuit of these goliath power providers\u200a\u2014\u200ahigh power density (lots of output in a small space) and high efficiency (low heat loss).\nAnd the results are in\u2026\nThe Mu One hosts 45W output power, now enough to power the latest notebooks and Macbooks. It hosts Power Delivery Technology that creates a variable voltage for fast charging devices, and it has an auto detect chip on board that creates an optimum charge for iOS, Android and other makes of mobile devices. All of this inside the svelte 14mm profile of the Mu.\nBeing able to add over four times the power of its predecessor is a result of the birth of Gallium Nitride Technology (GaN) enabling a huge amount of power to be enclosed in a very small space\u200a\u2014\u200aall whilst running at a market leading efficiency of over 90%.\nFinally, the solution to create the ultimate Mu is available.\nTechnology has finally caught up with the Mu that those two Dudes always wanted to produce.\nTwo Dudes\n   This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur small design team first successfully launched our UK version of the Mu in 2012.\n\nSince then we've established fantastic manufacturing partnerships allowing us to design and build a Mu family.\n\nThis will be our third big product release since launching the original Mu USB charger in 2012, and this time around we have been working with a specialist technology partner to deliver an extraordinary small and powerful product. The Mu One combines their expertise, our design skills and the superb production capabilities of our manufacturing partners.\n\nAll of these are in place and prototypes have been made so we just need to lock down those prototypes, push into production, create some tooling and stir in a little magic. \n\nSaying that, we've done this before and we know that nothing is plain sailing but we've built in some contingency time into our production schedule to allow for the inevitable 'item' that we can't foresee at the moment. We're confident that the pursuit of creating magic will overcome that unknown 'item'.

It runs on a 24-hour, light-dark cycle in sync with the sun. When you are jetlagged this is when your Circadian Rhythm is out of sync with the sun in your location.\nNapping can help you find balance when you don't get enough sleep. Even a 20-minute nap can help boost your energy and help you restore levels of tiredness.\nSleep Cycles\n         Sleep Logistics  \nOur job at Silentmode is to develop our Napinness algorithm in order to tell you when it's the best time for you to take the perfect nap. We do this using a combination of data points from sleeping hours, wake up times and desired outcomes.\n  After a period of time, your data points will help the Silentmode Napinness Algorithm customise and output your perfect napping schedule ensuring you can be at your best.\nOne of our featured audio artists Tom Middleton (SONUX) - Bioharmonic Sleep and Relaxation Soundscape Designer / Sleep Science Psychoacoustic Researcher \nThe Circadian Rhythm has an influence on the amount of REM sleep you will receive in your nap. You may have experienced a dream early in the morning rather than right after you fall asleep at night. This is the effect of the Circadian Rhythm that peaks around 9 in the morning.\nBy understanding both your rhythm and sleep patterns it's possible to customise your naps to extract beneficial physical outcomes.\n      Famous Nappers \nThere have been a great number of famous nappers over the years.

And here\u2019s what makes it even worse: When your body doesn\u2019t get the rest it needs, your stress and anxiety are not only compounded, but your body doesn\u2019t have the mental strength to fight it off.\nYou can fight back!\nNo matter what\u2019s causing your stress or anxiety, it can be improved with sleep. That\u2019s a fact. Better sleep gives you more energy, helps you focus, resets your mind, and reinvigorates your body.

On some toilets pressing extra hard on the unit to make sure it gets full surface contact is solving that concern. \nOn others where the curve is too big we have tested using thicker adhesive ads and that solves the problem. It sticks perfectly with a thicker adhesive pad we have tested.

It allows you to insert and remove the filament really easily. You won\u2019t have to try to push in/pull out filament for hours!! \nHow does it work? Tap twice on my bed and the filament will self-travel between the extruder and the nozzle. \nMy End of Filament Detection \nI cleverly detect the filament end. When I\u2019m out of filament, I pause for you to add a new spool and resume. Say goodbye to filament waste and air-printing\u2026 Yeaaaah !\nMy Beautiful and Robust Design\nDo not just focus on my beauty, I am also very strong. I have smooth curves and I am 50% 3D printed. I also have a great texture which dresses me perfectly.\nI am also very robust and I resist shocks. Made of an entirely 3D printed body weighing over 350 grams, you can tilt me, I will continue to print. \nMy amazing Print Quality\nMy print quality is amazing: I'm able to print incredibly consistent layers, from 200 microns up to 100 microns.\nOur high quality stepper motors allow the NEVA to print up to 80 mm/sec.\nAnd because I see things big, my printing surface is wide: 7 inches diameter (18 cm) and 8 inches height (20cm).\nMy simple software\nI never go out without my accessories. My free slicer (Cura by Dagoma) was conceived and imagined so that a child can use it. You only need to enter the print quality, fill rate and filament type. The rest of the settings is automatically picked and optimized for you.\nThen, insert an SD card and export your Gcode on it. That\u2019s all :)\nAnd with all these awesome skills, I can assure you, we'll have fun together !\nPLAY\n\nPerformance and integration of Hardware and software is so smooth you won\u2019t believe it : look :-)\nWait! I also come fully assembled, so just take me out of the box... plug & play!\n        Want to see a full print? Here you go!\nPLAY\n\nIt seems I'm the most fantastic and humble delta 3Dprinter. I'm the only one 50% printed... And I'm printed locally... Or I will! And I count on you to do it :) !\nI come from a big Family : the Dago'family.\nDagoma was created in 2014 in France by 2 engineers who want to change the world and our way to consume thanks to 3Dprinting.\nTo answer this strong mission, they first created my sister : the DiscoEasy200 printer. My sister is quiete famous in France : more than 8000 machines have been sold already, making Dagoma Leader in 3D printing in France and number 3 in Europe.\nAfter 2 years, my parents wanted to re-invent the simplicity and use of 3D printers. That's why they created me : the most magic, simple and affordable printer for all!\nAt the same time, they decided to open a second factory and establish it... in the US in Goleta. And this is the target of this Kickstarter: having enough backers to be able to launch this factory and deliver me to all of you quickly and in a eco-friendly way!\nI was designed to entertain young and old alike. \nYou want it? I print it. Jewelry, toys, figurines, crazy projects, spare parts for your blender or to organize your garage.\nAre you a music fan? Print your guitar. \nTell me your hobby and I will print what makes it even more wonderful.\nPLAY\n\nI was also designed for educational purposes. Whether it's to discover 3D printing and drawing or to develop fun technology projects, schools, universities and students will find a way to use me and learn with me!\nAn extraordinary wind turbine charging your phone !\nI'm not a toy, I'm a real business investment! Both small and large companies will be able to earn money thanks to me ! The first one to prove it? DAGOMA! We've got the biggest 3Dprinter factory: over 500 3D printers printing our new baby sisters almost 24/7.\nSo we want to do the same in California!\nWhat's the gain for you, entrepreneurs and Industries? Time saved on prototyping, small series... You might need me and my siblings to develop your business!\nWe already have famous Industries working with us, such as Peugeot PSA or Decathlon.\nthey are talking about us!\nI'm manufactured & 3D printed locally. That's part of my DNA.\nMy new nursery will be in Goleta, California. I want to be made in the USA.  \nWe also have two homes in France: Lille & Bordeaux. I'm already made in France.  \n... I now want to be manufactured locally,  everywhere.\nFeel free to visit us as soon as you can!\nIf you need help to understand me, to dredge me, to tame me, you will always have a Dago'teammate ready to answer all your questions. You will never be alone in this incredible adventure!\nYou have access to a local pre-sale and after sale service !\nMy parents always taught me to support causes that made sense to me.\nSo we decided, Dagoma and I, to get involved with e-nable, which allows children with agenesis of the hand to get a hand tailored, printed by a member of the community.\nWe are also involved locally in arts. We collaborate with local artists to propose you unique editions of our printers and promote links between art and technology.\nHere is the result of a collaboration with the French artist Aysar :\nNEVA customized by Aysar artist\nPreserving the environment and changing consumption patterns is our very essence. That's why we use the most environmentally friendly products possible. For example, I am printed in PLA, a plastic made of starch. And my parents recycle all our plastic waste to form new filaments .\nWhy do I need your help today? Because we need you to be able to start my new nursery: a 10 000 sqft factory, to manufacture and print me locally.

It makes drinking water a healthy addiction by making it taste closer to soda or juice. The scent and flavoring is safely added to the lid, which can be changed around. (Patent Pending) These flavoring oils have been approved for use both within the EU and by the FDA, are already used in existing beverages on the market, and can last anywhere from 6 to 12 months.\n20 seconds of your time could make a positive difference for someone else. Hydration is important, but so many of us don't get enough of it. Click one of the buttons below and share with someone who could use Flavour Bottle today.\nFlavour has all the flavors that you will love. \nThroughout 2016, we developed five flavors which include: strawberry, watermelon, orange, grape, and cola. \nThese flavors can also be enjoyed with carbonated water, which creates the fizz that many sodas and flavored waters have. \nSo How and Why Does it Work?\nAlthough our taste buds discern a good amount of flavor in 5 sensations (sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami), most scientists agree smell accounts for up to 80% of the sensation of taste.\nThrough a patented process, we\u2019ve managed to safely add food grade flavors to a silicone spout on the lids of the Flavour bottle. These are added during the manufacturing process, allowing the scent and flavor to last. \nRather than diffusing quickly, we\u2019ve used a process that gradually brings the flavor and scent to the top of the spout, allowing it to last much longer. Our scents have lasted up to 12 months, depending on the usage of the bottle. Once the scent and flavor is used up, an additional lid can be purchased to replace the old one, without having to replace the bottle. \nThe process is completely safe and is similar to edible waxes being incorporated into paper coffee cups to keep them from leaking. The silicone we are using is the same silicone already used by several other large water bottle companies on the market. \nAs you drink through the spout, you\u2019re also breathing in scented \u201cair\u201d from the straw itself, allowing you to get the full sensation of flavor while drinking water. You're also getting a hint of flavor from the flavoring oils coming through to the surface of the silicone. Structurally, we added a cap so that the scent wouldn't diffuse too quickly. \nWhen you are congested, you lose a bit of the flavor experience.  Food just doesn\u2019t taste as good when you can\u2019t smell. That\u2019s because a special channel connects the roof of the throat to the nose. When we eat and drink foods, odors make their way up through this channel to olfactory cells in the nose. It becomes blocked when we are sick or congested or even if we are consuming something while holding down our nose.\nThere has been a lot of work done in this field of science. Below are just a few of many resources on this topic.\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120530133708.htm\nhttp://www.livescience.com/2737-surprising-impact-taste-smell.html\nhttps://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bring-science-home-jelly-bean-taste-smell/\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VuR6QuWrHrc&t=101s\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJud8MKrvBE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HxAB54wlig\nIt Really Works!\nWhen we initially begun working on the Flavour Bottle, we had been through many different experiments to really get this concept to work as well as it is claimed by science.\n\nWe spent over three years of research and development to get to a prototype we felt worked for everyone, not just those who have stronger senses of smell. \nOur very first prototype was a scented cap on top of a bottle. One of the first things we realized was that we don\u2019t consciously smell through our nose while eating or drinking. Most of the scent of our food is actually being breathed in through the back of our mouth. We also experimented with creating a scented plastic ring from plastic casting resin to put on top of a bottle.\nOur initial prototypes\nSo our first prototypes did not work nearly as well as we expected them to. They worked similarly to the way a cup would work with a rim to drink from. Although it made the experience of drinking water more pleasant, it did not really add any taste to the water we drank. We had also molded this initial cap out of plastic and fruit flavors, and the scent did not last very long.\nWe began to think, what if we created some sort of drinking spout that was flavored. Its proximity to the mouth while water is being drank would work much better.\n\nAnd Eureka! That is how the Flavour Bottle was born. Inspired by scented silicone bands as well as erasers with scents that have lasted a very long time, we decided to create a food grade silicone spout.\nOur first prototypes were a few food grade silicone straws that had watermelon scents infused into them. We wanted to test these straws out to make sure they conveyed what we felt they would. The positive reinforcement kept us going to develop the bottle fully. \nWe poured water in glasses and invited random students to try it out at the University of Texas at Austin. Check out the results below.\nPLAY\n\n\nThrough a proprietary process, we\u2019ve managed to add the natural flavors that beverage companies use in their drinks and safely insert them into our silicone spout. We are working with a manufacturer that sources food grade flavors that have been approved by both the FDA and the EU. \nThe silicone took in the scent much better than plastic, allowing it to last a lot longer and diffuse a lot slower. Silicone has a characteristic that allows the scent to release when it is rubbed or touched, as opposed to plastic, which diffuses into the air. It is for this reason that the scent within the silicone lasts a lot longer than in plastic. \nSpecifications\nWho is it for?\nOur goal is to make drinking water a healthy addiction just like drinking soda. Water is the healthiest drink at the end of the day, as it does not contain any extra sugars or other harmful ingredients. Many of us do not get enough of it because we gravitate towards unhealthy sodas. We vastly underestimate how much water we really need.  And for those of us who unfortunately suffer from diabetes, these sodas and juices aren\u2019t even an option, so it makes it more difficult to enjoy water with actual flavors and tastes added to it.\nBut What About Flavored Waters and Fruit Infusers?\nWe did a test and looked into the ingredients of several different flavored waters. Most of these ingredients as you can see are preservatives and other questionable ingredients such as aspartame. Plus, they get expensive over time.       \nFruit infusers are awesome, but we don\u2019t always have the time to cut up fruit to add it in to water, plus fruit goes bad quickly and can get expensive. Water is the healthiest drink on the market, without any sugar or added calories, and often times that\u2019s exactly what we need.\nWe\u2019ve also included a cola version and will continue to create more flavors inspired by soda, which cannot be mimicked by infusers.\nAdding carbonated water increases the sensation of cola in the cola flavor.\nRewards\nWe want to wholeheartedly thank you for believing in our vision. You can see our rewards below:     \nWe have worked hard to subsidize our shipping prices while still ensuring a quick delivery after prooduction. We are working with global fulfillment centers to reduce the amount of time shipment would take as well as the cost, which is difficult to reduce typically for international shipping. We are also using a special high barrier pouch to protect the scent on the bottle, which adds a little bit to the cost of shipping. \nAbout Us\n  Where are you in the process?\nWe have spent a long time perfecting our bottle, making sure it works as fantastically as it claims. We are working with a experienced material manufacturer to source food grade silicone as well as flavors from the world's largest flavoring oil company. These are flavors that have been approved for use both by the FDA and within the EU. \nWhat will the funds be used for?\nBringing a brand new product to market has its costs. We have a few working prototypes, but the silicone spouts we are working with have very high MOQs, so we need to raise the funds in order to be able to get a Flavour Bottle into the hands of everyone. This is because the process of using food grade flavors with silicone is a very specialized one and requires a very pristine environment, all of which lead to a high initial startup cost. \nWhat's Next?\nWe are super excited to be able to bring this product to market. The applications are endless, and we truly believe there are many additional modifications we can make over time, by adding more flavors or even adding a filter within the bottle. Below you can see our timeline and where you all have joined in in our journey. We are extremely excited to get this product in your hands, and we won't rest until we do.\nHelp Out by Sharing Flavour Bottle with all your Dehydrated friends. \nIf you like what you\u2019re seeing, you\u2019re awesome! Don\u2019t be shy about sharing it with your equally great friends. It\u2019s so easy. Just hit one of the share buttons.\nThe more people know about the Flavour bottle, the more we can decrease this addiction to sugary drinks that\u2019s plaguing our world today.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll members of our team have backed Kickstarters that have had their delays and setbacks. No one wants to see a great idea executed poorly. An idea is worthless if it's never brought to fruition. We have spent a lot of time finding the perfect manufacturer for our water bottle, both the silicone part and the main body. Here's what we are doing to minimize any risk to you:\n\nManufacturing: Our most important part of this project is getting the silicone spout manufactured correctly. This means that the scent must be fully incorporated during the manufacturing phase. To really enhance the longevity of the silicone, we've worked with experts in the field of scent encapsulation, who have spent almost a decade developing this technology.\n\nProduct Adjustments: We want to deliver the best Flavour bottle to you, our backers who have put faith in us. That is why we encourage discussion throughout our process with our backers. If there is something we can do to improve the end product, we will consult with our manufacturers but also consult directly with our backers. Any modifications made will always be conveyed directly, and we promise to be honest and upfront.\n\nFulfillment: We've seen Kickstarter campaigns where a manufacturer did not deliver as promised or had issues with production machinery, which trickled down into the entire campaign. For production of the bottle itself, we have two back-up manufacturers that can handle the situation if something goes awry with our main manufacturer.

At present, these courses often lack a machine vision component. This is mainly, we believe, because there is no simple machine vision device one can use together with the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or similar device used in these courses. JeVois aims to fill this gap by providing a self-contained, configurable machine vision engine that can deliver both visual outputs of how it is analyzing what it sees (useful to understand the algorithms), and text outputs over a serial link that describe what it has found (useful to send to a micro-controller that can control a robot).\nOverview\nThe JeVois framework operates as follows: video is captured from the camera sensor, processed on the fly through some machine vision algorithm directly on the camera's own processor, and the results are streamed over USB to a host computer and/or over serial to a micro-controller.\nTo the host computer, the JeVois smart camera is just another USB camera. Different vision algorithms are selected by changing USB camera resolution and framerate. Users or machines can also interact with the JeVois smart camera, change its settings, or listen for text-based vision outputs over serial link (both hardware serial and serial-over-USB are supported).\nThree major modes of operation:\nDemo/development mode: the smart camera outputs a demo display over USB that shows the results of its analysis, possibly along with simple results communicated over serial port (e.g., coordinates and content of any QRcode that has been identified).\nText-only mode: the smart camera provides no USB output, but only text strings, for example, commands for a pan/tilt controller.\nPre-processing mode: the smart camera outputs video that is intended for machine consumption, for example an edge map computed over the video frames captured by the camera sensor, or a set of image crops around the 3 most interesting objects in the scene. This video can then be further processed by the host computer, for example, using a massive deep neural network running on a cluster of high-power GPUs to recognize the three most interesting objects that the smart camera has detected. Text outputs over serial are of course also possible in this mode.\nBut, really, anything is possible, since the whole JeVois software framework is open-source.\nHardware Specs\nAt a glance:\n A brief tour:\nThe JeVois smart camera is a complete Linux computer. It can run on its own, without a host PC. Thanks to the cooling fan, it can run under full processing load without overheating and while maintaining a constant 1.34 GHz CPU speed.\n Software Specs\nA few examples (watch the video for more). All results shown below are computed on the JeVois camera itself. The smart camera does all the work, including image capture, vision processing, and creating the demo displays. The host computer only runs a standard video camera software (e.g., guvcview on a Linux host) to display the smart camera's results.\nVisual Attention detects interesting things in the world\n In the above, the algorithm processing speed is 73.1 fps on the smart camera's processor, that is, it takes 13.68 ms to process one video frame. The camera sensor captures frames at 60 fps (16.67 ms per frame), which sets the video streaming speed. One could run some additional algorithms during the 3 ms difference. Also note that the CPU is not fully loaded by this algorithm (148.7% load, while 400% would correspond to fully loading all 4 CPU cores). Hence additional algorithms could also run in parallel with visual attention.\nAugmented reality markers (ArUco)\n  Object detection and recognition\n  Road detection for autonomous driving\n  120Hz eye tracking (camera streams at 120 fps, processing runs at 200+ fps)\nand see many more in the campaign video.\nThis is an open-source project. Anyone can contribute. Which vision algorithms will you create?\nHost Computer Requirements\nThe JeVois smart camera can work as a standalone computer, with no USB video streaming. In such case, one would usually simply stream commands to an Arduino or similar over the serial port. All you need then is to provide power to the JeVois camera's mini-USB connector.\nFor video streaming over USB:\nLinux (including Raspberry Pi): Works out of the box, no drivers needed, all functionality is available. You can switch between different vision processing modes on the fly and at runtime, by selecting different camera resolutions and frame rates on your host computer. For example, 640x300@60fps may run the visual attention algorithm, while 320x256@60fps may run the QRcode detection algorithm. A configuration file on the MicroSD card establishes the mapping between USB video resolution and frame rate, camera sensor resolution and frame rate, and vision algorithm to run.\nWindows, Mac OS X: Streaming works but selecting among different available video resolutions has become increasingly difficult with newer versions of Windows and OS X. It seems that these operating systems do not want to let you choose a camera resolution or frame rate. This choice, however, is how one can switch on the fly between different vision algorithms on the JeVois camera. One workaround is to configure your JeVois smart camera with only one vision algorithm (achieved by commenting out entries for other resolutions in a configuration file on the MicroSD card). Then the host computer will have no choice but to use that one.\nAndroid: The camera is detected but streaming video does not work yet. We are working on this and we suspect this has to do with deviations from the USB video class (UVC) standard on the Android side. For example, a USB packet sniffer has revealed that the Android device insists on querying camera controls that were not declared as being supported by the JeVois hardware.\niOS: The JeVois smart camera, and any other USB camera we have tried, are currently reported as not being a supported device. This may change in the future.\nConnecting to Arduino or similar\nDeveloping for JeVois\nEverything is cross-compiled on a host computer. At present only Linux is supported for compiling JeVois software. JeVois software is written in C++17, with a few low-level algorithms in optimized C. We use CMake to manage the build process. This allows you to build for both your host computer and for the JeVois hardware, both at the same time. This is very useful during development, since you can test your algorithms using any USB webcam and observe the results in a window on your screen. You can also use your host computer to train a deep neural network quickly, and then just load the weights onto your MicroSD card. The JeVois operating system is Linux and its features are managed by buildroot.\nScripts are provided to automate the process:\nrebuild-host.sh - compile the entire JeVois software suite natively on a host computer. You can use it with a USB webcam, and it display outputs in a window on your screen.\nrebuild-platform.sh - cross-compile the entire JeVois software suite for the smart camera hardware.\njevois-build.sh - flash the cross-compiled results from rebuild-platform.sh to a MicroSD card.\nContributions & novelty\nIn principle, you could assemble a working machine vision system using existing embedded computer boards, adding a camera, and programming a USB output. In fact, this how we started... - er, two years ago!\nThe hurdles we encountered and solved in creating JeVois are as follows:\n- Linux support for camera chips is often very limited. We wrote our own highly efficient kernel driver and figured out how to configure undocumented camera chip registers to support all the controls available on the camera (exposure, frame rate, etc). Most camera drivers in the Linux kernel only support one or a few resolutions and frame rates, many do not support controls such as manual exposure, etc. You could use a USB camera, for which support for the controls has been standardized, but not many support 60 or 120 frames/s, and they would increase the overall size, weight, power and cost of the system. Our kernel camera driver exploits hardware that is integrated into our CPU chip for direct image capture from a camera sensor. This is faster, provides lower latency (time between image capture and start of rocessing), and uses less CPU resources than attaching a USB camera sensor.\n- Linux support for the device-side of video streaming over USB is virtually non-existent (in open source). This is software that you need to run on the smart camera's CPU to make it appear as if it was a USB camera to a connected host computer. A webcam gadget module has been present in the Linux kernel source tree for several years, but its functionality is very limited, and, as we discovered, its very core logic is broken. We developed a fully working device-side kernel USB Video Class driver, with highly efficient data streaming and pass-through support for video resolutions, pixel formats, frame rates, and camera controls (when users change those on the host computer, the changes are relayed to the camera sensor chip).\n- Many small embedded computer boards exist, but software support is often limited, and quality sometimes is low. We had to fix kernel USB drivers, kernel GPU drivers, kernel camera drivers, and many other elements in the Linux kernel to make it work flawlessly while supporting all the features listed above. Small embedded boards also are no match for our solution in terms of total system size (including camera, connectors, fan), power consumption, speed and video latency (delay between capturing an image and presenting the processing results to the host computer), and out-of-the box enjoyment and reliability. For example, one has to face the reality that a quad-core chip will just overheat under load if it does not have a fan or very, very large heatsink.\nWe employed special design and manufacturing techniques which enabled us to deliver a complete, self-contained system in a tiny form factor. As an example, we run our DDR3 memory at its full rated clock speed (DDR3-1600), while other ARM boards we have surveyed on the market sometimes run at just half that speed. We achieved optimum speed as the result of extremely detailed circuit board design and optimization, and through the use of custom design, simulation, and fabrication tools. It makes a big difference for many vision processing algorithms (about 15% faster).\nIn summary, because we are developing the hardware, software and mechanical design jointly, we are able to deliver a highly optimized, plug-and-play, high satisfaction solution that just does not exist anywhere else today.\nLong-Term Vision\nWith JeVois we aim to enable everyone to use machine vision in embedded, IoT, robotics, and educational projects. While this campaign is to help us bootstrap the mass manufacturing of the hardware, we continue to work on the following open-source software aspects:\nSoftware development is gearing up to provide a repository of machine vision modules shared by the community. This is the equivalent of an app store for JeVois. It is expected to come online by February, before the devices start shipping.\nWe are developing a curriculum of activities around the JeVois camera for all levels (from kindergarten to Ph.D.). Activities will start at the entry level (just point the camera towards something and see whether it can identify it), to learning how the underlying machine vision algorithms work, to modifying existing algorithms, and finally learning vision theory and developing your own algorithms. This is expected to become available in April. We will leverage significant material we have developed by teaching robotics, vision, and artificial intelligence courses at the undergraduate and graduate level over the past 15 years.\nOur overall mission is an educational and outreach one. We hope that JeVois will help us and others translate the latest vision research results into working machines. JeVois will be integrated to our outreach activities, which include working with neighboring K-12 schools, our Robotics Open House program, and others. We have a small budget already available for outreach, which includes loaning and donating some JeVois hardware to interested students. Details will be available in February.\nComparison to the Raspberri Pi 3 model B\nRewards\nRewards include barebones kits and turnkey kits in several quantities. Choose a barebones kit if you already have microSD cards and mini-USB cables and do not need more of those. Choos a turnkey kit if you want to be ready to run out the box.\nColors\nChoose your colors in the backer survey after you place your pledge. Note that with the lighter colors, you will see the LED shine through the plastic case and make a small halo around the hole in the case for the LED. You may want this for better visibility or not if you find it distracting. The color that makes the most sense from a machine vision standpoint is black.\nThanks\nThis campaign is basically to build a batch of units that achieves low mass production costs. Please help us spread the word if you like this project.

It definitely is the perfect travel companion.\nWith OSTRICH PILLOW GO we want to make sure that not a single person is excluded because of his or her neck proportions.\nTo use OSTRICH PILLOW GO, simply place it around your neck and fix it without fuss thanks to its hidden magnetic buttons.\nIts three different positions guarantee a perfect fit and adaptation to your neck whatever its size. Then you're set to go and enjoy comfy dreams.\nThe secret behind OSTRICH PILLOW GO's unique comfort lies inside. The viscoelastic core of the pillow is made out of high-sensitivity memory foam. The foam core has a protective cotton fabric layer around it. The outermost layer is a removable and washable sleeve made out of skin-friendly stretchable fabric.\nOur team has worked hard to find a universal shape that would provide optimal headrest for different neck types. \nOSTRICH PILLOW GO's carefully chosen materials are able to reduce dramatic in volume, which is extremely convenient for travelling.\nWe've spent months testing hundreds of foam samples until we got to the nap-perfect consistency that guarantees dream-level comfort and compact transport for hardcore travellers.   \nOSTRICH PILLOW GO is the latest in the OSTRICH PILLOW saga of napping classics.\nWe are Studio Banana Things, the design studio behind the idea. We first launched the OSTRICH PILLOW ORIGINAL in Kickstarter in 2012 and the campaign was a total success that went viral on global media. Since then we've created the commute-friendly LIGHT and the discreet MINI versions, also to great public and Kickstarter acclaim.\nEarlier this year we thought that the next member of the OSTRICH PILLOW family should focus on providing perfect neck support and be super compact for diehard travellers. Our design team has spent the last few months studying the anatomy of the neck, analysing emerging travel habits, researching materials and patterns, visiting manufacturers and restlessly improving the design until we got to a really satisfactory point.\nWe're super excited to bring OSTRICH PILLOW GO to you and can't wait to press the button GO at the factory thanks to your support.\n  Designing OSTRICH PILLOW GO we have leveraged on all our knowledge on napping pillows accumulated over the years. We have done our homework and in parallel to working on the design of the product we have identified the different suppliers and manufacturers that are in a capacity to produce the product from the get-go (no pun intended).\nA particular aspect about memory foam is that it needs to be injected in a mould for manufacturing. The great news is that we have already made that initial investment and we have the mould ready at the factory.\nThe supply of the special lining fabric is another critical aspect and we are happy to inform you that we have the material ready to be ordered. If our campaign goes well we'll be proposing as stretch goals different fabric patterns so get ready to make your choice!\nThe final key aspect is packaging. The design is very advanced and we're finalising the manufacturing details. You'll surely get news from us about this aspect during the campaign.\nMany in the Kickstarter community may already know about us, Studio Banana Things. We are a passionate group of designers who love to imagine new worlds and develop fun and functional solutions for people on the go.\nWe are best known for the OSTRICH PILLOW family, which has turned heads internationally for the last 3 years. We are also recognised for other award-winning designs which have been exhibited in places such as the Museum of Modern Art New York.\nKickstarter, with its smart and active community of backers, is the perfect platform for us to explore our latest ideas. We are keen to listen and learn from you during this campaign and need you every step of the way.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPerfection and outstanding levels of customer service are at the core of our values and we like being frank with our fans and supporters.\n\nOSTRICH PILLOW GO is a new product and like with all Kickstarter campaigns you will be the first to receive it and be mega wowed, we are sure of this!!! When you see OSTRICH PILLOW GO in retail, you must show off to your friends you made the manufacturing possible.\n\nMoving from prototype to production brings challenges at times. We have minimised the possibility of ugly bumps on the road by advancing a great deal in the manufacturing preparation. We have a ready-to-use mould and a ready-to-start manufacturing partner, with all fabric suppliers lined up. This guarantees we can stick to our planned timeline.\n\nDuring our previous Kickstarter launch's we encountered some hurdles and aim to avoid these 100%. Some of these issues were relating to logistics matters, we have addressed all of these aspects (we don't like repeating the same issues). Due to some of these hurdles we have regrettably had to reduce the number of countries we can ship to in order to avoid compromising delivery lead times.\n\nOf course some international customs, certification, logistic delays, and Force Majeure may occasionally show their ugly head.

Thermal design and the step up to x5-Z8350 delayed the UP Board project. With the next generation UP\u00b2 (UP Squared), we are taking a different path on thermal design, using all our knowledge gained from UP. \n\nWith UP\u00b2 (UP Squared) we have spent more than two months discussing all specifications and component placement. We've driven all product capabilities in once, therefore we remain confident that no more upgrade options need to be managed later on. We've brought together a logistic team in-house, this will assist us in providing a delivery plan and handle all orders efficiently!\n\nWe had to work with LPDDR4 technology for the first time together with a complete new architecture that hasn\u2019t reached the market yet. Just a few days back, we amended the design to enhance the memory bandwidth. Now, we are working on developing the drivers for Altera FPGA MAX 10 to control the 40 Pin I/O as well as the 60 Pin. We are also improving layout optimixations and eMMC firmware boot.\n\nUP\u00b2 (UP Squared) is the answer to all applications.\n.\nAre you up for UP\u00b2 (UP Squared) ?

Plastic bottled water is convenient but does so much permanent damage to our planet. \nLet's all start doing something now to prevent this from happening!\nSo we created que Bottle, the only collapsible bottle that can travel with you and looks absolutely awesome. Unique spiral design shrinks que bottle to half of its size without sacrificing its stylish appeal.\nFeatured on:\n              Made of 100% BPA-free food-grade silicone, que Bottle is 100% plastic-free, making it safe for people and the planet. It\u2019s lightweight and compact, taste and odor free, stain and bacteria resistant, dishwasher safe, and safe to use for both hot (up to 140F) and cold beverages. Plus, we are offering two size: high-capacity 20 fl oz for everyday use and 12 fl oz bottle for travelers and kids. Collapsed que bottle can be used as a small-sized bottle, making it even more versatile.\nThe Silicone Material\nWhy did we choose to use silicone to make que Bottle?\nThe que Bottle is tested for its high and pure grade silicone quality because we understand that the container that holds your water should be safe. Unlike metal or plastic containers, silicone WILL NOT change the taste of your water. It's the water bottle that has the best qualities of glass and metal, with the added benefit of being flexible, light, and shatter resistant.\nThe Functions\nCollapsible: shrinks to half its size to fit anywhere\nOne push, easy collapse\nCollapses into a small size to fit in bags and pockets\n Wide mouth:fits ice cubes\n Safe for hot beverages: up to 140\u00b0F (60\u00b0C)\nSafe to use for hot coffee, tea, and cleaning with boiling water\n Easy to clean: dishwasher safe \n Durable: Collapse and expand over and over again\n Leakproof: airtight secure seals\nLeak-proof que Bottle makes sure your bag stays dry\n Shockproof: shock resistant \nNo damages caused if dropped by accident\n 100% food-grade silicone: FDA/LFGB approved\n 18/8 stainless steel cap: top kitchenware grade stainless steel\n 100% plastic-free: NO plastic material used for que bottle, 100% GREEN!\n The new travel essential, the bottle that travels with you everywhere.\n Never without a bottle again!\nIt's more than just a water bottle, beautifully crafted que Bottle is also a fashion accessory!\nHelp save the environment in the most stylish way possible!\n Four vibrant colors:\nSleek design and vibrant colors will suit your daily styles\n                   Stretch Goals:\nHi, we are Jean and Kevin, the creators of que Bottle. We like to travel all over the world and it deeply upsets us that we see a lot of used and abandoned plastic bottles everywhere we go.\nWe realized that the reason people were still buying highly marked-up plastic bottled water at public places was for the sake of convenience. There simply isn't a good alternative travel bottle available. Current water bottles are either bulky, making them impossible to carry around, or dull-looking and cheap-made foldable flasks.\nSo we wanted to make something that\u2019s functional but also looks great. We came up with the initial design and worked day and night for 12 months to bring it to fruition.\nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nGet Cash Back on the Projects You Love!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are dedicated to setting our brand and product standards high, and we will do our absolutely best to fulfill deliveries to you, our backers!\n\nWe have passed our prototype and testing stage successfully, and we are confidently entering the mass production stage.\n\nHowever, shipping a large number of products at once can be challenging considering we have a relatively small team.

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Fidget Cube!\nWe can't do this without you!\n        Questions?\nAsk away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.\nFeedback?\nGot a creative idea you think we should implement with Fidget Cube? Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo.

Since the advent of voice interaction technology, our life has truly become easier in many ways.\nWe think we can take advantage of this technology, and achieve more with it \u2013 ReSpeaker provides an open source, modular voice interface that allows us to hack things around us, just using our voices.\nRather than a voice assistant that fulfills simple tasks only when you asked, ReSpeaker provides a hands-free way of voice interaction for you and your surroundings. \nWith ReSpeaker, you are able to control, or even communicate with your toy robot, your home appliances, your plant, your office, your internet-equipped devices and many other things in your daily life.\nMore detail about the Stretch Goal 1 please go to: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seeed/respeaker-an-open-modular-voice-interface-to-hack/posts/1663367\nMore detail about the Stretch Goal 2 please go to: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seeed/respeaker-an-open-modular-voice-interface-to-hack/posts/1679978\nPowered by the MT7688 Wi-Fi module and the built-in high performance microphone, ReSpeaker responds to your voice and recognize your speeches based on powerful online cognitive services like Microsoft Cognitive Service, Amazon Alexa Voice Service, Google Speech API, Wit.ai and Houndify.\nAlso with the on board SD card slot to extend the storage and the integrated lightweight speech recognition engine - the PocketSphinx, ReSpeaker works equally well for keywords spotting when offline. You can have a large vocabulary and audio files stored in local storage to implement the speech recognition at anytime, anywhere, even without the internet.\nSetting up ReSpeaker is super easy and only takes a few minutes.\nWithout any App installation, you can start by connecting ReSpeaker to your WiFi network and then directly use our Web-based App to access a range of rich featured applications that ReSpeaker has provided, includes music streaming, file manager, plug-in, customized settings and more.\nVoice interface has never been apart from music entertainment, so does ReSpeaker. \nReSpeaker supports Airplay/DLNA for wireless music streaming. Just connect ReSpeaker to any ordinary speaker with an AUX cable, then you can start enjoying the music you love without pressing a single button.\nOf course we want to explore more possibilities coming out from ReSpeaker, and to achieve that we believe the best way is to leverage the power of the open source community. ReSpeaker runs the OpenWrt system that is based on Linux, which makes it 100% friendly to developers. \nAnd provided with our detailed and easy-to-use SDK, developers are able to develop more applications using Python on Linux. ReSpeaker also supports other popular programming languages like C/C++, Arduino, JavaScript and Lua.\nReSpeaker is not limited to what it can do for now, it is always growing. We\u2019ve developed a plug-in system that would continuously expand ReSpeaker\u2019s features and functionalities in the future. \nOur team will keep adding more plug-ins for ReSpeaker to cover as many things as possible that people want to have voice interactions with. \nAdvanced users can also develop their own plug-ins using our user-friendly Python APIs. All the plug-ins will be shared on the Web APP and free-to-download for everyone.  \nIn addition to the plug-in system, ReSpeaker is also extendable with plug-n-play hardware add-ons. \nThe far-field MIC Array allows your ReSpeaker to be able to recognize your location and hear you from across the room even while the music is playing. \nAnd the Grove extension board brings even more possibilities as you can connect various Grove sensors and actuators to extend its capabilities. The two onboard expansion headers also offer I2S, I2C, AUX, USB 2.0, GPIOs and many other interfaces that you can use for more applications.\nYou might wondering why ReSpeaker does not have speaker. In fact it does. We've cooperated with Meow King Audio Electronic Company and develop the Meow King Drive Unit. It can be directly connected to the bottom of ReSpeaker Core to produce beautiful sound out of it.\nAll the add-ons are modularized and have an identical disk design same as the core board. They can be stacked to one another when they are connected through soldering-free pins and header.\nTo improve the voice interaction experience, we developed the ReSpeaker Mic Array based on the XVSM-2000 Smart Microphone from XMOS. The board integrates 7 PDM microphones to help enhance ReSpeaker's acoustic DSP performance to a much higher level. With the Mic Array attached onto the top of the ReSpeaker Core, the Core is now able to: \nHear You From Far Away\nFocus On Your Voice\n Improve Your Voice Quality\nThe exposed PCB design does not mean ReSpeaker is just for people who knows a lot about hardware or software. \nThe plug-in system is designed for the community to share and download their voice interactive projects as a simple plug-in to the ReSpeaker module. It has significantly simplified the use of ReSpeaker as anyone who has a ReSpeaker can install the plug-ins they want with a single click, and after that they can run voice interaction just like any others. \nDevelopers can of course achieve more with the SDK we provide to develop their own voice interaction projects .\nFor beginners, we have step-by-step tutorials and recipes to help you getting started with your first project with ReSpeaker.\nRather than the on board MT7688 Wi-FI module which runs the Linux based OpenWrt, ReSpeaker is also powered by the ATmega32u4 chip and it\u2019s absolutely Arduino compatible, which means, we can use ReSpeaker as a powerful Arduino board and do many \u2018Arduino\u2019 things. It\u2019s for learning, it\u2019s for practicing, and it\u2019s for fun.\nFor example, you can program it with Arduino IDE to have a special DIY piano that is built on 8 cherry tomatoes connecting to the 8 touch sensors of ReSpeaker.\nWe are making ReSpeaker compatible with our previous project the Wio Link and the subsequent members of the Wio family the Wio Node and the Wio Core.\nWio Link is an ESP8266 based open-source Wi-Fi development board to create IoT applications by virtualizing plug-n-play Grove modules to RESTful APIs with mobile APPs. \nMore information about Wio Link can be either find at our previous Kickstarter Campaign :\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/seeed/wio-link-3-steps-5-minutes-build-your-iot-applicat/description\nor at Wio Link's official website:\nhttp://iot.seeed.cc/\nThere are videos demonstrate what is Wio Link and how easy it is to build an Internet of Things application with Wio Link,\nHow exactly does ReSpeaker works with the Wio Link/Node/Core?\nThe introduction of the Wio family has truly brought what ReSpeaker can do to a higher level. \nTo user ReSpeaker with Wio, simply pair your ReSpeaker to your Wio product using our Web App, then you can have a voice interaction with any of your IoT devices that is built on Wio. Like voice control your Pet Feeder built with Wio to dispense treats, or ask your Wio based Smart Plant if she need some water. \nCheck out the following demoes to see the VOICE INTERACTION BETWEEN YOU AND...\nFor each ReSpeaker Core reward it also comes with a 8G Class 10 Micro SD Card. \n ReSpeaker Core Module\n- AI7688 Wi-Fi Module\nOperation system: GNU/Linux based OpenWrt\nWi-Fi Network: Support Legacy 802.11b/g and HT 802.11n modes  \nExpansion: Two expansion headers for I2C, GPIO and USB 2.0 host \nInterfaces: Built-in 3.5mm AUX port, Micro USB and SD card slot \n- ATMega32U4 Coprocessor  \nUSB CDC virtual serial port for linux console\n12 programmable RGB LED indicators  \n8 on board touch sensors\n- Codec WM8960\nDAC SNR 98dB (\u2018A\u2019 weighted), THD -84dB at 48kHz, 3.3V  \nADC SNR 94dB (\u2018A\u2019 weighted), THD -82dB at 48kHz, 3.3V  \nStereo Class D Speaker Driver with 87% efficiency (1W output)  \nOn-chip Headphone Driver  \n40mW output power into 16\u03a9 at 3.3V  \nTHD -75dB at 20mW, SNR 90dB with 16\u03a9 load  \nOn-chip PLL provides flexible clocking scheme  \nSample rates: 8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48 kHz\n- Power Supply: 5V DC  \n- Dimensions: 70mm diameter  \n- Weight: 17g\n\n\nMic Array\nXMOS microcontroller with 16 cores inside  \n7 high performance digital microphones\nSupports Far-field Voice Capture (up to 10m)\nSupports Beamforming, Acoustic Source Localization, Nosie Suppression, De-reverberation and Acoustic Echo Cancellation\n12 programmable RGB LED indicators  \nMicrophones: ST MP34DT01-M  \nSensitivity: -26 dBFS (Omnidirectional)  \nAcoustic overload point: 120 dBSPL  \nSNR: 61 dB  \nPower Supply: 5V DC from Micro USB or expansion header  \nDimensions: 70mm (Diameter)  \nWeight: 15.25g\nGrove Extension Board\nGrove Ports: 10\nDigital I/Os: 3\nAnalog I/Os: 4\nI2C Interface: 2\nUART: 1\nDimensions: 70mm (Diameter)\nWeight: 15.25g\nMeow King Drive Unit\nRated Power: 5W\nImpedance: 4\u03a9\nSNR: \u2265 75dBA\nSensitivity: 550 \u00b1 50mV\nDegree of Distortion: \u2264 0.5% \nFrequency Response: 85Hz - 20kHz\nPower Supply: 5V through USB or through 3.7V, 1500mAh battery\nSpeaker Diameter:  40mm\nSeeed has always been an open Source hardware innovation platform from the very beginning.

ZEEQ is not just another device or accessory, it is an active participant in your sleep. ZEEQ can play music to help you fall asleep, monitor and react to your snoring, analyze your sleep and intelligently wake you up. Unlike other sleep technology ZEEQ actually responds to the data it collects.\n    ZEEQ will help you fall asleep by allowing you to listen to music through the pillow and letting you choose music from your favorite sources. You can set a sleep timer in the app so the music will stop automatically - that way you can focus on sleep. We have even created some new relaxing tracks (some even using binaural beats) to help you fall asleep faster and achieve even more restful sleep.\nIf ZEEQ hears snoring, it will gently vibrate the pillow to encourage a new sleeping position. \nYour natural sleep movements are recorded and used to wake you up at the ideal moment in your sleep cycle, making groggy mornings a thing of the past. Most importantly, ZEEQ is the most comfortable pillow you will ever own. \n All the technology in the world will never be more important than softness, support, and premium materials, but luckily ZEEQ integrates technology and comfort seamlessly.\nMake sleep a priority no matter your lifestyle. ZEEQ integrates into your existing sleep habits and improves your sleep without you even being aware of it.  \n ZEEQ links to a smartphone app, so you can see your sleep data, including your Snore Score. If you want to take it a step farther, the app can help you track your diet, exercise and other habits to analyze how these factors effect your sleep, so you can make changes toward more restful slumber.\n                The ZEEQ Difference\nThe ZEEQ pillow will improve your sleep quality and quantity in multiple ways.\nIf you fall asleep better with music, REM-Fit Audio lets you stream music wirelessly, so you don\u2019t have to sleep with headphones in and you won\u2019t disturb your partner. You can even use one of the REM-Fit soundscapes if you prefer a more ambient experience.\nPLAY\n\nThe Snore Alarm uses a built in microphone with decibel sensitivity to hear snoring, and responds by gently vibrating the pillow to encourage the user to change positions without waking them up. \nPLAY\n\nAs soon as you go to bed, ZEEQ will start to monitor your sleep. It uses a 3-axis gyroscope to detect your motion throughout the night and provide data on the quality of your sleep.\nPLAY\n\nSmart Wake senses where you are in your sleep cycle based on these movements, and wakes you up at the ideal moment in a predetermined time range. It will use soft vibrations to wake you gently without affecting your partner. \nPLAY\n\nMost importantly, ZEEQ is the most comfortable pillow you will ever own. REM-Fit is an expert in pillows and bedding, and will never sacrifice comfort for technology. A cozy, supportive memory foam shell and soft, durable Tencell pillow case make this pillow a dream to lay your head on. \nPLAY\n\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nFall asleep effortlessly, sleep peacefully and wake up rejuvenated.\nAren\u2019t you ready to see how it feels to be rested and energized for the two thirds of your life that you spend awake?\n    The ZEEQ App\nZEEQ integrates with a smartphone app to deliver sleep and snore data. You can use as few or as many of ZEEQ\u2019s features as you want, and you can customize each one to your preference. \n\nWant to turn down the vibration strength of your pillow?\nWant to listen to Spotify as you fall asleep? \n\nAll this and more can be controlled from the ZEEQ app. \n See your 7 day trends on the app's dashboard. Find out how well you fared on sleep quality and snore score.\nZEEQ is an active participant in your sleep, and if you want to be an active participant too you can use the manual features provided in the app such as diet, caffeine and alcohol consumption, exercise tracking and more. \n As the app learns more about your habits, both while asleep and while awake, it can detect patterns and correlations and start to make suggestions on how to improve your sleep quality.\n  Bonus Rewards\nWhen you back either of our Bonus Pack reward levels, you will receive one or more REM-Fit Activity Trackers. The activity tracker is the perfect compliment to your ZEEQ pillow because it tracks your activity during the day while ZEEQ monitors your sleep, and they both use the same app for integrated information.\nFeatures:\n\u2022 Track your steps, distance and calories burned\n\u2022 ActivePoints - ActivePoints reward you for more than just your steps by analyzing the intensity and duration of your activity. The more active you are in a day, the more ActivePoints you can earn. \n\u2022 360 LifeScore - Strive for a great night of sleep and a day of activity. Your SleepPoints and ActivePoints contribute to an overall 360 LifeScore.\nSpecifications\n  Dimensions: 21\u201dx 27\u201d, the standard pillow size \nMaterials: Tencel pillowcase, memory foam outer shell, comfort filling \nBattery: 5000 mAh rechargeable, lasts approximately 1 week\nElectronics: 3-Axis gyroscope, vibration motors, individual decibel tuned microphone, 8 precision placed speakers\nReward Levels\n     Project Development \nAll the heavy lifting is done; we are already near completion on our design and engineering. We have several functional samples of the pillow. We already have manufacturers for all our components and have visited the factories in Shenzhen, Shanghai and India 8 separate times.\n  There are a few big steps left to take: tooling, international testing and manufacturing. Your support will help us produce our first order of ZEEQ!\nThe good news for supporters is that the wait for the finished product will be short - you will have ZEEQ under your head in less than 6 months!\nTimeline\n Get Your Project Funded Today!\nwww.funded.today/get-more-pledges \nAbout the Company \nPLAY\n\n\nREM-Fit is a team of dedicated individuals who believe in a restful night\u2019s sleep. \nBeing fitness enthusiasts, we know how important rest and recovery are to any training routine, which is why we developed the first Total Sleep Recovery product line to help you meet your fitness goals.\nLaunched in 2014, REM-Fit is an active lifestyle bedding brand that that helps you achieve a healthy and active lifestyle by getting the best sleep possible for maximum recovery and comfort. The REM-Fit product line consists of three product categories: The REST, the ENERGIZE and the MOTIVATE Collections.\nBy focusing on both activity and the sleep needed for recovery, REM-Fit Active is an exciting way for you, no matter what fitness level, to track your sleep and activity and contribute to living a healthy lifestyle.\nREM-Fit is a division of Protect-A-Bed, a company with over 35 years of experience in the sleep industry and more than 8000 stores across the country.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nPILLOW COMFORT:\nA pillow is a very personal item and people have different options on the ideal pillow. We have worked hard to make a pillow that will be very comfortable for all types of sleeping positions and firmness preferences.\n\nMAKING EVERYTHING WORK TOGETHER:\nThere are a lot of sensors and components inside of a very soft object. Not only must if feel great to sleep on, it has to work properly. The noise sensors must react properly; the vibration motors must be strong enough to be felt through the padding, but not overpowering. We had to write new algorithms and logic so that all of our various components worked in concert with each other easily and effectively. \n\nDECIBEL READING:\nHaving a microphone that can detect sound down to a specific decibel and then react properly is a key component. The microphone has to be cost effective, sensitive and accurate. This is not an easy feat!\n\nAPP LOGIC:\nWith all the information coming from the pillow, the app needs to not only read the raw data, but present it in a way that makes sense to the end user. Also, the app must be easy to use, which can be a challenge with all the features available to the user.\n\nMANUFACTURING:\nWe have already done all the heavy lifting: We have factories lined up, components sourced and functional prototypes created. However, we know that there can be unforeseen challenges between pre-production and production. It is not unheard of for a factory to change hands or a component to fail in production. We are an established company with experience and relationships, which should minimize any manufacturing issues we might face.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "ZEEQ Supporter", "descp": "We appreciate support at any pledge level.

Tell your friends too!!\nWi-Fi and Bluetooth are essential!\nThey are the most frequently used wireless technologies; we use them to access the internet, connect cordless keyboards and many more. However, Pi Zero and previous Raspberry Pi models do not have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth built-in.\nWhat is IoT HAT?\nIoT (Internet-of-Things)\nHAT (Hardware Attached on Top)\nIt is an add-on board that provides Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity for the Raspberry Pi.\nYou can use Wi-Fi and Bluetooth USB dongles, however .......\nIoT HAT is more affordable\nYou get both functions for the price of one dongle. And if you are using Pi Zero, you may also need to purchase:\nUSB OTG cable ($3-$5) - connect a normal USB device to the Pi Zero's micro USB port.\nUSB hub with power adapter ($15-$30) - if you need to connect more than one USB device, it is advisable to use a powered hub for your Wi-Fi and/or USB Bluetooth dongle(s). \nThe setup is more orderly\nBecause you do not need the USB OTG Cable and the USB Hub etc, the setup is faster and looks less cluttered.\nIf you are running an IoT project, you could also remove the keyboard and mouse.\nIoT HAT has the same wireless radio as the Pi 3\nWe are using the same BCM43438 chip that is on the Pi 3 (read here) which supports both Wi-Fi 802.11n (2.4GHz) + Bluetooth 4.1 (Dual Mode \u2013 Classic and Bluetooth Low Energy) running at the same time.\nThe wireless radio of IoT HAT is as good as that of the Pi 3 and all WiFi/Bluetooth software for Pi 3 are compatible.\nRead the full blog post\nYou can extend the RF range easily\nThe IoT HAT has an on-board antenna. However if you want to increase the RF range, you can simply attach a compatible antenna to the external antenna socket and flip a switch. No hacking or soldering is required.\nBoth Wi-Fi and Bluetooth operate on the same 2.4GHz frequency, they share the on-board antenna or an external antenna when running.\nPi Zero + IoT HAT is the best IoT combo\nNot only is the combination the cheapest of all the options, it has also has the lowest power consumption!\nOur partners\nYou can connect to your Pi over the Internet easily with Weaved's IoT Kit for the Raspberry Pi. We are working closely with their engineers to ensure our HAT supports all their services.\nOur friends at 8Bitdo have made a special edition of their popular ZERO GamePad for this campaign.\nThe recalbox allows you to replay a variety of video game consoles and platforms, in your living room, with ease! The recalboxOS is free and open source. \nLive demos\nRunning Wi-Fi sockets and controlling 8 BLE devices at the same time.\n- Pi Zero + IoT HAT running a Nodejs socket server with Sandeep Mistry\u2019s noble BLE library \n- BLE Nano running BLE Peripheral firmware developed on mbed platform\nMore details about this demo is available on the this post.\nPLAY\n\nRunning Raspbian desktop with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.\nPLAY\n\nMedia Center - Kodi on recalbox.\nPLAY\n\nBattle with your friends in your favorite retro games.\nPLAY\n\nTechnical details\nLayout\nDimensions\nIoT HAT is designed to fit perfectly on the Pi Zero, measuring 65 x 30 mm.\nAnd it is also compatible with all previous Pi models with the 40-pins connector including Pi 2, model A+ and B+.\nPinout\nAfter connecting the IoT HAT, there are 11 GPIO pins left for you to use.\nRewards\nWe offer the IoT HAT, the RedBear ZERO GamePad and the Antenna Kit (antenna with interface cable) as rewards.\nIoT HAT is shipped with a 2x20 female header soldered.\nYou can choose not to have the header soldered when you fill in the survey form and we will include the header in your shipment. You can mix these options if you order more than one HAT.\nIf you're interested in getting more of an item, or creating a combination not listed in the rewards section, simply add the extra corresponding costs to your total pledge amount:\nIoT HAT - add $9 each \nAntenna Kit - add $6 each\nRedBear ZERO GamePad - add $10 each\nShipping & delivery\nWe are keeping this very simple and affordable; we will ship any quantity, anywhere in the world for $5! That\u2019s right, any quantity!\nAfter the campaign has ended, we will send you a survey form to fill in the delivery, contact information, IoT HAT choice (with/without header) and extra item(s) you have pledged.

ThreadStax streamlines the daily process of folding, storing and selecting your outfits so you save time, maximize space and can focus on the important things in life.\nThreadStax is a closet organizing solution that folds and stacks shirts, jeans, pants, and other garments in a neat, impossible-to-disturb stacks. Utilizing the power of magnets, ThreadStax keeps your closet and drawers looking sharp and easy to navigate. Just enough magnetism to keep the stack in place, while allowing you to flip through and select your clothes with a gentle tug. Air vents allow clothes to breathe, and spacers not only provide support to the stack, but keep delicate items from being crushed underneath your other items.\nSlides\n At the heart of the system are slides that separate your clothes. They can be used to separate single items or entire outfits. Featuring magnets to keep everything in order when you\u2019re searching through your wardrobe.\nBrackets\n Brackets are easy to install and remove thanks to Command\u2122 strips. They adhere to any surface and remove without damage. Watch this 16 second video for a demo.\nThe Brackets come in two sizes, 4 and 6 inch (10cm and 15.25cm).

Whether it\u2019s rifling to find that one shirt or trying to pull something from the bottom of the shelf, it\u2019s inevitable. It made us ask:\n In a poll we took, over half the population has clean clothes cluttering their homes. 90% of which admitted feeling demotivated to fold their clothes at all because they never stay that way.

All of our backers will be given an account at RLFPS.com which gives you access to behind the scenes and voting rights in pre-production, and the opportunity to join the community in controlling the interactive live prologue to Level 3. Furthermore, rather than finding players on ChatRoulette, our 50 final players for Level 3 will be randomly selected from our backers! \nWe're crowdfunding here on Kickstarter, and on our own website to raise the funds to create Level 3.

Then it struck us - through crowdfunding we have found a way to keep it on YouTube, keep it free to watch AND allow people to play. So, starting with Level 3, it\u2019s no longer a prank on the internet, it\u2019s no longer random strangers on ChatRoulette - we are going to build a community.\nYour \u00a31 pledge won\u2019t just give you the chance to be chosen to play Level 3, it will also give you access to an account at RLFPS.com where you can become part of our creative community, with exclusive behind the scenes access, and voting rights on pre-production.\nYou\u2019ll get to collectively choose anything from character names, to costume designs, to setpieces - when our props team come up with designs for a new weapon, you will be able to vote on which design goes into production and gets built!\nYou all come together for a massive playable live stream of the prologue to Level 3 - this is where it gets really cool\u2026\nFrom Level 3 onwards we are doing away with the genre-hopping and creating a consistent universe - so you will follow the characters and the plot across multiple levels of the game. The story picks up right where we left off in Level 2 - with you and the other survivor piloting the escape pod.\nThe prologue for Level 3 will be broadcast live, and controlled by the voting of all of our backers simultaneously, just like \u2018Twitch does Pokemon\u2019 - except with the actors reacting live to the results of all of your choices. You\u2019re in charge of staying alive, and trying to find somewhere to land the escape pod - all of your decisions will have repercussions that will echo across Level 3 and way beyond.\nOnce the prologue is finished, it\u2019s time for us to start playing the full level - and instead of going to ChatRoulette this time, we\u2019ll be selecting 50 players, at random, from all of our backers. Each of the chosen players will play through the five chapters of Level 3 - as long as they make it through alive\u2026\nIf you aren\u2019t picked for the full game, you\u2019ll still be able to watch the events unfold.

If you are rooting for one of the players, or perhaps you even know one of them, gifting them a token when they need it most will give them a game specific boost and help them along.\nIf you choose to donate more than \u00a31, your name will be entered into the hat multiple times, increasing your chances of being chosen to play Level 3, but no matter what your donation amount you will have access to all of the exclusive online content.\nCan't use Kickstarter?

Here is what we can say\u2026.\nNo more genre-hopping from zombies to aliens and so on - we now have an opportunity to invite you into a vivid, consistent universe with characters and storylines that span multiple installments. We anticipate that the full game will take up to one hour to complete per player, broken up into shorter chapters, probably five 12 minute sections.\nNow that the end goal isn\u2019t a YouTube viral film, the gameplay can slow right down to give you a chance to really explore the world and your options. There will be a heavy focus on interacting directly with other characters and actors in the game, rather than just talking to the guy in the helmet. If you have a great idea for how to solve a problem, convince them to help you.\nBudget allowing, there will be much more interaction that just voice - there are so many new things being developed here, it will leave Levels 1 and 2 in the dust.\nThe team here are more fired up than they have been in years - and we are ready to deliver a rich, living world for you to explore and interact with. We have the best Artificial Intelligence in the industry - because it\u2019s not artificial - there are a dozen real people reacting to each of your decisions in as you make them.\nUltimately the world we can build for you in Level 3 is determined by the number of backers - but trust us when we say, there is a $10m version of Level 3 that would change the face of gaming. The sky really is the limit, and of course anything we don\u2019t get to do with Level 3 will be carried over to Level 4 and beyond.\nRealm is about breaking the rules, and combining cinematic production value with high-concepts on a low budget. It's the unforgettable ideas and stories that get us out of bed in the mornings, and the resourcefulness we have picked up over a decade of indie filmmaking that allows us to pull it all off.\n From the moment we came up with the concept for Level 1, it was clear that our friends at Red House Mysteries would be the perfect collaborators for the RLFPS concept.

The language of our eyes is one of the most powerful and effective tools of non-verbal communication.\nEye expressions are an efficient, natural and universal way to connect instantly with Ulo.\nExclusive discounts are only available for Kickstarter backers. \nA - 2 Round 1,22\u201c LCD screen (originally used for smartwatches)\nB - 1 Hidden surveillance camera (1080p HD / 30 fps) & Motion Sensor under the two-way mirror beak \nC - 1 Mono Microphone\nD - 1 Capacitive button\nE - 1 Neodymium magnet under the rotative base\nF - 4 Adhesive neodymium magnets (\u230020mm/\u23000.8in)\nG - 1 Wifi 802.11ac module\nH - 1 Orientation sensor\nI - 1 Li-Po rechargeable battery\nJ - 1 micro-USB to USB cable (65cm/25.6in)\nK - 1 Speaker\n Every Ulo will be upgraded with unlocked new features (no extra charges).\nPLAY\n\nUlo needs a working wifi network to be fully functional.\nUlo communicates through eye expressions. A webpage and mobile apps allows you to customize eyes color, shape and size to match your interior and your taste. No logos or icons are displayed on the screens, but you instantly know what Ulo has in mind. \nFor instance, when the battery is low (under 10%) Ulo is tired, \nUlo blinks when you take a snapshot, \nits eyes follow your movements and Ulo squints when someone is watching live video. \nRandom animations add that extra spark of life which makes Ulo unique.\nEye expressions are possible thanks to new round LCD screens originally manufactured for next-generation smartwatches.\nThis is an example of the default tap system. You can configure custom (and secret) sequences to trigger On/Off & Alert Mode functions.\nA double tap on Ulo forehead will activate the Alert Mode.\nOnce your smartphone leaves your wifi network, every movement will be recorded in an animated gif and sent via email.\nEye expressions are not displayed.\nWhen your smartphone (and thus yourself) reconnects to your wifi network, the alert mode is disengaged.\nIt is a very simple way to check what is going on in another room or when you\u2019re away. Ulo streams directly (video & audio) on a secure webpage or mobile apps. This feature is perfect to use Ulo as a baby cam.\nUlo captures snapshots on demand and sends it on a secure webpage, your dropbox account or directly on your email.\nInfrared night vision let Ulo see clearly in total darkness. \n Ulo can \"talk\" to you with customizable sounds.\nIn Alert Mode, Ulo can last one week on a full charge. In everyday use, with eye expressions, Ulo needs to be recharged every 2 days. Of course you can also leave Ulo plugged in all the time on a USB port.\nUlo can lay on a flat surface or be hanged on a wall. A set of discrete adhesive neodymium magnet allows you to stick Ulo on every surface effortlessly.\nUlo is now waterproof! \nThis means you can place Ulo outside, within a reasonable temperature range (-10\u00b0C/14\u00b0F to 50\u00b0C/122\u00b0F) \nUlo services are accessible on a webpage, so it is compatible with every device with an internet connection and a browser.\nDedicated mobile apps for iOS & Android:\nUlo is also compatible with IFTTT. It\u2019s the best way to extend its purpose.\nUlo functionalities can trigger or be triggered by other connected devices or internet services.\nFor example, here's my favorite recipes:\nBut other connected devices or internet services can trigger emotions in Ulo.\nFor example, weather can affect Ulo's mood:\nDifferent emotions will overlay Ulo's eye movements, here's the first list of animations available:\nHappy / Grumpy / Surprised / Upset / Agitated / Puzzled\nBlinks / Squint\nChange Eye color / Reflects / Size\nOther recipe ideas:\nIf there is a birthday on my calendar today, then Ulo is happy\nIf the pollen count rises above 6, then change Ulo eyes color to red\nIf you have an appointment, then Ulo is puzzled (You shouldn't be home)\n Ulo only stores a few minutes of video locally. Nothing is sent over a distant third party server.\nThink of Ulo as your own personal server, so there are no extra fees.\nThe owl only sends data to your secure devices when needed. Each device has its own password + a second step authentification.\nThe setup is easy, a QR code is generated when your device connects for the first time. You just have to show this code to Ulo.\nYou\u2019ll have to renew this operation every 6 months.\nA detailed user guide is included in the box and video tutorials will be available online.\nIn the future, Ulo internal software will evolve. \nI\u2019ll add more random animation to the default settings and new kind of styles will be available. \nExample: \nPixelArt\nHand drawn\nRealistic\n3D effects etc\u2026 \nDon\u2019t hesitate to share your feeling in the comment section, it will help me to pick up the most suggested.\n\nUlo by day\nChasing tail\nTired Ulo = battery under 10%\n If you are interested in distributing Ulo, please fill-out the form at the top of this page: \nhttp://vivien-muller.fr/ulo-infos \nI\u2019ll contact you as soon as the product is ready.\n                                                                                                                                            ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCreating a brand new product is a time consuming and very complex process. \n\nI estimate delivery to be late 2016.

Fortunately, we've have been working hard and have established relationships with manufacturing partners in the US that will help us bring Metawear to your doorstep.\n\nOf course, there are still risks associated with producing the Metawear board. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.\n\nThe other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the Metawear boards. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that MetaWear Coin arrives (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination.

Click here to visit our online store and buy merch after we ship our rewards to backers!\nOur Story\nThe Mk.II - a 12,000-pound, 15-foot-tall combat robot that needs upgrades for hand-to-hand combat.\nWe are MegaBots, Inc. We challenged Japan to a giant robot duel, and they accepted... but demanded that the fight include hand-to-hand combat. We say BRING IT ON. We've assembled an incredible team of patriots to help us upgrade the Mk.II into the robot America deserves in the world's first giant robot fight, but we need your support to help pay for those upgrades!\nThe upgraded Mk.II concept - the most American robot ever made.\nRight now, the existing Mk.II tops out at 2.5 mph and is built for long-range paintball combat. That means it has thin, destructible armor plates and a mesh canopy. The entire robot's built to be 'lightweight' (if you can call 12,000 pounds light), and hand-to-hand fighting is a whole new level of combat.\nIn order for the Mk.II to survive hand-to-hand combat, we need to\nAdd heavy duty armor plating\nAdd some serious firepower \nUpgrade our hydraulics to handle the heavier armor and firepower \nIncrease our top speed \nUpgrade our power unit to keep up with our new hydraulic system and speed \nThat basic upgrade will cost $500,000. In order to make sure we win the fight, we need to:\nTest a wide range of weapons and choose the best load-out\nKeep our balance during hand to hand combat and not fall over\nNot injure ourselves in the cockpit during combat\nFight with an incredibly sweet paint job. While not strictly required, this is a matter of national pride. \nAll told, a fully upgraded Mk.II will cost $1,500,000. \nTeam USA needs your help now, in order to win this fight. Pledge today to make sure your team takes home the trophy!\nRobot Upgrades\n$500,000: Melee Combat Capability, High Performance Track Base\nMeeting our $500,000 goal means that we get to seriously overhaul the Mk.II. We'll build the ridiculously cool weapon systems you see in our concept art, add the shock-mounted steel armor we need to survive multi-ton punches, beef up our hydraulic actuators to handle the additional weight of our armor and weapons, upgrade our power unit to provide 5x the horsepower to handle the additional power demands of our new hydraulic system, and then work with Howe & Howe Technologies to build a custom track base replacement that'll make us 5x faster than we are now - which will end up making us 2x faster than KURATAS!\n$750,000: Modular Melee & Ranged Weapon Options\nRaising $750,000 will allow us to design and build an array of melee and ranged weapon systems options to help us find the perfect load-out to beat KURATAS. This kind of fight has never happened in real life before - what works at this scale, and what doesn't? This level will help us answer that question. This assortment potentially includes, but isn't limited to, crushing and grasping claws, pile drivers, shields, pneumatically-driven fists, cannons of all shapes and sizes, and flamethrowers (just in case).\n$1,000,000: Dynamic Balancing Algorithm\nAt the end of the day, both the Mk.II and KURATAS are top-heavy. We can practice driving and punching carefully to make sure we don't fall, but right now both robots run the risk of tipping over if they punch or get punched too hard. Raising $1,000,000 will allow us to work with IHMC Robotics, the top-placed U.S. team in the DARPA Humanoid Robotics Challenge, to develop a custom high-end balance control system for the Mk.II so that we can stay upright no matter what happens. This system could EASILY make the difference between falling over after the first punch, and staying upright through the entire match.\n$1,250,000: Life Safety Systems\nRaising $1,250,000 will allow us to engage with NASA - the leaders in the field of keeping humans safe in extreme environments - to see how NASA life safety systems might be used in the cockpit of the Mk.II. We need make sure we can fight as aggressively as possible while also not blacking out from impacts. Safety 4th, folks.\n$1,500,000: Hollywood-Grade Paint Job\nRaising $1,500,000 will allow us to work with FonCo Creative Services to create a Hollywood-grade artistic look and feel to the robot's armor panels. This is America's first giant combat robot - it deserves to look like the million bucks it actually costs!\nWhat You Get  \n$5: Website Shout-out\nFirst and foremost, you get to tell all your friends that you did your patriotic duty to make sure that America snatches the title of World's Best Giant Robot Builders from the hands of the Japanese. How's that for a reward? For $5 we'll put your name on our website as an online memorial to your awesomeness.\n$10: Behind-the-Scenes Media Content and Sticker\n For $10, we'll set you up with a sweet MegaBots logo sticker to feed your vandalism habit, in addition to the shout-out. All backers contributing to this level or more will also get access to the behind the scenes build process via the documentary we're filming!\n$12/15: Pilot the Mk.II In Robocraft\nFor $12 and above, you'll get to own and pilot the Mk.II in Robocraft, a new free-to-play game by Freejam Games that allows you to build your own combat robots from scratch and take them out onto the field of battle! The $12 level is a digital-only level, and comes with your name on our website but doesn't come with a sticker. The $15 level comes with both the Mk.II in Robocraft and a sticker from the $10 level. Any levels above $12 automatically receive the Robocraft unlock code.\n$25: Most Patriotic Poster Ever Created\nThe Mk.II concept art poster\nFor $25 you'll also get a 18\" x 24\" concept art poster celebrating the creation of the most American robot ever made.\n$50: One MegaBots Shirt\nJoin Team USA and show off your home team pride with a crew shirt!\nOur Evolution of Man shirt\nOur SUPER AMERICAN shirt\nFor $50, you'll get to pick from one of three shirts - a crew shirt that shows off your home team pride, an Evolution of Man shirt that celebrates the escalation of combat over the millennia, or our SUPER AMERICAN shirt that confirms that yes, Kogoro Kurata, building something huge and sticking guns on it is, in fact, Super American.\nYou'll choose which shirt and what sizes you want after the campaign's over, in a survey we send to our backers.

The boxed kit will be a numbered collector's item, so get yours sooner rather than later!\n$250: Demo Day Experience\nCome see the robot and party with us!\nSwag is awesome - but seeing the robot in person is cooler. For $250, you can come to our demo day, see the robot show off its abilities in person, and throw down at a crazy San Francisco party with the founders of MegaBots.\n$750: VIP Demo Day\nYou, too, can hang out with the MegaBros 1-on-1!\n $750 gets you a VIP demo day experience where you ALSO get to sign the robot, take pictures of yourself inside it, and hang out with the robot and founders in a separate, exclusive event.\n$1000/$2,500/$5,000:  MegaBot Pilot/Weapons Testing\nSuit up and pilot the Mk.II!\nFinally, for the ultimate thrill seekers out there, you can suit up and pilot this beast of a robot. $1,000 gets you a ride in the robot as it drives through an obstacle course at top speed. If just riding in the robot isn't enough, $2,500 puts you in the gunner's seat on our shooting range - blow up mock-up KURATAS robots as we drive the robot through a combat simulation. And if that's not enough... $5,000 will put you in the gunner's seat in an exoskeleton that controls the arms and torso of the Mk.II. You get to use a car as a punching bag until the timer's up. On top of all of these experiences, you get the collector's edition swag and a VIP invitation to our demo day.\nYou must be 18 years of age or older by May of 2016 in order to suit up and pilot the robot, and rest assured that you'll have to sign a mile-long waiver that's full of 'YOU MIGHT DIE. NO, SERIOUSLY.'\n$10,000: Pit Crew Experience\nJoin the pit crew!\nLast, but certainly not least, up to 5 lucky people will get to join our pit crew for $10,000. Come along for the ride on the ultimate, once-in-a-lifetime, behind-the-scenes experience as we take this fight to Japan.\nAdvisers\nGrant Imahara, formerly of Mythbusters and Industrial Light & Magic, has joined forces with us to help us design our robot, bring the giant robot duel to the people, and help make giant robot combat a sport in any way he can!\nPeter Diamandis, founder of the X-Prize, is helping us figure out how we can push the state of the art in robotics by using our competition to drive innovation!\nTrey Roski and Greg Munson, founders of BattleBots, have joined up with us to help us figure out the best weapons and strategies for melee combat against KURATAS, and to help us figure out how we can turn this duel into a sport!\nSponsors\nAutodesk has sponsored us from the beginning, supported the creation of the Mk.II, and will be continuing to support us with design software and access to high-end manufacturing equipment throughout this challenge.

With your ideas, feedback, and our learnings, we made an improved coin cell version, which we are super excited to share with the community.\nUsing the user feedback from our first product, we've transformed and improved the original MetaWear platform in just about every way; the tiny form factor is now even smaller, power consumption has been reduced, and we've optimized it to run on a single coin cell battery that doesn't need to be replaced for months!\nSchedule Delivery\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've brought you MetaWear before and we will do it again. Our first campaign was not only successfully funded but it was delivered early!\n\nThere are always significant challenges in manufacturing and delivering any hardware product at scale. Fortunately, we've have been working hard and have established relationships with manufacturing partners in the US that will help us bring Metawear to your doorstep.\n\nOf course, there are still risks associated with producing the Metawear board. Unexpected changes in component lead times, availability, and cost are examples of factors outside our direct control that could affect our delivery timeline, but we are working hard to mitigate those risks and plan to be transparent throughout the delivery process.\n\nThe other risk with this and any other project that involves physical delivery comes with shipping. There are a number of unforeseen circumstances that can cause problems during the actual physical shipping of the Metawear boards. We plan to work with proven companies to help ensure that MetaWear Coin arrives (in perfect condition) at their delivery destination. Since unforeseen circumstances can sometimes impact the shipping world, we will also make sure to have methods/resources in place to overcome any difficulties.\n\nPlease note that the final look and features of the MetaWear Coin are subject to change based on your feedback and circumstances outside of our control such as component availability.\n\nAs always we expect our backers, supporters, and MetaWear users to comply with the proper regulations and laws.

Setting your Sensorwake is as easy as setting your espresso machine, and changing out the scents is even faster. All this is brought to you by Guillaume Rolland, an 18-year-old French entrepreneur with a vision of making everyone wake up happy!\nEven Google recognizes SensorWake\u2019s potential, awarding it as one of the top 15 inventions \u201cthat can change the world\u201d at the 2014 Google Science Fair.We believe that everyone should wake up happy, relaxed and peaceful, empowered for adventures to come. Happiness lies in the little things, like a great morning, a smell we like, a memory it recalls, a smile it evokes... Together let\u2019s make sure this happens every day!\nOur story began on an early morning over a year ago when 17-year-old Guillaume Rolland couldn\u2019t wake up once again. He hated his noisy alarm clock so much that he decided then and there that he should do something about it.\nOne year later, Guillaume stood in Mountain View where his garage-built prototype placed in the Top 15 \u201cinventions that can change the world\u201d at the 2014 Google Science Fair.\nSince then, Guillaume has assembled a great team of talented and passionate people to make that change a reality. Now 18, and still a part-time engineering student at UTC, Guillaume heads the team and works nightly to achieve his goal of revolutionizing our mornings.\n\"I thought that now, in the 21st century, everyone should have the right to wake up happy, relaxed and peaceful, ready for a great day. So I invented the SensorWake!\" says Guillaume.\nWith the team assembled and partners in place ready to handle the operations, a successful Kickstarter is all Guillaume needs to allow everyone to share the SensorWake experience.\nBorn and raised in France, we grew up with quality smells all around us. That is why we are now happy to work with Givaudan, the world leader in fragrances and flavors. In fact, we\u2019re the first startup they\u2019ve ever chosen to work with.\n\u201cWe are used to working with household brands. But SensorWake represents a great challenge for us. We\u2019ve never done scented capsules for an olfactory alarm clock before!\u201d explains Aur\u00e9lie from Givaudan. \u201cWe truly believe in Guillaume\u2019s product and team. It\u2019s going to change the way we wake up.\u201d\nBut because we know that everyone is unique, we wanted to make sure you have a wide range of scents you can choose from, even at this early stage. As our backers, you\u2019ll be able to choose one of the following two-capsules packs (or more, depending on your pledge). One capsule wakes you up 60 times.\nHere are the two-capsules packs available:\n[NEW] American breakfast: Bacon & Freshly Squeezed Orange Juice\nContinental breakfast: Espresso & Hot Croissant\nCandy Rush: Sweet peach & Strawberry candy \nEnjoy the break: Seaside (monoi, tiare flower) & Lush Jungle (cut grass, leaves)\nInvigorating Aromatherapy: Purifying Tea Tree & Harmonious Chocolate \nVitalization Aromatherapy: Stimulating Ginger & Invigorating Pepper Mint \nVIP lounge (for Kickstarter Backers only): Dollar & Ebony Luxury\nThe patented SensorWake technology releases a scent that\u2019s dosed just right, thanks to its innovative diffusion system. In fact, according to consumer tests we ran on over 100 people, SensorWake will wake you up in under 2 minutes, 99% of the time!\nAnd for the 1% with a stuffy nose, SensorWake includes an audio alarm that goes off after 3 minutes if you\u2019re not awake. That way, you\u2019re never late\u2026 well, at least not because of us!\nSensorWake might sound like a device, but we like to think it\u2019s more. It\u2019s about making your mornings peaceful and happy, and your days smoother and easier to conquer.\nIt took countless hours to bring SensorWake to where it is now, from an original idea to an award-winning product with partnerships around the globe. But we\u2019ve still got a little ways to go. Landing SensorWake on your nightstand will take manufacturing and distribution startup costs, capital for our initial inventory, and additional quality assurance to make sure we\u2019re sending you the best product possible.\nWant to be part of our community? Check out the Backer rewards we developed to make sure you get a fantastic SensorWake experience for your contributions:\nIf you choose to back us, take a look at the table above to see what rewards you can get. You will be invited to choose your packs at the end of the Kickstarter campaign.\nAfter the launch, you\u2019ll be able to order refills and new capsules on our online store for an estimated $9 each. We\u2019re also doing our best to bring capsules to your favorite local store, so you won\u2019t have to wait for the mailman if you run out.\nTo make your life easier, we plan on setting up our website so you can register to get your favorite sent automatically delivered to your home once every two months. For the nappers out there, you\u2019ll be able to adjust this timing if you use capsules more often.\nYes! Easier to use than your coffee maker, setting up your SensorWake takes just three quick steps:\nAfter setting up the wake up time, insert the scent of your choice.\n Scent diffusion begins at the scheduled time.\nYou will be gently woken up within 2 minutes.\nScent refills are perfectly healthy: they are solvent-free, compliant with IFRA (International Fragrance Association, no allergen), REACH (European Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals Regulation, no chemical risks) and CARB standards (California Air Resource Board, healthy air quality).\nAt SensorWake we wanted to make a great device, not only for you, but also for our planet. That\u2019s why we designed it to be durable with high-quality materials to keep them out of landfills. Capsules are also 100% recyclable and free of any VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds).\nFinally, SensorWake fragrances leave no residue whatsoever on surfaces, clothes, or anything else in your room.\nOur team is a mix of youth, creativity, and excellence in engineering. We have experts in several fields, including engineering, marketing and design, and work closely with experts in olfaction and manufacturing, all ready to deliver the best product we can in a reasonable amount of time.\nWe are very proud that our invention has already received awards from prestigious institutions, which inspire us each day to go further.\nWe have tested and built SensorWake so that it\u2019s efficient, safe, and easy to use.

Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input.\nWhat Objects Does it Work With?\nMost materials that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work. Here are some materials people have used in our workshops: Leaves, aluminum foil, cars, running garden hose, silverware, milk, wet things, alive things, metallic things, graphite, play dough, kitchen sinks, etc. If something won't work, you can make it work for example by applying copper tape or getting them wet.\nFruits, Snacks, Humans, Animals, Cars, Swimming Pools, Coins, and Your Grandma, and Thousands More\nWhat Apps/Webpages Does it Work With?\nIt literally works with any app and any webpage that use a mouse or a keyboard press, which is almost every app or webpage a laptop can run. it just presses keyboard buttons and clicks the mouse. You might try a one button game website, or a music website such as TouchPianist. Use Photobooth or an online webcam program to trigger selfies, and use Powerpoint to advance slides. Launch Skype or FaceTime and hover the mouse arrow over the \"call\" button. Cue up a video on YouTube and trigger it to play with the spacebar or the mouse click. Or use one of the many custom Apps that we have created for you. There are countless possibilities.\nWho is Makey Makey GO For?\nArtists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers, Special Needs Children, Tinkerers, Creators, Dreamers\u2026 Really it is for everyone.\nAge 6 to 101, Kids and Teens Love Makey Makey, but so do Hobbyists and Experts\nWhile Makey Makey GO is playful and easy to use, it packs a lot of power and has a sleek technical design that geeks love.\nRequirements?\nMakey Makey GO works with any laptop or computer with a USB port and a recent operating system. How recent? We have tried it with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7 & 8, and Mac OSX. It also works with some tablets and mobile devices.\nMakey Makey GO Plugged into a MacBook Pro. By hooking up the traditional pinball machine button to the Makey Makey GO you can play two pinball games at once.\nMakey Makey GO plugged into a Windows Surface tablet running Windows 8. The score counts how long the person has stayed on the slackline.\nMakey Makey GO plugged into a Samsung Galaxy running Android using a USB adapter. Cardboard SmartSword is made with a Smartphone, some aluminum foil, and Makey Makey GO. When the sword touches your \"enemy\" you get a point.\nReward Details\nMain Reward: Makey Makey GO Kit\n1 Makey Makey GO - Plug and Play, no assembly, no setup. \n1 beautiful Red Alligator Clip\n1 key ring\nSome stickers\nPrinted instructions with quickstart guide\nOnline apps and documentation\nBonus Rewards\nCollector's Tin - A medium sized red storage tin with Makey Makey designs and logos ($5 value)\nExpansion Pack - Spool of copper tape, extra long alligator clip, long extension wire ($10 value)\nT-Shirt - A High Quality American Apparel Makey Makey T-Shirt ($15 value)\nMakey Makey Classic - The original Makey Makey that started it all ($50 value)\nWhy Did You Create Makey Makey GO?\nWe believe that everyone is creative, inventive, and imaginative. We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits.\nWe redesigned Makey Makey Classic to focus it down to its absolute bare essentials: a single capacitive sensor input with a single alligator clip that can pretend to be any key or a mouse click. Then we gave it a magnet, a keyring, and shrunk it down so small that it fits anywhere. The result is something that can always GO with you and that is unbelievably simple to use. It's the size of a USB thumb drive and just as easy to plug and play. \nWe designed Makey Makey GO to feel more like a kitchen gadget or a multi-tool and less like a traditional circuit.\nMakey Makey GO stuck to a fridge door magnetically is just one example of how Makey Makey GO is always within grasp.\nMakey Makey Classic \nIn 2012 we created, Kickstarted and delivered (early) the original Makey Makey, and it was named Best of Kickstarter. It has now gone into the hands of 200,000 inventors and delighted millions of others.\nMakey Makey Awards and Press\nThe Makey Makey Classic was named one of Consumer Reports\u2019 \u201cBest Tech Toys of 2014\u201d and one of Popular Science's \u201cBest of Toy Fair (2014).\u201d In addition, Makey Makey Classic was recently inducted into the Museum of Modern Art\u2019s (MoMA) permanent collection.\nTED Talk on Makey Makey \n\"I used to want to design a utopic society, or a perfect world or something like that. But as I'm getting older I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can't be designed by one person or even by a million experts. It's really going to be 7 billion pairs of hands, each following their own passions, and each kind of like a mosaic, coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens. And that's a world I really want to live in.\"\nWho are we?\nTodd Eddie, Jay Silver, David ten Have, and Rachel Silver.\nJay Silver leads JoyLabz and recently came out of MIT Media Lab and Intel. Dave ten Have, COO, co-founded the first cloud 3D printing company, Ponoko, and is an awesome Hacker. Todd Eddie, our VP, is a climber, and he's a Georgia Tech electrical engineer. Rachel Silver, our Logistics Goddess, studied visual arts at Sarah Lawrence and Reed College and is a gardening guru. Liam Nilsen, who is a lifelong unschooler, joined most recently to handle social media \u2014 he also runs the Endor project. \nWe all collaborated from across the globe to bring Makey Makey GO into existence. As Dave said the day before launching the Kickstarter, \"I think I just realized that I am living in the future. I live in New Zealand, but here I am in Cocoa Beach riding an electric bamboo/carbon-fiber bike, made by a friend out of local bamboo and left over carbon fiber, to UPS to overnight prototypes of an invention kit the size of my thumb that didn't even exist until 2 weeks ago to people all over the world. I am my childhood self's superhero.\"\nSo many people contributed to Makey Makey GO that they can't all be listed here. Please see the about page for credits. Eric Rosenbaum co-invented Makey Makey Classic with Jay. Makey Makey would not be possible without the input of literally thousands of people.

However, the reality is that we are more dependent on audio jacks for our computers, phones and tablets than ever before.  We use this technology everywhere we go, and the unfortunate fact is that the audio jack has not stayed up-to-date to the demands placed on it today.\nThis dilemma is the \"spark\" that got it all started as we (Jon and Jeff) sat down over a cup of coffee...\n... dreaming of what the world might look like with an improved audio connection solution. That is where our passion started and it has only grown as we get closer to making our dream a reality.\nOur hope is that in some small way, you will be excited about this Kickstarter campaign, and you will believe in this vision and decide to join the MAGZET revolution. And if you do decide to join us, you will be the proud owner of a MAGZET before it land in stores! This is especially important for our backers in countries outside of the United States that may not always have immediate access to the new technologies \u2013 with your backing you will get the MAGZET at the same time as everyone else.\nReported by:\n                              Our Solution\nYes! MAGZET will bring innovation to the audio connection with the power of magnetic technology\u2026\nThe MAGZET Magnetic Technology in the Middle\nThink about it, if we add magnetic technology in the middle (and we did with the MAGZET!), we can keep all the accessories and devices and that we already invested in and make them...\nMAGkap and MAGjack\n\"Snap\" connect enabled \u2013 The magnet technology conveniently pulls them together in a \u201csnap\u201d and auto-aligns even in dark environments without specific visual focus.\nMore reliable \u2013 Once the MAGkap (the side you plug into the audio cable) and MAGjack (the side you plug into the device) is installed, the device\u2019s jack and your audio cable are protected from wear-out.\nSafer \u2013 The magnetic technology breakaway feature protects your ears, headphones, accessories, or even worse, your device from being catapulted into hard surfaces with very expensive and inconvenient consequences.\nWhat's so wrong with the traditional audio jack?\nWe have all experienced the flaws of the audio jack as we know it today...\nInconvenient - We have to \u201cvisually\u201d focus and locate a small hole to slide things together, which is difficult to do while driving or in certain situations such as in a dark room, or while device is in a handbag or backpack.\nFragile - The audio plug has been known to breakoff in a device\u2019s jack and/or the device\u2019s audio jack or cable as been known to wear-out and stop working.\nCostly/Painful - Pull on the audio or headset cable from a bad angle and devices have been known to be catapulted into hard surfaces with very expensive and painful consequences to your devices, and your ears, head, or other body parts.\nOpen Jack - With the audio jack remaining open when headphones are not in use, dirt, debris, and moisture can work its way into the jack, impacting performance.\nWhere can I use it?\nConnecting to all your audio devices and accessories becomes simple and smooth. You can use your MAGZET with your phone, computer, tablet, headphones, stereo systems, even your car auxiliary input... pretty much any place you want an easier and safer way to connect your audio. You will want to have several, for maximum audio device and accessory versatility.\nWill all my current audio features still work? What about sound quality?\nYes! We took the design time and have run tests to make sure the MAGZET functions correctly with all your favorite devices, including Apple and Android-based models. You will still be able to answer calls, use the mic, adjust volume and skip tracks via the cable inline controls when using the MAGZET. The audio quality is preserved as we use the highest quality materials and manufacturing processes that one would expect from a high-end audio accessory.  Whether you\u2019re using your favorite phone, tablet, headphones, or computer, we have made sure that your device\u2019s functionality, audio quality, and features will continue to work just as you have always experienced with your wired solution.\nWhat about Bluetooth headsets?  Aren't they the future?\nThe apparent freedom of going wireless with Bluetooth seems like a nice option. However, it can be incredibly cumbersome to have to work through the pairing process and have a whole additional device that requires battery monitoring and charging. The MAGZET does not have these limitations, and it also works with devices that do not have Bluetooth functionality \u2013 all you need is that internationally ubiquitous audio jack that has been around for decades, well before Bluetooth was invented. If you need a wireless based solution there is certainly a place for Bluetooth, but it is not at some disadvantages and shortcomings compared to the wired audio quality and \"it just works\" convenience of the MAGZET.\nCan I really leave my MAGjack in all the time?\nYes, we wanted you to leave your MAGjack in so we invented a means to accomplish this! Normally when one plugs a connector into a phone audio jack, the phone (rightly so) thinks something is plugged in and would normally re-route the audio to headset functionality. Our technology counters the normal behavior and ensures that the MAGjack alone is not detected and the phone only detects the MAGjack when the MAGkap is connected.\nCan I really trust that you can build this thing?\nThis is certainly a fair question! The good news is that Jon is an award-winning technology innovator who has commercialized dozens of products with a deployment of over 5 million devices worldwide. Additionally, Jon has built-up a network of relationships over years of domestic and Far East business dealings and travels that will be leveraged on this project. \n\nAll this to say, you can be assured that the MAGZET will be built to a world-class quality level and that we have the experience, tenacity, and relationships to deliver what we promise.\nHOW YOUR BACKING DOLLARS WILL BE USED...\nThere are several tasks yet to be completed.  Please watch the following video to see how your backing dollars will make them possible.\nPLAY\n\nSo, that\u2019s where we stand. We have a fairly user-friendly prototype (as featured in the video). However, our design still needs to be miniaturized (made smaller), custom tooled, and ramped up in manufacturing.\nTHAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN!!!\nThese last steps are expensive, and we are asking YOU to please help us take MAGZET across the finish line. And in so doing... joining the MAGZET revolution of changing how the world plugs audio things together!\nHow do I back this campaign?\nBacking MAGZET on Kickstarter is simple and secure - and open to everyone around the world.\nLog into your Kickstarter account, or create a new account. \nClick the green \u201cBack This Project\u201d button at the top of this page. \nEnter your pledge amount and select one of the reward levels.

We have a long-term perspective, and the environment will remain a part of our decision-making paradigm.\n*** PLEASE KEEP SCROLLING FOR A DEEPER DIVE INTO DESIGN/RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ***\nDesigned with a \"Simplicity\" Focus\nIf there is one word that sums up the MAGZET \u2013 it would be simplicity. On the outside, the Series1 looks clean and simple, and the user experience is just as easy... just \"snap\" the MAGkap and MAGjack together, and you are off and running \u2013 i.e. it just works!  However, the most simplistic of user experiences is realized by a level of \"sophistication under the covers,\" which we will continue to dive into with the next section.\n\"Simplicity\" the Ultimate Sophistication\nResearch and Development\nAs in any entrepreneurial invention, the idea is the easy part; the hard part is the actual realization of that idea into a tangible solution that people would really find valuable and be willing to purchase.\nSo, we got to work over a year ago, pulling off many late nights. We researched by tearing into numerous devices, including Apple and Android based models.  We analyzed various magnetic strengths and tested early prototype concepts, improving each design iteration, with a plugfest with real people and devices.\nHere is just a small snapshot of the work we have completed from a Research and Development perspective, to give you a taste of what we have been up to.\nThe MAGkap and MAGjack\nBoth the MAGkap and MAGjack are designed for easy use and consist of quality components to make sure you experience the high fidelity sounds you expect from a great audio accessory.  \n\"We designed to the standards of a product we would be thrilled to use in our own daily lives.\"  \nThe design gives you a 360 degree solid connection, while still having the added benefit of magnetic breakaway protection.  The graphic below cycles through several of the MAGkap and MAGjack design iterations we explored through the design process.\nEngineering and Testing\nWhen we said we literally tore into jacks we were serious!  The graphics below shows 10 very popular devices\u2019 audio jacks from several vendors that we analyzed by cross-sectional cutout (by hand filing!) to determine their inner workings.\nThe analysis was key in determining a (patent pending) means to overcome the challenge that when one plugs a connector into a phone audio jack, the phone (rightly so) thinks something is plugged in and would normally re-route the audio to headset functionality, even if the MAGkap was not installed.\n\"We want you to leave your MAGjack in and needed to invent a means to achieve that - which we did!\"\nMagnetic Strength\nAs one would expect, a product based on magnetic technology required considerable magnetic analysis and design effort. We needed to determine the optimal magnetic strength for both holding under normal use and for the magnetic breakaway protection features.  \n\"It took us months to zero into the optimal magnetic strength after testing dozens of magnetic materials and shapes.\"  \nThe fun video below illustrates the magnetic holding force on the prototype concept shown above.\nPLAY\n\nNote: The video\u2019s audio track is that of our co-founder (Jeff) showing off his mad electric guitar skills!\nLatest Prototype\nThe latest prototype is shown in the graphic below. It has yet to be miniaturized (made smaller) and does not display the final color scheme. The prototype was rapid-prototyped through the use of 3D metal printing and CNC machining processes and was hand assembled.\nOUR STORY\nAfter spending the last 15 years working in the IT Industry, I (Jeff) left my job looking to do something different. One day, I was sitting in a local coffee shop and ran into a friend of mine named Jon Hallsten. Jon was closing one chapter of his career and was considering starting a new innovative product design company. We started talking about coming up with a gadget idea that we could take to market and had mass market appeal.\nThat's how the concept of the MAGZET product got started. Being a guitar player for the last 40 years, I mentioned that it seems crazy that we still plug things in and out to connect to devices, i.e. guitar amps, headphones, etc. Jon agreed, and that\u2019s what got us working on the product!\nSpecial Thanks to: Raymond Bugelski, Steve Chiles, Rodney Ross, John Buchanan, Paul Evans, Adam Rissmiller, Matt Orley, Shane Sevo, Scott Foster, Bob Martinez, Jay Yoo, Jon Fawcett, Kyle Crocker, Ken Burns, Vince Fisher and Zach Beaver for their expertise in support of this project.  All the talented people at Orca for all their hard work and design assistance.  All the trailblazing entrepreneurs on Kickstarter, whose campaigns we watched and learned from.  And most importantly, we are so grateful to our beautiful wives, Denise Hallsten and Lisa Russell, for putting up with our long nights and for their support of our dream.  We are humbled that you believe in our mission and are confident that together we can make MAGZET a reality and ultimately change how the world plugs audio things together!  Again, thanks to all of you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur biggest technical challenge to overcome was the fact that when one plugs a connector into a phone's audio jack, the phone thinks something is plugged in and re-routes the audio to headset functionality. The good news is that we invented (patent pending) a solution to fix that problem when just the MAGjack is installed and the Series1 does not have this shortcoming.\n\nTechnical Risk\n\nHowever, our technical challenges are far from over. We all know the benefits of miniaturization. This will be especially important in a MAGjack design that is intended to be left in a device. We want to shrink the MAGZET so that it protrudes less, and has room for the magnet (with enough strength), the landing pad, and the inter-connect contact points required. Definitely a design trade off!\n\nAnother significant challenge we have is that the nature of our design requires numerous, very intricate sub-pieces, which are hard to manufacture and require expensive tooling. We must not only shrink the design, but reduce its complexity and ensure that it can be reliably manufactured over volume! That is not easy...\n\nIn light of the challenges above, our timeline could be affected if we cannot solve them in a timely manner. Should we miss our technical deadlines, we\u2019ll let you know why (per Backer Promise #2) and make it right as quickly as possible.\n\nForecasting Risk\n\nOnce we get a flavor for the popularity of our campaign, we will do our best to forecast demand and create a solid production plan timeline. We've learned a lot from our years of bringing products to market, but sometimes, despite our best intentions, forecasts don\u2019t always hit the mark. Should we miss our projections, we\u2019ll let you know why (per Backer Promise #2) and take corrective action immediately.\n\nSupply Chain Risk\n\nWe\u2019ve built a network of manufacturing relationships with very capable teams over the years of building products. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we\u2019ll be sure to keep you informed (per Backer Promise #2) and work to quickly solve the problem.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nWhile every attempt was made in this campaign to use final design intent representations, we realize that during the miniaturization and build out process the MAGZET may have to be slightly altered in appearance and/or performance. We reserve the ability in good faith to make these changes if needed.\n\n*** Bottom Line *** \n\nWe know what it will take to bring the MAGZET to market, just as we have with numerous other products (actually over 5 million shipped devices worldwide) through the course of our careers. We have the experience, tenacity, and relationships to deliver what we promise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "MAGZET - Jon Hallsten & Jeff Russell\nFirst created \u00b7 19 backed\nHi All, We are Jeff Russell and Jon Hallsten and we live in the Akron, Ohio area.

This case turns your smartphone into a Polaroid-style camera that prints photos. Bonus: Those photos turn into augmented reality videos when viewed on the phone's screen\u201d \nTechCrunch: \u201cThis is genius! It\u2019s a Snapchat that you can hand off to someone and so much more.\u201d \nSlash Gear: \u201cPrynt Case: Using their app, one can see those printed pictures come alive, giving it the Harry Potter universe's living portrait feel.\u201d \nEngadget: \u201cSo what is the Prynt Case? Only the greatest thing to happen to mobile photography since Instagram\u201d \n             Ever wanted to share a photo with a friend and not have to put it on the internet? Now you can, with Prynt: the first ever instant camera case for smartphones. Just plug in your iPhone or Android device, snap a photo or choose one from your favorite social network, and print it out in thirty seconds!\nPrynt is portable, lightweight and fun! Snap and print photos anywhere, anytime. \nIt's ideal for when you're out with your friends, sightseeing, or capturing a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Gifts and cards become more special when you include an instant photo. Take it with you on the go and never miss the chance to shoot and share some everyday magic.\nWe also designed Prynt to be modular so it can fit different types of phones. The part of the case that contains the dock can be easily changed based on the phone model. That means if you upgrade or change phones, you don't need a whole new Prynt Case, just order a new dock adapter from us and keep printing.\nLastly, we worked hard to design a beautiful object you'll love to carry. We think our black, white, pink and blue models are gorgeous and the matching (animal-friendly) leather grips are quite chic.\nPlus, you'll never have to deal with ink or cartridges because we use a special paper with the ink embedded inside. Just load the paper and print away!\nThe case holds 10 sheets of paper, and refills will be available through our app. We'll include one pack of photos (10 sheets) with each Prynt Case reward on Kickstarter. Want more paper? For every $25 you add to your pledge, we'll send you 50 extra sheets.\nEach print-out is more than a photo \u2014 it's a video! While you're posing for a photo, our app records a short video and stores it in the cloud. When you hold your phone over the printed image, our app will automatically scan and recognize it, showing your movie on screen in augmented reality. \nYou can see the videos in your friends' photos, too! Print and pass your photos around for a creative new way to tell your story. It's like a secret message in every photo \u2014 embed any kind of surprise you can think of!\nThe Prynt app is under development and will be released this summer. Our goal is to carry the beauty and simplicity of the case onto the screen of your smartphone for a seamless experience.\nIn addition to taking a picture, you can select one from your camera roll, Facebook or Instagram. You'll also be able to enhance your photos with frames, filters and personalizations in the app.\nTo embed a video in a print, use the app to record your movie, then select the frame you want to print:\nOrder more paper through the app too, and we'll send it right to you! The app can monitor your paper usage and let you know when it's a good time to reorder so you'll never run out! Plus, your shipping and billing info will be stored so reorders are a breeze.\nWant to see Prynt in 3D? Press play:\nWe were inspired by classic instant cameras and wanted to recreate the magical experience of sharing physical photos with our loved ones. We were also convinced we could enhance this experience by incorporating our smartphones, which are always with us and help us stay connected.\nPLAY\n\nAfter developing the alpha prototype, we were the first French startup selected for Haxlr8r, a hardware accelerator program based in Shenzhen, China. We came away from the experience even more dedicated to our original vision of a modern instant camera that would be both portable and beautiful.\nThen Prynt was asked to exhibit at the 2015 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Over four days, we took hundreds of selfies, met lots of great people, and were even named by CNN as one of the four best products of CES! \nIt seemed like the perfect time to come to Kickstarter to get the support needed to finally put Prynt in your pocket! We're so grateful for all your enthusiasm and would love for you to help us make Prynt a reality. \n  And a big thank you to M&C SAATCHI Little Stories for helping us throughout the process of our Kickstarter campaign and also to our amazing video team,Vincent Vermandel and Little Big Man Production!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are really excited about launching the first ever instant camera case for smartphones.

It's a new type of gaming experience that combines the tangible and social pleasure of a board game with the interactive and adaptable mechanics of a video game. The game is for 2 to 4 players and features a Large, two part, high quality board that represents the minutely detailed world of Yo-Ho. At the same time, a free downloadable app turns your smartphone into a ship. Simply place your phone on the board and set sail for adventure!\nBecome the most famous pirate of Yo-Ho, a parallel world teeming with intelligent animals, lost islands and wild magic! The call to adventure echoes throughout this land, and although life on the high seas is a dangerous game, for those that truly embrace the pirate spirit the promise of glory is worth any risk. Will you sink...or will you sail?\nClassic: It\u2019s a free-for-all! Be the first player to reach a certain number of Swag points (aka victory points).\nCampaign:  Take part in the first chapter of the World of Yo-Ho saga : War of the Orchids. Each session is tied into a plot that will immerse you in the Yo-Ho universe.\nSingle Phone/Tablet: If you don't have enough devices for all the players, you can also play World of Yo-Ho with only one device, or even a tablet. In this case, cardboard tokens that represent ships and captains are included in the box version. The device is not on the map but is passed from player to player, and each player is responsible for updating his ship's position when he moves.\nCruise: This single player mode allows you to sail the seas of Yo-Ho, learning all about this magical world. It is also a quick way to understand how the devices move around the board.\nPorts are temporary hideouts where you can resupply, regroup and prepare your strategy. Being in a port allows you to:\nBuy weapons and items for use in combat\nPurchase upgrades for your captain and your ship\nAccept a large variety of missions\nRepair your ship\nCheck on how well the other players are doing and if someone is close to victory!\nBehold a selection of some of the fine weaponry you'll be able to unleash upon your ennemies! Are you more of a broadsides or cutlass kind of corsair?\nThat scallywag swagger may impress the girls back home but you're going to need a lot more flair then that if you want to make it to the top. Luckily these upgrade items will help get your captain and his ship looking suitibly fine!\nWord gets around fast in the World of Yo-Ho, especially if parrots are involved. When you depart from a port, it's not hard for other captains to find out what you did there. So if you don\u2019t want your opponents to know what items you bought or what missions you chose that could interfere with theirs, you\u2019d better lighten your Clams chest and leave the port incognito.  \nThere are many different kinds of missions, ranging from simple cargo transportation to searching for sunken treasure in monster infested seas.\nCompleting missions will not only make you rich but also bring you closer to victory. But beware, if you do not respect your contract, you could find yourself with a bounty on your head, something other players won't hesitate to cash in on!\nMissions are randomly generated for every game and evolve depending on each player's actions.\nAnother way to earn Swag points is to fight your opponents, whether you have a reason to or not!\nYou can attack a player if your devices are on adjacent tiles. Touch the attack button on his phone and the swashbuckling can begin!\nWhen combat begins, both players take their phones and secretly program their actions (with items bought whilst at port).\nThe amount of items you can play depends on the flag that you run up the mast. If either of the participants is flying a white flag then your options are limited. If both ships are flying the Jolly Roger however, you're in for one hell of a fight!\nOnce this is done, players put their phone back on the map, and everyone can witness the results as they are animated on screen!\nIn addition to earning Swag points, the winner can pillage items from his opponent. Talk about rubbing salt in the wound!\nWhile sailing the seas of Yo-Ho, weather conditions can change or a monster may rise from the depths. You could find an old wreck filled with sunken treasure or simply a message in a bottle bobbing along the waves\u2026 \n Smartphone technology allows us to bring the World of Yo-Ho to life. This world remembers, it be good deeds or foul play. Missions and Events are not chosen randomly, criteria such as your position on the board, where others are, whether you are ahead in the game or falling behind, whether you play aggressively or passively, all this information is used to make sure every player has his or her fair share of the adventure! The mission system is procedural, and will generate written descriptions based in the game's setting. By changing variables ( destination, time required, objectives, \u2026 ), every mission will be a new and original challenge. \nThere's is no freeloading either! Some missions will be rarer and have more interesting rewards than others, but no matter the mission, rewards will be proportional to the effort required to complete them : a mission sending you to the other corner of the board will be much more rewarding than one sending you two tiles away from where you are. Think you can earn some quick clams easily without being noticed ? Well, rumours spread fast in the World of Yo-Ho, and unless you bribe your way out of the harbour, other players might learn of your plans, race you for the reward, or even earn some clams by preventing you from doing so ! And don\u2019t think you can go back on a deal either! Some would be all too hasty to call on other players to exact some just vengeance for them!\nMany monsters live in the waters of Yo-ho. Some lairs even span across multiple zones, and they will be more then happy to pop up and disrupt your game should you cross their territory. Some will require a collaborative effort, and multiple rounds of combat to defeat. You can choose to ignore them (not always easy when I giant see serpent is bearing down on you), but every hit will be rewarded with well-earned swag points and recorded by the game, provided you don\u2019t ridicule yourself of course! However, only the player that deals the final blow will get to plunder the beast's horde, so some strategy may be required. A slain monster will of course stay dead until the end of the game. \n This memory can span further than just one game too. In campaign mode, each chapter (game) has multiple endings depending on the choices made by you and your fellow players. As you play through each chapter, your story will continue to grow and evolve, always based on the consequences of your actions! Perhaps an ally you made in a previous game gives you the option to sack a port, removing it from future games. However, another ally that has been with you since you first set sail may disagree with your actions and withdraw their support. This is just one example of how this dynamic world can adapt. You are the hero, it's your story to create! Here's a video to show just how vibrant we have made this world, you'll soon understand how the use of devices can bring so much more life to your tabletop games!\nWhether they rose to power through cunning, strength of arms or just blind luck, the life of a pirate is not known to cultivate the most balanced of individuals! But a few faults here and there isn't that big a deal, after all, nobody's perfect right?\nSome would call nailing a man o' war to the back of a giant swordfish madness. In the world of Yo-Ho it's pretty much par for the course. These giants of the sea have linked their fates to that of their chosen captain, for better or for worse!\nSmartphones are now an everyday object, so why not use them whilst playing a boardgame? Having small but powerful computers on a board can add a lot to your gaming experience. \nWe designed World of Yo-Ho based on the following principles: \nThese devices can calculate where they are on the board and communicate with one another.\nHaving a digital screen on top of the map allows you to bring it to life with animations and sound effects.\nSetting up your game is fast and easy. A few clicks and you're ready to go.\nYour phone can tell if it is being held up and display different information or let you input secret orders.\nYou can pause and resume your game anytime thanks to the game's autosave feature.\nJust like in a board game, random events can occur, however, thanks to the digital element, the game evolves and reacts according to the players actions.\nWorld of Yo-Ho Rules PDF (work in progress)\nMoving the phone on the board\nSo, how do the phones know where they are on the board ?\nThe board is composed of tiles, 6x10 exactly. The game first tells you where to put your phone, and then you can move it from tile to tile. It analyzes in which direction you moved it and understands where it currently is.\nAdding life to a static board\nThe screen displays a representation of the board underneath it and adds several elements as well. Your boat bobs along in the sea, waves are generated by the wind whilst birds and clouds fly across the screen. On top of that, UI elements give you the control of this living map.\nYou'll notice that we take into account the physical size of the screen in order to display the map as if you were looking through it.\nPhone Orientation\nDifferent types of information are displayed whether the phone is on the board or being held by someone.\nWhen your phone is on the board, it displays information regarding the tile it\u2019s on. These details are public and may be of interest to other players (to help them complete a mission for example).\nWhen you hold your phone up it shows private information relevant to your captain and ship. Only you can see its screen, so you can secretly consult your ship's hold or your active missions in order to prepare your strategy.\nYou think you know everything about pirates? Ah, the impertinence of youth... Make yourself useful, pour me another and I will tell you a tale of the Nine Seas\u2026\nYo-Ho is not only a world, it\u2019s a dimension folded into a single piece of worn parchment. Is its withered surface paper or human flesh? Nobody knows for sure but this is a minor conundrum compared to the secrets sealed inside this faded map. Legends say that the demon known as Davy Jones crafted it or maybe, that it was somehow\u2026 part of him. Who knows how old it is? It's impossible to retrace its history as it has spent the centuries being passed, stolen or traded from one persons hoard to another.\nThen \"she\" came to Yo-Ho. Her name was Hortense. She was, as she put it, \u201cHuman\u201d. She claimed : \u201cYo-Ho is a magical map, and I am the pirate who found it. I came here to be Queen of the high-seas\u201d. At the time we were only animals. Eating, sleeping, going on with our simple lives. Then Hortense shared her secrets with a parrot, and the parrot, in turn, shared them with us. We started talking, using our paws, paddles, and eating Koko. We took a liking to the pirate life. Hortense created the Sisterhoods and leaders arose. All around us armies were raised and nations were born. We learnt fast. We were restless. We hungered for glory.\nIn Yo-Ho, Pirates are as much a part of their boats, as their boats are part of them. We call this unity Biots. Massive colossus roam these seas, whales, giant jellyfish, and ancient turtles, and we learnt to communicate with them. We pitched our might against each other, brother against sister, in a perpetual fight to win the heart of our unique Goddess, Hortense in her beautiful regalia of flowers, these mysterious orchids she was so fond of. We made this place a heaven for feathered felons and scaly scallywags. It was our world to make and in it we saw only glory, fame and precious clams.\nWe became more than human. Better: we became pirates.\nBut today, as I write these words, Hortense is dead. Nobody knows who killed her. Her lieutenants found her on her island, executed on a golden beach, clutching one last orchid in her delicate hand.\nNow everything is changing. New chieftains are rising from our ranks. Silent forces are working in the shades of twisted palm trees, where mutant birds scream in the canopy. A foul wind is blowing in from the north. Its nefarious aura can be felt by all, from hardy deck hands to sea sick greenhorns. Dark portents manifest throughout the oceans: in the breaking of the waves, in the clouded skies, and among the many perils that lie just off the shore. A tide of darkness is rising in this world.\nDo you hear the roars from under the sea ? Do you see our skies torn apart by strange lights, to the pulse that is the lifeblood of this land ? Something is waking up. Something Hortense was shielding us from. What will we do once it awakens?\nAll backers will receive a free upgrade to their game board with a limited edition Kickstarter design!\n *Le Dernier Bar Avant la Fin du Monde is Paris most popular social spot for geek culture.

Please note: Transport is not included in this pledge.\nCaptain Figureheads - UNLOCKED!\nIf we reach $55k we'll add figureheads for the 4 original captains plus any others unlocked during the campaign. These allow you to easily distinguish each player's device and character whilst on the board as well as adding some more light hearted fun to the game! These are small, Silicone models that attach to your device via a suction cup. They will be included in the boxed version of the game (captain pledge level and upwards).\nShip Figureheads - UNLOCKED!\nNote: Example using a similar product.\nJust like for the captains, if we reach $60k we will add figureheads for the 4 original vessels plus any unlocked during the campaign! They will be included in the boxed version of the game (captain pledge level and upwards).\n$60,000 - New Captain and Ship\n Our first digital stretch goal will unlock a brand new Captain AND Ship for the game, each with their own unique ability. Plus we have so many ideas for them we thought we'd let YOU decide what you'd prefer. After the campaign we will send out a survey and you guys can vote on your favourite idea! This is an upgrade for the App and will therefore be available to all pledge levels. Models and figureheads will of course be produced for these newcomers if the stretch goals are met.\n$65,000 - Boat models   \nThis stretch goal will add plastic models representing the ships in the game as well as a detatchable sail to represent each of the captains. These are a fantastic addition for those of you wanting to play in single device mode. These models will replace the cardboard silhouettes present in the box set (so captain pledge levels and upwards). Here's a quick example of what we have planned. The models will be about 5cm tall and 6cm long. They will be supplied unpainted.\n$70,000 - Captain Models  \nAs with the previous pledge level, this will add plastic models representing the captains to box set (so captain level pledge and upwards).

We didn't want to launch a Kickstarter campaign before we were sure we could build our idea into a working project. The biggest challenge was bringing our vision of a boardgame with digital support to life. How would it play? How could it make a board game better? Would it ultimately enhance the player's gaming experience and immersion? We are now sufficiently advanced on the project to know it works, and it is fun. So though technically we are not starting the game and we have an advanced working prototype, now is the time to try and make it real thanks to Crowdfunding on Kickstarter by appealing to the extraordinary community of this wonderful site.\niOS\niPod Touch 3rd generation or higher\niPhone 3GS or higher\niPad 2 or higher (only in single device mode)\niOS 5.1.1 or higher\nAndroid\nbetween 3.5 inch and 5.0 screen\nAndroid 2.3 or higher\nAccelerometer\nTablet (only in single device mode)\nCommon\nWifi connexion (one of the phones can be a hotspot)\nThe device must pysically fit within a 5.7\" x 3\" zone for optimum performance.\nExamples\nTHE PUBLISHER \nIELLO is an international game and toy publisher and distributor founded in 2004 in Nancy, France.

Prizm streams music directly from the Cloud so you don\u2019t even need to use a phone or a computer. You can now discover and enjoy more music with a single hit of a button.\nPrizm enhances your everyday life through music\n\"You just have to press the play button and that\u2019s it\"\n\"What the Nest does for the temperature, Prizm does for the music in your house: It learns what you like and adjusts the environment to suit your needs.\"\n\"Prizm could be the Hi-Fi of the future automated home.\"\n\"Prizm\u2019s contextual approach is pretty clever.\"\n\"Prizm learns to play only music you want to hear.\"\n\"Prizm\u2019s product is slick, and, having seen it in person and played with it, I can tell you that the product just works.\"\nPress play and the music starts. Music streams directly from the cloud to your speakers. You will no longer have to use your smartphone, computer or any other device to enjoy music. No more browsing, bluetooth pairing or any kind of hacky setup.\nPrizm is even smarter, it can also start music as soon as it detects you in the room !\nThanks to the signals from your phone and wearables (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth), added to a sound level sensor, Prizm knows what is happening in the room. Not only does it identify who is in the room, it can also sense what is the current atmosphere (chilling with friends, working etc.).\nIf you are alone, Prizm plays music for you. If your companion is alone, it plays music for him/her. And if you are together in the room, it merges both of your tastes and picks a song both of you will love. \nPrizm doesn't only suggests new songs based on your tastes. It knows what you like but also understands when and in which context you like specific music. Because we know that you don't listen to the same music alone or with friends, in the morning and after work, Prizm's music recommendation is driven by the context.\nWhen you discover something great, just touch the heart to add the song directly into your own playlists (Spotify, Soundcloud, Deezer). So when you leave home, songs you just discovered are already on your phone.\nPLAY\n\nDemo : press the heart and the song is added directly into your playlists\nEach time you interact with Prizm, it learns. Everyday, Prizm remembers your habits and learns that you prefer pop music in the morning, and jazz when you\u2019re back from work.\nDon\u2019t think about what you want to listen to anymore. Just enjoy music you\u2019ll love and live your life.   \nWhy buy another speaker ? You probably already have at home a great sound system or speakers that fit your needs. Prizm works with whatever speakers you prefer and breathes new life in what you already own.\nPrizm connects to your Spotify or Deezer Premium account to stream music. It also supports Soundcloud free accounts. This way, you can enjoy Prizm without any paid subscription !\nWe are working hard to make Prizm compatible with your favorite music streaming services in the future. Let us know which one you would like to be supported next.\nA Prizm device needs only one account to stream music. This account is used as the music source but you can create as many Prizm profiles as you want. This way, everyone at home can enjoy Prizm with its own profile.\nPrizm will also implement an UPnP MediaRenderer. This means that whenever you want to listen to something specific that is stored on a compatible NAS or any DLNA Server, you'll be able to stream it to your speaker through Prizm. However, you will still need a Deezer, Spotify or SoundCloud account to experience the best of Prizm, that is to generate a contextual music feed and discover new songs.\nPrizm captures Wi-Fi and Bluetooth signals from your phone or wearables to identify you through your MAC address. During the setup, you just have to match your device to your Prizm profile. Thus, when Prizm senses your device, it knows you\u2019re around ! \nPLAY\n\nPart of the algorithm runs on the device, the other is in our cloud. For instance, music recommendation which requires a huge music catalog is computed instantly in the cloud. Because your profile is also stored in the cloud, you can go to a friend's who owns a Prizm, and you'll be identified by his Prizm ! Your music profile follows you around.\nPrizm will ship with some extra cool features :\nYou can set Prizm to wake you up in the morning : it'll pick a new song everyday to help you start a better day.\nSimilarly, Prizm can gradually go to sleep as you do so. This means that you won't have to fall asleep with the music on, or make sure it's off before you go to bed.\nPrizm was designed to be standalone and always ready to use. However, we built a companion app for the device\u2019s setup and to allow remote control. If you hear an amazing song, you will be able to Like it even from the bathroom ! For the moment, this app is iOS and Android compatible, but more OS will come.  \nWith Prizm, we wanted to break the rules of traditional Hi-Fi design. The two main buttons express fundamental human emotions : when you hear a song, you either like it, or you don't. This obvious interface serves the underlying learning algorithm.\nThe design itself reflects that Prizm is a thinking device, and not a simple Wi-Fi dongle.\n\nPrizm will also be available in 3 of these extra colors ! Backers will vote for their favorite after the campaign :\nWe are a bunch of hardware and software passionates and fervent music streaming users. Fed up with having to figure out what to listen to all day long, and having to connect our phones or laptop to our speakers to decently enjoy music at home, we set out to build the music system of our dreams.\n\nFor over 18 months, we've have built, coded, designed, prototyped to bring our vision to life. \n \nThe board is running a Linux OS on an ARM Cortex A8 at 1Ghz with 256MB RAM.\n\nPrizm software will evolve and bring new features. We'll listen to you. Updates will be seamlessly pushed to your devices, without you having to care about it.\n\nMany of you picture Prizm larger than it actually is. All those who have seen it in real life were pleased to see its real size, and how cute it was. So here is a picture in comparison with an old relative of Prizm : a CD.\n\n  Thank you !\n\nWe would like to personally thank all of you for your support.\n\nSpecial thanks to Antebellum Films for their dedicated work on the video and Orange for their support on the manufacturing process.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a hardware product is hard, and once in your hands it must last.

Preorder TinyScreen here \nLook who's talking about TinyScreen (read them all here)\nTinyScreen is the new way to visualize your environment. With a beautiful color OLED display, TinyScreen is designed to be used to display information from the TinyDuino platform, which stack together like little electronic Lego's.\nWith TinyScreen there are several default apps that will work right out of the box - like a Smart Watch app, a Video player app and a video game app.  You can use these default apps with NO PROGRAMMING AT ALL!\nSMART WATCH\nCreate your own smart watch using TinyScreen.  The watch can be configured to use several different watch faces, and can use Bluetooth 4 (also known as Bluetooth Low Energy and Bluetooth Smart) to communicate with your smart phone (Android 4.3+ and iOS 7+).  \nWe have an open source app developed for both iPhone and Android that will allow you to configure the notifications that you can receive and display on the watch, like incoming phone calls, incoming texts, tweets and appointments.\n 3D printed enclosures are also available for the watch body that you can download and print yourself, and we'll also have different enclosures that you can purchase.\nPLAY GAMES\nPlay games on your TinyScreen, either with the four buttons along the side of the screen, or with the new Joystick TinyShield.  This supports two analog joysticks.  Currently we have a Flappy Bird clone and asteroids, with many more games to come.  Plus with the open source software library, other Kickstarter backers can create games and share them on our website.  \nWATCH VIDEOS\nWatch videos on your TinyScreen which can stream from an attached microSD card.  The videos can be any length, and a simple menu system that uses the TinyScreen buttons lets you navigate and select the video from the SD card.\nThe video format is similar to an animated GIF and computer software is available to convert standard videos into this format.\nREWARD LEVELS\nCREATE YOUR OWN PROJECTS\nLightning Fast Arduino Library\nWe've written an Arduino library from scratch for the TinyScreen that is optimized for speed and performance, yet still is very easy to use.  Full screen updates can be done in under 30 milliseconds, allowing for smooth moving videos and graphics. \nCreating your own TinyScreen projects is simple and the library includes high level functions for dealing with fonts and text, menus, graphics, gauges and basic shape.  Just a couple of lines of code are needed in most cases to start displaying what you want on your TinyScreen.  The library is completely open source.\nWeb Based Programming\nWe've teamed up with Codebender - the leading web based platform for the Arduino - to make programming your TinyScreen projects simple.  All of the latest TinyScreen libraries, examples, and standalone apps will be available on Codebender, This means you don't have to worry about getting your system set up just right with the specific libraries installed - all of this is handled on the Codebender site so you can focus on creating on your TinyScreen project,\nAny sharing code on Codebender is simple as well, so we envision many TinyScreen users creating programs and sharing them with the entire community.\nThe examples and library code can also be used with other software tools, like the standard Arduino IDE, to give you flexibility with how you develop your projects.\nOne Click Download\nIf you don't know how to program - don't worry, using Codebender updating the program in your TinyScreen is simple.  Just plug it into the USB of your computer, push a button on the website, and in about 10 seconds the new program is uploaded to your TinyScreen system.  It's that easy!\nThe TinyDuino Platform\nThe TinyDuino is essentially an full blown Arduino shrunk down to the size of a quarter.  The TinyDuino processor board has the same processor as the Arduino Uno (an Atmel Atmega328P) and now includes an onboard Lithium battery charger and battery connector.  All of the shield signals are supported, so all of your existing Arduino sketches will work as is.\nMaking projects with your TinyScreen is easy through the use of stackable TinyShields.  Add sensors, communication, motor drivers or hook up your own external circuitry by stacking in the right TinyShield for your application. \nThere are currently over 25 TinyShields with more coming out every month.  There are sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, compass, 9-Axis IMU, ambient light sensor), output boards (motor drivers, audio output, displays), storage (SRAM, EEPROM, microSD card), communication (USB, Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE, WiFi, 433MHz,802.15.4, Ethernet) and breakout boards to connect to external sensors and circuitry.\nTinyDuino Board Updates\nAlong with the TinyScreen, this campaign is also introducing the most major overhaul to the TinyDuino platform since it's launch in 2012.\nJoystick TinyShield\nA new TinyShield that adds two analog joysticks for things like playing games and controlling devices like RC helicopters, robots and cars.  Each joystick can also be pushed as a switch input, and the Joystick TinyShield uses the I2C bus to free up I/O pins for other usages.\nTinyDuino Processor Board (major update)\nA major design evolution by adding a Lithium battery charger on board, battery connector, and an On/Off slide switch.  The coin cell option is also available with this new board version.   \nUSB TinyShield (major update)\nThe USB TinyShield has been updated to use a new FTDI USB converter and adds an option to locate the USB connector on the side or top of the PCB to give you more options where to plug in the USB cable.\nBluetooth Low Energy TinyShield (major update)\nA new version of the BLE TinyShield that lowers the TinyShield size and price using the Nordic nrf8001 BLE radio.  App support will also be available for Android and iOS to allow cell phone notifications to be transmitted to this BLE TinyShield to allow for things like Smart Watch notifications.  \nTechnical Specs\nTinyScreen\n96x64 OLED display, 16-bit color depth\n0.96\" (24.4mm) viewable area\nTotal Size: 1.02\" x 0.98\" (25.8mm x 25.0mm)\nSoftware controllable backlight (OLED brightness)\nPower down mode\nFour push buttons along the sides (connected to IO pins)\nSPI interface for display\n3.0V to 5.5V operation (higher voltages supported with TinyShield power regulator)\n20 - 45mA max supply current (depending on brightness)\nOpen Source\nWe are major supporters of Open Source Hardware and Software.  All of the software and hardware files for the existing TinyDuino platform are available on our website for download and modification, and the TinyScreen is as well.\nWho are We?\nWe are TinyCircuits - a Maker of Tiny Open Source Electronics based in Akron, Ohio.  We got our start in 2012 with the launch of the TinyDuino Project on Kickstarter.  This project exceed it's goal by over 1000%, which let us set up a full design and manufacturing operation in a 100 year old former tire factory in downtown Akron.  We have grown to a team of seven and are selling the TinyDuino products all around the world. Thanks Kickstarter! \nWe manufacture all our own products in house with our own Surface Mount Assembly Line (including Stencil printers, Pick and Place and reflow oven).  Over the past two years, we've manufactured tens of thousands of units reliably, for our own customers and for others.  Most recently, we built 6000 units of the Digispark Pro for their recent Kickstarter campaign.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTwo years ago we launched the TinyDuino project on Kickstarter which greatly exceeded our expectations (and raised about 1100% of it's goal). This let us set up our own manufacturing operation in Akron, OH, where we are able to assembly, test and ship all of our products. We produced over 15,000 different board assemblies as part of this and shipped to over 1100 different backers. \n\nSince that initial Kickstarter, we've released about 20 new products (mostly add on for the TinyDuino platform), and have learned a tremendous amount about manufacturing quality and reliable products, and have fined tuned our production process.\n\nOne of the biggest risks / challenges we see from this project is the procurement of the OLED screens themselves, since these will be from an overseas source and in a high volume. We have consulted with two different distributors of the OLEDs screens, and have a second model identified from a different vendor that we could switch to if something comes up with the original screen vendor.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Over!

Its remote control funtionality enables to select and view the recorded images stored on the microSD card.\nAs soon as we take the 360cam out of our pocket to demo it, people tell us the many ways they would use it.  They have inspired us to create accessories for special purposes, whether it is for sharing special memories of a day at the beach, or keeping an eye on your office or your home, or even professionally broadcasting a live event in 360\u00b0.\nWe\u2019ve created Kickstarter packages that include some of these accessories to meet your needs.\nUnderwater Lens Cups\nThe 360cam is waterproof (IPX8 rated) but as know, mixing optics with water are not good friends. Water creates image distortion and reduces the field of view. Our 360cam goggle to the rescue!\nOur mini-goggles are made of optical grade plastic and are enclosed in a blue rubber mask. They keep the lenses well protected from the water. Easy to attach and practically weightless.\nClip them instantly to your 360cam before going into the water.\nEthernet (POE) Video Streaming Base\nFor professional broadcasters you can easily stream a unique live concert or event to those unlucky ones who couldn\u2019t make it. It isalso ideal for professional  video surveillance providing full 360\u00b0 view 24/7.\nOur 360cam is equipped with a WiFi antenna. In an environment where wireless can be dependable, just switch the battery base to the ethernet video streaming base to allow a steady, reliable and high speed connection.\nThe ethernet video streaming base is POE ready. It's easy to set up, with no need to bring an extra power source to the camera. Professional video streaming at full throttle!\nLight Bulb Adaptor\nSetup a home video surveillance system without aneed for messy cables, to keep an eye on the kids or the pets in the next room, or to monitor your home and office while you are away.\nThe 360cam WiFi capability allows real-time seamless streaming to your mobile, tablet or cloud video surveillance service. The Light Bulb Adaptor provides direct power to the 360cam, enabling full speed WiFi connectivity to your home network or device.\nEasy setup - install it like a regular light bulb. This accessory is 115/230 volt compatible.\nUse the 360cam with your app or your own hardware.\nIn developer mode, the 360cam provides access to several camera controls.\nDevelop new business opportunities by integrating your software or hardware attachment with the 360cam.  Examples: \nA 360\u00b0 video conferencing service.  \nA surveillance security system.\nA webcam service. \nA patient monitoring system in a hospital.\nYour imagination is the only limit to uing the 360cam. \nOur software developer\u2019s kit includes:\n360cam desktop video player object code\n360cam app object code (for iOS and Android devices)\n360cam player Oculus Rift object code\nOur hardware developer\u2019s kit includes:\nThe entire software developer kit\nThe 360cam base 3D model\nThe 360cam base connectivity schematic\n15 hours of 360cam firmware tunning done by our engineers\nAccess to our engineering team to answer your questions\nOur Kickstarter launch is building a community of 360\u00b0 innovators, developing new usages and applications. \nTogether, let\u2019s push the envelope. Maybe we'll even push to see beyond 360\u00b0.\nWe\u2019ve been working on 360\u00b0 imagery for several years, developing 360\u00b0 solutions for the business market.\nOur customers inspired us to create a new generation of a 360\u00b0 camera - the one that would respond to today\u2019s needs of real time video streaming, Full HD unrestricted 360\u00b0 field of view, simple to operate and versatile to use.  \nWe believe that the time is right to bring the richness of the 360\u00b0 experience to the consumer market, and to make high quality 360\u00b0 cameras available to everybody.\nTo make this happens we had to rethink the entire optical and electronic design and processes.  Instead of using off-the-shelf lenses, we developed our own three 185\u00ba fish-eye lenses that capture the broadest field of view in the industry. Instead of having stitching occur on a computer, like most 360\u00b0 cameras, we developed on own on-chip stitching algorithms that allow immediate creation of .mp4 or .jpg files inside the camera.  We also designed a variety of accessories to allow the use of our technology in different conditions, to make it truly versatile.\nNow, that the technological challenges are behind us, we are facing the next challenge of bringing the 360cam into the hands of everybody. That\u2019s why we need your support.\nOur Kickstarter is about connecting with you, 360\u00b0 enthusiasts, to share our invention and hear your feedback. Become a part of our team and travel with us on our exciting journey to bring the 360cam into the lives of everyone.\nSome of our team\nCEO, Richard Ollier\nAfter graduating from engineering school HEI  in France, Richard worked in Japan with Omnicom on interactive planning.  Inspired by that experience, he returned to France and founded GIROPTIC in 2008 to bring 360\u00b0 vision technology to everyone.\nChief Optical Engineer, Gilles Mathieu\nWith a degree from a French optical design school, he\u2019s been building optical systems for over 25 years.  Now Gilles works on everything from designing our optics to manufacturing and quality control.\nChief Electronic Engineer, Thomas Bocquet\nThomas earned an engineering degree in France at ISEN and works with Cypress on imaging sensors for military and space use.  After building several cameras for Xenics, he now leads our electronics designs.\nChief Electronic Software Engineer, Arnould De Rocquigny Du Fayel\nArnould first met Thomas while he was a student at the ISEN engineering school. He has a strong background in FPGA & ASIC development. With expertise in image manipulation, Arnould implemented our patented on-chip image stitching algorithm and manages the embedded software team.\nSenior DSP Engineer, Ibrahima Sakho\nIbrahima earned a degree in Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris with a focus on DSP image pipe processing. Ibrahima has several years of experience in camera development. His strong skills helped us to exceed the expected performance of the 360cam.\nMechanical Engineer, Geoffrey Regia Corte\nGeoffrey has a degree from ISD in design and mechanical applications.  He designs our products and packaging.  With his talent for mechanical-for-manufacturing engineering, we were able to greatly shorten the time from prototype to production.\nThe 360cam hardware is made of electronics and optical elements as well as plastic & magnesium for its housing.  All the electronic boards have been tested and comply with our design specifications. The 360cam passed the pre-certification tests for FCC and CE. This prevents any unexpected delays with final certification process.  \nOur custom-designed lens has been inspected & tested by our optical engineer to ensure that they matched our design expectations.\nFrom the early design stage, we\u2019ve been working in close collaboration with our Asian partner -a plastic & magnesium die casting factory- to prepare the molds for mass production.  Our partner is waiting for our green light.\nWe expect to deliver the first production 360cam in November, 2014.  \nBetween now and then, we know that much still needs to be done. \nHere\u2019s an outline of that effort.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve been working diligently for the last two years to ensure the high quality and timely delivery of the first production run of the 360cam. But as with any innovative products we might experience unexpected challenges or red blocks as we are ramping up the first batch.\n\nElectronic Supply Chain\nSome of our electronic key components are unique and cannot be sourced through a backup supplier. As of today, we have a clear view of every component\u2019s lead time. However, unforeseen events such as a high volume order from another bigger player in the market could force our supplier to delay the delivery of those components by a few weeks.\n\nWiFi & Battery Performance \nThe quality of the live video streaming over WiFi is dependent on the design and placement of the antenna in the product housing. \nThrough multiple experiments and testing we found an optimal positioning of our miniature antenna to deliver the most reliable performance. But we are still working on improving the antenna performance to ensure even broader WiFi range without depleting too much of the battery power. \n\nImage Performance\nOur engineering team continues to improve Auto White Balance and Auto Exposure algorithm. Those are tested every single day in different extreme lighting conditions such as direct sunshine or dawn. Until we ship the 360cam to you we\u2019ll continue to work hard on fine tuning the image quality to ensure the best possible user experience. \n\nWe are committed to keep our campaign transparent and we will openly communicate with our supporters on the progress we make and the issues that might arise.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "New camera firmware update", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nAfter several weeks of testing, we would like to let you know that the new 4.09 camera firmware update has just been released!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Shipping & Services Update", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nPlease find below the latest updates on the project.\nShipping update \n- We are finalizing a new batch of cameras at our manufacturing facility with tighter quality control processes in place\n - We expect them to arrive in our distribution centers by the end September.

Each card has a special effect to be discovered. From creating armor to protect your Drako to casting a spell to snare your opponent, the tactics and choices are infinite. Will you be a daring attacker or a cunning defender? It\u2019s up to you to develop your own strategy by selecting the cards that will create your ideal game.\nDRAKERZ-Confrontation is played online: you must be connected to the Internet to play.

Last but not least, DRAKERZ-Confrontation can be played without a computer!\n\n\nOniris is a parallel universe where magic and fantasy come to life once, only known by those initiated to the \"waking dream\": the Drakoneers... Nowadays, only remembered in our legends.\n\nToday, electronic eyes of our modern cameras enable us to recover the gift of seeing Oniris and the creatures that populate it again... This is no coincidence: a new generation of Drakoneers is being recruited to battle against a great threat!\nIs it a war song or a moan being heard from the nightmare lands? What happened to the Legendary Drakoneers and their Drakos, protectors of Oniris? And what happened to the great Dragon, the first among the Drakos?\nDRAKERZ-Confrontation takes you into the heart of an epic quest, rich in adventures that are part of the extended universe of DRAKERZ.\n\nFight and advance in Drakerz\u2019s leagues and global rankings to become the best...

Will you have the guts and dare to become a Legendary Drakerz?\n\n\n   \n  The first step in playing DRAKERZ-Confrontation is to choose your Drako among one of six species. As a Drakerz, you can \u201cride\u201d any of these extraordinary beings but choose carefully as each type has its own abilities.\nLike lightning, a Felis never strikes in the same place twice. Swift in tooth and claw, it sunders the sky, armors and your opponents. With verve, fury and tenacity, a Felis knows to be patient when it comes to schooling opponents. Weaken? Never. Fail? Impossible! Even when mortally wounded, it can come back from the brink of death and punish his opponent!\nPROFILE : Guardian of the Animal Kingdom\nQUALITIES : Patience, tenacity\nTALENTS : The gift of regeneration\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : Felis regenerate health points when their health drops below a certain threshold.\n\n\nStrong as a rock, that\u2019s the Gorok. But it is sensitive, too... To cracking and tearing and dismantling! The Gorok is a giant bruise-maker in a world of heavyweight louts. A heart of stone? Yes, but between a Gorok and his Drakoneer exists an unbreakable bond. Your Gorok will do anything for you: dismember a few opponents, use their bleached skulls for drums, or fill up the arena with his molten battle-roar. Because that\u2019s what Goroks do.\n\nPROFILE : Mineral kingdom guardian\nQUALITIES: Reckless, impulsive\nTALENTS : Deals out earth-shaking blows\n\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : Gorok hits harder whenever its fury is full\n\n    Due to their natural concealment abilities, Meleons are feared and fearsome fighters. One might think a Meleon would be content to disappear, only to strike where and when its opponent expects it the least. But that doesn\u2019t take into account the Meleon\u2019s \"playful\" nature. Meleons take great pleasure in gaining victory through surprise attacks, master strokes, or simply through apparently insane maneuvers.\n\nPROFILE : Guardian of the Plant Kingdom \nQUALITIES : Cunning, unpredictable\nTALENTS : Knows how to blend into its surroundings\n\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : Meleons may draw extra cards at the start of their turn. \n\n    A Furkhan is well acquainted with that particular emotion called \u201cfear\u201d. It will hunt down your opponent to the point of giving him or her cold sweats. Its Furies, darker than your worst nightmares, will wear the confidence of its enemies out. It knows nothing of pity. It gives no quarter. It will stop at nothing to achieve victory. Though it is shrouded in shadow and darkness, don\u2019t start to think its soul is dark: a Furkhan is unfailingly loyal to the one its has chosen as its Drakoneer.\n\nPROFILE : Guardian of the Animal Kingdom \nQUALITIES : Fast, precise\nTALENTS : Good at taking its opponents by surprise\n\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : The Furkhan pays one less mana point for a special movement\n   \nIt is said that Ogams are the oldest Drakos the world has ever known. Is it because they are steeped in magic and ancient secrets? Or because they\u2019ve been guided by many Master Drakoneers on the Way? It\u2019s hard to say, but one thing is certain: their knowledge of Mana is incomparable. For an Ogam, Mana is everything. An Ogam knows that Mana flows through dreams like blood through veins. His charm is poisonous and his dance is fatal.\n\nPROFILE : Guardian of the Plant Kingdom\nQUALITIES : Wise, powerful\nTALENTS : It knows all the secrets of the Mana\n\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : The Ogam Drakerz gains more mana when it discards a card\n \n  A body studded with horns and gemstones; a thick, tough hide that deters even the bravest; innumerable feet bedecked with claws: such is a Kwartz. The large crystals, supple as scales, that cover his back form a gleaming bunker. A Drakonner leads its Kwarts into combat biting as the cold wind and as fast as an avalanche. A Kwartz is also capable of rising into the air to pierce his opponents with a laser-like Fury.\n\nPROFILE : Guardian of the Mineral Kingdom\nQUALITIES : Unshakable, surprising\nTALENTS : His defenses are unshakable\n\nSPECIAL STRENGTH : The Kwartz adapts his defense to attacks it receives\n \n  These are the simplest type of card to play: pay the price of the invocation and apply the card\u2019s effects. Effects can be instantaneous (effects are applied immediately and do not last), or temporary (they are applied immediately and last as long as indicated on the card). Once played, the cards are discarded (put aside and not played again).\nThese cards are unique in that they are played only during the opponent\u2019s turn and only when he has just played a card. The consequences are two-fold: effects of the Interruption card are applied before those of the card played by the opponent, and his or her Card Placement Phase ends immediately. As such, these are powerful cards that you need to learn to play at the right time.\n\nThese cards can have effects on Armor, Weapons or Fury, or can be Tactical. Effects of an Equipment card last as long as it is in play. An Equipment card is not discarded after being resolved. They have a level of effect of 1, 2, or 3. When played, an Equipment card starts at Level 1. Its level can be raised with the help of Upgrade cards. Equipment cards have several casting costs. When they are played, the first level is used to determine the cost of the card, and likewise for the levels that follow.\n\nThe Fury is the Drako\u2019s most powerful attack, but also the most difficult to execute. It is necessary to play this type of card to set off a Fury. This card\u2019s effectiveness will also depend on the Fury Pool value that appears on the interface.\n\nThose one only target Equipment cards and are used to change their levels, either by upgrading your Equipment or by lowering the level of your opponent\u2019s Equipment. If the equipment is at level 1 and it has been reduced (dropped to level 0), the equipment will be destroyed and discarded from play.\n\n\n\n  We are an indie studio and our efforts have brought the development of DRAKERZ-Confrontation to 90% of it being a releasable game. However, we will need external help in order to bring the game to completion.\nTo help improve the game we are giving Early Access players the opportunity to have their say in how our game is shaped by joining as a user in our BETA game.

We have a lot ideas for Homey, but limited time to develop. With more funding, we can invite more members to the team, which can develop more functionality!\nIt just works\nWhen you plug it in, Homey already works with most of your devices, and support for many more will come. Next to home appliances, it connects to your entertainment systems and online accounts. Homey is the living hub that intelligently connects everything in your life.\nHomey works with...\n...and many more!\nScience!\nWhile this sounds like magic, it\u2019s actually science: Homey includes 7 wireless modules that work on various frequencies and protocols, all integrated together in an intelligent and easy-to-use device with state-of-the-art speech recognition. And to make sure we don\u2019t miss out on your older devices and television sets, we\u2019ve added an Infrared Power-LED. Yes, you may throw away all your remotes now.\nThere\u2019s an app for that\nBecause there are a lot of devices used out there, and new ones being released every day, Homey features an app store, so you can continuously get freshly made apps by fellow enthusiasts and device brands. All apps are checked, so you don\u2019t have to worry about privacy and safety.\nDevelopers and hobbyists can also publish directly to the Labs section, where you can freely share your own homebrew projects.\nHomey can talk to all types of devices using various wireless technologies\nDo I have supported products?\nYes, you have! Homey already works with the most basic devices at home, such as your older, infrared-controlled TV set. Let Homey connect to your mail, calendar en weather service and your already have quite the smart assistant, which only gets smarter and smarter as you purchase more (wireless) devices!\nOut of the box\nWhen you use Homey for the first time, it already knows how to talk with most of your devices. In the event that you own a device that Homey isn't yet familiar with, like your older television, you can easily learn Homey how to talk to it using your remote. As a bonus, these device codes are then shared to other Homey owners, so that everyone that owns the same device can profit instantly.\nMultilanguage\nBecause not everyone is a native English speaker, Homey is multi-language. At first we support English, Dutch, German, Spanish and French, and more languages will be added later on, prioritized by our backer's locations.\nFor the geeks, developers, hobbyists\nWe are geeks and we'd love to have a part of our backers to be geeks too. Everyone can develop for Homey, because we designed it with openness in mind. We don\u2019t like all that commercial blahblah, we do this to give you the best experience!\nHomey works with apps written in JavaScript. An app can do various things, such as controlling one of Homey\u2019s hardware modules, use the Internet, make another app smarter or tell you a Chuck Norris joke when you ask for it.\nApps can talk to each other. For example, with a few lines of JavaScript, you can tell Homey to play your friend\u2019s favorite song when they enter your house with your homemade nfc door lock.\nBy pledging as geek, you don\u2019t only get Homey, but also example code for your own Homey app, an Arduino library and early access to the SDK. You'll also get two nRF24L01+ radio transceivers to communicate wirelessly plus enough jumper cables to get you started.\nTwo nrf24l01+ transceivers, included with the Geek Edition\nTechnical specifications\nHomey has in total 8 radio modules, which are accessible through our high-level JavaScript API:\nWi-Fi 802.11b/g/n\nBluetooth 4.0\nNFC\nZigBee\nZ-Wave\n433.92 MHz\nnrf24l01+\nInfrared\nThese are all connected to a Raspberry Pi Compute Module, which runs our custom software. Homey runs on a node.js server, so developers can make use of the easy-to-learn JavaScript language.\nHomey works with a 12V adapter, which will be shipped with a connector to match your region. For now we promise type A and C plugs only (US and EU mainland), when we have more backers from foreign countries, we\u2019ll do our best to include your local plug!\nThe sphere is 11 cm (4.3\") in diameter. In the middle you will find a multi-colored LED ring that empowers apps to give feedback to the user, and the small circle on top is for the Infrared Power-LED to shine through the casing.\nThe Homey Smartphone App is available for iPhone and Android users. Users of other operating systems can use their browser to access and configure Homey on the go.\nHistory, Current state and Timeline\nHomey has been in development for the past three years as both a hobby and university project. In the hobby phase, the speech recognition used was a hybrid between Microsoft's and Google's, combined with a display for visual feedback. Shortly after, the project was rewritten in Node.js for a University's project with use of Google's speech recognition, added with our own sauce of intelligence.\nA *very* early prototype :)\nWe are sure that an intelligent home will never work without support for all your devices. That was why we chose for an open platform, that allows everyone to contribute, based on Node.js running on the Raspberry Pi.\nRaspberry Pi with a 433.92MHz transmitter\nTo launch this project as a consumer product, the Raspberry Pi will be replaced by it's industrial variant, the compute module. Then, all wireless modules will be hooked up to it, and finally put it all in the orb casing.\nHardware demo video\nThe development in the coming time will be primarily focused on getting all the parts in the orb. We are also further developing the mobile applications and marketplace, and starting the mass production process for the casing. After that, bulk ordering of the modules and assemblage of the product are up to finalize Homey.\nJump in and contribute!\nWe want to bring Homey to the world, to make the lives of everyone easier and more fun. And you can help us make that goal a reality and be a part of the future of homes. Backers will receive:\n((Super) Early Bird) Homey\nPledging this option will get you the home of the future. Talk to it and control your home!\nYour Homey includes support for a broad range of devices to set you off in minutes.\nYou will also get early access to the Homey app store to download extensions and improve your life.\nHomey backers will be given the opportunity to suggest apps and devices that we just can\u2019t miss.\nWe will always listen to you. Your feedback is taken into consideration very carefully to make sure Homey stays at the very top.\nGeek Edition\nGet all the benefits listed above on the default Homey option.\nPlus, you will get immediate developer access to the Homey app store and SDK \u2013 both the regular and the Labs section.\nYou will be provided with 2 wireless radio transceivers also found in Homey to make your hobby projects Homey-compatible, plus  jumper cables to add them to your project.\nAlso, both sample app code as an Arduino library will be available to you to make sure you don\u2019t have any hassles!\nA High level Javascript API will be provided for easy access to all of Homey\u2019s hardware.\nHomey-homie\nIf you want to support us, but don't have the money for Homey itself, this is your pick!\nYou'll receive a unique, miniature Homey with a multi-colored LED ring. There'll also be a NFC tag inside, so you can use it to unlock your door, for example!\nOther ways to contribute\nSpread the word!\nMaybe you can\u2019t kick in on one of the options above. The great thing is, to help Homey succeed, there is more you can do: Like this Kickstarter page, post, tweet, blog and pin (about) us, email your friends, talk to your co-workers, convince your family and dog or do whatever you do best to share us with the world. Also, while you\u2019re at it, you can find us on Facebook over here. Go on, click that Like button!\nDonate brain cycles\nWe have tons of ideas of how we can use Homey, but you sure have many too! Getting input from everyone is very important for us to make Homey the very best, like no tech ever was. Have some thoughts on Homey? Ideas for supported devices? Awesome appness? Cool scenarios? Post them in the comments or send them to us by the medium you like: email, facebook, twitter, postcard or carrier pigeon.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n== Licensing of Technologies ==\n\nWe do our utmost best to make sure all the licensing is properly fixed before we ship the device. We will make sure that the product you get shipped is hardware-wise capable with all the technologies touted before, so a possible missing license could be added through a software update.\n\n== CE/FCC Certifications ==\n\nAlthough we are doing our very best and are in collaboration with local test labs and the University of Twente, CE and FCC certifications remain a tricky issue. First of all they are really not cheap, especially FCC requires extensive testing by accredited labs, and secondly they might delay the process if clearance is not given in the timeframe we estimated. Although we already took this into account, government-issued certifications always post risks.\n\n== Overwhelming demand ==\n\nTo handle overwhelming demand, our perks will be released in batches, each with its own estimated delivery time. This is to prevent early backers to receive their product much later than anticipated, and to give every backer a clear indication of the estimated delivery time for their product.\n\nThis is of course the only problem we're hoping to face ;-)\n\n== Supplier delays ==\n\nSince we are incorporating many different technologies in one device, we have to deal with a lot of suppliers for all the components. Although we have multiple options for each part, communication with suppliers or delays can cause for unexpected delays in the process, especially since many electronic parts are manufactured in Asia nowadays.

To control your uArm wirelessly as well as having the opportunity to be the first to play with our smart phone apps, you can back us with an additional $30 and send us an email to feedback@ufactory.cc \nSee more details about the Bluetooth here.\nThe Story\nWhen hearing the word \u201crobot\u201d, most of us may think of the giant industrial robot arms. They can precisely install the components at a very high speed, or handle many complex, even dangerous tasks. \nRobots are awesome, and wouldn\u2019t it be nice if everybody who wants a robot arm can actually afford one? After all, $50,000 is kind of a lot of money. This is when we, the UFactory come in. UFactory stands for \u201cYour Factory\u201d. We build various robotics products to make robots more accessible for everyone! That\u2019s why we started the uArm project - a desktop miniature robot arm.\nPhoto: ABB\nThe Robot \nWhat is uArm?\nuArm is a 4-axis parallel-mechanism robot arm, inspired by the ABB PalletPack industrial robot arm IRB460. \nIt is made up of laser cut acrylic or wood parts, powered by standard RC hobby servos, and controlled by an Arduino-compatible board. In parallel-mechanism robot arm, most of the masses concentrate on the base, making the robot much more stable and allows the upper Arm to react really fast.\nAbove are some of the prototypes we had so far.\nWhat can you do with uArm?\nWell, in two words: COOL Things!!!\nOnce you got your uArm, you can immediately customize it with your own components. For example:\nYou can add a LED to make a computer-controlled desk lamp!\nOr install it on the arm on a mobile robot chassis base and move it around.\nOr play music!\nOr help you to send business card!\nOr make a small assembly line at your desk!\nOr program it to do your homework!\nOK, probably not doing your homework. But the possibilities are infinite; there are many more fun applications that can be done by using your uArm kit. And as you try to make it work, you will learn a lot about robotics and coding.\nThe uArm can also be a great gift to get people interested in Robotics. Since it could be easily controlled with a smartphone, people with no programming background can also enjoy the fun of robotics.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t plan to do anything with it, a desktop robot arm will be a WONDERFUL decoration!\nHow do I use it?\nRight now we have already developed a Windows application that allows the uArm to be controlled with keyboard or mouse. \nA serial communication program that uses Processing to create a host computer program that displays simple OpenGL object to show the orientation of the controls and reads keyborad event then sends command to the uArm.\nUsing mouse to control uArm to play Cup Stacking via serial.\nWith some basic controlling skills, you can use basically any input device to control it, for example, we have also used other remote controller to control the arm. With our imbedded inverse-kinematics algorithm, the uArm can be precisely controlled using coordinates. \nWe are currently working with the Android and IOS apps as well, so you can control the uArm via Bluetooth as well. \nWe have also written an Arduino library specifically for controlling the uArm. So if you are familiar with Arduino, you can program it directly with Arduino IDE. By calling different functions, you can easily move uArm to your desired position without doing tons of hard math.\nUPDATE: We have just sketched out a new function for the uArm which allows you to simply dragging it around as the uArm records the critical coordinates for later playback! With this function, you can now TEACH the uArm to accomplish simple tasks without writing a single line of code, or even connecting to your computer\uff01\nFurther Details:\nThe basic design is Arduino-controlled with 4 degrees of freedom. Three servos on the base control the main movement of the arm and the mini servo on the top moves and rotates the object. The end-effector of the arm is always kept parallel to the ground.\nWe also made some other designs of the end-effector for applications and extensions.\nMechanical Parts:\nThe structure of the arm is made up of laser cut acrylic or wood parts.\nIn addition to some screws, nuts and brass stand-offs, we also provide some flanged bearings, one large bearing, and 4 suction cups for you to complete the assembly of the arm.\nBy adding the bearings the arm can work smoothly and stable.\nThese parts, along with the servos, allow you to build the arm and a gripper end-effector.\nElectronic Parts:\nThe micro-controller is an Arduino compatible board. And we also develop a shield for Arduino to drive the vacuum pump and the servos. In additional, the power supply board will be on the shield, too.\nThe electronic parts of the Basic uArm consist of 3 standard servos, 1 micro servo, 1 Arduino-compatible board, 1 uArm shield, 1 USB cable and 1 wall adapter power supply.\nThe electronic parts for the gripper end-effector consist of 1 micro servo.\nThe electronic parts for the suction cup end-effector consist of 1 small vacuum pump and 1 solenoid valve.\nThe electronic parts for EARLY BIRD & Gripper Kit\uff1a\nThe electronic parts for Suction Cup Kit\uff1a\nThe electronic parts for Replaceable Kit, Custom Message Engraved Kit, Complete Assembled Kit & Advanced Kit:\nMounting:\nThe uArm comes standard with 4 suction cups for the base of the arm, to allow you to mount the arm on any smooth horizontal surface, such as a smooth desktop or floor.\nYou can also install the arm on a mobile robot chassis base and move it around.\nuArm Work Envelope (working range of the arm):\nWhat is the payload weight capacity for uArm?\nIn our informal testing, we have found that the uArm can easily lift and move a regular can of soda. \nMore testing will be carried out later and more accurate data will be specified.\nOpen source!!!\nuArm will be completely open-sourced after the Kickstarter campaign completes! We will use the time in between to optimize our design and make it the best it can be. We are a company, yes, but we are also a group of robot maniacs. We want to share our joy with the rest of the world and make more people realize how fun robotics can be! All of the design files, hardware and software will be released in May, 2014. So you can build your own arm using a laser cutter, then add you own controller and servos to it. \nEven if this project fails, we will still release all the files online. If this project succeeds, though, we will be able to launch more open source robotics kits and mechanical platforms! Cheers!\nHow to assemble uArm?\nWe will offer a full step-by-step tutorial describing how to assemble uArm after we finish the finial design. Now we have a simple Assembly Diagram for the current version.\nEvolution of uArm\nMechanical Parts:\nThe major revisions of the mechanical parts are on the thickness of the Acrylic parts and the base of the arm.\nWe changed the thickness from 3mm to 5mm.\nWe have made an electronic module holder for the electronic parts and also made a case for the vacuum pump and solenoid valve in the latest version.\nWe have made 3 versions of the base of the arm so far. In the first version, the mounting is not convenient. So in the second version, we added 4 suction cups on the base and you can also use screws and nuts for mounting. In the third version, we added a bearing on the base, so the arm can move smoothly and stable.\nElectronic Parts:\nWith electronic parts, we have made 5 versions so far. In the latest version, we make a shield of Arduino for the arm to drive the vacuum pump and the servos. In additional, the power supply board will be on the shield, too. The micro-controller in the final version is still an Arduino compatible board.\nThe first version: A micro-controller board, a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\n The second version: A micro-controller board (Arduino Leonardo), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\n The third version:A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\n The fourth version: A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\nThe fifth version:A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), an uArm shield, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\nThe latest version we have made so far:\nWhy we need you  \nWe are robot maniacs with the goal of making robotics kits more accessible to the public and we want to help more people to see the beauty of robotics!\nuArm is our first developed platform. We now have several prototypes, but they can still be made better. Currently the uArm can\u2019t perform super accurate motion due to our tight budget; also if we can injection mold some of the parts, the assembly process can be greatly simplified; We are also planning to design and build the next version of the arm. It will be stepper-motor driven with metal frames thus it will be more accurate. And we will add remote control function on PC, Mac and Smart Phones as well. Furthermore, if we can get gather enough public attention, we can corporate with big companies to send these robot arms to schools, and give children access to robots!\nWe are eager to make the uArm better, cheaper and easily accessible. so more people can enjoy the fun of robotics. And all of these cannot be done without your support!\nRewards\nAs rewards, we will offer the parts or a complete kit to build your own uArm from acrylic or wood. Only Complete Assembled Kit and Advanced Kit are assembled.

You can ask me to change speeds, direction or even dance around.\nWe created Ozobot to bring social gaming back to game night. Ozobot is a physical game piece that can play with virtual worlds, creating a bridge between old and new, cutting edge and nostalgic.\nWhile Ozobot loves to play, learning is also a natural activity. Imagine a group of school kids completing an app learning game using Ozobot\u2019s SmartCodes. In the process of completing their game mission, they are also learning the fundamentals of robotic programming...\nMeasuring slightly over an inch in diameter and height, Ozobot is the world's most compact smart robot of its kind and features some of the smallest components on the planet.\nOzobot will come with four free apps for iOS and Android. More apps will follow every few months along with 3rd party developers adding their creations into the mix.\nHelp Ozobot escape mazes using various SmartTiles as you navigate using straight lines, turns and intersections in order to win.\nPush the limits as you explore Ozobot\u2019s color language while creating intricate patterns and designs.\nA modern day game of chance. Watch Ozobot cruise through mazes and customizable exits to decide your fate.\nThis multi robot hybrid race game merges the digital world with physical tracks, creating a new and engaging gaming experience.\nThe possibility of bridging digital and physical gaming has been one of our most exciting frontiers. Ozobot's ability to operate in both worlds and autonomously navigate between them created a new realm which we call hybrid gaming. Whether you are enjoying the thrill of a racing game or testing your skills on a strategic board game, the Ozobot hybrid gaming platform will capture your imagination and let you experience new and classic games like never before.\nOur journey began in the spring of 2012 with the idea of finding different ways to play, learn and socially interact in an evolving digital world.\nThe idea gained traction when we started researching robots and their evolution through time. We started with a line-sensing robot and began building from there. Two years and countless revisions later, our idea grew into the smallest little robot we could make: Ozobot.\nSize and consistency of behavior has since been our driving forces to make Ozobot as small and as smart as possible. \u2026And with your help, it\u2019s going to be fun to see how far we can take Ozobot.\n\u201cLast year, Anki showed us the beauty (and business savvy) of combining physical and digital gaming.

We successfully completed our first sample run which we shared for the first time at CES. The results were overwhelmingly positive and we are happy and energized by the positive response. Thank you.\nWhile Ozobot is getting smarter, so are the games, and the Ozobot app team has been working tirelessly to keep up with Ozobot and develop the best ways to play. Today, Ozobot has four apps, and with your help we can keep building and sharing Ozobot with other developers to build more and more games and unearth capabilities that are yet to be imagined and designed.\nOzobot\u2019s first showing was a CES success.

For the latest, go to rimworldgame.com.\n-------------------------\nRimWorld follows three survivors from a crashed space liner as they build a colony on a frontier world at the rim of the galaxy.\nFor Windows, Mac, Linux. The game will be distributed by DRM-free download and backers will also get Steam keys. If you can't back here, there are PayPal buttons with the same rewards at rimworldgame.com.\nSo far this has been a one-person project. I'm Kickstarting now so I can hire specialists to do music, sound, and art for the game.\nThe AI Storyteller\nI've always thought the best part of games like Dwarf Fortress and The Sims was the stories that come out of them. That's why RimWorld is designed as a story generator. It's not about winning and losing - it's about the drama, tragedy, and comedy that goes on in your colony.\nTo keep things interesting, the game creates events like pirate raids, trader arrivals, and storms. But these events aren't random. RimWorld uses an AI Storyteller (modeled after the AI Director from Left 4 Dead) who analyzes your situation and decides which event she thinks will make the best story. There are several storytellers to choose from:\nCassandra Classic aims to create a rising curve of tension over the course of the game. Early on, the most dangerous thing she'll do is send a psychotic squirrel after you. Later on, bands of scavengers will arrive. In the late game, look forward to combined-arms attacks from mercenaries mixed with lightning storms and crop blights. If you want a traditional tension and difficulty curve, go with Cassandra.\nPhoebe Friendly is for the player who just wants to build and watch a colony grow. She'll occasionally create minor disasters, but nothing that would threaten the existence of the colony. If you want a more relaxing game about growth and success, choose Phoebe.\nRandy Random follows no rules. He may give you some amazing stroke of luck, like a trader selling an advanced weapon for a low price or a group of helpful immigrants, followed by a near-unbeatable pirate attack combined with an electrical fire. If you think losing is fun, you might want to try Randy.\nAnd we're considering other AI Storytellers, too. High population storytellers, starvation storytellers, seasonal storytellers, moody storytellers, and anything the community thinks up are all on the table.\nAn aboveground colony at night.\nA motley crew\nIn RimWorld, your colonists are not professional settlers \u2013 they\u2019re survivors from a crashed passenger liner. They'll be accountants, homemakers, journalists, cooks, nobles, urchins, and soldiers.\nEach character has a background that affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (for recruiting prisoners or negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically-engineered assassin can do nothing but kill \u2013 but he does that very well.\nYou\u2019ll acquire more colonists by taking in refugees, capturing people in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, rescuing them, or taking in migrants.\nOver the course of long games, players develop a motley group of refugees, pirate raiders, purchased slaves, and crashlanded survivors. The diversity of people makes each colony unique.\nYou won't get hundreds of colonists - we want to keep the number small enough that you can know each one individually.\nRaiders burn out some walled-in colonists.\nThe Tactics Engine\nRimWorld uses an engine that I originally developed to power a tactical sim similar to Jagged Alliance 2. This means it has a lot of features designed to make small-team firefights interesting. For example:\nThere's a cover system that models low cover and leaning around corners.\nThere's a really nuanced algorithm for determining and reporting hit chances based on distance, skill, weapon, lighting, angle, and cover.\nWeapons have some pretty deep stats.\nThe AI plans and executes tactical moves like flanking while trying to stay out of the enemy's line of fire. It uses a number of heuristic algorithms to analyze the battlefield and use the space effectively. It works with allies and avoids bunching up.\nI think most base-builder developers wouldn't put this much effort into a tactics engine, but having inherited from that earlier project, RimWorld benefits greatly in unexpected ways.\nBecause of how important cover and positioning are in gunfights, our combat interacts deeply with the colony's layout and structure. This means players have to think about how they want to position their constructions to maximum advantage in future firefights. Combat in general is a lot more interesting than the traditional trading of blows you might expect in a base-building game. And it's possible to build a wide variety of base configurations for maximum tactical advantage against diverse foes.\nRaiders assault from the north. The colonists have fallen back from their frontline sandbag positions. (click to expand).\nThe teaching system\nThis kind of game can be really hard to learn. So we've created an adaptive teaching system that watches your actions to figure out which parts of the game you understand, and teaches the parts you're missing. If you don't understand a control, the game will notice and help you out unobtrusively. If you already know something, the game won't interrupt you.\nRimWorld also uses a notification system to make sure you don't miss anything that needs looking at. If you're low on food, or a colonist is about to go berserk, a message hovers in the corner of the screen informing you of the fact. No more getting annihilated because you missed some little detail. If you get annihilated, it'll be for a totally legitimate reason.\nPsychology\nPeople in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. You can inspect a character's psychology at any time to see what they're feeling and why.\nWhen a colonist becomes too stressed, they may suffer a \"mental break\". Some will give up and wander the colony for a time. Some will leave. And some will, in dwarfish fashion, become psychotic and throw a violent tantrum.\nSheckley the miner thinks about a recent battle while rescuing a wounded friend.\n  The universe\nThe flavor of RimWorld is a mix between hard sci-fi and the Old West. It's a rim world at the edge of the galaxy, far from the civilized core worlds. The planet is vast and mostly empty, and there are no strong civilizing authorities anywhere nearby. You're on your own.\nThe core idea in the RimWorld universe is diversity. In the this setting, humanity is spread across the galaxy, yet lacks any way of traveling or communicating faster than light. Combined with the fact that stellar civilizations regress (due to war or plague) as often as they progress, this means that someone traveling between stars may end up interacting with people at any level of development, from pre-agricultural tribes to transcendent machine gods.\nYour starting colonists in RimWorld are at a technological level in the middle of this span. But you may end up interacting with people at much lower and higher levels, as well as acquiring and using their tools and weapons. In RimWorld, a single fight can involve a bow and arrow, a revolver, a charged-shot pulse rifle, and a near-magical teleportation device.\nA developed underground colony with a large hydroponic grow-op.\nIn its fiction, RimWorld draws a lot from Firefly. This is where it gets its subtle Western vibe - frontier living, an arid environment, sparse law enforcement, and the constant threat of outlaws. We're also heavily inspired by science fiction novels like Dune and Alastair Reynolds' Revelation Space series (which both Alistair Lindsay and I are huge fans of). The Warhammer 40,000 universe also forms part of our inspiration.\nIn terms of game design, the game draws most from the 800-pound gorilla of the simulation genre, Dwarf Fortress. We also take ideas from indie hits like FTL (our semi-random event format) and Prison Architect (its way of presenting a complex world in a comprehensible, interactive way). And, there are many others.\nWe're in the gaming press!\n\u2022RockPaperShotgun: (Space) Colonial Ambition (September 18)\n\u2022 The Jace Hall Show: Former Bioshock Infinite Developer Goes Indie With Space Colonization Sim: RIMWORLD (September 18)\n\u2022 BeefJack: Dwarf Fortress in Space: RimWorld (September 19)\n\u2022 RockPaperShotgun: Outer Limits: RimWorld Lands On Kickstarter (October 4)\n\u2022 WorthPlaying: RimWorld announced, seeks crowd funding (October 4)\nRimWorld's development is arranged into \"modules\". The plan is to work until one module is finished, release it, and then choose the next based on what people want. This way, the game will grow organically according to the feedback of the community, while remaining playable at all times.\nAs a Kickstarter backer, you'll be one of the voices with the most influence over which direction we take the game. Perhaps you'll like some of the modules I'm interested in below. And if you've got an idea for another, please let us know.\nNote that this list of modules isn't a roadmap or a plan. These may not all ever be finished. They're options I'm offering to the community. Which way should we take the game after the Kickstarter?\nProposed Modules\nTynan Sylvester - Design and programming\nI've been making games over ten years. The first were Unreal Tournament mods, followed by my four years at Irrational Games working on BioShock Infinite, followed by the indie projects I've worked on since. I also wrote a game design book called Designing Games and published it with O'Reilly Media. There's more about me at my website, including various articles I've written on game design.\nAlistair Lindsay - Audio hero\nAlistair is perfect for this project. He did audio on games like DEFCON (haunting!), Darwinina (quirky!), and Prison Architect (engaging!), so he knows how to work with this kind of game and he knows how to handle an indie sound project top to bottom. He's been working game audio since 1999 when he started with Rare. \nAlistair doesn't just try to make an effect in a game sound like what it represents. He thinks about how his audio will make players feel on a subliminal level. He's going to be doing magic like adjusting ambience, interface, and game sounds to match the AI Storyteller's desired mood, to make you feel tense or relaxed or excited just as he wishes. I'm almost scared of him.\nThe dude is legit and I'm really happy to have connected with him. As a first sample, Alistair was good enough to do the audio for the RimWorld trailer. I think he did an awesome job of nailing the sci-fi/Western feel.\nTo Be Determined - Art\nWe're still in talks with some artists who are ready to help develop a unique and effective look for the game.\nIs there more info?\nYes. See our development blog, and the forums, where testers have been discussing their play experiences. To keep updated, you can also follow me on Twitter.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe game is getting to the point where I (Tynan Sylvester) can't do everything it needs myself. It needs audio, and it needs art. This means I need to contract people to do these things, which takes money.\nIn addition, there are basic costs to setting up a corporation, software licenses (e.g. Unity costs $1500), and so on.\nIt looks a lot like Prison Architect. What's up with that?\nBlame my (Tynan's) lack of art skill - especially with characters. I made the character art you see in the trailer as a stopgap, and borrowed the Prison Architect style because I'm not a good enough artist to develop a new one. They were never intended to be final. With this Kickstarter, we'll be able to get a real artist who can sit down and develop an original style for RimWorld.\nI've talked with the original Prison Architect artist, Ryan Sumo, and he's fully supportive of RimWorld. We didn't share any art or code with the PA guys.\nWhen will the game be available?\nThe game works now. If you're in the influencer tier, you'll get access to the current pre-alpha as soon as the Kickstarter ends and we work out the payment and download details (which could take a few days after November 1).\nI've run several playtests and verified that real people can pick it up and enjoy it. It is, however, a bit light on content, and there are bugs. I'd like to squash this stuff as fast as possible.\nI think we can have the first more stable and well-rounded public alpha (with audio and art contributions) out in January 2014.\nWhen will it be completely done?\nAfter the public alpha in January 2014, I'll continue development based on what people seem to want. I don't know how long after that the game is finished. Development could continue for a long time, depending on community response. This is really the kind of game that could expand forever. Regardless, everyone who gets the alpha will continue to get updates right up to the final game.\nDRM?\nNope. No DRM.\nPlatforms?\nRimWorld is currently being tested on Windows and Mac. Unity (the technological base for the game) also supports Linux, so we'll be releasing for that too. There may eventually be an iPad version, depending on how the Kickstarter does, but this isn't planned in the next few months.\nHow do we know this isn't vaporware?\nYou should be concerned. Kickstarter projects often don't get finished. But this one will be. Here's how you know:\nThe game already exists, and the testers are already having good experiences with it. We've got a small crew of testers on the Ludeon forums sharing their experiences with the game. Take it from them, not from me.\nI have a history of finishing projects. I wrote a book and got it published with O'Reilly media. I'm a professional with experience at a major studio. I know how to schedule a project and handle design risk.\nI wasn't willing to make this project public until I knew it was on the path to being a real game. That's why I made so many prototypes before settling on this concept. Most game ideas don't work well. But this one does.\nThere are still risks in this project, but they are about individual features, not the project as a whole. Some ideas will fail, and some parts will need to be redesigned. But RimWorld will not become vaporware. We've already got a game here, and it's a good one - we just need your help to make it as great as it can be.\nAre there multiple Z-levels?\nNo. RimWorld isn't really about digging the way Dwarf Fortress is, and there are tons of interesting story things you can do with no Z-levels. We're focusing on the story-generating parts of the game. Z-levels may come eventually, but not soon.\nWill there be multiplayer?\nIt's possible; and if the community asks for it consistently I'll gladly put it in. But it's not immediately on the to-do list and it would be a significant amount of effort to do. For the near future, I want to work a lot more on fleshing out the library of events and the AI Storytellers.\nIs there a community?\nYes! There's tons of good discussion on the Ludeon Forums. You're invited to contribute your ideas as well. Fans have even created a RimWorld subreddit. I maintain a development blog at the Ludeon Studios website.\nFor the creative rewards, what are the constraints?\nTo keep things consistent, there's a whole set of documents about this. Please check the creative rewards guidelines.\nCan I make YouTube videos/interview you/try the game for press purposes?\nProbably. If you're a journalist or a YouTuber who gets at least 1000 views per video, please email me.\nLightning strikes during a rainstorm.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSee the FAQ above: How do we know this isn't vaporware?\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Alpha 13 - Trapped With Your Ex released!", "update_content": "Here\u2019s Alpha 13 \u2013 Trapped With Your Ex!\nTo get your update, you can re-download from the same link as last time.

It's also the world's first  consumer electronic product that uses 3D printing technology to achieve personalization.\n What makes Hex so special:\n1. Piloting made easy: With an extremely user-friendly control app, everyone can enjoy the feeling of being a pilot.\n2. See the world from a different perspective: Put a camera on Hex and take video from the air, in real time.\n3. Personalize your flying experience: You decide what you want your Hex to look like.\n4. Be creative and hack: Hex is completely open source, modify it in any way you like.\n5. No soldering required: Just click the kit to together to create your own personal copter in minutes. \nNew sensors added!\nLearn more: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1387330585/hex-a-copter-that-anyone-can-fly/posts/595702\nPiloting made easy!\n\u2022 Smartphone controlled\nHex is controlled using smartphones and other mobile devices, so complicated remote controls are not required to get it off the ground. The control system we use, RC Touch, has an extremely user-friendly interface and is already available for iOS and Android devices. \n\u2022 Multiple control methods\nHex can be controlled using the gravity sensors in a mobile device. It imitates the movement of the smartphone or a tablet in the air. In addition, traditional throttle, elevator, aileron, rudder control systems can be used to operate your Hex. \n\u2022 Utilizing Bluetooth 4.0 for communication\nHex uses Bluetooth 4.0 since this communication protocol is available in most modern mobile devices. Bluetooth 4.0 provides Hex with efficient long distance communication.\n\u2022 Auto-stabilization\nHex\u2019s flight control system is paired with various sensors help to make flying more safe and steady. These components massively reduce the risk of crashing. The sophisticated electronics in the copter allow it to sense when Hex is not balanced and adjust the motor speeds accordingly.\nSee the world from a different perspective!\n\u2022 Camera compatibility\nA camera can be attached to Hex for aerial photography and videography.\n\u2022 First Person View (FPV)\nWith FPV glasses provided in the Hex Spy Kit, you can experience the thrills and joys of being in the air! A 5.8G Radio telemetry module is used for real time transfer of videos to the FPV glasses.\n\u2022 Real-time Wi-Fi telemetry\nHex also lets you see what the webcam sees on your mobile device in real time. A Wi-Fi communication module is used.\n(The FPV glasses kit has no battery included. The external power port of the glasses can be used for supplying power. The voltage of the external power supply shall be at 8-13V)\nPersonalize your flying experience!\n\u2022 Choosing shells\nHex can be customized in a number of different ways. You choose how you want it to look depending on what you like. We provide many 3D printed shells. All shells are directly mounted on top of the circuit board, and no soldering is required.\n\u2022 Designing personalized shells\nIf you are a designer, you can design your own shells and print them out from Shapeways or a 3D printer at your home or a nearby hackerspace and mount them to your Hex.\nBe creative and hack!\nArduino compatibility\nYou can change Hex's behavior by changing Hex's open source code or hardware. Hex is Arduino compatible which makes it easy to fiddle with it.\nAuto-balancing hacks\nThe autopilot system of Hex allows it to auto-balance itself in mid-air, but if you are creative, the same circuit board can be used to balance other devices such as a two-wheeled robot car, fixed-wing aircrafts, camera gimbals, submarines etc.\nWho We Are\nWe are a team of makers coming from different parts of the world who believe that drones will be a big part of our future.  Our team is made up of designers as well as software and hardware engineers. We have been making and researching drones for the past year and hope this is just the first of many projects related to drone technology. With your support, we hope to develop Hex nanocopters into a very customizable experience.\nRewards\n(This picture shows the current prototypes, however we keep improving the shells so the final design might look a little different.)\nHex specifications\n\u2022 Propellers\n   o Size: 56x8.5 mm\n   o Fits shaft: 1.0 mm\n\u2022 Motors\n   o Diameter: 7.0 mm\n   o Length: 20 mm\n   o Shaft diameter: 1.0 mm\n   o Over 50,000 rotations per minute (rpm)\n\u2022 Flight Control System\n   o Flight control: Microwii Copter\n   o Processor: ATMega32u4\n   o Gyro and Accel: MPU6050\n\u2022 Flight Time: 7 minutes\n\u2022 Communication protocol: Bluetooth 4.0\nStretch Goals\n (We have reached the $500K goal, visit here to check out the details.) \nTimeline\n8/30    Finish optimization of the bluetooth communication module.\n9/15    Launch the beta version of Android controller app.\n9/30    Optimize the assembly of Hex.\n10/15  Further reduce the size of the autopilot and manufacture some for testing purposes.\n10/30  Finish the optimization of gravity-sensor control method and design more 3D shells.\n11/15  Start manufacturing.\n12/1    Ship rewards! \nAcknowledgements\nHAXLR8R\nThanks a lot for your valuable mentorships, suggestions and the occasional (often?) butt-kicking that we deserved.

We participated in HAXLR8R, the world's first hardware accelerator program, earlier this year and got invaluable help from them, and their great mentors and teams.\n\nWe have been living and working in Shenzhen, China, the manufacturing capital of the world, for the last several months. During this time, we have visited many manufacturing factories and realized the advantages of digital fabrication over the traditional methods. We have been using 3D printers, laser cutters and CNC machines for rapid manufacturing and prototyping, and using digital fabrication has helped us a great deal in iterating our designs based on user feedback. We have also established relationships with Shapeways, so users can get their personalized product easily.\n\nAlthough we have been in touch with several shipping companies that provide services across the globe, the physical delivery and shipping is always a slight risk due to unpredictable circumstances.

At the end of the project, you will be able to choose your favorites.\nREWARDS LISTS:\nVIDEO PERSONALIZATION - 3D rotating cube:650 $\nIf you send us videos and pictures about you we will made a personalized video for you.\nVIDEO PERSONALIZATION:  1.700 $\nincluding one HOLHO FULL PYRAMID  (smartphone or tablet) and the HOLHO APP.\nWe can make a 30\" video editing your Company logo, supers and pictures using the motion graphic animation. Accordingly to your brief and our proposal we will produce a video tailored for you and we will adapt it to the device you choose. (OUR PARTNER: http://www.moviefarm.it)\nVIDEO PERSONALIZATION : 5.000 $\nincluding one HOLHO FULL PYRAMID  (smartphone or tablet) and the HOLHO APP.\nYou are already a HOLHO owner and you are pre-ordering a 30\" video made editing your Company logo, supers and pictures using the motion graphic animation and the 3D (your product basic animation). Accordingly to your brief and our proposal we will produce a video tailored for you and we will adapt it to the device you choose.  (OUR PARTNER: http://www.moviefarm.it)\nWhy are we asking for 58,000 dollars?\nTo make Holho, we have to produce at least 3 different specific steel molds that are very expensive. Also, the Perspex that we use for our Pyramid is a very expensive raw material that we have to order in advance to be able to produce the product. Perspex needs to be ordered in different colors in pre-set quantities. Last but not least, we need to prepare a variety of cool videos to play on your devices. Therefore we have to invest in creating the videos , editing them in 3D and Motion Graphic. Any funds that remain will be invested in further product research and development.\nOUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULE:\nWhen the campaign will be successfully over we will immediately proceed to produce the molds.\nMolds production takes 4 weeks.\nAt the same time the raw material will be ordered and the application of the filter on the plexiglass faces will start.\nWhen molds are ready  the production is ready to begin and it takes 3 to 5 days to develop the product.\nTherefore, the delivery we have estimated on the site is accurate and guaranteed by the end of November 2013, and December 20th.\nFor higher volume of requests we will adjust the production to satisfy all the bakers giving notice and  keeping them informed.\n\nSHIPPING: please take a look on the rewards.\nWHO WE ARE...\nEnrica moved to the US six years ago.

Ultimately, John knew at some point in his life he was going to have to wear a ring, and he wanted the ring to be practical, but personal. We started prototyping on a 3D printer using Tinkercad to create renders.\nSome of the prototypes developed over the development period\nMetal and RFID was the biggest problem we faced when developing the ring. Naturally metal absorbs the RFID signal from the antenna which means that induction fails and so does the ability to communicate with the ring. After several months of research and development John realised how to solve this problem by using an intermediate layer between the Ring and the inlay. The next problem was to source a thin enough intermediate layer.\nFollowing a number of trips to China later we had sourced a 13mm intermediate layer and put together our first prototype. Five prototype rings were ordered and distributed to fellow tech enthusiasts, and that was when we discovered issues with the style, fitting and security. A few months later the style issue was addressed by allowing the NFC Ring owners to customize their own style and also by providing a set choice of colours. \nA few months after that the problem of security was resolved by adding an additional inlay opposite the original inlay. This solves the security issue by creating an interference area stopping any powerful antennas being able to complete a full induction process and by using different hand gestures for different actions (closed fist for public, open hand for private).\nComfortable fitting took a long time and a lot of money to solve. The issue with the inlays was that the thinnest inlay on the market at the time of initial development was 12mm. This meant the ring was 13mm wide. This was incredibly uncomfortable as the ring is designed to be worn permanently such as a wedding band. Five very expensive prototypes later we had developed our own 6mm NFC Inlay, we decided on the NTAG203 chip because it was actually an NFC chip unlike some of the cheaper alternatives being used in the market. \nSo now we stand, ring in hand, production lined up, what we need now is a community of backers to start using the ring and spread the word!\nSoftware\nAll of our software is open source, developed in Apache Cordova.  As a side project we also contributed to various Cordova modules hopefully making future Cordova projects easier to implement.  John wrote about his development experience should you be interested.  All of our repos are publicly visible on Github and we're really keen to get early adopters as involved as possible to get things moving!\nThe future\nCreating an open source platform will enable third parties to adopt the NFC Ring and consider making their devices NFC ready. Our end goal is to produce a ring that will make your day to day life better. We envisage being able to use your ring as a pedometer and to monitor your heart rate, we have big plans for the future and we would like you to be part of our journey.\n3D print your own\nWe believe in sharing as much information as possible so we also publish useful links to documentation and other reference points on our Github organization site. This includes 3D models so you can customise and 3D print your own ring at home!\nWhat we're raising funds for\nMass producing the NFC inlays at such a small size and that can be read whilst surrounded by metal is expensive. Our MOQ (Minimum Order Quantity) is 10,000 units. Because we have been working on this secretly for 12 months our prototyping is complete. We know what does and doesn't work so now we just need funds for the mass production run.\nHow we're making the ring and getting it to you\nNaturally when developing any new product the largest time is taken up in R&D and connecting suppliers/manufacturers and other stakeholders. So we approached the development of this company as we would approach the development of a web app.  This meant we introduced high availability and scalability right from the start. It feels good to know that should one supplier be unable to grow as our demand increases, we have a second that can easily help facilitate our needs.  \nSo what is the process?\nOnce our kickstarter is successful you will receive an email.  This email will include a link to a page where you will be asked to take a photo of your hand holding a magnetic strip, like on a credit card. Don't worry, we don't keep these images or use them for payment.  We do this so we can measure the size of the finger you want your ring to be on.  If you don't have a webcam you can always use another means to find your ring finger size and enter it manually.\nYou will also be asked any product-specific questions such as what colour inlays you would like and if you have chosen a custom inlay design we will ask you to email your design through.  Details will be provided based on the size of your ring.\nDuring the delay between Kickstarter finalizing, assuming we hit our target, we will place the order with our RFID supplier and we will run our first MOQ inlay run of 100k Units.  The lead time on these is a few weeks so during that period we will begin manufacturing inlay covers, rings and RFID reflective material.  We have a  30 day credit account with this supplier so we can place the order early on to avoid delays on funding clearance.\nThree weeks after Kickstarter finalises, we should have the inlays, inlay covers and reflective material ready to start manufacturing the first run of rings.  Our minimum run will be 1000 units and will take roughly two weeks to complete.  All of our factories and production is in China, they have already done practise shipping runs between each other to ensure they can handle the distribution requirements of our project.\nOur Kickstarter funds should clear 4 weeks after the campaign finishes, at this point depending on how much we clear we will either manage completion from China or from the UK. \nWe are working with a ring factory that has a proven track record at delivering Kickstarter projects, this factory is responsible for taking orders, manufacturing the ring shape, cutting the covers and reflective material to size, inserting the components into the ring and sealing with the coating. The factory will also be responsible for any custom printing and engraving requested. \nWe're using a distribution provider CritSuccess, in the US to serve the Americans. CritSuccess has a track record at delivering on Kickstarter projects similar to this one. We are handling Europe distribution from the UK and Asia distribution from China.\nDepending on scale we expect it will take up to 4 weeks for the rings to ship from China to the US.  We have spoken to our importers who have assured us there are no issue importing this technology.\nSo assuming four weeks for production, four weeks for shipping and then a further one week for handling you should have your ring in late October, ready in time to wrap it up and get it ready for a stocking :)\nKnown Limitations\nThe normal NFC Ring does not work with The BlackBerry Z10 this phone you will need an alpha size ring.  This is due to the way that the S4 and Z10 NFC chip-set and where RIM/Samsung place their antenna in their battery making it impossible for those phones to read small NFC Inlays consistently.\nUPDATE: SAMSUNG ISSUE SOLVED!  I'd still recommend having an Alpha and a Normal as it isn't great.  BlackBerry is unsolvable, yay RIM.....\nUPDATE PT II: We're working with Broadcom to try to come to a final resolution on this, it's a complex problem due to the number of factors that can affect performance.\nEach phone has a sweet spot where the NFC Ring will work, find it and place your sweet spot sticker here.\nThe Nexus 7 Tablet has a known bug with initializing the camera for scanning QR Codes, when you try to use a QR code it will crash the app.  You can still create actions locally though.\nThe Alpha Male Ring is really only for chaps with big fingers, because of it's large size normal size hands will look dwarven or hobbit like, further side affects include taking the longest possible route everywhere and having deranged company on your travels.\nWe ship all NFC Inlays unlocked, so it may be that at some point we decide to send an update to your app that sets them to locked open, this is to stop someone writing a malicious NDEF record to your ring and locking it in that state.\nHat Tip\nVarious people have helped us along the way especially:\nAmal at dangerousthings.com specializes in NFC and RFID implants.  We worked together to develop the NFC Technology and sourcing various partners and components.  He has a range of Implants and while we don't prefer implants you might so check his site out.  What that man has done to his body in the name of this project is beyond all of our efforts.\nThe Apache Cordova Team.  The Cordova team amazing at supporting us in implementing various plugins and bug-fixing issues and also their work on Cordova 3 has been fantastic.\nDon C at Chariot Solutions - Don Wrote an amazing cordova/phonegap NFC plugin.  He's also a good guy, good guy Don is good guy.\nOur Investors, who you know, funded everything.  John and Matt, John also built the project from nothing.\nOur Press release author, Gareth Halfacree who turned our technical brain farts into something coherent.\nOur heroes at First10 especially Chris L and Rich who have both been with this project for months and have spent endless hours doing our 3D renders, product pictures, marketing video, banner adverts..  Just everything really..  Amazing effort.\nAnd last but not least, you.  By supporting this project you are making your own future be just a little bit more cool.\nStretch Goals\nWe are very excited to share our stretch goals!\n\u00a330,000 - Multiple rings/inlay <-- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a332000 - Sweet Spot Sticker with every ring <-- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a335,000 - Choice of Steel or Titanium Ring for all models. <-- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a340,000 - We provide An Android NFC Phone Unlock App, saving you 3$ on the Play Store! <-- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a350,000 - Investigate Windows Phone App <-- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a360,000 - Provide 1/2 size rings IE 7.5, 8.5, 9.5.... <-- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a370,000 - Contribute source code & Lobby Android community for NFC unlock in core <-- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a380,000 - Create option of stealth bomber black ring (all black)  <-- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a3100,000 - 5 color inlay options (white, black, black carbon fiber, silver, wood). <- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a3110,000 - Windows Phone App <- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a3125,000 - Nickel free Titanium Ring Option <- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a3150,000 - Different color options for the ring metal (IE Black/Blue) <-- ACHIEVED!\n\u00a3200,000 - Ten color inlay options, chose from 10 different color sets.\n\u00a3225,000 - Transparent Inlay cover option, see the electronics inside the ring!\n\u00a3250,000 - The Collection: \u00a350 gets you 3 Rings ( Alpha, Normal, Stealth Bomber), 3x Inlays (one of each size), a chain and a box.\n\u00a3275,000 - All Kickstarter Limited Edition Ring backers receive a free Alpha Ring.\n\u00a3300,000 - ALL BACKERS RECEIVE 50% REDUCTION ON THEIR FIRST ORDER AT STORE.NFCRING.COM", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur factory has experience in delivering rings across the US, UK and China however we face some obstacles delivering to other countries.

We've made it as simple as possible, and with your support we can make it available for everyone.\nWith our Smart Herb Garden you can grow basil, thyme or other herbs without worrying whether the plants have enough water, nutrients or light. Just plug it into the wall and add water, the smart device takes care of everything else.\nEach Smart Herb Garden comes with cartridges for basil, thyme and lemon balm, plus mini tomato and salad rocket as stretch goals (see below). Refill cartridges will be available for chili pepper, mini tomato, peppermint, spinach, salad rocket and various kinds of lettuce. Just between us, we're also working on strawberries.\nSelection of refills available for the Smart Herb Garden\nWhat's So Smart About The Smart Herb Garden\nWith more than 3 years of R&D behind the Smart Herb Garden, the backbone of the technology is the growth medium, a nanotech material engineered to supply plant roots with the right amount of oxygen, water and nutrients at any time.\nOur technology is probably the easiest indoor garden solution to use on the market, and there's less noise involved than other solutions (we're biased, of course)\nWe've also built a cutting edge lighting solution. The light spectrum in traditional LED lights makes plants look unnatural on the one hand and can be harmful for children's eyes on the other. We've worked with the worlds leading LED technologists to invent a natural-looking light system that gives plants enough light to grow while only requiring 6 watts of energy. This keeps the electricity bill for running the Smart Herb Garden  a whole year to around 4-5 dollars\nAnd yes, there are several patents pending for our technology.\nWhat others say\n\"In practice, you simply insert the supplied cartridges and fill the reservoir with water. Then power the thing on and \u2014 bingo \u2014 in a matter of weeks you should see green shoots of awesomeness.\"\n\"Although some gardeners were born to grow beautiful plants with a little water and a lot of sun, others need a boost. Click and Grow provides that.\"\n\"A nice solution for a tight space beset with bad lighting and an owner without the slightest farmer-esque tendencies.\"\n\"Having a stock of growing herbs doesn't have to mean digging around in the garden. In fact, it doesn't have to even mean having a garden to dig around in (at least in the traditional sense). The Click & Grow Smart Herb Garden moves the outdoors indoors.\"\n\"The new Smart Herb Garden will help take the guesswork out of growing plants indoors\"\nThe team. The one holding the Smart Herb Garden prototype is our founder Mattias.\nWe've Done It Before\nIt took two years for our founder, Mattias Lepp, to get from the first 3D drawings to the first batch of manufactured smart gardens and we've sold more than 50,000 of them to date. Though the technology and challenges are slightly different for the Smart Herb Garden, we've learned a lot when it comes to manufacturing, logistics, customer support and other areas of  making it easy to grow plants at home. We will most definitely face some challenges, and we don't want to toot our own horn too much, but we're very likely to ship the Smart Herb Garden on time. (Fingers crossed.)\nMore About the Rewards\nThe classic Smart Herb Garden is white, but we also have a couple of color options here on Kickstarter. If you choose the $49 backing level you can choose between Kiwi Green, Soft Pink and Orange lids for your smart garden. And if people like the colorful options more, we might pick one of them as our standard option in the future.\nOur colors in addition to Classic White: Kiwi Green, Soft Pink and Orange.\nWe also have a Black Kickstarter Special Edition smart garden. See preview.\nFinally, for the super-backers that are willing to back this project with $1000 of their hard-earned cash, there's the hand made Interactive Next Gen Smart Herb Garden. Stroke or hug the plants to get feedback whether they have enough water, or just say \"hi\" back to you. Here's a bit of a video demo:\nStretch goals\nMore backers means bigger quantities and less per unit cost. We'd like to share these gains with our Kickstarter backers.\n$200,000 - every backer gets an additional Mini Tomato cartridge. Unlocked!\n$300,000 - every backer gets an additional Salad Rocket cartridge (in addition to the Mini Tomato). Unlocked!\n$450,000 - every backer gets an additional Chili Pepper cartridge (in addition to Mini Tomato and Salad Rocket). Unlocked!\n$500,000 - upgrade to Mint. While we can't add more refills to pledge levels, we can upgrade one of the plants. Tests are going well for mint which many backers have inquired about, and so we can upgrade one of the current plants to peppermint. Based on what we know today lemon balm has the least fans, but we would put this up for a vote. Unlocked!\n$600,000 - a mobile app. We've made growing plants at home as simple as possible, but they still need some looking after. The Click & Grow app gives you tips on growing plants, sends you important reminders and lets you send photos of your herbs to our Gardener for feedback. It would be available for iPhone and Android.\n$700,000 - upgrade to Strawberry. This is the ultimate stretch goal, because neither reaching that level nor having a strawberry refill ready by September is easy. If we reach this level we'll upgrade one of the six plants to Strawberry, decided by a vote among our backers. Our gardener is ready, we hope that you are, too.\nPlease note that the retail Smart Herb Garden will still come with basil, thyme and lemon balm. These are just additional plant cartridges we want to share with our wonderful Kickstarter backers at and above the EARLY BIRD level. The value of these refills is $5-15 each.\nWe Need Your Support!\nWe have the technology and several working prototypes. While our first product has been successful, we're still a small company. We're looking for Kickstarter support to fund creating the plastic moulds for the Smart Herb Garden (this alone costs around $50,000) and to pay manufacturing engineers/consultants that will help us get production-ready.\nWe've exceed our funding goal of $75,000 and we will use the rest of the money we are raising on Kickstarter to cover the costs of getting the first batch manufactured.\nWho We Are Building This For\nWe've built the Smart Herb Garden for busy city people that like to cook. People who don't have a garden (just between us, we envy people with gardens). People that travel a lot. People that have killed a plant or two in the past by not watering them. People that are geeky enough to want an hi-tech flowerpot.\nMeasurements and specs\nSize: 11.8'' length x 4.7'' width x 11.4'' max height \nOr as they say in Europe: 30 cm length x 12 cm width x 29 cm max height \nWeight: approximately 850 g\nBuilt-in light contains 2 LEDs, 3W each. \nElectricity plug compatible in US, continental Europe, the UK and most other countries with standardized plugs.\nProject plan\nGlobal Availability\nWe guarantee fast hassle-free delivery in the US and European Union. \nSome countries are very strict when it comes to dealing with live plants and seeds, even harmless ones like ours. We therefore can't guarantee a smooth delivery to rest of the World. In countries like Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Brazil you may have to pay customs tax when you pick up your Smart Herb Garden, or may have to insert seeds yourself. We will refund backers in countries we can't deliver to.\nHigh-resolution images\nDownload from this Dropbox folder", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is lots that can go wrong in getting a prototype production-ready. The good news is we've done it once before, and that our core technology is solid. The things we worry about:\n\n1. Finalizing the plastic moulds may take more time than we're currently planning. We'll get there eventually but this may mean a 2-6 week delay to shipping deadlines.\n\n2. We haven't finalized testing of the optimal packaging for the growth medium. We're currently weighing 2 options, and this can delay the project by up to 4 weeks.\n\n3. Building a new seeding machine is like building a reasonably complex robot. We've done this before but no-one has ever built a machine just like that, so this can delay the project by 1-4 weeks.\n\n4. If our coffee machine breaks down, all bets are off and shipping will take place in 2018 at the earliest.

Everyone who has pledged for a Premium Thermodo can choose a Green Kickstarter Edition Thermodo instead. Everyone who has pledged for a Regular Thermodo, can choose a Red Thermodo instead of the Black or White one. Get both by pledging for one of the Thermodo Sets (See Reward Tiers).\nGot more questions? See if they haven't been answered in the FAQ\nFollow the Wrap party directly from Copenhagen on this Live Stream.\nWhat is Thermodo?\nThermodo is a sleek little thermometer for your mobile devices, accurate and expertly built hardware that you can have with you everywhere. Thermodo is designed and produced by Robocat. Support for iPhone, iPod touch, iPad and Android. Now with Thermodo companion app with SDK for iOS and Android. Windows Phone support possible once stretch goal is reached.\nHow does Thermodo work?\nThermodo consists of a passive temperature sensor built into a standard 4 pole audio jack enclosed by a sturdy housing. This allows your mobile device to read Thermodo's temperature straight from the audio input. Thermodo sends an audio signal through the temperature sensor. This sensor will then attenuate the signal amplitude depending on the actual temperature. This attenuation can now be detected on the microphone input and through software we calculate the corresponding temperature. Easy peasy! We call this the Thermodo Principle\u2122. Simply plug Thermodo into your device and start the companion app or any other Thermodo enabled apps of your choice. The temperature reading takes place instantly. Thermodo is powered by your device. No external power is required, it can even run in the background while you do important stuff.\nWhere can I use Thermodo?\nYou can measure the temperature indoors as well as outdoors. Track the temperature and see how it rises after you turned on the radiator or check how the temperature drops during a summer night. No network connection required. Thermodo comes with a neat little keyring so you'll always have it with you.\nRewards\nStretch Goals!\nWe blasted right through the 35K base goal. We now have the factory floor and all the minimum requirements to get production underway. With a growing budget, there's a few other things we can shoot for. Help us reach these goals!\nApps and developers\nWe are building a free Thermodo companion app for iOS and Android, but Thermodo already works with our own apps, Thermo and Haze. So once you get your Thermodo, there should be plenty of things to do with it. However, we won't stop there. We're making an open source software developer kit (SDK) available to anyone who wants to build their own Thermodo integration into their products. The sky is the limit here, Mac apps? PC apps? Linux apps? Other iOS, Android and Windows Phone apps? Arduino or Raspberry Pi support? Social temperature? Runkeeper + Temperature? We'll see.\niOS apps Thermodo will work with\nAndroid apps Thermodo will work with\nWhy would I want to track my temperature?\nIt's incredible how much we rely on forecasts and so called \"local\" temperatures - the truth is that temperature values available online or through apps comes from weather stations that can easily be miles away. Nothing beats taking the measurement yourself right where you are. A small personal weather station with you at all times, how cool is that?!\nThe Black and White Thermodos\nThe Story\nIn the winter of 2011 we launched a tiny free thermometer app. We called it Thermo. It was one of those projects we build because we thought it would be fun and different. It wasn't a complex app, it was just a nice simple approach to weather in a great design. Apparently we weren't the only ones who thought this was a neat idea. To this day we've had more than 2 million downloads and hundreds of thousands of happy users around the globe using it every day. Unfortunately not everybody seemed to like it. Occasionally we would get 1-star reviews like this one:\nThe thermometer analogy we used in the app was obviously displaying the outside temperature as the iPhone can't possibly measure the immediate temperature around you\u2026 But it got us thinking\u2026 What if it could? Now we want to turn bad app reviews into a great new product.\nWhy we need you\nWe are software developers and we know a lot about what there is to know about making digital products, but as we've learned over the past few months: building hardware is costly. We've done as much work as possible and spend all of our salaries on making the prototypes, but to get to the next stage of production we'll need molds, components and factory time. Here're some of the specific things your funds will go towards.\nSensors, Resistors and PCB's - the components that make up the brain of Thermodo.\nInjection Molds - to manufacture the awesome housing of Thermodo.\nThermal conductive filling - makes your Thermodo more responsive.\nTooling, manufacturing and assembly - We've been rather picky with how Thermodo looks and feels, so the actual production is a highly specialized series of steps.\nApp development - honestly, most of your funds won't go here, we are working weekends and pouring time into the project to get both the iOS companion app and the SDK ready, but we'll occasionally need a cup or coffee or a pizza.\nShipping and packaging - getting your new Thermodos to you, wherever you are.\nMachines, building other machines!\n\nWhere we are \nWe're currently at our 3rd revision prototype of Thermodo and we finally feel that the product is ready to enter into the next stage of production. This is why we're launching the kickstarter now. We've done as much work as possible up until this point - now it's time to see if our passion for exact ultra-local temperature measurements and shiny gadgets is shared by others. Below you'll see a nice walkthrough of the current 3D model and a few upclose shots of Thermodo on our favorite devices. This thing is infinitely more real than when we soldered the first raw prototypes.\n\nThermodo on an iPhone running the current version of the companion app\nThermodo on an iPad running Thermo\n\nWhats next?\nHere's a short roadmap outlining the plans for the next few months if the funding succeeds.\nMeet the team\nRobocat is a Danish software studio. We\u2019ve been building unique digital products out of cozy Copenhagen for the last 3 years. Each of our adventures is guided by a strong sense of craftsmanship. We strive for pixel perfection; whether we\u2019re building a utility or service we always try to imbue our products with a sense of wonder. The team consists of (from left to right) Kristian, Michael, Willi & Ulrik teamed up by our engineer Marcus (below). We all have a seemingly unhealthy interest in the weather and want to create something that makes you go 'wow'.\n\nWay of the future\nWe all carry tiny pocket computers around which are helping us to understand and interact with the environment around us, through quantified data. This is something we think is infinitely cool. We're hoping that Thermodo and all the experiences we're making is just the first step into this new playing field.\nLimitations\nThermodo is only designed to measure the temperature of your environment with your mobile device. Hence, its operating range is only specified within the limits of common consumer electronics. During the testing phase, we specified its range from -20\u00b0 C to +50\u00b0 C (-5\u00ba F to 120\u00ba F). For comparison, iPhone 5's operating temperature is 0\u00b0 to 35\u00b0 C (32\u00b0 to 95\u00b0 F). Thermodo may not be used as a body thermometer, nor for measurements of fluids.\nOutage font by Dave Whitley (davewhitley.com).

Writing software for the Apple App Store always contains the risk of being rejected in the first place. In such a case our software needs another technical or visual iteration and the release might be delayed.\n\n\u2022 Quality Control. We are quite picky when it comes to the mechanical quality of our products. Even though we came in contact with several other prototypes of things manufactured by our supplier and despite the confirmed confidence of our partners who worked with the manufacturer several times before, there is always the risk that we are not 100% satisfied with result of the 0-series. In such a case an additional iteration and improvement of the manufacturing process might be necessary. This rather unlikely scenario would delay the manufacturing process.\n\n\u2022 Electrical Tests: To make sure the Thermodos work as they are supposed to, we are going to test each unit electrically. If we receive orders up to 1500 pieces, we will test the devices ourself in our HQ before shipping them to the customer. For orders higher than 1500 pieces we will need some extra hands in order to be capable of performing the electrical test in time. That would mean we need to set up an electrical test procedure directly at the factory which could lead to delay.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "The Thermodo Journey Ahead", "update_content": "Hi Backers,\nEvery good journey needs a bit of an emotional narration at the end.

Many fantastic and special moments become blurred together after a while and it feels like life just rushes by, too fast for us to grasp.\nWe at Memoto wanted to find a way to relive more of our lives in the future - and enjoy the present as it happens.\nThe functional prototype\nThe Memoto camera comes in three different colors: Arctic White, Graphite Grey and Memoto Orange\nThe Functional Prototype\nHardware devices consists of mechanics, electronics and firmware. The mechanics are often overlooked, the 3D printed prototypes in our Kickstarter video has taken two engineers and one industrial designer over four months to finalize. The result is a production-ready construction of a weather protected, very strong and well designed camera casing.\nThe electronics has taken even longer to develop. We have used evaluation kits and break-out boards to put together a complete set of components in order to be able to start development of the firmware. At the same time we have made a circuit board design that fits all the components into a very tiny package.\nWhat does the functional prototype do?\nThe prototype does everything the final camera will do, taking photos and registering GPS position. \nSample photo and gps data from the Memoto prototype camera\nMiniaturizing the electronics\nNot only has miniaturized circuit board been designed by one of Sweden's foremost digital camera engineers who are working on our team, but it is also undergoing careful review and approval from these outside sources:\nThe head of engineering at our Taiwanese manufacturer, Yomura, to make sure it fits into the camera casing without causing any problems during assembly or long term use\nThe engineer that created the Anoto pen, in order to verify our power management and battery life\nThe engineer behind the electronics in the Mutewatch watch, to verify overall build quality and circuit wiring\nThe GPS chip manufacturer, to verify that the GPS will function properly and to compare it with their reference design\nThe GPS antenna manufacturer, to verify our antenna placement in relation to other components and the casing\nThe PCB currently waiting for review and quote from manufacturers.\nThe 8-layer High-Density-Interconnect printed circuit board with laserdrilled blind and buried vias\nWant more details? Here's a word from our engineers: \n\"The Memoto camera is small and uses fine-pitch BGA components with as small as 0.5 mm (0.02\") distance between the pads. This required the use of an 8-layer IPC-2226 Type-II HDI (High Density Interconnect) PCB of 4/4 mil track/space, with filled and capped laser-drilled partial vias of 0.1 mm (0.004\") diameter between the outermost layers as well as buried vias, which are mechanically drilled partial vias between layers inside the PCB. This via technology, including placing vias inside the BGA pads, is required to avoid interfering with routing on the top and bottom component layers and make room for fine-pitch BGA escape. Due to the presence of high-speed USB tracks and antenna signals on the PCB, it also has been impedance controlled which involves analysis of how the electric fields behave in the metal layers relative the other dielectric layers in the PCB.\"\nThe world's smallest wearable camera\nThe Memoto camera is a tiny camera and GPS that you clip on and wear. It\u2019s an entirely new kind of digital camera with no controls. Instead, it automatically takes photos as you go. The Memoto app then seamlessly and effortlessly organizes them for you.\nEasy and effortless\nThe camera has no buttons. (That's right, no buttons.) As long as you wear the camera, it is constantly taking pictures. It takes two, geotagged photos a minute with recorded orientation so that the app can show them upright no matter how you are wearing the camera. And it\u2019s weather protected, so you don\u2019t have to worry about it in inclement weather.\nThe camera and the app work together to give you pictures of every single moment of your life, complete with information on when you took it and where you were. This means that you can revisit any moment of your past.\nThe Memoto lifelogging camera - only 36x36x9 mm\nLong battery life\nThe camera\u2019s batteries won't need to be recharged until after approximately 2 days of use (using default photo frequency of 2 shots per minute). To recharge the camera\u2019s batteries, you connect the camera to your computer; at the same time the photos are automatically uploaded to Memoto\u2019s servers. There are no buttons to press. You just wear the camera, then charge it and wear it again.\nAccess your life through the Memoto app\nWith this many pictures captured and stored every day, we think it's crucial that you can easily browse among the best and most meaningful ones. The app we're building for iPhone and Android organizes the photos to work as a photographic memory even after many years.\nConcept images of the iPhone app. (Photos taken with a iPhone4S). From left: Timeline view with notifications, Map display, Social timeline view\nConcept images of the Android app. Left: Login screen. Right: Moment view in private mode.\nRelive your life like you remember it\nThe way this works is that the photos are organized into groups of \"moments\" on a timeline. On the timeline, you're presented with keyframes (about 30 per day) each representing one moment. You can tap a moment to relive it in a stop-motion like video of all the pictures in that moment.\nThe image analysis and organization is made out of the images\u2019 metadata, such as time, place and light. This enables you to not only browse your life the way you remember it, but to search for specific events of your life: who was it that you met at that party or what did the sunset looked like in Lapland in June? (Fun fact: there is no sunset in Lapland in June).\nThe app organizes all your photos on a timeline, making them easy accessable to search and share.\nYour photos are yours and only you can share them\nThe app comes with features for sharing through the biggest social media services. However, we want to stress that your Memoto pictures will always be private by default. That is, you only share pictures when you deliberately want to share them.\nCutting your storage costs at least in half\nThe Memoto Camera potentially produces a huge amount of bits and bytes. 4 GB data per day amounts to up to 1,5 terabyte per year. Instead of you storing all this on unreliable and expensive hard drives that can get stolen or lost, Memoto offers safe and secure infinite photo storage at a flat monthly fee, which will always be a lot more affordable than hard drives. For Kickstarter backers, the first year of storage is included in the reward!\nTechnical specifications\nCamera\nAutomatic photo capture at customizable frequency (default frequency is once every 30 seconds)\nDouble-tap on the camera case to manually take a photo and bookmark it\n5 megapixel resolution images\nLog of GPS positions and timestamps\nBuilt-in rechargeable battery which lasts up to two days\nLED battery life indicator\n2 full days of constant photographing (4000 pictures) space on memory\nBuilt-in accelerometer ensures that pictures are correctly oriented regardless of how the camera is worn\nMicro-USB port for charging and connecting to computer\nStainless steel clip to connect the camera to your clothes\n36x36x9 millimeters small\nSoftware\nAutomatic uploading of the photos to Memoto's servers by connecting the camera with your computer (Local storage is an option, but doesn't enable use of the Memoto app.)\nEncrypted storage for an indefinite number of photos (1 year subscription)\nEasy access of your photos through smartphone apps and browser\nApps for Android and iPhone\nPrivate and social layer - all pictures are in private mode only, until you choose to share them with your friends\nAll photos are stored and organized for you. None are deleted, but the best one are more visible.\nBrowse through your memories moment by moment. Tap to relive a moment.\nSearch for events in your history. Share with the ones you trust.\nWhy we're doing this\nOur search for the ultimate lifelogging device started with gathering people from all walks of life and asking them about their use of pictures and photographing. We let them try our very early prototypes of the camera and listened to their spontaneous thoughts about it. Then, we grouped their answers according to their expectations and needs:\nMemory - more pictures in order to remember more\n\"I wish I had more pictures to look back on and remember where I've been and with whom.\" - Falko, 34\nRe-experience - reliving moments from one own's and other people's lives\n\"If I had the opportunity to relive a moment I would like to see when my parents were young and a situation not playing out the way they've told me...\" - Marcus, 27\n\"I think the camera would capture from a different perspective and that it wouldn't be a re-experience but a completely new experience.\" - Elias, 26\nSurprise - having pictures that wouldn't have been taken\n\"When coming home from a trip I often find myself with pictures I could just as well have googled me to. But I feel I miss the nice small moments in ordinary life. I'd rather have one picture from that nice alley we passed in Paris, than five pictures of the Eiffel Tower.\" - Ulrika, 25\nPost-it wall from the prototype process\nPresence - avoiding disturbance a magic moment\n\"I rarely take photographs in social situations because it would disrupt the interaction I'm having.\" - Amelie, 25\nLife improvement - using data to observe and change behaviour\n\"Maybe it would be a wake-up call, making me change my routines and develop more as a person\" - Jenny, 38\nPreservation - documenting our children's life\n\"I want the pictures to be saved so me and the kids can look at them later. I think it's important the kids remember everyday things. Stuff that may be lost. I don't want us to just save pictures from ceremonial events.\" - Johan, 47\nControl - knowing the pictures are stored safely\n\"I can see myself using this, as long as I have perfect control\" - Jenny, 38\nConvenience - letting an automatic service managing the pictures\n\"I like the idea to not having to do anything myself and not be sitting with 5000 pictures to manage later\" - Ulrika, 25\nAn early prototype on one of the test persons\nWho we are\nExperienced entrepreneurs\nMemoto was founded by six Swedish serial entrepreneurs in 2012. Martin K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m, formerly founder and CEO of blog search engine Twingly, shaped the concept of the Memoto camera, a wearable camera able to create a continuous life log for the user. For this task he recruited his friend Oskar Kalmaru, founder of an online video provider, as well as Bj\u00f6rn Wes\u00e9n, who was, at the time, a freelancing designer of high-tech electronics.\nTop quality team\n\nTogether, the three recruited some of the best and most talented persons available to complete the founder team. From Sweden's largest online photo diary Dayviews.com came UX and growth expert Sebastian Bj\u00f6rkelid. iOS developer Erik Hampusg\u00e5rd moved over from tech consultancy firm Sogeti and backend developer Simon Pantzare was attracted from lifelogging startup Linkura. During summer of 2012 the team grew quickly and the work with finalizing a beta version of the camera and the service intensified. In October 2012, the team was already up at 14 people.\nParts of the Memoto team\nWhat you get when backing us\nThe reward for us if you would back the Memoto camera would be tremendous. We would be able to see the product we've been working hard on, for almost a year now, finally go into production and hopefully worn on our first user.\nSo giving something back to everyone who help us fulfilling this dream is the least we can do. Thankfully, Kickstarter is a great place for this.\nTo reward every contribution, no matter of size, our first rewards start as low as $1. In those low ends, we include you in our ever-growing lifelogging family and let you be the first to know whenever something new comes out. You can also sponsor the environmental recycling of up to five cameras. And you get to see the lifelogging documentary we're working on before anyone else.\nThe best reward, we think, is of course to get your hands of one of the very first actual Memoto cameras. For the earliest of backers, we different levels of early bird specials where you get the camera before it reaches ordinary market, plus a well-deserved mention in the list of Memoto's Friends at Memoto.com.\nOne of the co-founders, Oskar Kalmaru, wearing the Memoto Orange prototype\nRead all about the rewards on the right of the page. Go ahead - make this happen now!\nProduction Schedule\nThings tend to take more time than you hope, doesn't it? Well, to be honest, we are actually a few months ahead of our initial production schedule at the moment but we do expect things to become trickier along the way. Therefore, we have a pretty conservative schedule laid out for us. Roughly, it looks like this:\nOctober 2012 \u2013 Finalizing design and construction of the Memoto camera\nNovember 2012 \u2013 Start tooling for plastic injection molding, do batches of electronics. \nDecember 2012 \u2013 Product tests, certification and finding fulfillment partner \nJanuary 2013 \u2013 Start production of final version\nFebruary 2013 \u2013 Start shipping the first Memoto cameras to our earliest backers.\nInternational taxes and shipping\nAs long as our products pass the standard quality test for a country or region, we are shipping to the entire world. Shipping is free. And the box we ship is a gift itself, from us to you, with a little surprise in it.\nLegality and safety\nMemoto\u2019s products and services is all about integrity. Everything you create with Memoto is yours - only yours. If you want to share your content with someone else we think you should. But only you decide when to do that. And even when you have shared your content you are still the owner of it.\n\nAll pictures you transfer to Memoto\u2019s cloud service are stored encrypted. The pictures are only visible to you: only you can see them and only you can change them. If you want to share a picture or a moment with someone you trust you have to make an active choice. The software contains no automatic share features, no hidden buttons, no \u201cshare-by-default\u201d. You only share your content when you want to.\nLegally, you may photograph what you want, as long as you don\u2019t obviously infringe someone else\u2019s integrity or violate an official photo ban. If someone asks you not to use your Memoto camera - then please don\u2019t. If someone doesn\u2019t explicitly ask you, but you have reason to believe that the place or the context is inappropriate for photographing - then please don\u2019t.\n\nMemoto\u2019s products and services are made for those of us who like to collect memories and stories about ourselves.\nAnd, last but not least, a big thank you to:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRISKS AND CHALLENGES AS SEEN WHEN LAUNCHING THE KICKSTARTER CAMPAIGN ON OCT. 23 2012. (FOLLOW US ON BLOG.MEMOTO.COM FOR CONTINUOUS UPDATES ON HOW THE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN MET.)\n\nBuilding a new kind of super small digital camera is a complex and time-consuming task. We are humble to the challenge and know there are many pieces that will need to be put together for it to work. One such thing is obviously financial and only with the help from Kickstarter will be able to get to production of the first Memoto Camera.\n\nGetting to the point where we can ship the camera to your door from the point we are at now, involves the following:\n\n1) Getting the design and construction ready for production. All the components must fit together, literally water tight. There is so much to take into regard when finishing this up. Fortunately, we have the construction experience of one of Taiwan's formost plastics manufacturers to rely on, as well as the design experience from our ex-Nokia industrial designer Per Brickstad.\n\n2) Fitting the electronics into such a tiny shell. This is no small feat. We have a functioning prototype with all the components in place. Right now we are finishing the wiring to send the first batch of PCBs to manufacturing. We have two very experienced camera engineers on our team to make this happen.\n\n3) Setting up a logistics and quality assured manufacturing chain. In every step of the production, our manufacturers need to have strict guidelines and tests to sort out the good units from the bad as early as possible. To assist us with this, we are leveraging the knowledge of people that have done this over and over for many projects before.\n\n4) Getting all the pieces of the firmware in place and working without problems. There is a big difference between having a functioning prototype taking photos and gathering GPS data (which we do) and having it function properly under adverse conditions out in the field. Again, our team members have built both hardware and firmware for cameras before, during several years of time.\n\nWe are not shying away from any of these challenges. While we are taking them seriously we are adamant in overcoming any problem. We are committed to getting the Memoto camera into the market and have all the skills needed to do so. With the help from the Kickstarter community we can have the resources to move into production while also completing all of the tasks above!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #72", "update_userinfo": "It's here!

It's a wifi-enabled, energy efficient, multi-colored bulb that you control with your iPhone or Android. LIFX gives you unprecedented control of your lights, reduces your energy costs, lasts up to 25 years and delivers an amazing range of experiences we think you\u2019ll love.\nSets up in Seconds\nLIFX is incredibly easy to set-up. Simply replace your existing bulbs with LIFX smartbulbs, download and install our free app from the App Store or Google Play and you're good to go.\n\nWe Need Your Help!\nWe [Phil Bosua, Andrew Birt, Andy Gelme, John Bosua, Ben Hamey, Dave Evans and Guy King] have designed, redesigned and reimagined LIFX many times during the past six months, pouring countless hours into thinking about the user experience, the technical aspects of the project and how to deliver the world's smartest lightbulb to you at an affordable price point. You can help bring LIFX bulbs to the world by being the very first to own them!\nWhat is LED Lighting?\nLED lighting is the future of home and commercial lighting around the world. LED's have reached a price point and level of consistency where they're now the best alternative to incandescent bulbs for their energy efficiency [they use approx. 1/10th the energy of standard household bulbs].\nThese bulbs will not only bring you a great experience, but are one of the easiest ways to reduce your energy bills and impact on the environment.\nIn addition they're unbelievably long-lasting. Just like standard LED light bulbs, LIFX smartbulbs are rated to 40,000 hour / up to 25 year standards.\nEnvironmentally Friendly\nLIFX is a revolution in home lighting and will allow you to save money and reduce your environmental impact. With up to 20% of homes power consumption coming from lighting, it makes sense to switch to LED technology and even more sense to switch to LIFX LED smartbulbs. But this is just part of the story, LIFX is about the experience.\nWhat can I do with LIFX smartbulbs in my house?\nControl your lights from anywhere\nChoose any brightness for a specific bulb, a room or your whole house\nCreate the colors to match any mood or decor\nGet notifications such as Twitter, Facebook, Texts and more\nReduce your energy consumption and save money\nVisualise your music with animated colors\nMake an impression at your next dinner party \nGet creative with colors and effects \nCreate a night light for your kids\nSecurity mode when you're on holidays \nCreate groups of lights \nRobot dance like it's 1999\nThere's many more things you can do with LiFX smartbulbs in fact we're creating a software developer kit (SDK) and a hacker kit so hackers and developers alike will be able to release more and more apps to do things we haven't even thought of yet.\nThe LIFX App\nThe free LIFX App will be available on the App Store and Google Play and we also have plans for a Windows, Mac and Linux app. If we achieve our goal we'll fast track the development of these apps across each platform.\nThe LIFX app is one of our favorite aspects of the entire project, and we've spent countless hours thinking about how you can interact with your lights. We have mapped out a very smooth configuration UX from the app to the LIFX master bulb. In essence you place your LIFX smartbulb into a light socket, turn the switch on and then launch the app. You will be guided through a process of choosing your home network from a list and then entering your password. The LIFX master bulb will then auto configure itself to your router and all the slave bulbs will auto connect to the master. If you add more slave bulbs down the track  these will also auto connect. Each smartbulb can be controlled individually. eg. they don't just mirror the master bulb.\nRegarding security: LIFX will be as secure as your WiFi network. eg. without the WiFi network password you can't control the smartbulbs.\nWe're aware that while the hardware is the most visible and interesting part of this project our software is the soul.\nWhat do I get?\nLIFX comes as either a single bulb or can be purchased in packs. Each LIFX bulb is ready to install straight away. Simply choose the type of bulb you need (Edison Screw, Bayonet Cap or Downlight) and you're ready. If you ever need to purchase additional bulbs, these all form part of your mesh network, meaning every LIFX you buy can be controlled via the same app without reconfiguring.\nWhat types of smartbulbs are available?\nBayonet cap [B22]\nEdison Screw [E27]\nDownlight [GU10]\nSome backers have recently asked for specific fixture model numbers.\nAfter the project has finished we will be sending out surveys to all KS backers asking which type of the above LIFX smartbulb casing you want. You will be able to mix and match bulbs styles in any combination. We are preparing more details on the above casings and other options that will be available in the next few weeks including dimensions and more. The more pledges we receive the more options will be available. Please direct message us if you have a preference for casing style/type that is not on the above list.\nThe Tech\nLIFX uses a master/slave concept to connect to your home router via 802.11n and then onto all the other LIFX smartbulbs via 802.15.4 mesh network. Each LIFX can connect to all country electricity systems from 110V to 260V. This includes USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Australia and 95% of other countries around the world. \nYour light switch needs to remain on for the smartbulb to be accessible with the LIFX app. However you can use any light switch to turn your smartbulbs on and off like you do with traditional bulbs.\nLIFX uses a mesh network. The standby power usage of each bulb is very small, in fact a AA battery would keep a LIFX smartbulb in standby mode for approximately 1-2 years. [note: The master bulb requires a WiFi connection which uses approximately 2-3 watts. Only 1x master bulb is required in each home/office.]\nThe LIFX prototype uses an RGB phosphorous COB LED lamp which is approx. the equivalent of a 60 watt incandescent bulb or 50 watt halogen downlight. We are looking into all the options on the best type/brand of LED lamp to use in the production model. Getting this right is something we are very passionate about. (real world comparison - actual lumens of LIFX rated at higher levels than 60w incandescent bulbs)\nWe couldn\u2019t have done this without our distributed systems hacker Andy Gelme who is the lead engineer on LIFX. He\u2019s been at the forefront of automation technology for many years creating systems that run on top of open industry standards.\nWe will be releasing a LIFX Software Development Kit (SDK) that will allow mobile App developers and home automation hackers full control over their LIFX smartbulbs. This includes using a small scripting engine that runs within the LIFX smartbulb. Stay tuned for more details. We can't wait to see what amazing hacks you come up with.\nWe have set up a LIFX Tech blog where you can interact directly with our lead software engineer Andy. Just pop on over to that page if you have some curly questions.\nhttp://tech.lifx.co\nComments\nWe are receiving lots of awesome comments. Keep them coming. One of our favs below.\n\"Out of all Kickstarter projects I have pledged for the LIFX is the first one which, when I showed my wife the intro movie, she immediately said \"Oh, I HOPE you're backing THIS!\" - so, LIFX is as of now officially WifeApproved (tm) in our home, which kind of makes me want to up my pledge to about three dozen lamps.\" - KS LIFX Backer - Nick Sakellariou\nEdits\n- On the back of questions and information we are receiving from the Kickstarter community regarding wattage and lumen output of bulbs in general we have adjusted the video to more accurately reflect this new information. One of the things we love about the Kickstarter process and community is it allows people like us to crowd source funding but more importantly ideas and smarts. We are committed to creating the worlds best smartbulb and will adjust our thinking and approach to achieve this. Given the overwhelming response to our project we are also now planning to hire the best darned LED experts we can find!! Thanks again for your support - we're glad we can share this journey with you.\n- Removed IPV6 from the main info page. Our aim is to use IPV6 but we prefer not to guarantee this until our development matures over the next few months.\nThe Internet of Things\nWe love the internet of things, home automation and the overall concept of the smart home but we also understand for most people it is a large chasm to jump. This understanding has been one of the guiding forces in the design of the LIFX smartbulb - to start with one commonly used household item and make it smart, easy to use and accessible to everyone.\nManufacturing \nLIFX Smartbulbs have been designed and prototyped in Melbourne, Australia and San Francisco, USA and we plan to manufacture via a trusted partner with operations in based in Melbourne and Shenzhen. We realise that whilst we're reinventing the lightbulb this doesn't mean we have to reinvent the manufacturing process. We are using as many standard LED lighting components as possible. These components have undergone rigid testing and stood the test of time. We are also very excited to create our own LIFX customised computer board \"the brains\" of this project. Also fully featured FREE apps will be available on the App Store\u00ae and Google Play\u00ae designed by Bonobo Labs.\nOur Vision\n\"LIFX answers a need that is well and truly overdue. Everyone in the world needs light bulbs. Existing light bulbs are based on an archaic technology that threatens our environment. Light bulbs consume approximately 20% of electricity in homes around the world. They need to be more efficient, smarter and last longer. In the twenty-first century, people need lighting that matches the \"smart culture\" and eco aware sensibilities of our day.\"\nPhil Bosua - Inventor of the LIFX smartbulb", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "mini update - correct shipping addresses", "update_content": "It's been a pretty exciting couple of weeks at the LIFX office.

We know not everyone can kick in, but if you believe in the SmartThings vision, please \"Like\" this Kickstarter page, Tweet about us, Pin us, and email all your friends. While you're at it, visit SmartThings on Facebook and \"Like\" us there too! :)\nDonate your brain to science. Every day our team, spouses, partners, and friends come up with interesting, fun, helpful (and occasionally bizarre) new ways to apply SmartThings and SmartApps. We want everyone in the community to share their ideas. Just go to the Comments section and tell us how you envision making your life smarter.\nDEVELOPERS: HACK THE PHYSICAL WORLD\nWe want to free physical devices from the iron grip of the few who understand the ins and outs of firmware. That's why SmartThings will be a completely open platform. Our core mission for SmartApps is to enable developers to unleash their creativity in the real world just as easily as they have been able to on the web and mobile devices.\nThere are two paths to creating new SmartApps. Basic, and Advanced.\nAt the Basic level, you can generate new SmartApps using a web based interface with full access to existing triggers and available actions within the SmartThings cloud.\nAt the Advanced level, we are creating and exposing an SDK for the physical world of non-smart devices \u2014 enabling them to plug into the digital one and become smart.\nWe give your front door an API. We give your bed an API. We give your toilet an API... your imagination is the only limit.\nWe are working hard to make sure that our APIs are both straightforward and secure. You can use your preferred development language and tools to do amazing things with the physical graph that SmartThings is bringing online.\nWe are ready to integrate with all of your favorite web services.\nThe uses are endless, so don\u2019t be shy. Let\u2019s work together to make the physical world smarter.\nA SPECIAL NOTE FOR MAKERS\nWe\u2019ve got dozens of ideas to share for how to make our lives smarter, but we're also eager to hear yours. Tell us about them in the Comments section.\nBut, if you\u2019re handy with a soldering iron, know that a breadboard isn\u2019t just for cutting Rye, can casually slip Arduino into daily conversation, and are ready to hack your own physical world, we\u2019re ready to support you.  For you makers and open hardware buffs, we\u2019ve got:\nSmartThings ThingModule - add cloud intelligence to any device\nSmartThings ThingShield and Sketch for Arduino - make your existing project smarter\nSmartThings Software Development Kit (SDK) - develop SmartThings-friendly software\nCloud Platform API - integrate your device or app directly with SmartThings\nMobile App Extension Template - embed controls for your project in the SmartThings mobile app\nTell us about your project and we\u2019ll help you bring it to the world.\nPROJECT TIMELINE\nWe currently have working prototypes of the key hardware and software components of the SmartThings Packs that you are backing as part of this Kickstarter project, including the hub, end-devices, maker tools, cloud platform, and mobile app.\nHere is our timeline for putting SmartThings into your hands:\nSEPTEMBER \nFinal stage of design and certification process for SmartThings Hub, Packs, and Maker tools\nOCTOBER\nCertification completed for SmartThings Packs\nInjection molding and final packaging design\nNOVEMBER\nVolume manufacturing of SmartThings Packs (Hubs and Things)\nDECEMBER\nDistribution - Kickstarter backers get their SmartThings Packs \nSDK ready for Developers and Makers\nSmartThings Mobile App available including SmartApps\nMEET THE FOUNDERS\nThe SmartThings founders share a vision: A product experience that is beautiful, functional, fast and revolutionary. We can\u2019t wait to get SmartThings into your hands. Reach out to us in the Comments section if you want to speak with any of us directly.\nAlex Hawkinson\nAndrew Brooks\nBen Edwards\nJames Stolp\nJeff Hagins\nJesse O\u2019Neill-Oine\nScott Vlaminck\nHISTORY AND EVOLUTION\nThere were two major \u201caha moments\u201d that inspired us to develop SmartThings.\nLike most innovation, SmartThings started with a flooded basement. During a power outage, the pipes at Alex\u2019s cabin froze and burst, flooding the basement. In looking for options to get notified about temperature drops and flooding, it became clear that available solutions required a separate Internet connection. Even if the cabin had one, it would have shut off in the power outage.\nSo the concept of \u2018it just works\u2019 for SmartThings was born. We built a platform that easily connects everyday things to the Internet. Our vision is to include always-on cellular connectivity in every SmartThings Hub, so you just take it out of the box, plug it in, and it\u2019s connected. Even better, when you buy new devices, what we call Things, from the ThingStore, they\u2019ll be pre-assigned to your SmartThings Hub. Plug them in or turn them on, they show up in the app, and you\u2019re immediately in control.\nOur real inspiration came when we realized how intelligent everything in our lives could become through the power of computing in the cloud - SmartApps were born. Installing applications into your real life should be as easy as it is on your phone. SmartApps let you combine schedules, events, notifications, information from the Internet and many sensors and devices to create useful solutions that make life easier and more fun.\nTHANK YOU!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #41", "update_userinfo": "Update 41: SmartThings + __________ = Even Smarter Homes", "update_content": "SmartThings Blog Launched\nWe've created a resource that helps to explain who we are, what we're doing, and why it's important.

Based on the need to interact with devices and poll devices, there are scenarios where we can exceed that limitation. This is core functionality, so we\u2019re evaluating either firmware modifications to dynamically address and throttle the polling and radio, or fixed strategies to reduce our polling frequency based on device type and other variables.

Check out SmartThings here. ***\nNew Video: Ubi & SmartThings\nUbi - Always on. Always ready to help.\nUbi is a voice-activated computer that plugs into a wall outlet. You talk to the Ubi and it talks back. It directly connects to the Internet through wifi.\n\"Look ma, no hands!\"\nWe believe people want to do things when they're at home - they clean, they fold laundry, they cook, they eat, they spend time with loved ones. These are all things that (for the most part) take up use of our arms and hands. When we're at home, we'd rather use our limbs for other activities than typing, scrolling, or swiping.\nUbi is short for ubiquitous computer because it's always on, always listening, always ready to help. It can scribe, listen, analyze. Ubi will either talk back to you the information you seek or indicate information through multi-color lights. \nUbi listens to its environment and senses it through sound, temperature, light, pressure, and humidity. It can record this information or use it to trigger events and communication.  \nWhat can it do? \nUbi can be used for potentially hundreds of applications. The applications we plan to ship with the Ubi are:\nVoice-enabled Internet search \nSpeakerphone \nIndicator light (light changing based on events, e.g. weather, stock, email) \nHome speaker system with sound piping \nVirtual assistant (audio calendar, feed reader, podcast etc) \nVoice memos \nAlarm clock \nIntercom system \nBaby monitor \nNoise pollution monitor \nControlling the climate of your home perfectly (through web enabled thermostats like Nest)\nA Helping Hand\nWe see a huge potential for Ubi to assist those who have visual, hearing, or mobility impairments. With its indicator lights and talk-to-activate functionality, Ubi is super simple to setup and use. We want the Ubi to make it easier for our parents and loved ones to stay connected with us and the world. \nYour Kickstarter Contribution \nWe're serious about making this technology of our dreams easily available to everyone. Your Kickstarter contribution is going to allow us to get safety approval (FCC and CE) so that it can be used everywhere. It will also help driving down the cost of making the Ubi so that everyone can afford at least one.  In a nutshell, your contribution will:\nAllow us to meet regulatory approval\nGet our first production run in place (tooling, machining, and chip printing - we are working with local firms who are very talented)\nAllow us to complete the initial apps we're going to deliver with the Ubi\nRewards\nEach Ubi reward above the $1 level comes with one Ubi unit that has wifi and a slew of other functionality. It also includes the Ubi web, iPhone and Android app and access to the Ubi portal to monitor and setup the Ubi remotely. You'll also get early access to the API.  \nUbi is available in arctic white or midnight black. Please specify which is your preference when you back the project.\n$1 - Access to backer-only updates and early offers when product is launched    \n$149 - Early backers - 1 Ubi (limited to first 100)\n$189 - Single Ubi \n$349 - Two Ubis \n$479 - Three-pack of Ubis \n$649 - Five-pack of Ubis\nNEW! - $1249 - The Inner Sanctum - The Ubi 10-pack and much more\nHow it works \nUbi plugs into a wall outlet and accesses the Internet through a wifi connection. It has a microphone and speakers and listens for commands. Saying \"Ubi\" wakes up the Ubi for receiving verbal commands. You can then instruct the Ubi to do your bidding. Ubi will receive plain language commands. Ubi communicates back to you through speech or by using lights.\nOnboard the Ubi are sensors to monitor your environment: \n\nTemperature\nHumidity\nAir pressure\nAmbient light\nThis data can be stored online or used to trigger alerts to your mobile device or email. \nThe Ubi runs Android with a powerful processor to perform voice recognition and also has the ability to connect to other devices. You can plug in speakers, USB drives, or connect through Bluetooth directly to your iPhone or Android device. For developers, you can also communicate with potentially thousands of devices (through RF, wifi, or Bluetooth) and we're making the device open so peripherals and other applications can be used with it. \nTechnical Specs on the Ubi \nAndroid 4.1 Jelly Bean \n800 MHz ARM Cortex-A8 Processor\n1 GB RAM \n802.11 b/n/g Wifi Enabled (WEP, WPA, and WPA2 encryption)\nHi fidelity speakers and omni-directional microphone \nUSB 2.0 with 5 V power supply \nBluetooth 4.0 \nTemperature, humidity, and air pressure sensors \nAmbient light sensor \nRF Transceiver Module \nPlugs into a standard NA 110 V, 15A power outlet (world versions to be forth-coming)  UPDATE: NA two-prong plug, but 100-240 VAC, 50-60 Hz support! UPDATE #2: worldwide plug support available!\nDimensions (approximate): 4.0\" x 4.0\" x 1.1\"\nWhere We're At \nWe've been working for over ten months on the concept, design, and prototyping of the Ubi and we're now at a point where we're ready to bring it to the Kickstarter community. We've also built an early working prototype and have been refining the design to make it more compact and easier to use. We've been in contact with manufacturers and suppliers and have spec'ed out the costs for bringing the Ubi to market. Ubi is currently slated to work in English with North American voltages. We hope to expand this to other regions and languages. \nWe're working with local and overseas suppliers for sourcing the Ubi's electronics and plan on completing the machining, assembly, testing and certification of the Ubi in the Toronto area. We've also worked with certification authorities for pricing of safety and communication testing of the Ubi and inspection will be completed at the final point of assembly.\nOur team is experienced in working on dozens of projects for engineering research institutions. All of our team members have engineering backgrounds and have delivered on real engineering projects in the past.\nSample Data from the Ubi \nBelow is an example of some of the data that will be available from the Ubi as it monitors different aspects of its surrounding environment. The Ubi can constantly monitor your home to provide triggers or feedback. \n    Special Thanks and More\nThanks to all of our backers for helping us get this exciting project off the ground! We'd also like to thank the other Kickstarter projects that have inspired us like Twine, t\u014dd and Pebble.   \nA HUGE thanks goes to our extremely talented friend, Joe Sarafian, of RapidParts.ca for his help in creating our Ubi prototype. \nA special thanks also goes out to El Cantador for allowing us to use their music in our Kickstarter video.

In the last year, I've enjoyed my GoPro camera, but the mounting positions could be better. I was frustrated with shaky or hard to watch video caused from rapid head movements. The view from my chest or atop my helmet lacked perspective. I figured with a third person view it would capture more action taking place around me. I'd looked high and low for a better solution, but couldn't find anything at stores or on the web, so I made a commitment to create one myself.\nSome of you may be thinking \"I could make one of these\". The retail parts in this VuBackPole will run you about $190 + $30 in shipping, not including your time and effort. All you need do to verify is search the web for prices on carbon fiber tubing, aluminum snow shovels and RAM Mounts. Let me bring the cost down for you by manufacturing in bulk.\nPrototype\nAll action videos in my project were made with my prototype. After 12 months and 6 prototypes later, I'm ready to manufacture a design that meets my requirements for ease of use, quality of video and safety. It's lightweight aluminum, durable and works with GoPro, Contour and nearly any other action camera. If you are a professional or just shoot action footage for fun, I have the solution to superior quality viewing and enjoyment for you and your viewers.\nYou could buy parts of this product: high quality collapsible snow shovel $65, GoPole $60, GoPro Grab Bag Mounts $37, for a total of $162. And still, no third person perspective.\nThere's a reason third person shooter video games are so popular.\nThird Person Perspective\nIf you enjoy playing with this perspective, why not make your GoPro videos the same. Let your viewers feel like they're standing right behind you and part of the action. It's funny to watch, they'll start moving around like they're watching 3D.\nManufacturing\nThis product will be assembled in the USA. Some parts, like the RAM mount are made in the USA, Seattle WA, and others will be manufactured overseas. I'm still working with US manufactures to get the shovel spade and carbon fiber tube built here. If I can negotiate the costs down to be competitive with overseas quotes, I will. My desire is to make this as much a US based product as possible.\nLet's do this together and make this a successful project that our friends and family can all enjoy for years to come in our views.\nThanks in advance for making this project a reality.\n//Rodger Dean\\\\\nYouTube Channel\nhttp://VuVantage.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Rodger Dean\n3 created \u00b7 26 backed\nI enjoy being in the Alaska backcountry riding snowmobiles, ATV's, fishing, and enjoy anything outdoors.

Here comes\u2026\nL8, the Smart light.\nL8 is a battery powered mini squared lamp with a multicolor 64 Led matrix on one side and a multicolor super bright Led on the other and several useful sensors, that connects via bluetooth to your smartphone to notify you by light images or animations of just about anything that happens on the Internet: Twitter and Facebook messages, e-mails, game results, outside  temperature\u2026. in other words, If exists... it can shine in L8. \nL8 SmartLight Functionalities\nClick on the image\n\n\n\n\nBeing connected with your Smartphone means that L8 alerts you as soon as you receive messages and incoming calls, and it functions as an alarm clock.\nSensors:\nAdditionally, the L8 includes some sensors:\nProximity \nTemperature\nLuminosity\nThe L8 also informs you of what\u2019s happening in your surrounding WORLD and shares it with everyone else. \nYou can find out the exact temperature in any room of your house; know if someone has entered in; or have your L8 light up when there\u2019s very little surrounding light. \nFrom a friendly mobile application, you\u2019ll choose the uses but you\u2019ll also be able to create your owns since the programming code is open so that anyone can modify or improve it to fit their needs.\nAnd all of this is stress-free since the information goes directly from your computer or Smartphone, no matter where you are.\nWhat really is L8?\nL8 is much more than a simple notifier...\nIt\u2019s light:\nChoose the colour of your LED lights, create a unique ambiance by controlling both, tone and intensity, which combined with the super LED (very powerful) light at the back of the device, it will create a light-decor effect you won\u2019t believe. Or if you prefer, you can also project animated series of lights (for a party, for example). You just have to choose among the wide gallery or design your own series of lights!\nIt\u2019s Voice:\nNo noise; talk through light\u2026 Communicate with those around you by letting them know what mood you are in.. feeling blue?, your team colours\u2026. you name it.\n\nIt\u2019s Multicontrol:\nThanks to its applications and its interface, you can take control of several L8s simultaneously or transfer yours to be controlled by others\u2026. think of a party, for example ;)\nIt\u2019s image:\nYou decide what image you want to put on your L8. Lots of designs are available in the gallery, download it from the internet, or be creative and design your own!\nIt\u2019s social:\n\nThanks to its connection to the internet through bluetooth, you can post and share your L8 image icons through social networks and see your contacts\u2019s images too.\n\nIt\u2019s Portable:\n\nL8\u2019s low weight and small size makes it easy to take with you on the go (comparable in size to a cassette tape) and best of all, its wireless\u2026\nIt\u2019s different:\n\nBear in mind that this is the first light Smart device, and this opens up endless ways of using it: GPS Guide, bicycle light signal, portable lamp\u2026. these are some of the possibilities, but perhaps the best ones are yet to be discovered...\n\nIt\u2019s open:\nThe programming SDK code is open for anyone to develop and to add new applications, features or accessories to the L8's experience. Together, we can do it better.\nHow does it work?\nL8 is comprised mainly of a Bluetooth chip and proximity, temperature and light sensors, connected with a 64 RGB LED Matrix on one side and a Super RGB LED on the other.\nIt has a long lasting lithium battery that gives up to nine uninterrupted hours of use and can be recharged easily through a normal USB port.\nWith the \u201cL8 Controller\u201d application (available soon for Android, iPhones/iPads and computers), you can control your L8 and program its functions to your liking. You can also set rules based on \u201cIf / then /else\" filosofy, in which you choose the moment to communicate something (like a Twitter message, for example) and you assign it a particular luminous signal on your L8.\nThanks to its built in sensors and its Bluetooth connection (enabling it to inherit the ones from your smartphone: voice recognition, microphone, accelerometers...), the possibilities are unlimited!\nhttp://www.l8smartlight.com/how\nRules system: \"If This - then-->Light\"\nSome interesting examples of use\nL8 has a enormous potential and the range of its uses is almost infinite. We want to define it as the \"multipurpose gadget\". For example:\nIf you are a mom and you want to activate a luminous alarm instead of using noise while your baby is peacefully sleeping close to you to avoid awakening him.\nIf you are a deaf person and you want to become aware of everything your smartphone receives. \nIf you want to have your own remote and totally customizable ambi-light behind your TV. Even making it to be activated when you come in to the living room!\nIf you want to have it in your own bathroom and as soon as you wake up and you come in and you turn on the light, automatically L8 is activated telling you whatever information you have set on it; for example: the weather outside for today, if the traffic is ok, if you are allergic and you want to know if the pollen count forecast in air is high and therefore you should use antihistaminique\u2026\nIf you want to place it in your porch, garden, to be used as a light that changes its light colors or intensity based on the daylight.\nIf you want to enhance or highlight whatever decoration object you have, to provide it with a specific color light that matches with the surrounding style!\nImagine holding a L8 in your back while you are riding in your bike\u2026 it would be the perfect positioning and customizable light! Or even placed in the back of your car to communicates with other cars\u2026 maybe it would be illegal, but sounds well!!\nIf you have in your mind more amazing uses for the L8, we are willing to know about them, please, share them with us and with the rest of our community here: L8 COMMUNITY USES\n&\nTry the Simul8tor and the Anim8tor and create new 8x8 images or animations (8bit style, as shown in a real L8) and share them on Facebook and Twitter!!\nWhere we are and next steps?\nSince we have started with the idea one year ago, we have worked to explore the alternative techniques and tried to imagine all the opportunities of this kind of Smart Thing gadget. We have been working hard to create several different prototypes in the last months, to be sure about the viability of the project. Now we have the L8 version 0.3 and we are very proud of having achieved it. \nBut we still have to keep on working hard to complete such an amazing product as it is!!\nPrototyping evolution:\nFirst prototype, L8 V 0.1 with arduino and colorshield\nL8 V 0.2 with our own design board!\nL8 V 0.3 case design\nL8 V 0.3 !\nENCLOSURE DESIGN \nWe have as a must that your feedback is the core of this project. All the decisions we take must go in the right direction. This direction is what you like. Therefore, we have at this point 2 different designs for the enclosure. So, help us to decide what you prefer:\nL8's RETRO DESIGN:\nL8 Retro Design. Front View\nL8 Retro Design. Rear View\nL8's MODERN DESIGN:\nL8 Retro Design. Front View\nL8 Modern Design. Rear View\nAny feedback comment about what design do you like better will be welcome here:\nLeveraging on our expertise in hardware and software development, we've dedicated over a year creating working prototypes and near-final forms. We are truly excited about getting the L8 into people's hands to see what new uses and application others will find for it. We are convinced that the best ideas are yet to come!\nOur Kickstarter project will fund final refinement of our prototypes and the equipment and parts needed for production. The more funds we raise, the quicker we'll be able to add new features that make the L8 even more powerful and genuine. We have big things planned \u2014 and because it\u2019s programing SDK code and API will be open to everyone to develop anyone will be able to help us improve it.\nYour contributions will help us do:\nFinal enclosure design with its add-ons and production tooling.\nFinal board/electronics design.\nFirst production run (large component order).\nImprove the battery life.\nQA Testings.\nAnd produce at least 1000 L8, but above all, we want your help to make L8 SHINE.

Ringbow transforms touch screen gaming, allows remote control of your operating system, applications, music apps and presentation tools, allows you to operate and answer your phone remotely and turns your device into a multi-user or multi-player platform. \nSince touch screens are controlled with fingers, a finger-worn tool, specifically a ring, is the natural choice for complementing them. Operating Ringbow with your thumb, in conjunction with using a touch device, enables countless new features and a much more efficient user experience. Ringbow multiplies the functionality of your finger together with allowing amazing simultaneous actions providing powerful capabilities and layers of functionality that are simply not available in today\u2019s technologies. \nOperating the ring with your thumb while using your finger to touch a device provides powerful capabilities and layers of functionality that are simply not available in today\u2019s technologies. Ringbow multiplies the functionality of your finger together with allowing amazing simultaneous actions.\nRingbow lets you free your fingers from your device, leaving your hands available to do whatever you feel like doing: eating a sandwich, drinking a beer, high-fiving your buddy or stroking a puppy. Whatever you'd choose to do with your hands!\nRingbow innovates touch devices\u2019 gameplay, offering unique additions to existing mobile games as well as developing new games that couldn\u2019t previously be played on touch devices. Ringbow also makes porting consoles games and PC games to mobile devices easier than ever which can be done without affecting and damaging their great experience.\nRingbow in a nutshell;\n* the world's first touch-screen gaming accessory\n* a comfortable ring that you wear on your finger whilst gaming\n* adds layers of functionality to each touch\n* acts as a mouse/joystick device to use for gaming\n* builds a new platform for existing and new games\nAT&T FOUNDRY & RINGBOW - We collaborated with the AT&T Foundry to explore the potential of Ringbow. Take a look at how they envision the Ringbow device - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFJw1ZXFvB0 \nIt simply works\nUsing Ringbow is extremely easy and staggeringly simple. It is designed to provide natural gaming control, similar to the way we operate our console\u2019s controllers. This allows for an intuitive gaming experience and a sense of tactile feedback which greatly enhances the user experience.\nRingbow works on Android, iOS (coming very soon) and supports any Bluetooth enabled device. It works natively with the operating system and with a large variety of existing applications, although our mission is to provide users with brand new cool features. To do that we've partnered with some leading game developers so that Kickstarter supporters will receive a package of exclusive games with their Ringbow. We also hope that you\u2019ll use our API to enhance your own apps so we can add them to our games and apps directory.\nRingbow offers a D-pad style controller, communicates via Bluetooth and lasts 5 hours per charge. The Ringbow box includes:\n- The Ringbow game-ring accessory device\n- Micro-USB cable for charging\n- Ringbow control panel application for Android & iOS devices\n- Game package (see below) including games that were especially designed to support Ringbow, native control of the operating systems and a list of many games that naturally supports Ringbow and works automatically.\n- Developers kit includes the Ringbow APIs and plug-ins, technical support, creative guidelines and 24 hours assistance from our team.\nWe plan on shipping the product in time for the holiday season.\nThis very first Ringbow model is described as a gaming accessory but it can do much, much more. You can use Ringbow for remote browsing while reading; to correct misspelled emails; to act as a remote control for your TV; to answer phone calls while driving; to transform your tablet into a gaming console for your kids;\nBack us and you'll be among the first to get your hands (or should we say fingers!) on a Ringbow\nFor the last 2 years we have been researching the concept of Ringbow and developing the product. We\u2019ve built a number of working prototypes in a variety of ergonomic designs, conducted an impressive commercial pilot with AT&T and recently completed the final Ringbow design and we are now ready to manufacture it for the masses! Prospective partners, distributers and users have recognized Ringbow's great potential, but in order to take the product to the market we need your help.\nYour support will allow us to establish a production line, manufacture the product and expand our games and applications offering so that Ringbow users will enjoy a new and exclusive experience.\nThe funding goal represents the costs of tooling, plastic molds, product certifications and additional software development.\nKICKSTARTER BACKERS WILL BE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE RINGBOW DEVICES ALL OVER THE WORLD.\nWe hope you find Ringbow a powerful and creative tool and hope that you choose to support it.

All you need to do is plug the Pocket TV into the projector and your presentation can be played from the cloud (like a Dropbox account) or locally from the SD Card.\nWhat can it be used for?\nStreaming video: Imagine being able to watch YouTube on your TV rather than on a small computer screen. Or even your other video subscriptions such as Netflix, Hulu or Amazon Video Services. You can now do that right on your home theater system instead of your tablet or phone. Oh and it\u2019s all displayed in HD with up to 1080p resolution.\nListen to music: The Pocket TV even acts as a streaming device for music so you can play all of the content that\u2019s on your computer or home network drive (NAS). That means you access not only your downloaded music but also your movies, TV shows and even your holiday pictures right on your home entertainment system.\nGaming: Why wait for Angry Birds to come to Xbox360 or PS3 when you can play it on your Pocket TV? Or how about racing and strategy games? Wouldn\u2019t they look better on your TV than on your phone?\nSocial Media: For all you social media addicts who can\u2019t go 15 minutes without checking your Facebook and Twitter feeds we wouldn\u2019t deprive you of that. Trust us, we\u2019re just as hooked as you are!\nNews: Get CNN and BBC on demand. The story you want, when you want it, right on your big screen TV. For those who are less addicted to news you can access all your feeds with Google Currents, Pulse, Flipboard and similar apps.\nWork: Edit documents, read PDFs, review PowerPoint, send and receive emails and even do video conferences.\nGoogle Maps: Tired of squinting at your screen trying to find road directions? Yes we know you won\u2019t be able to take your TV with you on the road, but the satellite imaging is insane on a 50-inch plasma!\nWeb Browsing: And of course you can to that too. Use Dolphin browser, Opera, or even Chrome and sync it with your laptop's browser.\nThousands more apps: The Google Play store is full of apps for all types of users and most of them work on the Pocket TV. Dropbox, Evernote, IMDB, ESPN\u2026 The list is endless. Go exploring and let us know what you like. If there\u2019s a specific function you would like us to develop to better use a popular app let us know and we can work on it.\nRemote Control\nA Standard IR Remote is shipped with every Pocket TV. This remote uses infrared signals just like your TV and gives you the ability to control the Pocket TV using up/down/side arrows and several buttons. You can also program your universal remote to control the Pocket TV if you don\u2019t want to have yet another remote lying around the house.\nAn Air Remote is also available for backers who prefer this option. The Air Remote has a gyroscopic sensor that allows you to control your Pocket TV just by moving it around (like a Wii controler). Move your hand up, down or sideways and the cursor on your screen will follow you. This makes your TV experience a lot more interactive and a whole lot more fun!\nControl it from your smartphone. If you want you can also use your iPhone or Android smartphone to control the Pocket TV. Just download the Google Remote TV app from the Apple App Store or the Google Play Store and your phone will become your remote. We\u2019re also working on our own app for your phone with some very cool features.\nHow does it work?\nThe Pocket TV has a Cortex A9 processor packing 1GHz of power and run Android 4.0 (which works similarly to Apple's iOS for you Apple fans!). It uses the HDMI port for display and can be controlled with either a standard IR remote or the more interactive Air Remote. You can connect it to any standard TV set as long as it has a HDMI port and it will display up to 1080p resolution. It also has a USB port so you can attach an external hard drive, a wireless keyboard and mouse or a video camera for video calls. Oh and did we mention it also has a Micro SD card slot so you can add extra storage?\nOpen Source Software\nThe Pocket TV runs Google's Android which is open source project and we want to build on that with your support. If you're a developer and want to develop Apps, MODs or even ROMs for the Pocket TV, we want to work with you. Drop us a message and we can work together on your idea or project. Who knows, maybe we can even bundle your app into the device for when we start shipping in November. \nHardware Design\nWe\u2019ve tried to think of everything to make your Pocket TV experience as intuitive and fun as possible so we\u2019ve packed as much technology into this tiny device as humanly possible by combining the best hardware and software together. Below are the technical specs.\nNote: Specs have been recenty upgraded to 1GB RAM\nWhat have we done so far?\nWhat you see in the video are actual working units. We've developed several prototypes that we're using for testing and to develop the software on. Our Hardware design is complete and our software is in Beta at the moment but it's very stable so we're very close to finalizing it. \nWhy do we need your help?\nWe need your support at Kickstarter to help us to fund our first production and manufacturing run. That means making thousands of these devices to ship around the world. We also need your help to spread the word about the Pocket TV. You'll be amongst the first to have one so you can tell your friends and the whole world too.\nWhat's Next?\nWe\u2019re now getting ready to start production of the Pocket TV but we need your help to accomplish that. With the support from Kickstarter we'll be able to start  our first manufacturing run and we hope to start shipping them to you by September or October 2012. \nHere is our plan for the next few months:\nJune: Finalize the software development\nJuly-August: 1st production run\nSeptember: assembly, testing and packaging (possibly start shipping)\nOctober: Start shipping\nRewards\nSince we're not in the US like most Kickstarter projects we'll ship all the rewards using FedEx Priority Shipping so that you can get your Pocket TV delivered to your doorstep faster (within 2 business days) and without moving from the comfort of your home. Please bare with us and don't forget to add the FedEx shipping cost to your total pledge. Sorry about that but we\u2019re just trying to speed up delivery to you.\nHere's a list of our Rewards:\nWe have two Early Bird specials for the first 200 backers who support us:\n$99 - Early Bird Special #1: One Pocket TV with standard IR Remotes (Please add $10 FedEx shipping for US & Canada and $15 for FedEx international)\n$119 - Early Bird Special #2: One Pocket TV + One Air Remote (Please add $10 FedEx shipping for US & Canada and $15 for FedEx international)\nWe also have a variety of rewards with different remote control options:\n$110 - One Pocket TV with standard IR Remote (Please add $10 FedEx shipping for US & Canada and $15 for FedEx international)\n$135 - One Pocket TV + One Air Remote (Please add $10 FedEx shipping for US & Canada and $15 for FedEx international)\n$280 - Two Pocket TV + Two Air Remotes (Shipping costs included)\n$650 - Five Pocket TV + Five Air Remotes (Shipping costs included)\n$1,250 - Ten Pocket TV + Ten Air Remotes (Shipping costs included)\nMore About Us\nInfinitec is a young 3-year-old startup.

Turn everyday objects into touchpads and combine them with the internet. It's a simple Invention Kit for Beginners and Experts doing art, engineering, and everything inbetween:\nIt comes ready to use out of the box with everything you see above: MaKey MaKey, Alligator Clips, USB Cable.\nWhat Can I Make?\nThat's up to you! First, load up a computer program or any webpage (yes that's right, you're surfing the internet to invent). \nLet's say you load up a piano. Then, instead of using the computer keyboard buttons to play the piano, you can hook up the MaKey MaKey to something fun, like bananas, and the bananas become your piano keys:  \nOr let's say you Google for an online \"Pacman\" game and draw a joystick with a pencil (yes, an actual ordinary pencil):\nThen you can play Pacman by touching the drawing with your finger.\nOr you could load up facebook or gmail and send a message on a custom-made alphabet soup keyboard:\nHow Does it Work?\nAlligator Clip two objects to the MaKey MaKey board. For example, you and an apple.\nWhen you touch the apple, you make a connection, and MaKey MaKey sends the computer a keyboard message. The computer just thinks MaKey MaKey is a regular keyboard (or mouse). Therefore it works with all programs and webpages, because all programs and webpages take keyboard and mouse input. \nMake + Key = MaKey MaKey! \nWho is MaKey MaKey For?\nArtists, Kids, Educators, Engineers, Designers, Inventors, Makers... Really it is for everyone. Here is an 8-year-old girl in a Maker Space:\nShe invented a \"knife-and-log\" interface for cutting virtual wood in an online game.\nWe ran a workshop in February 2012 with some professors and grad students who specialize in interaction design. One grad student made this beachball game controller:\nAnother grad student made this working pressure sensitive switch by layering Play-Doh under a spring:\nThe workshop took place at Queen's University during a conference.\nWith MaKey MaKey, kids can start inventing right away, and experts can make working prototypes in minutes instead of days.\nWhat materials work with MaKey Makey?\nAny material that can conduct at least a tiny bit of electricity will work (if it doesn't already work, just rub it with bananas, spray it with water, or apply copper tape). Here are some materials people have used in our workshops including Ketchup, Pencil Graphite, Finger Paint, Lemons, etc.:\nOther materials that work great: Plants, Coins, Your Grandma, Silverware, Anything that is Wet, Most Foods, Cats and Dogs, Aluminum Foil, Rain, and hundreds more...\nRequirements?\nMaKey MaKey works with any laptop or computer with a USB port and a recent operating system. How recent? We have tried it with Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Mac OSX.\nWhy Are You Creating MaKey MaKey?\nWe believe that everyone is creative, inventive, and imaginative. We believe that everyone can create the future and change the world. So we have dedicated our lives to making easy-to-use invention kits. We believe that the whole world is a construction kit, if we choose to see it that way.\nWe are inspired by the Maker Movement. We want to help people start to think of themselves as Makers and agents of change. When you have the \"Maker's Mindset,\" you know you can change the world.\nBefore we created MaKey MaKey we worked on other creative tools and invention kits such as Drawdio, Singing Fingers, and Scratch.\nWhy Are you Doing a Kickstarter?\nIf we raise $25,000 then we can do a large first run, which brings the retail cost down significantly, so that we can sell the kit to you for $35 (including shipping). We want this to be accessible to beginners, educators, artists, inventors, engineers, and anyone else regardless of income. \nWe are raising Kickstarter money to fund the first large run of MaKey MaKey kits. That is why most of the rewards are kits themselves. That's what we're spending the money on: manufacturing the kits.\nHave You Prototyped This?\nEverything in the video is real, running on either the first or the second prototype. Two years ago, we created the first prototype for MaKey MaKey, and ran a workshop at the San Francisco Exploratorium where people made \"Drum Pants\" and \"Tweet Tea\":\nThen we built the second prototype from 2011 to 2012, and we tested it with professional interaction designers. It looks like this:\nOur third prototype was just made, and will be tested at the Maker Faire and by 100 beta testers. It looks like this: \nNow we are designing the kit a fourth time. This will be the kit you, our KickStarter supporters, will receive. It will look mostly like the third prototype, with some aesthetic modifications.\nHow Are You Manufacturing the Circuits for the Orders Placed on Kickstarter?\nWe are collaborating with the amazing team at Sparkfun. Sparkfun is the perfect choice for us because they make safe, environmentally responsible (RoHS compliant) circuit boards. They are located in the USA (in Boulder, CO), and they treat their employees fantastically. Workers are paid a generous wage with benefits, can bring their dogs to work, listen to music while they work, etc. That may sound like it should be \"normal\", but in the world of circuit production it is very rare and there are lots of sad working conditions elsewhere. Also, Sparkfun is the world's largest manufacturer of Open Source Hardware, which is critical to MaKey MaKey, an all Open Source Hardware project.\nWe worked closely with Jim Lindblom and others from the Sparkfun team to get the board ready for manufacturing. We\u2019re grateful to have them as our partners in this project. With their help we will be done manufacturing and shipping by the end of August. They have a lot of experience meeting deadlines.\nWhat Does the Back of the Board Look Like?\nThe back of the board has hookups for 6 keyboard keys, and mouse control. It also has the open hardware logo, a link for help getting started, and an area for using the board in Arduino mode.\nWait... Is this thing an Arduino?\nYou could say this board is 2 for the price of 1. MaKey MaKey runs on top of Arduino. You can start using your MaKey MaKey board in \"Arduino mode\" at any time. This would allow you to spin motors, turn on LEDs, or anything else that an Arduino can do. If you want to learn to use Arduino or other electronics, but want to start without any programming or breadboarding, MaKey MaKey is a good starting point. There's no need to understand Arduino in order to use MaKey MaKey.\nSeriously, I Am a Geek, Tell Me All the Krazy Tech Stuff\nMaKey MaKey is a printed circuit board with an ATMega32u4 microcontroller running Arduino Leonardo bootloader. It uses the Human Interface Device (HID) protocol to communicate with your computer, and it can send keypresses, mouse clicks, and mouse movements. For sensing closed switches on the digital input pins, we use high resistance switching to make it so you can close a switch even through materials like your skin, leaves, and play-doh. We use a pull-up resistor of 10-50 mega ohms. This technique attracts noise on the input, so we use a moving window averager to lowpass the noise in software, saving money on hardware filtering. There are six inputs on the front of the board, which can be attached to via alligator clipping, soldering to the pads, or any other method you can think of. There are another 12 inputs on the back, 6 for keyboard keys, and 6 for mouse motion, which you can access with jumpers via the female headers. If you wish to use a different set of keys, or otherwise change the behavior of your MaKey MaKey, you can simply reprogram it using the Arduino environment. By cutting a trace on the back of the board, you can disconnect the large pull-up resistors if you want to, which would be necessary in a small minority of Arduino-style projects. Have more geeky questions? Post them in the comments and we'll answer them. \nOMG This Is Awesome Where Can I Find Out More?\nMaKey MaKey was at Maker Faire in the San Francisco Bay Area on May 19th and May 20th. There were MaKey MaKey giveaways at Maker Faire for teachers, maker space organizers, etc. (limited supplies)\nThe homepage for MaKey MaKey is makeymakey.com\nHere is the Press Page  for photo links etc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "OMG Can You Say Invention Gaming System?

The result: Beer Battle! Check it out:\n\nDo that on your desktop, laptop, or tablet! Thanks to all of our friends and backers!\n_________________________________________\nPlaysurface\nWe have a new mechanical and electronic design approach to bring large-format touch computing and home touch tables within reach of ordinary developers and consumers. Our development of Playsurface started by assembling the best open-source optical touch table plans available, and we intend to create a hackable, multi-use, blazingly fast touch computing platform for gaming, music, browsing, device control, and other applications. The goal is to enable cutting-edge performance at a price point that makes buying a touch table similar to many consumer home computer purchases.\nFeatures\nPlaysurface addresses touch table design from both mechanical and electronic design trajectories, and includes:\nA new, application-specific closed-loop digital image processing module to provide touch detection and tracking functions apart from the gaming/application computer\nAn open-hardware cabinet and surface design developed for cost optimization and flat-pack shipping\nA USB interface standard and driver that reduces implementation of the touch table to the same level as plugging in monitor and mouse peripherals\nOnce the development work is done, we will ship you a complete touch table and all of the open-source driver and demo programs needed to get you going right away. With Playsurface, if you can put together Ikea furniture and plug in a new monitor, you can have an incredible touch table.\nWhere We Are\nTempleman Automation (TA) is a contract engineering company with prior sales of inexpensive touch tables in the educational and research sector. This has involved significant work on hardware and software. \nHowever, to make a really great multi-purpose touch computer two critical pieces are still missing and need Kickstarter support:\nThe touch interface must perform the optical touch tracking without taxing the application processor and with minimum system requirements\nA specialized hardware design is required to match the new electronics architecture and meet all materials, shipping, and home-assembly requirements\nTA has a design to address these issues and wants to make the resulting touch table available to the world as an open-source hardware and software project!\nWhy We Need Funding\nTouch computing has innumerable commercial opportunities. We meet people every day with skills and ideas that should be applied to touch tables.  We are using Kickstarter to generate the start-up funding necessary to create a finished platform to drive application creation. Our Playsurface Kickstarter rewards have low overhead to maintain our low-cost vision, and we hope to sell units commercially after the Kickstarter. \nBut we need both initial orders and funding for tooling costs to create the next generation of touch tables!  \nThanks for any and all help Kickstarters!\nHere is a new movie to show some of the things you can do with Playsurface right out of the box with Windows 7:\nHere is another short movie about playing games on Playsurface:\nHere is another one by popular request showing Playsurface with a few of the Microsoft Touch Pack applications - designed by Microsoft to show off the multitouch capabilities of Windows 7:\nIn response to questions about fiducial tracking with the Playsurface, here is a new video showing two applications we have made:\nHere is another movie showing Playsurface running MapTool to spice up board and roll playing gaming!\nHere is another one showing music editing with a virtual mixer and digital recording system:\nWe have had such a great response from the RPG crowd, we thought we would show a few more tools that work great with Playsurface.

It is a Playsurface 'daddy long legs version' (see pics at playsurface.org!).\nThe goals for this prototype have been to put our new carpentry jigs through their paces, verify new joinery techniques, improve the 'sled', and improve the IR lighting system. We are pleased to report that we have met all these goals. We are still testing to ensure we have optimal intensity and uniformity of the new indirect IR lighting system.

Head over to www.playsurface.org to see some images of our work finalizing the carpentry and design of the Playsurface chassis.\nWe are refining the joinery approach; investigating adding dowels in union with the pocket screws to prevent racking on the large sides. Further, we are building up jigs to ensure that our production build of the kickstarter units will go smoothly. You will see in the pictures that all along this process we are documenting the revisions so all the supporters who opted for plans will get great documentation."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 38, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/472263971/playsurface-the-affordable-multi-touch-computing-t", "project_name": "Playsurface: The Affordable Multi-Touch Computing Table"}}]
