It enables all types of users, from professionals to those brand new to the world of 3D printing, to quickly and easily change tools with almost no down time. XChange is patent pending, designed and manufactured in the USA by PrinterMods.com.\nConnect new tools in a single motion.\nWe designed XChange to be broadly compatible with most popular 3D printers, printer tools and accessories, while maintaining the smallest, lightest footprint possible.\nDirect drive tool being removed\nMade by us in the USA, XChange features an anodized aluminum frame, aerospace-grade electrical connectors, and is readily compatible with most existing 3D printers.\nTeachingTech Review - 12-18-20\nXChange incorporates an elegant mechanical and electrical connection that enables rapid tool changes using only a single motion. It is comprised of a master mounting assembly featuring a robust magnetic locking mechanism, and one or more interchangeable tool plates for fast swaps between multiple types of tools. \n\nMagnetic lock mechanism actuation\nIt works by pairing a master assembly, which remains affixed to your machine, with multiple interchangeable tool plates, using a strong magnetic coupling mechanism.\nHigh quality electrical connectors connect the master assembly to your 3D printer's mother board, while each tool assembly has its own PCB with convenient wire-to-board connectors to connect your hot end, fans, extruders, and more.\nDrawing of XChange assembly disengaged.\n\nWhether you want to try out new tools or accessories, experiment with multi-material prints, make use of spare parts, or just maximize uptime for your printers, XChange makes it possible. Compatible with virtually any combination of tools and accessories you can imagine, XChange opens up a world of new possibilities, with the printer you already have.\n\nIt's great for:\nDedicated tool types for certain materials\nChanging colors between or during prints\nFast maintenance - swapping a tool into service eliminates down time\nExperimenting with new tools and accessories, like laser engravers, pen plotters, and more.\nTeaching Tech's printed tool assembly cradle, 12-18-20\nXChange was designed to be compatible with the most popular styles of 3D printers. It's natively compatible with any 3D printer using MGN12H linear rail on the X axis, and 2020 extrusion-based systems like Creality 3D printers using an optional V-slot rail adapter plate.\n\nWorks with factory 8-bit and 32-bit motherboards.\nNatively compatible with MGN12H linear rail systems.\nCompatible with V-slot wheels and 2020 extrusion using V-slot add-on.\nPlanned compatibility with Prusa i3 style machines (will require a printed adapter).\nCompatible with popular ABL using up to 5-wire probes (such as BL Touch).\nXChange is currently intended only for 24V 3D printers.\nCapable of printing high temperature filaments in enclosures.\n Marlin 2.0.X Bugfix compatible - more firmware compatibility coming soon.\nOther motion geometries can be supported with printed adapters, which are expected to be designed and released in early Q2 2021 (sooner if the community would like to contribute to this end).\n\nAuto Bed Leveling\nABL probes like BL Touch, and capacitive and IR sensors will be supported natively by XChange, with a few different configuration options possible to suit a multitude of use cases. \nBL Touch probe being used on XChange with new ABL-capable boards\n\nWith XChange V1.0, ABL is supported on most 8-bit boards, and all 32-bit boards. 8-bit boards running Marlin 2.0.X currently support BL Touch, with our suite of tool changing features enabled. However, these boards are quite limited on available memory, and tool changing / BL Touch does fit, but doesn't leave much room for other features. We're working with skilled firmware developers to further reduce our needed footprint, and will be releasing firmware revisions to all backers for various popular machines.\n\nExploded view of master and tool assemblies\n\n\nElectrical:\nRobust, custom PCBs feature extra-thick traces, corrosion and wear resistant plating, and properly rated connectors from genuine parts suppliers like Samtec, TE Connectivity, Amphenol, On Shore, and others.\nAll PrinterMods products are manufactured to be RoHS-compliant.\n\nMechanical:\n50N magnetic coupling mechanism, perfectly aligned to maintain a strong connection during prints, but releases at the push of a lever\nInjection molded locating and alignment pins affix tool mounts reliably and repeatably.\nHigh-grade, machined aluminum frame, designed for the lightest weight and smallest footprint possible.\nOnly 16mm deep when closed.\nWeighs only 110g completely assembled(!)\nUSA-engineered and manufactured.\nWe faced some early challenges in developing firmware that would be fully functional for 3D printers with 8-bit boards and limited memory (such as the Creality Ender-3). We're working with Marlin firmware developers who have performed careful changes to Marlin bugfix-2.0.x with improved ergonomics and features, and will be releasing specific firmware branches for specific popular machines, as well as documentation for customizing the firmware yourself.\n\nCustomizing Tool Heads\nProgramming settings for different tools is as easy as modifying your slicer G-code, or saving those parameters to the machine's SD card or firmware config files. Configuring new tools is done by defining the following parameters:\nExample toolhead configuration options in G-code.\n\nThe firmware is currently in a very functional state, with many of Marlin\u2019s core functions enabled, with more improvements to be rolled out over time. Some of these changes / features have been rolled into the latest official Marlin bugfix-2.0.x, while we\u2019re further refining things like LCD menu selections for tool changes, tool head settings, etc.\n\nWe\u2019ve chosen Marlin because it\u2019s the firmware that runs most of the world\u2019s 3D printers. That said, we\u2019re interested in adding more firmware options to the mix, and if you want to help develop something, let us know as we\u2019d love to support you (as long as we're not spreading ourselves too thinly).\n\n3D Printer Belt Length Chart\nLast updated on December 18th\nRough timeline of XChange development, 2019 - 2020. Predicted Kickstarter fulfillment window 2021.\n\n\n\nProduction\nInitial production on XChange is due to begin on January 2nd, 2021. Manufacturing certain parts in volume will require fancy new high-volume fixturing, which we'll be taking delivery of after the completion of the campaign. We'll keep our backers updated on our progress as we move forward.\n\nIs XChange open source?\nNot at this stage, but we're working on ways to do so, at least with much of the XChange ecosystem. We will be publishing CAD, firmware, and supporting our backers, makers, hackers and developers in creating useful modifications. Wherever we can offer support to talented and inclined individuals, we intend to do so.\n\nShipping and Fulfillment\nCurrently, we ship internationally via USPS, UPS and DHL. Domestic shipping within the USA for most of our current customers is typically around $7.50 - $8.50 USD, while international rates vary (most shipments cost under $20 for the label, not including VAT and duties).\nBetween now and the time of fulfillment, we'll be working with third party fulfillment and logistics partners in an effort to bring even better value international shipping. As is with our current policies, we will not be marking shipping up at all, and will pass along the lowest possible rates to our customers.\nPrinterMods has been a USA-based manufacturer and retailer of 3D printer parts and upgrades since late 2018, and is made up of a team of talented, highly caffeinated makers, industrial designers and manufacturing specialists.\n\nOver the last two years, we\u2019ve proudly grown to serve tens of thousands of customers in more than 50 countries around the world, and have earned a reputation for our valuable, unique products and unwavering commitment to customer service.\n\nWe have our own manufacturing, production, and fulfillment facilities (located in FL and AL). All of our products are designed, engineered, and fulfilled by us in-house.\n\nDuring the course of development of XChange, we\u2019ve closely collaborated with various industry leaders and experts. We're grateful to all of them for supporting our efforts. \n\nSamtec - Manufacturer of very high quality electrical connectors, trusted in critical industries around the globe. We worked with Samtec to spec the ideal connectors for XChange, and validate our designs.\n\nInsanity Automation - Marlin firmware developers and automation experts. We teamed up with their team to do initial firmware development, and are continuing to work with them to offer ongoing updates to our backers.\n\nSlice Engineering - Makers of some of the finest 3D printer hot ends on the planet. We've collaborated with them to ensure XChange is ready to support their catalog of offerings, and will continue to do so in the future.\n\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter as a platform for a soft launch of XChange prior to a full-fledged consumer launch. By using Kickstarter, we can control the exact number of XChange units we\u2019re manufacturing, without over-committing ourselves. It also provides an efficient platform through which we can interact directly with our backer community, and help empower you to do amazing things with XChange.\n\nOur backers should expect communications from us on pertinent manufacturing, production and fulfillment updates along the way. We ask that backers be willing to give us constructive feedback when using XChange, and together help us further refine and improve it for everyone to enjoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019ve already addressed a number of challenges during the lengthy development of XChange, and we\u2019ve generally spared no expense to ensure we\u2019re making the highest quality, safest, most manufacturable and functional version of XChange that we can.\n\n#1 - Manufacturing\nThis is a BIG one, and proves to be a problem for many starry-eyed Kickstarter creators. We\u2019re confident in our ability to produce XChange\u2026 because we are the manufacturer. We have a fully-equipped facility in which we currently produce all of our other CNC-machined parts for existing catalog of products. We\u2019ve created and tested the machine programs, invested in custom tooling, designed high-volume fixturing (we even have backup fixturing)... all in an effort to ensure that we can produce XChange on-time for our Kickstarter backers.\n\n#2 - Packaging\nWe\u2019ve left this for last in our product development process because in addition to requiring us to know the very final form factor of XChange (and included accessories, etc.), our first priority is providing a high quality product. That said, we are actively working with a partner on developing some cool packaging that is not expected to cause any delays with our fulfillment.\n\n#3 - Fulfillment\nOver the two years we\u2019ve been operating PrinterMods, we\u2019ve learned a ton about efficient packing, production, and fulfillment. We foresee no fulfillment-related delays with our pre-established processes, and are well-equipped to course correct in the event of unforeseeable circumstances (we\u2019re looking at you, global pandemics).\n\n#4 - The current state of world affairs...\nWe're all sick of talking about it at this point, but this really is an unusual time in history. Successfully developing a product is hard enough as it is, and it's made all the more challenging with the looming threat of global pandemics, unstable economies, and lockdowns. Even during the XChange development process, we felt the repercussions of these global changes because, much like everyone else, we're at the mercy of some of these realities. Even something as simple as postal carrier shipping delays can impact many aspects of production at once, causing delays. We promise to never use this as a crutch or excuse for not doing our jobs to the very best of our abilities, but do ask for an extra helping of patience and support from our backer community as we navigate these uncharted waters.\n\n#5 - Shipping (carrier) delays\nWhen it comes to actually fulfilling the product, we're pretty great at our jobs. What we're not able to do is ensure that postal carriers (and governments / Customs divisions of numerous countries) do their jobs as well as we do. As experienced as we are with international fulfillment (a significant portion of our existing sales are overseas), it is simply outside of our control. We will be doing what we can between now and the time of fulfillment to create favorable international shipping options, and to offer our customers flexibility in carrier choice and shipping method as is possible. Please, check with your individual governments and carrier of choice to understand what, if any, delays they may be experiencing, and to fully understand your government's laws pertaining to import, VAT, duties, and the like. We will always do our best to assist with this as we are able, but ultimately it is the responsibility of the backer.\n\n#6 - Stretch goals?\nWe are not beginning this campaign with any particular stretch goals in mind. If we do decide to introduce stretch goals (which is unclear at this point), we will focus only on options that do not directly affect the scope of XChange's production. Changes to our core product that do not constitute incremental improvements to XChange, or that would negatively affect our design for manufacture (DFM) will not be put forth. These goals can be pursued separately from the Kickstarter platform, after we deliver on our core promises.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nXChange is designed to last the lifetime of your machine.

Users can paint any 3D model in the app, then convert the model into  a MultiColor 3D model and download that model for MultiColor 3D printing. It works with every Slicer and 3D Printer.  \nThe output from SimplyColor3D 2.0 can be imported into any 3D slicer. It can be used for 3D printing on FDM or sandstone printers, and it can be uploaded to Shapeways or similar 3D printing services.\nSimplyColor3D 2.0 automatically unwraps 3D models. Because of the UV maps, any models painted with SimplyColor3D 2.0 will work with all other graphics applications (i.e. Marmoset, Lightroom, Photoshop, Dimensions, Zbrush, Hexels, Sketchfab, Shapr3D, Keyshot, etc.). The assortment of features in SimplyColor3D 2.0 makes it truly easy to paint any 3d model.\nAbsolute Zero, Painted in SimplyColor3D 2.0, pictured in Marmoset (credit Arcane Wonders)\nMaking MultiColor models is DIFFICULT!\nWith over a MILLION models it's no wonder that most 3D printer users rely on Thingiverse.com for content, but there are less than a thousand MultiColor models on Thingiverse.  As more people are buying MultiColor capable 3D printers the demand for MultiColor models is growing.\nThe normal method to convert a single body 3D model into a MultiColor model is to cut it into different pieces,  using a software program like NetFabb and Meshmixer. Other applications allow the user to paint the model, but they don't work with every slicer and every 3D printer.\nThe only way to solve the problem is to enable easy conversion to MultiColor. That way anyone can make any 3D model a MultiColor model. This requires software for painting and converting existing 3D models.\nSince there are no easy tools that support preparing MultiColor models for 3D printing, we took on this challenge and created SimplyColor3D 2.0  - the world's best integrated solution for painting and converting MultiColor 3D models.  We make MultiColor 3D easier!\n Introducing ...\n\nSimplyColor3D allows anyone, of any skill level, to turn a single-body  3D model into a MultiColor 3D model, for 3D printing in multiple colors easily. All the 3D models that you design, all the models on  thingiverse.com, and all the other online model repositories, can be  colored & split with SimplyColor3D and 3D printed in multiple colors on any 3D  Printer. This enables a level of freedom and customization never before  seen. Every 3D model is now a MultiColor model. Every model can be  colored unlimited times in different colors too. \n\nFor those of you who are familiar with SimplyColor3D 1.0 here is a short list of the upgrades we have included in SimplyColor3D 2.0:\nSplit by color: Output in 3MF or STL\nDirectly download to your computer\nNow supports ALL 3D printers and EVERY slicer.\nFill by region\nGlobal color replace\nIsland color replace\nStamping: Default and custom images\nrevised interface\nFavorite colors palette\nSave work online\nmodel gallery\nPhotoshop style layers\nCustom backgrounds\nTake snapshot\n3D rotation orientation cube\nEasy help requests\nBuilt in tutorial videos\nDo you want to see how to use SimplyColor3D 2.0?  In our Update#6 we show how to use each of the painting tools.\nHere is a little more detail on the user interface:\nWe think it's important that SimplyColor3D adheres the industry  standard way of doing things. That's why we use unwrapped Obj files with  texture map png's. Models that are painted with SimplyColor3D are compatible with leading programs like Blender, Maya, 3DS,  Rhino, and Zbrush.\nSimplyColor3D has a main window where the 3D model is displayed. On the left hand side is the main menu where models can be saved and loaded, and painting features selected.\nMain interface window\nThe Gallery shows rotating snapshots of previously saved painted models. \nGallery\n Custom backgrounds may be loaded, and Screenshots can be exported with a single click of the mouse.\nTake a screenshot\nThe color can be selected by either entering the exact RGB color code or  by picking from a color wheel, or by using a color picker for selecting  a color that is already painted on the model. This way the user can  work with a standard set of colors easily switching between them.  Colors may be saved to the Favorites palette.\nColor selection menu\nThe Fill by region feature divides the model into paintable areas by the edges of the model. Clicking on an area will fill the entire region with the color selected. \nColor pick & Fill by region\nIsland color replace only replaces the color you click on, up to the border of the color which surrounds it. \nIsland color replace\nGlobal color replace, switches one color for another, everywhere it appears in the model. \nGlobal color replace\nStamping, paints an image on the model. Stamp with default images, text, or copy from the model, or you may stamp with any uploaded image.\nStamping\n\nOnce you are happy with the look of your model you can convert it to MultiColor for FDM 3D printing. Simply click the \u201cSPLIT\u201d button and the MultiColor version of the model will download directly to your computer.\nThe model is now ready to be imported into your favorite slicing program, like PrusaSlicer or Simplify3D.\nAlternatively, you can download the OBJ, MTL, and texture PNG file which can be used to print in full color on Sandstone or Material Jetting 3D printers.\nSplit model converts the model to MultiColor for FDM 3D printing\nModels that have been converted for FDM 3D printing now have each color region defined in their file. These regions can be assigned to different color filaments in your slicing program. Below shows the each color section expanded in Windows 10 3D viewer. \nSeparate bodies in 1 file for FDM 3D printing\n\nCovid-19 (thing:4166787): Painted, converted to MultiColor, and 3D printed\nMike Wazowski (Thing:4187763): Painted, converted to MultiColor, and 3D printed\nSimplyColor3D 2.0 is unique among 3D applications. It is the only application that allows automatic conversion to MultiColor. It also has many unique painting tools and other features that make the coloring process fun, simple, and easy. Here are some of the features that set SimplyColor3D 2.0 apart from the competition:\nArcane Wonders is a board game company. They are currently running a Kickstarter campaign for The Freedom Five. Here a few time-lapse videos of their models being painted in SimplyColor3D 2.0, and side-by-side spins of the graphical models beside their material-jetting 3D printed counterparts.

SimplyColor3D makes it go from boring to AMAZING in full color!\nSimplyColor3D is a Cloud application, which means it runs in your  browser and doesn't require any software to be installed on your  computer. It supports all operating systems (Windows, Mac, Linux) and a  wide range of hardware. To run SimplyColor3D your computer must have the  following capabilities:\nOperating system: Windows, Mac, Linux\nBrowsers: 100% Tested with Chrome\nCPU:  3ghz dual core i5\nMemory: 16GB\nOpenGL: Must support at least OpenGL V3.3\nGraphics card: GTX1050 or better\nInternet connection: 10mb/s\nProfessional graphics drawing tablet (Optional)\nThere are 4 pledge levels:\nPricing after the Kickstarter:\nSubscription MSRP: $60/year.\nLifetime unlimited access MSRP: $200.\nIf you pledge during the Kickstarter then you can take advantage of significant savings:\nOPTION ONE: 1 Year Unlimited Access:\nStart: $25 (Save 58%)\nIncrease: +$5 for every 100 backers\nOPTION TWO: 2 Year Unlimited Access: \nstart: $45 ( Save   62%)\nIncrease +$5 for every 100 backers\nOPTION THREE: 3 Year Unlimited Access:\nStart: $60 ( Save   66%)\nIncrease: +5 for every 100 backers\nOPTION FOUR: Lifetime unlimited access:\nStart: $100 (50% Savings)\nIncrease: +5 for every 50 backers\n\nSimplyColor3D will be rolled out to Kickstarter backers in the order  they pledged. The length of time it takes for the backer roll-out will  depend on the number of backers. There will be a period of time where we  will onboard everyone and work with them to ensure that the platform is  stable before it is made available to the public. This will probably  take about 3 months before the general public will be allowed to  subscribe to the service and access SimplyColor3D.\nAfter the current Kickstarter backers are on-boarded then SimplyColor3D 1.0 backers will be phased into SimplyColor3D 2.0. If you want to be moved to the front of the line and get access right away then you could always pledge again to further support the project =D\nWe will continue to further improve SimplyColor3D with the Kickstarter funds we received from this campaign: Which is the exact same thing we did with the funds from the SimplyColor3D 1.0 Kickstarter campaign (plus more money from our own pockets...who knew software development was soooo expensive?....).  We implemented many of the features that we mentioned in this section from the V1 campaign (plus a whole bunch more) like:\nAuto convert STL to the OBJ file format\nDirect download\nImproved freestyle paint brush\nCustom stamps\nFill by region\nHere is a sneak peek into our future development schedule:\nSpeed Optimizations\nThingiverse.com integration direct Import -> paint -> remix\nSketchfab bridge integration\nNew export file type (DAE, WRL, and more)\nModel transformations (i.e. scaling, cutting)\nAdvanced drawing tools (i.e. Lasso, improved fill by region, square brush)\nSection views\nMagnifying glass\nKeyboard bindings from standard applications\nMirror painting\nEnhanced gallery with cloud backup\nSimplyColor3D 2.0 Kickstarter - Release and future development timeline\n\nTachyon, Painted in SimplyColor3D 2.0, pictured in Marmoset (credit Arcane Wonders)\nSimplyColor3D enables everyone to be a graphic design artist.

Slicing profiles are provided for selected materials.\nOpen design\nWe chose to make our products extendable, upgradable, and easy to maintain.\nExcept the food-safe core parts of the extruder, most parts are standard spare parts that can be sourced. This campaign is designed to help us fund the injection molds for the core parts.\n3D Printing lovers are part of a strong community and we hope that more and more makers will experiment and promote food printing thanks to Cakewalk 3d. We\u2019re eager to get feedback and don\u2019t worry we\u2019ll be always here to help!\n\nHi, my name is Marine. I\u2019m a 3D printing executive, a graduated pastry chef, and the creator of Cakewalk 3d. I live in Paris, France.\nI love innovating with food and that's why I started Cakewalk 3d, first as a side project during the spring. It all began when we were all quarantined in France, and I wanted to automate my own pastry techniques. With a mechanical engineer, we worked together remotely, each one testing and improving on its own 3D printer.  We gather our result daily, and we iterated over 3 months.\nOnce I started showing other pastry lovers the desserts I was getting, there was so much interest that I knew it was something I had to share with the whole 3D printing community. I worked and designed new recipes during months (mostly tested and approved by my coworkers!) and searched for the best production methods.\nEven if I always want to 3D print everything, I came to the conclusion that the core parts of the extruder need to be injected. So I worked with an engineering team to select the best providers and design the molds. The campaign is aimed to raise enough money to pay these molds.\nThanks to your support, Cakewalk 3d will be soon in production, and I am really excited to share what we\u2019ve built with the Kickstarter community.\nIf you\u2019d like to see some of the designs and recipes I\u2019ve been getting with Cakewalk 3D, you can find me on Instagram @marine_corebaillais\nMay 2020 : The first designs\nMay 2020 : First 3D printed parts\nMay 2020 : First prototype assembled\nJune 2020 : Corentin's trial on Creality Ender\nJuly 2020 : New version on Marine's Anet 3D printer\nJuly 2020 : Testing new recipes\nPLAY\n\n July 2020 : First tests with chocolate\nAugust 2020 : 3D Printing Chocolate on Thibault's Alfawise\nSeptember 2020: Prototype testing on Alfawise and Anycubic\nSeptember 2020 : Final version, ready for production\nOctober 2020: Burger printing in progress...\n Help us spread the word and receive an extra ingredient in your box !\n\nShare this with friends on Facebook.\n  Share on Instagram.\n  Mention and follow us on Twitter.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nManufacturing:\nAs the old saying goes: good tools for good works.

From this intuition the idea of creating a new concept of handles bar that really helps cyclists in a more ergonomics and innovative way. Our mission is to correct your position ensuring the best ergonomics and safety in a way never experienced before. \nJoin the SPIRGRIPS revolution, change the way you bike for good. \nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nSPIRGRIPS\u00ae + are the result of more than ten years of research. These inner bar grips are developed, tested, and scientifically validated in Switzerland in collaboration with professional cyclists. Numerous prototypes have been tested using the latest 3D printing technologies to validate the ergonomics of the new handle and ensuring its perfect integration on the handlebars available on the market. \nNEW SHIPPING RATES\nWorldwide shipping available!  After the campaign, we will send a survey to all our backers in order to collect the diameter chosen and the shipping details. Shipping will be charged only after the campaign.  It is variable for every country and depends on the number of pledges made for each country, that's why we prefer to not make you pay in advance. We will give you the exact shipping rates and charge you just the right amount! We already can provide accurate estimates and we would do our best to not get rates higher than these.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhere we are now\n\nThe current prototypes, printed with 3D technology, are fully working in all the required features. We have spent the last six years engineering SPIRGRIPS\u00ae and testing new prototypes with athletes from all countries.

That's about 4% larger than the normal size of a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle.\nWe imported the highest-quality puzzle cardboard in the world (1.9mm Eska \"blue\" stock) from the Netherlands and invented some new printing techniques so the pieces snap together and stay snapped\nThese puzzles have been extensively playtested to make the experience as smooth and engaging as possible from the moment you open the box to the moment you place the last piece of the last segment\nWhen you're done with the puzzle, everything can be reset and all of the secret compartments close back up with velcro so you can share the puzzle with a friend or solve it again later.\nNo puzzle dust!!\nPuzzle Art\nMost puzzles start with stock art of some trees or cats or something. We wanted each of our puzzles to make a fantastic, tiny world. And we wanted the art to tell a story as you solve it. So we worked closely with independent artists like Sarah Becan, Boya Sun, and Felicia Chiao to create beautiful one-of-a-kind puzzle images loaded with tiny details, story quirks, and easter eggs.\n\"The Happy Isles\" by Sarah Becan\n\"The Mystic Maze\" by Boya Sun\n\"The Sunny City\" by Felicia Chiao\nCustom Dielines\nTo make the magical ending work right, we had to customize the shape of every single piece in all three puzzles. While we were at it, we also made sure that the individual puzzle-piece shapes highlighted the cool art details instead of cutting them in half.\nJigsaw puzzles start as one big piece of cardboard, and then a specially designed cutting tool called a die comes down like a stamp and slices it into a thousand pieces.\nThe die for the \"Happy Isles\" puzzle\nUsually, the tolerance for that slice is about 3mm. But to pull off the magical ending in our Series One puzzles, we needed a 0.5mm tolerance. Nobody had done that before, so we had to work closely with our puzzle factory create new quality-control and die-cutting techniques to make it happen. Some of the roughly 3,000 blades that make up our dies actually had to be precise to within 0.1mm \u2014 30 times more precise than a regular puzzle. \nAn excerpt from Simon\u2019s briefing for the puzzle factory\n One of the nice side effects of making a more precise die and using super high-quality puzzle cardboard is the pieces click together in a really satisfying way and stay together even if you need to move the puzzle.  \n Magical Surprise \nIt\u2019s always exciting to pick up a new puzzle with an image you like and then open the box and start putting together the corners and edges. But after a while, you get to the part of the puzzle where you need to assemble 400 pieces of blurry sky. And then when the puzzle's about 75% done, that feeling of \u201cwhat am I doing with my time\u201d creeps in. Eventually the last piece finally goes in and the puzzle is over. We\u2019ve always found that part a little anticlimactic.\nSo we came up with a whole new way for a puzzle to end. When you place the last piece of what you thought was the end of the puzzle, you unlock a whole new part of the experience \u2014 a final act that includes both a magical illusion and a completion to the puzzle's narrative. We playtested these puzzles hundreds of times with people all over the world to figure out how to make this special ending as clear and engaging as possible, and we hope you're going to love it.\n\"The Happy Isles\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Mystic Maze\" 1000-piece puzzle\n\"The Sunny City\" 1000-piece puzzle", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're working with our long-time manufacturing partner Ad Magic to deliver these puzzles to you on time.

Currently, solutions for affordable resin printing require either experience or research to get started. Our goal was to make using a resin 3D Printer easy and affordable.\nThe Prism\nThe Prism is the result of thousands of hours of use and development. The Prism removes a number of barriers through a combination of hardware and unique software features, making it approachable for non-super users.\n\nHardware\nWith an easy to remove magnetic bed and a print volume of 120mm x 70mm x 150mm, the Prism is a resin printer with a 2K LCD screen that allows for high resolution prints that look like finished products. Built with an all metal chassis for durability and a dual linear rail motion system for stability, prints can be as fine as 25 micron. The 57 watt parallel LED array drives uniform light distribution across the entire build plate, edge to edge. \nHardware Features\nAuto Leveling\nAuto leveling in its purest form. The leveling system actions at the beginning of every print and when homing the machine. Instead of chasing your tail around leveling and running test prints to make sure the level is right, let the machine take care of that process.\nPLAY\n\nDual Linear Rails - Reliable and repeatable Z movement is essential for high quality printing.\n2K LCD Screen - The 2K LCD screen allows for high quality printing.\nAll Metal - The all metal frame provides a rigid structure for daily operation. Fully enclosed with convenient flip lid.\nParallel LED Array - The 57 Watt Parallel LED Array allows for even light distribution throughout the build area.\nThe 57 Watt Parallel UV Light Array allows for even light distribution throughout the build area\nSoftware\nRegardless of the material, the resin calibration gives a strong start on cure times without guessing. The auto leveling system allows for beginners and experts to just print. On the fly cure time adjustment prevents the need to alter your workflow. Finally, we provide support for all major slicers.\nSoftware Features\nResin Calibration Print\nNot sure what cure time to set for new resin? No problem. Avoid guess and check by using the built-in resin calibration print. This print provides a reasonable ballpark on what cure time to set for the resin being used -- getting you from guessing to printing faster. Just choose the column that shows the best results!\nPLAY\n\nOn-the-fly Cure Time Adjustment\nAvoid nuisance around cure time while you are printing. Being able to adjust the cure time on the fly can save a number of pains like needing to reslice the file just to adjust cure time, or fine tune your cure time for a resin. Don't reslice, just print and adjust.\nPLAY\n\nWiFi Support \nThe Prism has a WebUI that functions as a convenient WiFi based delivery device for sliced files. In addition to delivering files, you are able to: start, stop, pause, edit profiles, and adjust printer settings. \nCurrent WebUI interface. Naturally, feel free to transfer files via Micro SD card if preferred!\nFull Control of Machine Settings \nAnti Aliasing levels (0,2,4,8x), Movement speed, UV Power Intensity\n  Allowing full control over machine settings is useful to power users and casual users alike. Want to cure a layer faster? Increase the power. Want to use a thicker resin? Adjust the Z speed and distance. Want to smooth out that lower resolution model? Enable anti-aliasing. Take advantage of more settings that many printers lock out. \nKeep the advanced settings from ChiTuBox intact, including Anti-Aliasing and Power Management\nSoftware Compatibility\nThe Prism supports all major slicers, and will continue to be updated as the software for SLA printing evolves. We hope that this lets you choose the software YOU like instead of forcing a buggy difficult-to-use slicer with limited features. Currently, it supports files from ChiTuBox, Slic3r, Print Studio, and Creation Workshop.\n\nPrint Gallery\n\n Here is the Prism in action:\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n\nResin:\nIn addition to the Prism, we also offer a line of 3D printer resins. They are made in America and formulated for LCD based resin printers.\nStretch Goals:\n\n\nTimeline and milestones:\nMay 22nd - Beam3d launches Kickstarter campaign\nJune 22nd - Beam3d Kickstarter campaign ends\nJune 28th - Production of units start\nJuly 20th - units are ready to ship and start shipping\n\nThe Beam Team\nThe Beam3D Team is composed of professionals who have been involved in consumer electronics for the majority of our careers. At our core, we are 3D printing guys, each with our own stable of 3D printers. In fact, a number of those printers are pieces that we have either developed or used in professional ventures throughout our careers from homebrew kits, entry level consumer models, and even up to industrial grade machines.\nWe see the need for high quality, low cost resin printers in the community, and we would like to be the ones to deliver on and support that dream.\n  The Iterations\nThe Prism has gone through a number of iterations. Below are some of the different phases that the Prism has gone through.\nOne of our earliest prototypes.\nWe updated to include an LCD screen so that we could provide more control. Before we've updated the Z axis\nTesting the new Z rails:\nPLAY\n\nOne of our old plate designs\n First short run of production:\nPLAY\n\nNew hood design!\nFinished design:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis Kickstarter is really a pre-order.

The assembly has been simplified by replacing the traditional screws and hinges with long-lasting snap-fit, increasing the overall reliability of the umbrella.\nThe handle and the shaft have been designed to take full advantage of the high flexibility of the whole umbrella when it is subjected to wind stress.\nThe canvas, made with a high density micro fiber Pongee 210T fabric, ensures a high degree of water repellency that allows water droplets to quickly slip away and performs an important protective function by shielding 95% of UVA and UVB rays.\nWe compared Pluvi, in terms of Durability and Flexibility, with traditional umbrellas of the same Price Range.\nPLAY\n\nFew components to minimize the chances of failure and all produced by the same injection moulding technology. Our unique technical polymer, used for every single element of the umbrella, has been specifically developed to be easily recovered and reused for the manufacturing of new products.\nPerfectly suitable for a complete cradle-to-cradle system or an alternate version made from zero-impact biodegradable polymers.\nPluvi is an umbrella with a modern look and attractive colors, combining sustainability with Italian style.\nFor those who are looking for something practical and stylish or simply as a useful original gift.\nTraditional Umbrellas are made of many rigid metal parts not suitable to withstand the stress of the wind.  Once broken it\u2019s almost impossible to repair and the recycling of the materials turns out to be difficult and very expensive.\nThe data collected by the International Trade Center states that over 2.5 Million umbrellas per day are imported by the major countries in the world; since the global market is stable, this means that:\nIf we consider that in a traditional umbrella (average weight of 350 grams) there are approximately 280 grams of metal and almost 1 square meter of fabric, this means that:\nLet\u2019s put these numbers in perspective:\nWe have been developing Pluvi over the past 3 years; at present Pluvi is in the pre-series production phase utilizing temporary moulds. This is a truly passionate project for our team and we are here to ask for your support in making it a success.\nWith your help we can shine a light on a fresh design and a new solution and introduce an umbrella that is fully recyclable and can actually improve the environment.\nStretch Goal #1\nStretch Goal #2\nTo see the result of the vote click HERE.\n If you like to support our idea, please leave a feedback on our social pages and spread the word between your friends.\n          ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll of us have backed various projects on Kickstarter and we are very aware of the values that backers bring to the project. \n\nWe have spend countless hours in the preparation of this campaign and we have chosen our suppliers and partners carefully to guarantee an integral, reliable and ethical product.\n\n\nHowever, sometimes forecasts don\u2019t work as initially planned.

He became obsessed with resolving first layer adhesion as this is one of the issues that affects every 3d printer, and then needed to find a way to get prints off the bed easier.   When he made his first prototype and shared on social media nearly everyone wanted one,  and BAM - \nWham Bam was born.\nWham Bam will be making many other products, and always following the same mission:  Making 3D printing Easy, Productive and Fun!\nWham Bam has been through a year of product development, testing, refinement, material engineering, further testing and design. \nFor the last month we have been going through a Beta Test Round with select testers on various machines.  Each beta tester prints for different reasons and with a range of materials.  \nWe have taken their comments and suggestions and improved our product,  we have established production and supply and already created our test samples and prototypes with the same factories who will execute our production orders.\nWe are ready to go! In order to be able to offer competitive pricing on these top of the line materials we need to purchase in mass, we also need to create some simple tooling to cut materials to size and shape and to create our new robust packaging. With the Kickstarter funding we can get this into production in as little as 3 weeks from the goal met date!\nsee what our Beta testers are saying about our system!\nRob R.  \"I honestly stopped using my printer for a while because my prints stuck so well that I'd ruin them or break the glass trying to get them off.

Capable of using a wide range of materials that other companies cannot claim without damaging their magnetic sheet permanently.\"\nCarlos P \"I\u2019m liking how the prints look. Super smooth on the bottom. And I love that it just pops off. No more spatula. My installation experience went pretty smooth\"\nBryan V. \"Man, thats amazing, you saw that was super super easy to remove. And check out that super smooth finish on that first layer, so nice. The prints still stick when they're supposed to and they are super easy to pop off when done. \"\nJohn R.  \"Beta Test for Wham Bam. Great product! Want more plates in the future, and much more reasonably priced than you-know-who. \"\nPatrick L.  \"Wanted to share my experience so far.

Do you feel depressed when your 3D printer stops at where the print is almost finished, you have to spend whole day to print it again? Are you worried if your 3D printer will print a huge objective, which will last more than 24 hours?\nIf your answer is yes, Resumer 3D will release your worries. Resumer 3D, an affordable and magical tiny module, is designed to resume interrupted 3D prints from any printed layer automatically. Resumer 3D is super easy to use; you simply connect it to your 3D printer via USB cable, leave your 3D printer alone and go out for a date. Resumer 3D will monitor and accurately record 3D printing data, as a result, it can resume interrupted prints due to power interruptions, tangled filament, nozzle jam and even intentional interrupts. Resumer 3D will change the way you 3D print and design.  \nHow does it work? \nResumer 3D simulate the way of how 3D printer software works, sending out and receive G-code by USB port. By this way, when your printer is working, Resumer 3D will monitor the status of the 3D printer, record the printing data in real-time. Furthermore, there is a super capacitor built in Resumer 3D, even if the power shuts off unexpectedly, the super capacitor will keep Resumer 3D alive and store your printing information solidly. When you turn on 3D printer, as Resumer 3D has stored all the printed data, it can resume the prints from any printed layer automatically. Resumer 3D makes everything easier.\n At beginning, we posted Resuemer 3D project on hackaday.io, many people are doubt that why Resumer 3D is so compatible as it can work with different 3D printers. Thanks to my team, we have tried our best to insert different USB drivers of different 3D printers; furthermore, as how Repetier-Host and Cura control 3D printer, Resumer 3D use the same way to communicate with 3D printer and control it by G-code command. Following picture is the first version:\n What we can do with Resumer 3D? \n1. Resuming directly from interrupted prints.\nNozzle stops at the middle of the prints \nWhen the printer is working, unexpected things may happen randomly. We will be lucky if the nozzle stops at the middle of prints, when the printer stops unintentionally due to power outrage. At this situation, Resumer 3D will resume the prints flawlessly, the same as it`s printed without stops. \n Nozzle stops at the edge of the prints. \nWhen the printer is working happily, it will be still no worry if the printer is interrupted due to power outrage, however, the nozzle stops at the edge of the prints. Resumer 3D is eligible for resuming the prints as well. \nPLAY\n\nHere is the print, as you can see, the resuming result is pretty good:  \n 2. Resuming interrupted prints from any printed layer. \n As you may already know, sometimes the filament runs out or the filament is broken during the printing, we are absent as well. When we come back, finding that printer is working without filament, big gap between the print and nozzle. What should we do? Print it again? No, with Resumer 3D, we can turn off 3D printer, then turn on it, adjust the Z-axis height of the nozzle, resume the print from specified layer. \nPLAY\n\nWhen you resume prints from any printed layer, adjusting the height to proper position is very key factor if you can get perfect result.  \n 3. Print Multi-color object with Resumer 3D by single extruder. \nHave you ever thought about printing a colorful object with your single extruder 3D printer? However, it is almost impossible or too complicated unless you choose colorful filament or editing G-code. Good news is that you can print multi-color easily with Resumer 3D. You can turn off the printer to change the filament, when it is ready, turn on the printer again, Resumer 3D will resume the interrupted prints, amazing and easy, isn`t it?  \nPLAY\n\n Printing a colorful haummer for Sol is such an easy thing.  \n4. Printing with inserts, Resumer 3D will change the way of 3D designing. \n As more and more engineers are using 3D printer, the field 3D printer applied to expends. It is common for engineer to design parts with inserts, will 3D printer be still eligible for this task? With Resumer 3D, the answer absolutely is \u201cyes\u201d, you can insert any metal parts you want during the printing. What you need to do is turning off the 3D printer, putting inserts into printings.\nPLAY\n\n The following airfoil, we designed for Drone, the carbon wing has inserted printing successfully.  \nFeatures:  \nCompared to other solutions in the market, such as Rasberry +Power monitoring module, high-level main board, Resumer 3D has the following features: \n 1. Affordable and worthy: Just 21 dollars, you do not have to spend hundred dollars to buy a Rasberry Pi and Power monitoring module, you do not have to buy the extra Mainboard either. With 21 dollars, you can save hundreds of filaments.\n2. Easy to use: You simply connect Resumer 3D to your 3D printer via USB cable, leave it alone. No headache of editing G-code, no afraid of technical problems when you choose Rasperry Pi.  \n3. High Compatibility: Currently Resumer 3D is compatible with most of marlin firmware based 3D printer. We have integrated all the USB drivers for 3D printer that we can find in the market to MCU (Miro Controller Unit). The most challenge thing is that different mainboards have different USB drivers, what`s more, part of the mainboards do not have USB drivers, then we have to develop for them. Fortunately, we overcome this obstacle, we are happy to share our product on Kicktstarter.  \n4. Powerful: Resumer 3D can resume your interrupted prints from any printed layer instead of resuming only from where the nozzle stops like other solutions. There are many different reasons blamed for interrupted 3D prints, for example, Tangled filament, Nozzle jam, Power outage, you will find that only resuming from where the printer stops is not good enough. If there is a big gap between the nozzle and the prints, it doesn`t work, you have to spend many hours to print it again. With Resumer 3D, you can adjust the Z axis height to the perfect height, the printer will resume to print as if it never stops.  \nProduct testing   \nThe height resolution of Resumer 3D is 0.2mm.You can resume your interrupted printings successfully with the following two requirements: \n1. The minimal printed height should be 0.2mm\uff1b \n2. The minimal printed time should be 2 minutes. \nResuming printings: \n When are testing Resumer 3D, please wait for at least 10 seconds before you turn on 3D printer after turning it off. Otherwise, you may find that there is NO SD card when you try to resume the printings. \n Suggestion: \nWhen you test Resumer 3D with power outrage module, turn on the printer after turning off it for at least 10 seconds, otherwise the printer may not detect the SD card, as a result, Resumer 3D could not resume the prints. Please do not touch printings and X-axis, Y-axis, Z-axis (Except for moving the extruder.), when you resume the printer, in case of failure printing due to the movement of printings.  \nTechnical Details:\nLength: 69.4mm, Width: 29.5mm, Height: 17mm \nWeight: 28g  \nResolution: 0.2mm   \nResuming Height \u2264 2m  \n   Production TimeLine  \nSpecial thanks: \nResumer 3D Team is an international team, our team members are from United States, China, United Kingdom and Italy. We would like to give the best wishes to Mark Cole from United States from Australia. During this project, his famliy on hard times, Mark Cole`s family got bad flu. However they still do his best to make this project online successfully. They are strong and I believe that they will recover soon. Thank you for everyone, thank you for 3D printer!

Do you enjoy building things yourself? Do you have a project that needs lithium-ion batteries for energy storage?\nWe created a solution just for you! Our 18650 battery connectors make it easy to build your own DIY lithium-ion batteries of any size, voltage, capacity and power level that you need to fit your project! \n18650 cells are one of the most prevalent types of lithium-ion battery cells. They are available from dozens of companies in hundreds of varieties. This makes them an ideal cell for custom battery builders.\n[Journalist? Check out our Media Kit]\nHowever, the most commonly used method of joining them - spot welding - requires expensive tools that most hobbyists don't have. That's why we created the Vruzend caps - to help you build the perfect battery for you!\nUnlike spot welding or soldering, Vruzend caps allow you to assemble and disassemble a battery pack easily. This is helpful for modular applications where your battery size or capacity may change over time, or to allow you to swap out batteries over time as they inevitably weaken. You're no longer stuck with tossing an entire battery because a single cell went bad.\nThe new V2.0 terminal caps\nOur system uses an interlocking dovetail design to securely join the caps together like children's toy blocks. Once the caps are connected, you simply insert your battery cells. Now each cell has a threaded post terminal allowing for easy and customizable connections.\nEasily assemble 18650 cells into any battery pack size and configuration\nWe have been testing our current version (V1.5) of the Vruzend DIY battery building kit all over the world and with great responses. However, the power ability of the kit was somewhat lower in the initial version. We have been working hard on a new version of the kit to allow higher power capabilities and are excited to announce that it is finally here! The Vruzend V2.0 kit works just like the V1.5 kit that has been tried and tested, but uses pure copper bus bars and copper alloy spring contacts to allow much higher power levels, as high as 20 A continuous per cell! \nImprovements made in our most recent kits include:\nSuperior polymer for more resilient plastic caps\nElongated terminal posts to allow more busbars\nSpring contact includes stopper for more even insertion\nImproved mold tolerances makes assembly even easier\nThe copper based components in the new V2.0 kits are nickel coated, taking advantage of the high conductivity of pure copper and the corrosion resistance of pure nickel.\nThe Vruzend team has been working for months to bring our V2.0 kit to the market, and we fully expect to begin shipping V2.0 kits in May for our early bird rewards and June for our secondary rewards (once the early bird rewards are sold out). The first group of V2.0 kits will only be available here on Kickstarter, and then will be available on www.Vruzend.com afterwards. Make sure to take advantage of the special kickstarter pricing now though, as we won't be able to offer the kits for this price for long!\nWe are offering both kits, our existing Vruzend V1.5 kit and the new Vruzend V2.0 kit as rewards for backing our Kickstarter campaign. You can find details for each reward level and the option to pledge for that reward on the right-hand side of this screen.\nThe contents of each kit include:\nV1.5 kit (includes enough for 52 cells):\n104 caps with SS spring contacts\n104 SS nuts\n130 SS bus bars\n6 brass wire clamps\n6 zip ties\nNote: The V1.5 kit is rated at 3.5A continuous and 7A peak per cell\nEverything included in the V1.5 kit\nV2.0 kit (enough for 30 cells):\n60 caps with nickel-plated copper alloy spring contacts \n60 nickel-plated copper alloy nuts \n90 nickel-plated pure copper bus bars \n4 nickel-plated copper alloy clamps \n4 zip ties\nNote: the V2.0 kit is rated at 20A continuous and 25A peak per cell\nEverything included in the V2.0 kit\nVruzend is also the proud sponsor of multiple electric and solar-electric race car teams, including Team Sunergy from Appalachian State University! Pictured below with their award-winning solar race car, Team Sunergy is using the Vruzend 2.0 kit in the battery of their next-generation solar race car. Pictured below is the DTU Okami racing team developing an electric racing motorcycle, and last but not least, the students on the WWHS EV Team are the current defending champions of the Google Gravity Games and are also using Vruzend battery packs!\nSo far we've shipped our existing version of the Vruzend kits to over 100 countries around the world. Below are just a few of the countless user-submitted photos we've received back from successful DIY battery projects around the globe.\nUser-submitted DIY Vruzend battery packs\n If you aren't already experienced with battery building, we highly recommend doing some research and preparing for your first DIY battery. The best resource to teach you how to build custom DIY lithium-ion batteries is Micah Toll's #1 bestseller, DIY Lithium Batteries, available on Amazon in both paperback and Kindle e-book formats.\nTo see an example of a battery being assembled with the V2.0 battery building kit, check out this video: https://youtu.be/d2FCvW6S6Wk\nAnd to discuss Vruzend DIY battery building kits more, join the facebook group here: https://www.facebook.com/groups/Vruzend/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any manufacturing project, there is a chance that the manufacturing process will take longer than expected and delay our schedule. However, we have taken every effort to ensure that we will remain on schedule.\n\nWe waited to begin our Kickstarter campaign until we were 90% prepared for production, instead of starting much earlier like many other campaigns have. This meant we couldn't start taking pre-orders as quickly as we'd like, but that we have only a small amount of final work to finish before we can begin final production of your battery-building kits!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "V1.5 DIY battery building kit (1 kit)", "descp": "1 complete V1.5 kit.

They won't cause irritation or fall out like foam earplugs either. \nReusable and Easy to Clean\n EarJellies can be reused many times. Cheap foam earplugs can get expensive when a new pair is used every time. EarJellies will last several months or even years with proper care. \nExcellent for Side-Sleepers\nEarJellies will not extend out of the ear canal too far, making them a great choice for side-sleepers. Once inserted properly, EarJellies will not work their way out of your ear canal half way through the night. They will stay in place all night for improved sleep. \n Silence the Snorer in Your Life!\nGreat for Water Sports\nEarJellies provide a reliable water-tight seal for swimming, surfing, kayaking, snorkeling and other water sports. The seal will not leak after extended use to help prevent ear infections and exostosis or \"swimmer's ear\". \nEarJellies will also properly fit smaller ear canals in children to prevent infections.\n Multiple Sizes for a Custom-like Fit\nWhen it comes to earplugs, a \"one-size-fits-all\" approach doesn't work for everyone. Ear canals come in many different shapes and sizes. EarJellies come in multiple sizes to find your own custom-like fit, especially for those with extra small or extra large ear canals. \nLow-Profile and Discreet\nEarJellies sit flush against the outer ear for a discreet look - great for concerts and clubs.  \nPerfect for Concerts and Clubs\nGreat for Long Motorcycle Rides\nProtect your hearing at the race track\nStadium noise can reach dangerous levels\nWhat makes EarJellies so different from all other earplugs out there?\nEarJellies are the only earplug made of MemorySil\u2122 - a patented, unique viscoelastic silicone rubber with shape memory. Whenever it is stressed or deformed, MemorySil gradually adapts to its new situation and slowly relaxes to almost perfect softness. MemorySil is a dual network elastomer: a network liquid piggybacking on a network solid. The network solid has permanent crosslinks that give the material a stable shape, but with a very small modulus. The network liquid has temporary crosslinks that allow it to adapt gradually to new shapes and with a much larger modulus. Those two networks act together to give MemorySil unparalleled viscoelastic properties. For example, MemorySil is remarkably aware of time, appearing firm and elastic on short timescales, but soft and accommodating on long timescales. Even its mathematical modeling is unusual; whereas the stress-strain behaviors of elastic solids and Newtonian liquids are described by integer-order differential equations, MemorySil's stress-strain behaviors are described by fractional-order differential equations. Essentially, MemorySil gives EarJellies a custom-like fit for a more comfortable, reliable seal to block more noise.\n10x Time-Lapse\nPLAY\n\n ANSI S3.19-1974 - NRR Rated 25 decibels\nEasy to Insert Correctly\nProper insertion is essential to achieve the given noise reduction rating (NRR) of any earplug. EarJellies will slide into the ear canal easier than foam for a proper fit. Here's an excellent study on laboratory results vs real world noise reduction of several different earplugs. The differences are huge! Proper insertion can mean 100x or more noise reduction. \n Soft and Comfortable for Everyday Use\nEarJellies will gradual conform to the shape of your unique ear canal shape and size. The \"feel and seal\" is simply better than foam or rubber earplugs.\nEarJellies in the news!\nThis Physics Professor Has Invented a Better Earplug\nUVA professor invents new earplugs\nTechnology-Medical/Hearing Loss\n  EarJellies Podcast\nEarJellies Podcast\nThank you for your support!\ninfo@earjellies.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're currently gearing up for large scale manufacturing.

We've had to re-engineer traditionally used production and tooling methods because they were not suitable for EarJellies.

See how you can even pop our patent-pending frame into your own hat for a completely custom ActionHat. \nSure, it looks like just some hat with a GoPro on it, but it's a little bit more than that - we promise! You see, we hated the elastic head strap so much, that we invented the ActionHat. \nPLAY\n\nThe problem with the elastic head strap is that you can't put it on one-handed when you're in the middle of the action. And, as you can tell by our video, we are fishermen - so when we're fighting fish with both hands on the rod and reel, we can't fumble around with a head strap. Or worse yet, accidentally drop it in the water while trying to put it on.\nPLAY\n\nBeing able to pop it on one-handed when you want to capture that BIG moment, is a BIG deal. We discovered this through a simple DIY - by screwing in a GoPro to the bill of the hat. Unfortunately, that DIY hat along with our $400 camera sank to the bottom of the ocean. So with the ActionHat, we made it FLOAT! If you spend anytime near or on the water, consider the ActionHat an insurance policy for your expensive camera.  \nIt FLOATS with one action camera (or up to 6 oz mounted)\nThe real magic is in the patent-pending, multi-mounting location, floating frame. The frame makes the ActionHat modular and customizable. With multiple mounting locations, you can wear it forwards or backwards to get the exact shot you want. You can mount an action camera or a smartphone (kit sold separately). Since the camera weight is not on the bill (and front heavy), the ActionHat sits comfortably and balanced on your head. \nActionHat has multiple mounting locations\nBecause the ActionHat is used outdoors and on the water, we've had many requests for a mesh back ActionHat. While the request seemed simple enough, the see-through mesh required us to redesign and rethink the support frame completely. We wanted to keep all the great things about the original ActionHat but make it lighter and more comfortable. \nCheck out the prototype pictures in the gallery\n  After over a year of developing and testing dozens of different prototypes, we are finally ready to launch our new mesh back hats with our patent-pending flexible frame! \nAll the components have been designed and tested, now we just need your help to get the molds made and the production started!\nBy meeting our goal we can new three styles of ActionHats in black. By exceeding our goal, we can add more color option for you to pick from! When that happens, we'll request your color selection in the Backer Survey. \nActionHat Mesh and ActionHat Visor\nThe new flexible frame allows you mount two accessories at one time. To use the hat backwards, simply disconnect the mount, slide the frame to the back mounting location and reattach the mount. And just like the original ActionHat, if it falls in the water - it will float!\nTake a look through our image gallery for close-ups\n                We also created the ActionHat Visor: a simple, lightweight design with one mounting location. Just like all ActionHats, it was designed to pop on quickly and easily with one hand, and it floats!\nCheck out the overview video below:\nThanks for checking us out!

A more comprehensive list of compatible printers can be found here.\nOther than the obvious simplicity of AstroPrint, you\u2019ll be connecting your printer to one of the most powerful platforms dedicated to 3D Printing.\nWhich means, you\u2019ll be able to:\nRemotely manage your 3D Printer (No pesky cables or SD Cards!) \nMonitor your 3D Printer with live video streaming (compatible camera required) \nGet email and push notifications of your print status \nAutomatic security & slicer updates on the cloud, so you have no software (or maintenance) to deal with\nAn app store that can extend the capabilities of your 3D Printer (much like the apps on your smartphone)\nAccess your print history and trends (i.e: analytics)\nNo need for a laptop/computer to be connected to your printer \nResponsive, mobile friendly and works on any web enabled device \nSimple, clean, intuitive interface \nIntelligent slicing that learns your printing habits and improves your prints over time\nNot to mention, you\u2019ll have IMMEDIATE access to all of the 3D Printing apps on our app marketplace.  \nThis lets you tap into the creativity of developers who have developed 3D Printing apps just for you.\nYou'll be able to extend the capabilities of your 3D Printer by installing apps on your Touch as easily as you install apps on your smartphone.\nWhich means, the capabilities of the Touch are infinitely extendable. \nLet's get to how the AstroBox Touch benefits Developers. \nAre you a developer?\nIf so, you\u2019ll get first dibs into our API when it is released with the AstroBox Touch.\nJust like the early days of Google Play and the Apple App Store - early developers on those platforms got a massive, DISPROPORTIONATE advantage as they were able to capitalize on the inevitable growth and network effects.\nWe are confident that a similar story will transpire with consumer 3D Printing.\nSince AstroPrint is the fastest growing cloud platform for consumer 3D Printing, it is certainly the best place to develop your 3D Printing apps and reach 3D Printer owners. \nThe AstroBox Touch software is brand new, built on an open source framework (called Ionic) and runs on the Raspberry Pi as a native app.\nSince we will be using this open source framework for the AstroBox Touch -- it is very developer friendly.\nHere\u2019s why that\u2019s important: You will be able to make 3D Printing related apps using just Javascript, CSS, HTML, and deploy it on our platform.\nYou'll literally be able to make your app available to ALL of our users who own 3D Printers. \nThat's power. \nYour app will be IMMEDIATELY accessible on every AstroBox Touch.\nAlso, if you develop an app for the AstroPrint.com web portal, it will get in front of our 23K+ 3D Printer owners that use this portal for managing their printers.\nAt a glance, these are some of the capabilities of our API:\nCreating web socket connections into any 3D Printer \nRunning slicing jobs though our cloud slicing engine\nManaging print queues\nCreating payment flows\nImporting/Exporting models/STLs\nAccessing cameras (with permission of course!)\nand more.\nPotential ideas for apps: Apps that let people browse and 3D Print models, improve on 3DP workflow (i.e: file repair, auto positioning etc.), improve maintenance tasks (e.g. plate leveling, filament loading), or add 3DP functionality to your existing web application.\nIf you release your app on our platform, it will be available to all of our users across all devices (Desktop & Mobile).\nThe AstroPrint API has limitless potential as our platform is the fastest growing cloud platform for consumer 3D Printing. \nWe believe our platform is much like the early days of Google Play or the Apple App Store. (Request API Access)\nAre you a 3D Printer Manufacturer?\nIf you are a 3D Printer Manufacturer, let us focus on the software (after all, that\u2019s OUR expertise).\nWe can make your 3D Printer cloud connected and wireless and save you a lot of hassle and money.\nBy integrating AstroPrint with your printer(s) - both YOU and YOUR customers will benefit massively.\nFor example, with AstroPrint:\nThere\u2019s no need for your customers to deal with pesky cables or SD cards \nThere\u2019s no need to develop and maintain a complex cloud infrastructure (we already built it!) \nCustomers will be able to wirelessly manage their printer from anywhere with any device \nYour customers will be connected to one of the most powerful cloud platforms for 3D Printing which includes a suite of mobile apps, desktop apps and an ever expanding library of 3D Printing apps developed via our public API.\nIn short, you focus on what you are best at (hardware) and let us worry about what we are best at (software) -- and together, we can partner up and make 3D Printing even simpler for the end user.\nWe also have the capability to build you a custom, fully branded (with your company name and logo) build of the AstroBox Touch software. You can get a special introductory rate during this Kickstarter (via the associated Reward Tier), or contact us to get more information.\nWhat\u2019s so great about the AstroPrint Platform?\nWe believe that your 3D printer should be super simple to use.\nWe are not quite at that point yet, but we are getting closer everyday.\nAstroPrint is a suite of software products all designed to make 3D printing incredibly simple. \nIt is our mission to standardize the software for the 3D printing industry in the same way that Android standardized the software for much of the smartphone industry. \nThis allows more people to adopt and take advantage of 3D printing technologies by bringing their creativity to life. \nSome obvious key benefits of AstroPrint:\nWireless management & monitoring of your 3D Printer (No pesky cables or SD Cards!) \nCompatible with Marlin, Repetier, and Sailfish firmware based printers \nAbility to save and create custom slicer settings \nFile Manager and folders for organizing your file(s) \nAn app store that can extend the capabilities of your 3D Printer even more\nPrint history, trends, and stats of your prints \nPrint notification(s) by email and/or push notifications of print status\nAutomatic slicer updates in the cloud, so you do not have to deal with software (or maintenance) upgrades\nNo need for a laptop/computer to be connected to your printer \nResponsive, mobile friendly, and works on any web enabled device \nSimple, clean, intuitive interface \nIntelligent slicing that learns your printing habits and improves your prints over time\nReal time video remote monitoring of your prints from any device (you'll need a compatible camera - which is not included with this Kickstarter)\nThose are the main benefits\u2026\nThere's a few more \"not so obvious\" features:\nCustom Manufacturer Presets: The AstroPrint slicer routes slicing jobs through the best slicing engine and settings for your specific 3D Printer.  This is PRE-PROGRAMMED into the system directly by your printer manufacturer. (Of course, you still have the option to tinker and tweak with advanced settings.)\nPlug & Play Slicing Engines: The slicing engine is modular.  This means with a click of a button you can use Cura, Slic3r, or a proprietary slicing engine (if applicable). As new slicing engines become available, they can be added easily like lego blocks.\nThe app store: Using our API, anyone can submit apps to the AstroPrint app store. The app store is accessible by any user who is on the platform. Several apps have already been submitted (like Leopoly, 3D Slash, Materialise etc.) and more are in development by third parties.\nThe Team\nMeet the team!  \nWe're 10 strong and are on a mission to make 3D printing simple and accessible to EVERYONE. \nSeriously, when we aren't eating tapas or paella - our entire life is dedicated to making 3D Printing simple. \nAstroPrint developers (in Malaga, Spain) working hard to help you 3D Print stuff with more ease\nReward(s) Summary\n  Technical Specifications\nDelivery Timeline\n  Your pledge will help us finish the AstroBox Touch, Mobile Apps & Astroprint Desktop\nThanks For Your Support!\nWe sincerely appreciate your support in bringing the AstroBox Touch to the world \u2764\ufe0f\nWe have one last favor to ask you...\nPlease consider sharing this campaign with your friends and followers and help us spread the word!\nYou can do that very easily by clicking one of the following links: \nShare this on Twitter to help spread the word about this campaign!\n  Share this on Facebook to help spread the word about this campaign!\n  ....you can also download this short clip and post it on your Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook:\nThe AstroBox Touch Kickstarter Trailer (0:54 seconds, 9 MB)\nThanks again!\nWe Love You!  \u2764\ufe0f\n-The AstroPrint Team\nThank you with the bottom of our hearts for your support!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSupply chain and logistics: We have already verified bulk pricing of each physical component through multiple distributors. \n\nThis includes tooling and injection molding for product cases (where applicable). \n\nHowever, unforeseen complications from manufacturers and distributors may cause delayed delivery.\n\nThe list of printers that we can support is dependent on how open the format is for each printer. \n\nIf your printer is open source, AstroPrint should already work with it.

Every time we do laundry, our clothes shed tiny microfibers (including plastic), which go down the drains of our washing machines, through wastewater treatment facilities and into our waterways.\nEveryone who wears and washes clothes is part of this pollution. Everyone who eats or breathes could suffer the consequences. Learn more about the problem of microfiber pollution here. \nThis is a 120x magnified image of clothing microfibers filtered from washing machine effluent. One study found that a single fleece jacket could shed as many as 250,000 individual fibers per wash.\nOur team learned about the microfiber problem while working on marine debris along the US East Coast. It became clear very quickly that this could be the biggest pollution problem facing our ocean. We knew we needed a solution, and the ocean itself helped us come up with one.\nDesign Inspired by Nature\nMost washing machines do not have filters. The ones that do are only good to keep keys and coins from clogging your pipes. A standard filter cannot do what needs to be done: catch fibers too small for the human eye to see AND allow water flow.\nSo, we turned to nature. Coral does exactly what we need; it catches tiny things from flowing water.\nYou just drop, or throw it into your washing machine (any washing machine - front or top loaders, with and without center spindles) and do your wash as usual. It is easy to use and easy to clean.\nCora swooshes around in the laundry and just like coral, allows water to flow, while picking up those little pieces of microfiber and catching them in her stalks.\nWhen you take it out of the washer or dryer, have a look. When you see clumps of fuzz, just pull them out and put them in the trash bin along with your dryer lint. \nThis is the fuzz recovered from one load of doggie towels and blankets.\nThe Cora Ball was designed as an equal opportunity fiber catcher, helping you protect our public waterways from a host of potentially harmful materials and chemicals. In the US, our clothes are 60% plastic. The rest may be made from natural materials, but they are often covered in dyes, heavy metals and other chemicals. So, it makes sense to catch all of this manmade material before it ends up throughout the marine ecosystem, in the bellies of fish, and ultimately, on our plates.\nWe are working hard to find opportunities to upcycle or recycle the fuzz from your Cora Ball, the primary obstacle being the mixed-material nature of laundry lint (polyesters, nylons, polypropylene, cotton, wool, etc.). For now the trash is much better than the nearest river, lake or bay.\nThe Cora Ball will be made from 100% recycled plastic, both post-consumer and from manufacturing (would have gone to landfill). It is 100% recyclable and made in the USA (Vermont). Since we are using 100% recycled material, we have to go with whatever is out there. Most of it will be black, but every now and then, we will find a source for a color. So, the color of your Cora Ball will be a surprise of mostly black with either a clump of color or stripes.\nOur design is getting the attention of industry experts, featured at innovation events and in a variety of media:\nProtecting the Ocean with Each Laundry Load\nThis is about small collective actions having the power to achieve big results. If 10% of US households use a Cora Ball, we can keep the plastic equivalent of over 30 million water bottles from washing into our public waterways every year. That is enough water bottles to reach from New York City to London.\nYour use of a Cora Ball protects both air and water. The Cora ball's design collects microfibers until you remove them and put them in the trash. That means they will not re-attach to clothing and fly off into the air - only to become run-off and end up in our public waterways anyway.\n Cora Ball Backer Rewards\nAs a backer, you will be first to receive your Cora Ball(s) making you an early adopter of this solution to microfiber pollution. And, you\u2019ll get to share with friends, family and neighbors! \nBeyond the Cora, we have some additional rewards exclusive to the Kickstarter Community:\nInvitation to join our Innovation Team: we want this to be the best microfiber catching device it can be, innovation team members will receive insider communications and opportunities to do specific tests and provide feedback to help us strengthen and improve our design. \nJoin us on American Promise: Our work on Rozalia Project's oceanographic research vessel, American Promise, played a vital role in learning about the problem of microfiber pollution and developing a solution. She is a very special boat; a world-record holder and the greenest sailing research vessel in the world. Our top reward levels offer opportunities for a personalized tour, lunch or dinner with the captain, crew and at least one member of the Cora Ball inventor team and, at the $5,000 level, a full weekend as part of the crew working to protect the ocean on the Gulf of Maine. Read more about this extraordinary boat here and watch videos from various expeditions here.\nThe team behind the Cora Ball is all about ocean protection. We\u2019ve been on the case for 7 years and it was during this work that the Cora Ball was born. \nBrooke Winslow, our Technical Designer, at work.\nNot only have we developed a consumer solution to microfiber pollution, but we are working hard to better understand the problem as well. We conducted the first mountains to the sea microfiber study, sampling the entire Hudson River from the Adirondack Mountains to New York Harbor where the river meets the sea (video below) because we know that the better we understand a problem, the stronger our solution.\nPLAY\n\nThis is a true social enterprise: the success of the Cora Ball first and foremost means a cleaner ocean; secondly, proceeds support Rozalia Project\u2019s work cleaning and protecting the ocean and developing and implementing more solutions to the problem of marine debris. Learn more about Rozalia Project.\n The Technology Behind the Cora Ball\nMaterial: Made from 100% recycled and 100% recyclable plastic in the USA.\nRange of use: Useable in your washer and dryer. We've researched the high and low temperature settings in washers and dryers and selected a material that maintains its integrity within these ranges.\nEffectiveness: Catches up to 35% of the microfibers per load, per Cora Ball. The effectiveness depends on several factors including what items are in the load, wash settings and wash frequency. For maximum effectiveness, we recommend using 2-3 Cora Balls. We are constantly testing to learn how it works best and will always share our results.\nLimitations: The Cora Ball was designed to maximize both effectiveness and ease of use. Also, we wanted it to catch fibers from all of your clothes and textiles without having to separate. That said, we recommend that you do separate delicate items especially those with lace, tassels, crocheted sections or frayed threads, and do not wash them with your Cora Ball, as there is a chance they get caught in Cora's stalks.\nMagnified (125x) image of mixed fibers on a Cora Ball after a test load. Without the Cora Ball, these would have washed out the drain, through septic systems or wastewater treatment facilities and into our public waterways.\nYou will make this happen: This Kickstarter Campaign is the last piece of the puzzle, rather than the first. The molds are ordered, the patents filed.\nThis campaign is about production: As a backer, you will support the production of Cora Balls and help us get them to market faster. Getting them to market faster means we start protecting the ocean, its creatures and ultimately all of us, faster. \nWhat surpassing our initial goal means to this project\nThanks to a community of amazing backers and people who will make a small effort for big collective impact, we have far surpassed our initial funding goal. We want to share what that means for the Cora Ball, the ocean and Rozalia Project, and how hitting this campaign way out of the park makes a difference.\n1. It means a bigger impact protecting our ocean, lakes and rivers; the more people who have a Cora Ball, the sooner we start keeping microfiber out of our public waterways. And Kickstarter backers will get their Cora Balls first.\n2. A large community of backers demonstrates support that will allow us to develop stronger relationships with distribution partners who will get the Cora Ball to a broad market.\n3. Our initial $10,000 goal was the minimum it would take to go into production - this was the barest of minimums to make Cora Ball a reality - we would have been assembling them at the kitchen table. Exceeding that goal means a bigger first production run and correspondingly, a more efficient manufacturing and assembly process.\nWe are not going to mess around with stretch goals. We will keep spreading the word about this campaign and encourage participation. We will continue to work on streamlining our packaging and shipping plans. And we will keep in touch with you with updates as we bring the Cora Ball into the world and, together, make a difference.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we foresee has to do with the timing of getting Cora Balls out the door, rather than with making them in the first place.

Our experienced team has already developed a few working prototypes, which have been tested and perform well, providing us with feasibility of the product. This gives us confidence in SELFLY and its development.\nMini drones have become quite popular in recent years, and SELFLY is a very simple one, so the technological challenge isn\u2019t high. Since it uses existing technology in order to enable a new kind of mini drone use, compacting it into a phone case is possible to implement - we've done it!\nOur products prime purpose is providing the user with a convenient and available option of taking photos from a new different angle. The 1st pilot view video stream is recordable, but its primary purpose is to control the camera in order to choose the perfect angle for a selfie picture. Our drone is VERY stable, however, a 99$ product obviously does not include a stabilizing gimbal. If you are looking for a drone to capture professional stabilized video you will have to spend 600$ and more, this is beyond the scope of this product. \n\nWe do not aim to replace, nor compete with large and complex drones. However, if you are looking for a great affordable replacement for a selfie stick to take an exciting new angle for your photos, this is the product for you. \n\nSELFLY\u2019s main clip shows the target of the final product. With your support we will get there. Although we have several working prototypes, the current prototype is yet to include the full and final functionality and components to be included in the product, and in order to reach the manufacturing stage further development should be carried out. However, full functionality as described is fully feasible.\nOur subcontractors are well-known companies, and are quite experienced in the mini drone tech field, making our work plans and budget expectations well-planned in order to accurately estimate the development process through to shipping.\nWe are sure that our product will meet your expectations.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Be a SELFLY fan!", "descp": "Thank you for supporting us\nJoin us for updates, and news.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2017"}], "stat": ["58 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 99 or more", "title": "1 SELFLY Camera Kit", "descp": "Receive one SELfly Camera kit\nfor 99$ - Only on Kickstarter (Expected retail $139)\nAvailable for: iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy 7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Nexus 6.\nUniversal connector for all 4-6 inch mobile phones\n* You can choose your preferred phone model and color in a backer survey upon completion of the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,383 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "1 SELFLY Camera with two phone cases", "descp": "Receive one SELFLY Camera with 2 phone cases (any two models) for 109$ - Only on Kickstarter (Expected retail $149)\nAvailable for: iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy 7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Nexus 6.\nUniversal phone case for all 4-6 inch mobile phones\n* You can choose your preferred phone model and color in a backer survey upon completion of the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["355 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 119 or more", "title": "SELFLY Camera Kit + 1 SELFLY power bank", "descp": "One SELFLY Camera + one phone case (any model) + one SELFLY power bank\n(Expected retail $169)\nAvailable for: iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy 7, Galaxy 7 Edge, Nexus 6.\nUniversal connector for all 4-6 inch mobile phones\n* You can choose your preferred phone model and color in a backer survey upon completion of the campaign.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,539 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 185 or more", "title": "Double Pack - 2 SELFLY Camera Kits", "descp": "SELfly Double Pack - Receive two SELfly Camera kits.

The King Arthur Legend always made the list.  I have been inspired by this legend since I was a child and now I am excited to share this deck with you.   \nThe Arthur Legend is full of rich characters and a wide range of lore.  All this history makes it an ideal foundation for a playing card deck. Kings, Knights, Queens, Love, Betrayal, and Brotherhood are just a few of the themes that play out in this beloved story.  \nWhen I decided to capture the story of the Arthur Legend, I then picked an art style that has been attractive to me for years.  The art for this deck is a reflection of the Book of Kells.  The Book of Kells is a beautiful hand drawn and written illuminated manuscript that tells the story of the four Gospels of the Bible. This book was written around the same time as the origins of the King Arthur story.  This legend and art style are a perfect compliment to each other. \nFollow my Kickstarter for the next 30 days to watch this deck come to life.

That means ALL OF THE TUCKS WILL BE FOILED AND EMBOSSED! As some of you may now from my previous decks, the foiling and embossing is superb and a very nice touch to the decks.\n\nOur first stretch goal has been unlocked! That means ALL OF THE CARDS will be printed with color with metallic ink accents! The HANA Luxury Playing Cards Gold edition will have gold metallic ink and the Silver Edition will have silver metallic ink!\n      The Hana luxury playing cards is an original set of decks designed by Steve Minty. These decks are inspired by the unique elegance of traditional Japanese culture. Elements from aspects of textile, art, and social structures are incorporated into this deck along with my design sensibilities to make these different from what I have done before.\nAs always, I work on projects that I have a connection to on a personal level. I knew since I first started designing playing cards that I wanted to work on a deck that revolved around Japanese culture. To do so, I traveled to Japan to research as well as gain some insight and inspiration. It was an unforgettable experience but I merely scratched the surface. In the span of 3 years, I spent countless hours on research, scoured through books ranging from Japanese society to samurai armor and even attended a few museum exhibits for the sake of this project.\nInitially, I wanted to do something bold and very eye catching but I was not pleased with the looks I came up with as it was too garish. I took a step back and rethought my process on how to approach this project and through many drafts, I came up with what you see now.\nThis deck is more art centric than the decks I have done previously. It draws upon the history of playing cards in Japan as well as the art that makes them special. Aspects of Feudal Japan, Hana Fuda, Kimonos, Ikebana, Ukiyo-e among others are incorporated into the decks. I hope they have been not been lost in translate but most importantly, I hope you guys enjoy them as much as I enjoyed making them.\nBelow are examples of how the decks will look as well as court cards. Throughout the campaign, additional court cards will be revealed and explained on why they were chosen.  \n         Close up on the details for the art\n                Example of coins from the Muertos Campaign\nThis Gold 1\u00be\u201d Engraved Commemorative Coin can be used as a dealer button, card guard, display piece, or decision maker. The front side features the Geisha and the back features the Hana insignia!\nAdd a Gold Coin to any Reward for just $12! \nMeasures approx 22\" by 26 1/2\" Shipped seperately in a 25\"x3\" tube\nAdd an Uncut Sheet to any reward for $40.

Although there were some technical difficulties with the one of the printers and other issues, I've taken what I've learned from that experience and will apply a more efficient and effective process to allow for another successful campaign. As always, I have done a lot of research and followed up on a lot of companies to ensure that this project goes as smoothly as possible. \nThere may be the risks of the unforeseen but I have prepared myself enough with knowledge and research to minimize it if necessary. I listed the delivery date conservatively in order to not rush the production of the product.

It fits your switch without removing or swapping anything. No tools required.\n\u2022 Fits all switches: Switch Bot works with just about any rocker switch all over the world thanks to our innovative mechanisms.\n\u2022 Work with others: Switch Bot can be controlled by other smart devices like Amazon Echo, SmartThings, WeMo sensors and hundreds more. And APIs will be released.\n\u2022 Affordable: Add IoT (Internet of Things) to any device for $19.\n\u2022 Long battery life: Powered by a replaceable lithium battery with about 600 days of use.\n Meet Switch Bot\nSwitch Bot is a smart IoT robot to mechanically control all your switches and buttons.\nWe are constantly running from place to place, working to accomplish everything on our never-ending \u201cto-do\u201d list. If you\u2019re a person who is always on the go, convenience can be the biggest lifesaver and an added luxury or reprieve from daily stress. \nSwitch Bot is a small, automated device (controlled via app on your Android or iPhone) that turns devices in your home and office on and off.

You\u2019ll never have to worry about running home to turn the washing machine or dryer off, open the door for your children after school, or make your coffee in the morning. What\u2019s better than having one less thing to do, being able to hit that snooze button on your alarm to get a few extra winks of sleep?\n    You can turn on and off your light switch with one Switch Bot. Please find the demo video at the bottom of this page.\n They Love Us\n  How it works\n1. Download the free app (from Apple App Store or Google Play).  \n  2.

They should be affordable, last long, be easy to maintain, and specifically address YOUR foot problems, not global foot problems!\nOur 3-step ordering process uses an App which will take you less than a minute of your time to complete your order:  \n1.Take two pictures of your foot (Top and Side View)  \nAttach Third Picture (Bottom View: for Blisters/Sores/Ulcers)\nAttach Fourth Picture (Foot Stress Map: Wet your foot and step on a white paper) \n2.Select your foot Size/Add Extra Details \n3.Order Confirmation and Processing (Less than a day)\nWe DON'T create complex 3D foot models with 20+ pictures, as its a waste of your and our time!

The synthetic skin material (US Patent Pending 15/204,353) which can be range from ultra soft to hard, can be dispensed via nozzle attachments at specific sections of our insoles, using our proprietary manufacturing process.

Did you know that it was on the original ship that the Mayflower Compact was signed, our first \u201ccivil body politic\u201d?\nRenowned Naval architect William Avery Baker of M.I.T. (i.e. \u2018wicked smaht\u2019 guy), researched and designed the ship which was constructed at Upham Shipyard in Brixham, England between 1955 and 1957 using carefully researched methods and materials. Mayflower II is the same size as the original Mayflower and true to the look and spirit of the original. No other ship today can make this claim! \nSailed across the Atlantic in 1957 by a crew of 33 and accompanied by a LIFE magazine writer and photographer, she arrived to great fanfare and celebration by thousands of spectators, including Vice President Richard Nixon and Senator John F. Kennedy. Completing this restoration means she will be able to sail again!  \nNearly 25 million people have stepped aboard since 1957. Mayflower II plays an essential role on the historic Plymouth waterfront, serving as a \u201cfloating classroom\u201d where thousands of schoolchildren and visitors every year are educated, inspired and entertained. What a wonderful way to learn about history!  \nThe story of the Mayflower remains a powerful, tangible piece of American history to all who encounter her through books, films, and most often, through a visit to Plimoth Plantation and Mayflower II.     \nSchoolchildren learn how the Mayflower sailed across the Atlantic and what daily life was like on board.\n  In 2013, routine work revealed deeper challenges to the ship\u2019s frame that could not be deferred to a later stage in the ship\u2019s already existing restoration plan. Work (and fundraising!) began immediately. The restoration plan includes three phases\u2014stabilization, major restoration and ongoing support and repairs. Some work has already been completed over the last two winters; the remaining work requires the ship to be in dry dock over a period of at least 30 months at Mystic Seaport\u2019s Henry B. duPont Preservation Shipyard. It is this remaining work that we are fundraising for today.   \nIn total, the project requires $12 million, which includes a reserve fund for future maintenance needs. $7.5 million is needed before the end of the 2016 in order to proceed with the final phase of restoration. A significant amount has already been raised. Plimoth Plantation will continue to solicit support from individuals, foundations and government agencies to ensure the goal will be met. \nFor the stories she tells, for the hope she inspires, for the freedoms she represents, and for the education she provides, Mayflower II is worth saving.

And thank you for looking at our project! We are Peter Dunham and Linnea Gits, the designers and artists behind the Chicago design studio, Uusi and we are incredibly excited to introduce our project to you: an entirely hand-painted deck of tarot and poker cards called \"BRuT.\"\nBRuT: A modern tarot. At Uusi we are deep lovers of everyday objects that are useful and practical. If they can also be beautiful \u2013 all the better! But if an object can somehow be just a little bit magical to boot, oh my gosh, what an incredible delight!! Thus our fascination with playing cards and tarots and our desire to reinterpret them for a modern world.\nUusi and the tarot.  About three years ago when our design studio took on the challenge to design six entirely unique, Limited Edition playing card decks all featuring original, hand-drawn artwork we began collecting decks from around the world to study and draw inspiration from. In our journey through this multitudinous genre some of the most beautiful, artistic and imaginative decks that we came across were tarot decks. We knew as soon as we saw these decks we would someday want to make one ourselves.\nAlong with their fantastical imagery, the tarot's charm was also it's unusual size. Standard tarot decks are typically created using an oversize format and though sizes vary, the one we chose for BRuT \u2013 60mm x 110mm \u2013  is about an inch longer and almost the same width as a standard poker-sized deck. This extra length works elegantly to enhance the look and feel of the artwork allowing it to come alive in your hand like no other deck can and creates the perfect mini canvas, so-to-speak, for art. Add to this our tarot deck will be printed on premium, Master Finish card stock with a linen finish and you have one beautiful and highly playable deck. \nIn many ways we feel the tarot is the perfect deck. Not only does its size make it a beautiful object to look at, but one in which you can play a multitude of games. Aside from the original game of Tarot, (a trick-taking game that is a lot like Bridge), if you remove the Cavaliers and Trump cards you can play just about any game that you would normally play with a standard deck of cards.\nBRuT Inspiration. The artwork for our BRuT tarot was inspired by Early 20th Century Modernism, Art Brut (or Outsider Art) and the forceful, geometric look of Brut Architecture. The symbolic imagery in our trump cards are loosely based on the early Marseilles Tarot from the 1700's.  All imagery in this deck was hand-painted using gouache \u2013 a type of watercolor medium that is similar to watercolor but more highly pigmented.\nThe Future Enters Us. Finally, as a divination medium the tarot can be a powerful, meditative tool that allows the future to step inside you. Though few of us are gifted with telepathic powers, learning about and understanding these universal symbols and their meaning can be a powerful, reflective experience that teaches you to know yourself better, which in turn will naturally reveal the truth inside and ahead.  A tarot is the perfect deck to find the secret passageways to the eternal future and as the old, masonic saying goes, \"If you follow the secret way, you will find the shortest road.\"  Let's follow this road together and make BRuT happen!!!\nWhere are the cups, coins, wands and swords for the courts? This was a tough decision for us, but ultimately we chose to use the modern, French suits for our courts instead of the older Latin suits as we wanted this deck to be as multifunctional as possible.  A well used deck has a power all it's own \u2013 we all have our favorite \u2013 and this change helped to expand the function of the deck and move the tarot into our every day lives. \nThe French suits also hold meaning beyond their graphic design service on the cards and can just as easily contain content as powerful as the older, Latin symbols. We will expand on the French suit symbols and meaning later in the project.\n                 **All court cards will be revealed during the project.\nThe imagery for the twenty-one BRuT trump cards is based on the early, Marseilles tarot from the 1700's.  At Uusi we wanted to give a fresh take to this tarot classic by adding bold graphics that playfully reference the divination symbols of the Marseilles Tarot.\nIn games as in divination tarots The Fool is a complex, powerful card. On the one hand this \"wild\" card reminds us of how little we actually control in the world and that the wisest response to this chaos is to relax into it and try not to manage that which we have no power over.  On the other hand, it warns of blindly giving in to the fates for as the old saying goes: \"The wise man rules his stars, the fool obeys them.\" \nOur fool is a classic jester \u2013 a dreamer \u2013 paying little attention to that which surrounds him. If not for his animal companion, a cat who is there to warn and brutally awaken him with an urgent,\"reality bite,\" he could easily get lost in the world. And nothing, not even angels, protects those who lose themselves.\nAt Uusi we were the first designers to create and introduce the diptych ad cards to custom playing card decks. With the BRuT tarot we are switching it up a bit and taking advantage of the elegant size this longer card stock offers and are making it a triptych!   \nThe scene on the card depicts Hercules wrestling with a lion.  In our version of this classic scene Hercules has his hand thrust down the lions mouth.  He is literally reaching into the jaws of fate and controlling his own destiny against staggering odds.  This is our eternal struggle in the world and if we participate in it fearlessly and fully we are destined for a new birth.\nA complex, mystical yet thoroughly modern design weaves it way across the back of our cards creating an almost hypnotic pattern.\nOur BRuT tuck boxes will be created with an extra heavy paper stock to safely hold and beautifully display the tarot deck inside.  Designed to have a modernist meets mystical flare it is the perfect packaging to enter into the Future with ;)\nBRuT LIMITED EDITION POKER DECK! We have created a bonus Uusi playing card deck for this project.  It is a companion, Limited Edition BRuT poker deck with all the same courts as the Tarot minus the beautiful Trump cards and Cavaliers, but just as much fun to play with! PLUS \u2013 if you get both decks \u2013 all that powerful juju of it's Mother tarot deck will rub off on it making you an unstoppable, gaming force!\n**Brut poker cards will share the same back design as the tarot cards.\n*All images of the deck and tuck boxes you see in these photos are prototypes made at Uusi's studio. The finished product may vary slightly from what you see here \u2013 backers will be kept up-to-date of any minor changes that may occur. The overall design and theme will remain UNCHANGED throughout the funding and printing process.\n Seventy-eight tarot cards, one fool card all with original, eye-catching artwork.\nOne illustrated, Uusi Ad Card.\nCard dimension: 60mm x 110mm\nPrinted by The Expert Playing Card Company (EPCC).\nPrinted on premium, Master Finish playing card stock with a linen finish.\nHeavy, premium paper for the tucks with an embossed linen finish.\nFifty-two playing cards and two jokers all with original, eye-catching artwork that makes them ideal for magic and card games, yet at the same time very familiar and immediately recognizable by players and spectators alike.\nPrinted by The Expert Playing Card Company (EPCC)\nLimited Edition of 5000.\nPrinted on Master Finish card stock with a linen finish.\nPremium paper for the tuck box.\nAt Uusi we have been designing and producing Limited Edition decks for over three years now and with each deck we create we strive to maintain a high level of artistry and craftsmanship.

Each deck is hand-gilded with pure copper or gold leaf \u2013 this is NOT a sprayed on foil or simulated metal \u2013 by Peter Dunham using a 400+ year-old traditional gilding process. An exceptionally high level of craftsmanship is applied to this Fine Art process to ensure that each gilded deck is not only beautiful to look at but also to play with.\n*View more images of our gilded decks here.\nBRuT Gilded Poker Deck and Two Deck Box. This handsome and highly coveted case was originally introduced in our \"Uusi Classic\" deck project and we have brought it back one last time for BRuT!

Boards from these towers were originally milled from trees that were 300+ years-old making the graining and color of each case incredibly beautiful and unique. Each case will have either a gilded copper leaf or 24KT gold leaf bottom to reflect the either 24KT gold leaf or copper leaf, gilded poker deck inside.\n*Please note: Though the picture above shows two copper gilded decks this box comes with one gilded poker deck and one deck without gilding.\nBRuT TAROT Gilded Deck and Box.

This delay was caused by our addition of the 9 panoramic cards in the deck.  A special die had to be created for the tuck to accommodate the added cards in the deck and the cards themselves had to be designed and painted.  This was a special addition that we really wanted to offer to everyone for your awesome support of our project and we are sorry it caused a delay, but we know the added cards truly made the deck unique for you."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "\"Burt\"?

We love 3D printing and all the doors it opens, but we don\u2019t like our printers. It seems like every day something jams, breaks, shifts, or fails. Even when our printers do work, they need fine-tuning to print well. All in all, we probably spend more time working on our printers than on our inventions.\nSure, there are some high-end machines out there that consistently work well\u2014but why do they have to be so expensive?\nGo into a store with $179 and see what you can get. A microwave, a mini-fridge, a vacuum, etc. All of these products are pretty complicated, and no one expects them to require fixing every week. We believe a 3D printer shouldn't be any different.\nThat\u2019s why we designed Tiko.\nTiko is a 3D printer unlike any before it. We meticulously designed every piece of it to make it high quality and easy to use, while keeping costs down in order to achieve a great price. So, what makes Tiko different?\nMost 3D printers have a multipart frame. These are bulky, difficult to assemble, and easily damaged. This is where Tiko is fundamentally different. Tiko is unibody. That means the whole frame is one piece, introducing an amazing array of benefits. Easy to manufacture. Virtually impossible to misalign. That's how you get a quality 3D printer for $179.\nTiko is a delta 3D printer with three sets of arms moving in unison to control the movement of the print head (more on this later). The essence of Tiko\u2019s innovation is our discovery that delta is the ideal configuration to unlock the many benefits of unibody.\nFrom the very beginning, we were determined to make an accurate printer. Tiko\u2019s unibody construction and delta mechanism have been carefully designed to deliver exceptionally high mechanical repeatability without the need for high-precision components. That\u2019s right, you heard us. Even without high-precision components, Tiko is still able to print incredibly consistent layers. \nTiko printed the vase pictured above at a 200 micron-resolution, but it can print as fine as 50 microns.\nThanks to unibody, Tiko is also enclosed. Whereas most 3D printers have problems with warping prints, Tiko\u2019s enclosed print chamber means that prints are isolated from the outside environment, resulting in strong and consistent print results, even when the wind blows.\nTiko\u2019s slender unibody frame, delta mechanism, and ultra-compact liquefier/end-effector enable it to print objects far larger than any similarly sized 3D printer.\nLike most delta printers, we started with a circular print volume. But we wanted more than that, so we expanded Tiko\u2019s print volume into the corners for those extra-long prints, maximizing space efficiency.\nNot only can you print large objects, you can actually remove them easily, too. Tiko\u2019s print bed is flexible, so once your print is done, you simply lift the printer off the bed, then twist to pop off your print. \nAnd with the specially-formulated coating on Tiko's print bed, prints adhere consistently. No more scraping, no blue painter\u2019s tape, and no glue stick shenanigans either.\nYou know what else is flexible? Your choice of filament. Tiko uses non-proprietary 1.75mm filament on a standard 1kg 165mm (6.5 in.) diameter spool, so you can experiment with different materials. Tiko also detects when you\u2019re out of filament and pauses the print so you can reload and resume. \nWires are so 1996. Connect Tiko to the cloud, and you can print from almost anywhere, even from your smartphone. No Wi-Fi? Tiko makes its own wireless access point so you can print directly, too.  \nTiko\u2019s browser-based software is super user-friendly. We\u2019ve already optimized Tiko\u2019s performance, leaving only a few straightforward settings so you can spend more time on your ideas and leave the printing to Tiko.\nTiko\u2019s enclosed build chamber also means children and pets can\u2019t interfere with the liquefier, a small but dangerously hot component that is typically left exposed in other 3D printers. Taking things a step further, Tiko has an onboard accelerometer that automatically shuts the printer down if it\u2019s disturbed.\nThis same accelerometer is used for auto calibration, plus something even cooler. Tiko can measure its own performance, so with your permission, we can use performance data from your printer to help make every Tiko better. This will help us improve our firmware and slicing engine AND keep your Tiko running at peak performance. Everybody wins!\nTiko\u2019s unibody construction also makes it incredibly strong. The stiffness of the frame improves print quality while making Tiko durable and easy to ship.\nBut even with all that strength, unibody makes Tiko surprisingly lightweight.\nBy now you might be wondering: How can a 3D printer this good, with all these features, cost so little? Well, it wasn\u2019t easy. But if you\u2019re not afraid to geek out, neither are we...\nYou emailed us, you asked us technical questions, and we\u2019re happy to deliver. Right off the bat, there are a few things you should know:\n1) Tiko has almost no parts in common with any other 3D printer in the world. Period. With a few exceptions, every component inside Tiko is a bespoke part designed for rapid and inexpensive manufacture.\n2) Every component you see below is a generation or two behind where we actually are. We are in a highly competitive field with rampant product-cloning, so we hold our intellectual property very close to the vest, and a number of these technologies are patent-pending. These older parts worked well, and they\u2019re similar to what\u2019s in the final Tiko, but the latest generation is even better. And secret!\nNow let's get technical...\nONCE AGAIN, UNIBODY\nIt all started with unibody. In most 3D printers, the most expensive (by far) item is the frame. That\u2019s because most 3D printers have a frame built from multiple beams that are fastened together. In delta printers, this frame is often made from three vertical extruded-aluminum beams. We had a simple thought\u2026 what if we extruded all three rails together?\nJust like that, we had it. A unibody chassis. Strong, lightweight, virtually impossible to misalign, but also one we could extrude by the mile at a very low cost. Being made of one piece means no assembly is needed\u2014no fasteners, no alignments, none of that.\nIt\u2019s a simple concept, but an enormous leap forward. And it's only the beginning.\nDELTA\nDeltas really do it better. We don\u2019t want to lecture you on robot kinematics, but it\u2019s no secret that parallel manipulators are inherently more accurate than their gantry/serial counterparts. We\u2019ve said it twice, and we\u2019re proud to say it again. Tiko does not use high-precision mechanical components. Why not?\nBecause we don\u2019t need to! Tiko\u2019s low-part-count parallel-arm mechanism has consistently demonstrated exceptional mechanical repeatability without the use of high-precision rails and linear bearings. That means we can manufacture Tiko using consumer-grade tolerances and relatively simple parts, rather than the crazy-expensive CNC-machine components found in other 3D printers.\nDIRECT-DRIVE SYSTEM\nHaving developed an inexpensive chassis and rails, we didn't want to mess it up with a complicated drive system. Most 3D printers use an eye-popping arrangement of belts, pulleys, and tensioners. Instead, we developed a proprietary direct-drive system in which the motors are mounted onto carriages that drive themselves directly along the rails.\n\nSimple, reliable, and super-inexpensive to make. How we integrated the gear racks into the rails during production, however, is our secret. \nNOTE: Don't worry, we abandoned the above pictured NEMA-14\u2019s ages ago. They were expensive, heavy, and noisy. Tiko now uses a completely different type of motor that has proven far more suitable, and you wouldn\u2019t believe how little it costs. This alone had a major impact on our pricing.\nCUSTOM ELECTRONICS\nOnce we had perfected Tiko\u2019s mechanics, the electronics became the most expensive part of the printer. Most 3D printers use hobbyist electronics, which are great for tinkering but overpriced and underpowered for a consumer-grade product. So, we developed our own.\nTiko\u2019s electronics employ carefully chosen surface-mount components that are optimized for mass manufacture. These make Tiko faster and smarter, while costing less.\nFurthermore, Tiko\u2019s high-efficiency liquefier and motors use only a fraction of the energy required by most 3D printers. This allowed us to use smaller and less expensive electronic components and a standard \u201cbrick\u201d power adapter instead of a bulky PSU, which further reduced costs.\nPASSIVE-COOLED LIQUEFIER\nLastly, there is Tiko\u2019s liquefier assembly. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the only liquefier in the world that can extrude PLA without active cooling\u2014and in an enclosed space at that.\n\nWe spent close to a year getting it right. Why did we bother? Because cooling fans are expensive. Aside from the fan itself, you need a finned heatsink, the wiring to the PCB, the PWM output to drive it, and the added assembly steps to install and wire it in. There\u2019s also the noise, the size (which would compromise print volume) and the problem of dust collecting in the fan/heatsink.\n\nTiko\u2019s one-of-a-kind passive cooled liquefier solves all of these problems, and it's compact, energy efficient, and inexpensive to manufacture.\nAt its core are the carefully designed convection-optimizing heat vents. These vents maximize the upward flow of hot air while shielding the heatsink. The exact specifications are secret, but Tiko's liquefier maintains a remarkably low inlet temperature without any forced airflow\u2014even inside a warm print chamber.\n\nBy incorporating the heat shield into an injection-moldable end effector with integrated ball joints and making a geometrically simple heatsink without any fins, we dropped costs even further.\nTITANIUM NOZZLE\nAchieving our demanding thermal performance criteria also required the use of a one-of-a-kind aerospace-grade Titanium alloy nozzle. The nozzle minimizes conduction to the heatsink without the need for an insulating barrel. The reduced heat flux results in a nozzle that requires very little energy to maintain its temperature, making it exceptionally energy efficient.\nNotice how quickly the temperature drops off. We freakin' LOVE Titanium!\nThis unique nozzle makes for an extremely compact and efficient liquefier, which gives Tiko excellent extrusion control while enabling trouble-free nozzle changing, as no molten filament ever comes into contact with the threads. It also improves print quality by minimizing the effects of radial disturbances in the carriage. \nBut isn't Titanium expensive? Sure it is, but by making the components so small, it actually reduced our costs.\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\nTiko\u2019s cutting-edge technologies and bespoke parts give it a completely different cost structure than any other 3D printer. It wasn't easy, but we did it, and now we're really excited to take the next step and bring Tiko to you.\nNow for $179, you can have a Tiko. What you create with it is up to you.\nAnd first movers can get a Tiko at our limited Earliest Bird ($99) and Early Bird ($139) prices.\nIf you want multiple Tikos\u2014for your whole family or a school or to simply print more things at the same time\u2014multiply $179 by the number you want and set that as your pledge amount (Example: 3 x $179 = $537 for three Tikos). \nNOTE: Multi-Tiko pledges will only be counted in multiples of $179. Earliest/Early Bird prices are limited to one-per-backer.\nOne of the questions we get asked most is, \u201cCan you use your 3D printer to print another 3D printer?\" Well, kind of! For an $18 pledge, you can get a 1/10th scale Baby Tiko Unibody\u2026 that was printed by a Tiko!\nAnd for any pledge amount, you'll be helping make 3D printing accessible and dependable for a new population of inventors who haven't had easy access before now. We'll keep you informed of our progress through consistent campaign updates, and over time we'll share creations from around the world that came to life thanks to your support. \nFULFILLMENT\nWe\u2019ve been working on Tiko for over a year. During that time, we\u2019ve gone through many iterations, developed some remarkable technologies, and created a strong network of manufacturers to form a solid supply chain. With your help, we can initiate the following steps to bring Tiko to you\u2026\nSHIPPING\nIn order to make sure that all backer information is up-to-date so we can ensure fair rates, we will collect shipping fees when we send backer surveys this Fall. Exact shipping rates will vary depending on destination, but will not exceed $65 USD per Tiko.\nTiko rewards will be shipped according to Kickstarter pledge order, starting this November. If you want your Tiko soon, you should move fast!\nWhat is it about us that makes us so different? How were we able to build Tiko, and why are we the ones to deliver? Let\u2019s get better acquainted.\nMatt Gajkowski (Center)\nMatt was born and raised to be an entrepeneur. He believes in simplicity and relentless progress, and he isn't afraid to challenge established ideas. He is the mind behind Tiko's groundbreaking technologies and the muscle that has brought them to market. Matt worked as a freelance product designer before starting Tiko. He now has a vision for the future of 3D printing and the know-how to realize it.\nSharon Charitar (Left)\nSharon gets things done. She handles Tiko's market research, community management, PR, bookkeeping, etc. You name it, she's done it, expertly. An analyst at heart, Sharon finds data that we use to improve our business and our product. She is the glue that holds all of Tiko's operations together and keeps us running smoothly and efficiently.\nMichael Zhang (Right)\nMichael was born in China and moved to Canada at age 12. He is fluent in Mandarin and has many connections back home. Michael leverages this, along with his sharp technical skill set, to work with experienced manufacturers without language or technical barriers. This enabled us to find new ways to manufacture Tiko's bespoke parts and push the envelope on Tiko's performance while reducing manufacturing costs.\nWe\u2019ve worked hard to bring Tiko to this stage, but we couldn\u2019t have done it alone. It was through the patience, support, and enthusiasm of some amazing partners that we\u2019ve made it this far.\nSpark Centre is a non-profit support organization that helps entrepreneurs bring innovative technologies to market. A passionate team, they have supported us since day one. They are the minds behind the $25,000 Ignite competition and the Thrive accelerator program. Before we met Spark, our prototype was held together with tape and popsicle sticks. If you have an idea, talk to them!\nFallon StarterKit takes the same top creative talent that works on Fallon\u2019s high-profile ad campaigns and lets them create crowdfunding campaigns for select projects. Boy are we glad they selected us! This campaign is the result of our extraordinary partnership with Fallon.\nThere are numerous other amazing companies we\u2019ve worked with for manufacturing, legal, accounting, etc. Building a printer is one thing, building a company is another, and it\u2019s because of their hard work that Tiko is ready for you.\nTiko has the potential to make innovation accessible, and we still have many more technologies we look forward to developing. But we can\u2019t do it alone. In the age of Kickstarter, YOU have the power to decide which technologies become realized. With Tiko, we want to return the favor by giving you the power to create. \n\nThank you for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Tiko is only as good as its parts, and up until now, all of those parts have been prototyped using 3D printing and machining. In production, our parts will be made using injection molding and other processes, which means they'll have different tolerances and mechanical properties than those we\u2019ve prototyped. If any of these changes compromises performance, we will have to go back and tool them again. This is not a fast process.\n\nFurthermore, we will not release a printer that doesn't meet our high standards, so we'll run endurance tests on every single aspect of Tiko until it's ready. This too, takes time. If something doesn\u2019t pass, it has to be analyzed, fixed, re-tooled, and re-tested.\n\nYou get the idea\u2014perfecting groundbreaking technologies isn't a quick or easy process. As a result, our biggest challenge is getting it right quickly. We don\u2019t want to rush or it will show in the final product, but we also don\u2019t want you to wait a day more than necessary. We feel confident about our timeline, and we have expert manufacturing partners who are eager to speed up the process, but our biggest challenge is staying on schedule.\n\nOther than that, you can sit back and relax\u2014with Tiko, you\u2019re going to get everything you hoped for and then some!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Section 4 Compliance", "update_content": "Hello everyone,  \nIt has been quite some time since we last spoke, and it\u2019s time to bring you up to speed.
