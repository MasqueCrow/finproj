We have included an approximate USD conversion for all the reward tiers and add-ons. The project goal of $12,000 AUD is approximately $9,000 USD.\nMedieval Playing Cards is the original deck created by Egor Klyuchnyk from Anomaly world studio in collaboration with Elephant Playing cards.\nInspired by fearless knights, severe lords and gorgeous queens, Medieval is a fully custom hand-drawn deck with one way courts in the original old style of playing card decks. From the card stock to the construction of the tuckbox, Medieval is designed to transport you back in time with a contemporary twist!\nSilver and Gold edition decks with Foil (to be unlocked!)\n   These new decks have been created to show all beauty of the Medieval Age and inspired by the great artist - Diego Vel\u00e1squez. Through this deck we want you to feel this epoch, and experience its elegance and grandeur. We present two types of decks: First, the Silver Unlimited Edition, and second the Gold Limited Edition for those who want to stand out.\nUnlimited SILVER Edition\n   Limited GOLD Edition\n Features of the decks:\nPrinted by Legends Playing Cards Company.\nThicker Robusto card stock for a genuine medieval feel.\nRed wax-style seal.\nIntricate custom numbered seal on the Limited Gold deck (if unlocked)\nAuthentic out-of-the box tuck flap packaging.\nBeautiful and Intricate 2-way back design for both decks.\nUnique coat of arms for each suit- subtle background design. \nCard Backs (click for higher resolution)\n  Note about the out-of-the-box tuck flap\nSeveral people have commented how impractical this will be for continual use - this is not the case! Once the seal is broken and the deck opened, the flap will fold back inside the tuckbox just like a normal deck. It is the same size and will function exactly the same as a normal deck after opening. We have chosen to use this construction method to emulate old-style decks, but with the ability to convert back if you want to. It is unique and looks awesome, but once you open it it will work just like another (but better) deck of cards!\n    Medieval playing cards were created with one way faces harking back to the old style playing cards to represent nobility in all their glory.

These sugar skulls are very colorful and whimsical, not scary at all. I absolutely love the Sugar Skull style used for the Day of the Dead.\nIn terms of meaning, the skull symbolizes death but in a positive manner. In Mexico it is believed that death is not the final stage in one\u2019s life but rather a step forward into a higher level of conscience.\nCALAVERAS DE AZ\u00daCAR Playing Cards - Black - Printed by the USPCC \n   Limited run of 2500 decks\n  One thing that makes sugar skulls stand out from other skull-related creations is how jolly it looks. Most depictions of the skull are either creepy or morbid, but sugar skulls are happy and cheerful ones. The reason for this is because they want to capture the joy and spirit of their deceased loved ones.\nThe symbolism of a sugar skull is rooted in the decoration around the eyes. Flowers are meant to symbolize life, while cobwebs symbolize death. The skulls are designed to be bright and cheerful, being a celebration of the life that once was.\n                      T-Shirt Design\n  T-Shirts are 100% Fine Cotton\nSizes: S, M, L, XL, 2XL (Mens and Womens sizes)\n$23 per T-Shirt ($26 for International) \nUncut Sheets\nThe front side of the CALAVERAS DE AZ\u00daCAR uncut sheet (frame not included).\nDimensions: 22 X 26.5\" \nThey show every card in the deck, front and back\nPackaging: Rolled up and shipped in a cardboard tube\nColors available: Black or Blue\n$35 per Uncut Sheet ($55 for International)\n  CALAVERAS DE AZ\u00daCAR Playing Cards - Blue - Printed by the USPCC - Limited run of 2500 decks  \n                      WALL ART\nPosters:\nPoster Size: 12 x 18 \nONLY 50 of each Available\nSigned and Numbered\n$30 per Poster ($45 for International) \nAvailable in Black / Blue\nPaper Stock: Standard heavyweight: 80 lb. stock with matte finish\n    Canvas Prints:\nLimited Edition\nONLY 5 OF EACH SIZE ARE AVAILABLE \nSigned and Numbered\nChoose from 6 sizes to suit any interior space \nArchival-quality inks won't fade over time\nComes ready to hang with hinged hardware\nBlack / Blue\n       CALAVERAS DE AZ\u00daCAR Playing Cards - PURPLE - LIMITED EDITION \n500 decks ONLY!

Designer playing cards with attitude.\nRemember us?\nThe Buzz:\nIn April 2015, over 500 people from all over the world contributed to the Kickstarting of the Joker and the Thief Playing Card Company. We released our debut deck - a completely custom, foil-covered deck of playing cards that oozed attitude. The design that you helped create was a hit, and is now loved by people around the world, all thanks to you! \nWe're extremely proud of the original deck and its general reception. It won a place on Kardify's Top 12 Decks of 2015! We were interviewed by ABC Local Radio Australia and the Local Newspaper. The original deck recently won third place in United Cardists' \"2015: Deck of the Year Contest\" for three categories - Best Ace of Spaces, Best Jokers and Best Tuck Box. The deck also landed a spot within the Top 100 Hot New Releases in Toys and Games on Amazon, as well as being featured on Art of Play, Cardvolution, and Gambler's Warehouse - three of the biggest playing card retailers on the planet. \nWe\u2019ve been absent for a while, but now we\u2019re back! The Joker and the Thief return with a striking and luxurious colour way \u2013 White and Gold.\nJoker and the Thief: White Gold Edition \nSharp. Streamline. Sublime\nTuck box photography by our friend Fabien Defaucheux. Check out his work on Instagram - @Fabiendefaucheux\n In collaboration with our artist Pedro Oyarbide, we originally sought to create a deck that was distinctly unique amongst other decks of playing cards on the market. We focussed on 100% custom illustration, striking details, eye-catching packaging and deep connotation evident through symbolic design. \nTo add to the mythology that the Joker and the Thief Playing Cards evoke, we decided to create a white and gold edition. This creates a third dimension of meaning, contrasting the darkness of the original deck with the light colour scheme of the second edition. This builds upon the conflict between life and mortality that is apparent on the back design. The Joker and the Thief emerge from the shadows more beautiful than ever.\nThe Back Design\nJoker and the Thief: White Gold Edition rocks a metallic gold, inverted colour scheme.\nA thought provoking dynamic of mysticism and myth.\nThe first step in creating the original cards was to create a unique back design. One that not only had an intricately beautiful design but one that both appealed aesthetically and sentimentally. It had to be thought provoking. From the first sketches to the end product, it slowly developed its own flair, and this continues throughout the deck! \nThe back design is one way; it is perhaps one of, if not, the most unobtrusive and functional major one-way design on a deck of cards.\nThis allows for a unique story and symbolism to be evoked; metaphors of life and mortality, thievery, lies, deceit, power, mysticism, struggle, and love. We see the opposition of the King and Joker, the way they oppose each other, each being attacked by a viper, a symbol that despite their contrast, both share the same fate. The chained hands, both of flesh and bone, represent mortality. They hold cards; life holds the ace of spades, the death card, and the skeletal holds a card with a skull on it, representing the inevitability of death. The chains and manacles link the Joker and the Thief, and the daggers represent the danger of their opposition.\nThe Joker and the Thief: White Gold Edition features an inverted back design sporting bright gold metallic ink for gorgeous shimmer in sunlight. \nThe Ace of Spades \nIconic. Draped in Gold.\nA bold statement. The ace of spades is the source of the original deck's identity.\nJoker and the Thief's debut Ace of Spades returns\nThe Court Cards\n12 Completely Custom Court Cards\nThe court cards are all completely custom, illustrated from scratch. The themes that you see on the back design can be seen here. You may even start to see a story forming as you shuffle through them. We have created something different. We have done away with borders to free the courts - to make use of the space and to make each of them distinct and prominent characters.\n\"12 court cards, dressed with charisma and distinct in character - royalty ready for battle.\" - Art of Play\nThe Joker and The Thief \nThe Two Troublemakers Return. \nThe Joker and The Thief\nThe Tuck Box \nPeppered with Lavish Touches.\nBy far the most praised aspect of the original deck of Joker and the Thief Playing Cards was the tuck box, which was adorned with a heavy amount of silver foil hot stamped on both the exterior and interior of the box. Now we have dressed the second edition in a beautiful white and gold colour scheme. \nWith gold foil stamping, embossing, a perforated blood red tax stamp seal now featuring gold foil, and a new uncoated matte finish for the white stock - this version is bound to stand out amongst your collection. Impress your friends with a deck that many are calling a conversation starter!\nThis tuck case will look amazing on your poker nights, pulling them out to perform to a spectator, residing on a shelf amonst your prized collection, or featured in an opening shot of one of your Cardistry Videos. \nBeautiful and extravagant tuck boxes are going to be a consistent feature of the Joker and the Thief brand moving into the future.\nInterior Hot Foil Stamping\nDesigned with Handling in Mind\nLightened and Improved. Taking full advantage of design and composition.\nAs a more refined version of the original deck, the White Gold edition had to be lightened, and stripped back. By inverting the back design, it not only created an elegant aesthetic, but it also significantly cuts the amount of ink saturation within the card stock. This takes full advantage of the composition of Classic Finish. By stripping back a significant amount of Joker and the Thief\u2019s ink, this deck should possess a far snappier; far more responsive and papery feel in comparison to the original deck. \nThe Bells and Whistles \nAll the features you want, know and love!\nThinner Borders\n100% Custom Pips, Fonts, Court Cards and Art Work\nUpdated Colour Scheme\nGold and Silver Metallic Inks (Faces and Backs)\nInterior Tuck Case Gold Foil Stamping \nExterior Tuck Case Embossing + Hot Stamped Gold Foil Coverage\nDramatic Ink Saturation Reduction \nCLASSIC Stock and Finish for Improved Handling\nMatte Finish Tuck Case Paper\nTraditionally Cut for Smooth Edges\nPerforated Blood Red Tax Stamp Style Seal now with Gold Foil\nManufacturing\nThe Expert Playing Card Company will manufacture the second edition of Joker and the Thief Playing Cards. This ensures that you receive the highest quality product possible, and a deck of playing cards that is both incredibly durable and handles amazingly. \nJoker and the Thief: White Gold Edition will sport the highly acclaimed CLASSIC Stock and Finish. To take full advantage of this type of stock and finish, this edition will feature a reduction of ink saturation due to its inverted back design. This, along with being traditionally cut, ensures snappier, smoother, crisper and more responsive cards for maximised performance.\nThis praised finish has both the snappiness and durability of EPCC's previous decks combined with the more papery feel and slick finish of a traditional USPCC deck. It is the best of both worlds.\nLEFT: Standard USPCC Cutting. RIGHT: Precision Cutting (Our Manufacturer) EPCC\nFulfilment Service\nTo ensure that your decks arrive safely and quickly, Art of Play will be returning to fulfil the Joker and the Thief: Gold Edition deck.

My name is James Milaras, and I am the co-founder and owner of the Joker and the Thief Playing Card Company. \nSecondly, we're very thankful here at Joker and the Thief for you guys, our backers! Last year, you made something very special happen. My best friend and business partner, Reuben, and I wanted to create a special deck of playing cards. Creating a deck of cards was our dream ever since we first got into cards. Our backers made that a reality! You will always be apart of team Joker and the Thief.\nReuben Nutt, while still collaborating with us has since moved town to pursue other interests. His continued efforts in creating beautiful video and photographic content for Joker and the Thief has been outstanding. Of course a shout out to our beast of an illustrative team member, Pedro Oyarbide, for his amazing work on this project as well as an upcoming monster of a project.\nWith that said there is even more cool stuff from us this year! Joker and the Thief: Dystopia is coming (*winks*). If you don't know who we are, here's a little something that will bring you up to speed with us!\nJoker and the Thief was founded by two Australian Cardists, videographers and photographers that have huge love for all things playing cards.\nBack in 2012, we started up a YouTube channel called Joker and the Thief Card Deck Reviews. Through this we collaborated with Art of Play. We got together on our weekends, and in our spare time to go out and location scout to shoot. We then edited in house, usually side by side, listening to music and fuelled by snacks. We had minimal equipment and a very small budget (if there really was one) Oh the joys of indie film making!\nWe sought to change the way deck reviews were made and in doing so, many adventures were had along the way. Since we didn't have a car at the time, our bikes and our legs were the main source of transport in our city, if we were to shoot on location. With little time, little transport, a budget of... not much, and our favourite Youtubers, Film Makers, and Cardists as our inspiration, we slowly but surely developed our skills. We had some truly memorable moments along the way. We always knew that we were going to create a deck of cards... one day. And here we are - Round 2! \nWe've done this once guys! We can do it again.

We are confident that this Kickstarter campaign will be an even smoother process than our last project. \n\nAs with any project, there are risks and challenges involved. We ensure that our methods are simple. Outsourcing will once again allow for a very smooth and successful campaign.\n\nShipping:\n\n- We are enlisting Art of Play to handle the shipping of your decks. So as soon as the Expert Playing Card Company has finished manufacturing the cards, the stock will then be sent to Art of Play's warehouse in San Diego, California. The shipping of the stock to Art of Play may take up to three weeks. There is a possibility that this process may be slightly delayed, but in case that this happens, you will be updated.\n\n- Your orders will promptly be packed and sent out to wherever you are in the world. If you have ever received a package from Art of Play, you will know that their packages are secure and every deck arrives in immaculate condition. You will also receive a tracking number for your rewards!\n\n- We expect the cards to be shipping out to you in [Insert Date]. If earlier you'll be updated. We'd rather over-promise than under-deliver.\n\nProduction:\n\n- As it stands, the files have been at EPCC prior to the launch of this campaign. So, as soon as we hit our goal, we will give Expert the all clear to start production.\n\n- When the campaign is successful and has concluded half the job will be done. It may take 3-4 weeks for manufacturing time. There is always a possibility that a delay or a problem can occur in terms of manufacturing. Expert Playing Card Company has an excellent work ethic and will work hard to ensure that no issues come up, and if they do, will be sorted quickly.\n\n- It is important to note that we also receive physical and digital proofs from Expert that must be approved. Since we are based in Australia allow for up to 2 weeks for us to receive these proofs and confirm them. We need to make sure that you are guaranteed quality. \n\nUpdates:\n\n- As soon as we hear something, you will too. Our updates section will be our platform to announce anything new to you.\n\nOther Rewards:\n\n- For those who pledge for posters, they will be produced, signed, packaged and shipped in house. We will make sure that your posters are sent out as early as possible.\n\nThanks very much for visiting our campaign page and backing!

We have published 10 titles so far, with 4 of them - Progress: Evolution of Technology, Exodus: Edge of Extinction, Mistfall and Simurgh - financed through Kickstarter.\n\nOur delivery track record is so far impeccable, each project was finalized and delivered before or by the deadline, in spite of tight self-imposed schedules. Simurgh, funded in December 2015 is due to be delivered in May 2015, right on schedule. However, we are aware that each project has its own specific challenges and we plan to reduce the risk through careful planning and contingency measures.\n\nWith four successful projects we are making use of our experiences to improve our processes and further decrease any risks. As In the Name of Odin is our fifth Kickstarter campaign, we already know the ropes, and with the time used to prepare not only the game, but also the campaign itself, we are ready to face any possible challenges.\n\nOur goal with In the Name of Odin is to produce the game within 90 days from the campaign end, and to deliver before the end of August 2016. We already have a detailed production and shipping plan in place.\n\nThe new challenge with In the Name of Odin is the presence of plastic miniatures. This is a new technology with which we have some degree of experience (Exodus had plastic miniatures) but we have enrolled the help of experts in this field.\n\nThe fulfillment will be handled by the same companies that helped us deliver Progress, Exodus and Mistfall. We're already familiar with their systems and vice-versa, thus we expect little to no delays on this front.\n\nAlthough In the Name of Odin is fully developed and the artwork is 75% ready, we are also prepared for unexpected delays. In the worst case scenario, finalizing the art could add delays of max. 10 days, production of some extra 25 days and shipping & customs may add 10-15 days.\n\nWe are experienced at dealing with large production runs, and we are preparing backup plans for each step of our project, starting from production, through shipping, to final delivery.\n\nWith all of the above points in mind, we estimate that there is a 80% chance of a delivery at or before the deadline and only a 20% chance of a 30 days delay.\n\nMISSING/DAMAGED ITEMS\n\nBecause we are dealing with a large number of games produced, packed and shipped, there is always a chance for human error or damaged parts. If such a thing happens, please check out our customer support page on www.nskn.net and we will send you replacements with all due haste.

Please, follow us as we show you our project.\nThe deck, named Teliad Heren, represents nature, life, harmony, not \u201cpeace\u201d since Humans, Orcs, Elves and Dwarves do battle and confront themselves. The back has elements from the four races and fuses them together in a new, innovative way. Gold foiling will embellish the tuck case (even without the stretch goal)\nThe back from Teliad Heren is a summary of all the graphic elements from the four races\nThe indices have a peculiar style, inspired by the runic alphabet\nThe Elves (clubs)\nThe Humans (hearts)\nThe jokers - inspired to the classic Dal Negro joker\nA big summary with the faces of Teliad Heren\nAlfrin stands for \u201cimmortal\u201d and depicts the fantasy world of Teliad in an timeless, eternal life. That\u2019s why Teliad Alfrin is decorated with gold and silver ink. All the colors of the characters will be printed in two layers: an underlying metallic ink and a CMYK print on top.\nAlfrin will be limited to 1000 decks, and never printed again.\nAlfrin tuck case with green foil and DRAGONSCALE paper\nAlfrin hearts and diamonds\nAlfrin clubs and spades\nAlfrin jokers\nThe king of hearts in all his regal glory\nThe bold Queen of spades\nDwarves in heaven? Why not! They are hard workers, they deserve some peace\nThe brave Jack of spades\nThe dragon back of Teliad Alfrin. Green and silver ink\nWith Teliad d\u00f9r (obscurity), Darkness enters the world of Teliad. Dark colors, silver ink and new, twisted, details for all the court cards are the key features of this deck.\nTeliad d\u00f9r is a stretch goal: when unlocked, pledges will change as stated in their description.\nThe tuck case in its (evil) glory\nThe king of hearts, after being corrupted by Darkness\nThe fine details of the back\nHow number cards and pips will look in Teliad d\u00f9r\nPassione relies on LPCC for printing its own premium decks. LPCC is a reliable partner, already involved in the Love is a Smoke project.\nTeliad will be printed with Elite finish.\nLPCC's attention to details is \"legendary\"\nA statement from LPCC: \"At Legends PCC, our primary focus is producing the world\u2019s finest playing cards for people who appreciate quality. Constantly staying on top of worldwide printing advances, we seek to apply these to playing card manufacturing and packaging design. With this project, we are looking forward to trying out a new and never before used paper stock for packaging, a premiere Italian paper supplier with a wide selection of brand new paper varieties. Quality and consistency is paramount when dealing with paper, and when you print with Legends, we can closely match the feel and durability of any of our in-house decks.\"\nLPCC masters the art of printing playing cards\n\nThis time Passione Playing Cards together with LPCC will bring out custom tuck cases for the first time from a renowned Italian company, a leader in paper manufacturing: Fedrigoni.\n...you won't find a finest paper than Fedrigoni's\n\nFedrigoni is not a new player in the market. It actually created the market itself, the Fedrigoni Group was born in 1717 AD. Now Fabriano is part of the Fedrigoni Group, it is worthwhile to remember that Fabriano invented modern paper, working on it since 1264 AD. It\u2019s one of the most ancient \u201cmade in Italy\u201d products you can think of.\nWe are still in the process of selecting the right paper for each tuck case.\nAfter the main goal we already prepared some stretch goals. When Teliad d\u00f9r is unlocked, tiers with more than one deck will have it included.\nDuring the campaign you will be able to customize your pledge by adding decks, uncut sheets or other objects unlocked during the campaign. You can't add Teliad Alfrin decks (the limited ones), but you can add uncuts.\nHeren uncut (front)\nHeren uncut (back)\nAlfrin uncut (only back for now ;-) )\nThe leather pouch\nThey speak about us:\nMaxPlayingCards 1: TELIAD Playing Cards.

Luxury for the modern cardician.\nThe Design\nA merger of form and function\nWe wanted to create a worker's deck. A pack of 52 cards that merges form with function. Using a classical approach to design, the goal was to develop a look that is familiar, but fresh. The elegant repeating pattern evokes the decks that have survived the test of time. Black Mint Playing Cards are luxury for the modern cardician.\nHandling\nBlack Mint will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company on the highest quality card stock.\nAfter we established the look, we focused on the feel. The true mark of a card is how it handles. The Black Mint deck will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company on the highest quality card stock available. It will be coated with the legendary Air Cushion Finish to provide for the smoothest spread, fans, and shuffles. \nCustom Faces\nClassic court cards with a modern touch of MINT.\nEverything about the Black Mint Deck is custom. The faces include custom fonts, pips, court cards, and Ace of Spades,  but we were careful to maintain the classic playing card look that we have all grown to recognize and love.\nBy Magicians, for Magicians\nThe back design features an intuitive marking system for magicians to take clever advantage of.\nOur goal is to create harmony between the card and the cardician. Black Mint playing cards are a tool; and like great magic, they hide their best kept secret in plain sight. An innovative marking system opens up and endless world of possibilities. We have also included several gaff cards to help you perform special effects that you couldn't with an average deck.\nExtra Cards Include a double backer and a double facer.\n'Edge 52' Online Instructional Course\nEach deck comes with an instructional course teaching you powerful effects with your deck.\nStudents of 52Kards know that we are also invested in the education of magic. Each Black Mint deck will come bundled with a free in depth instructional course that will teach you how to effectively use the built in marking system and included gaff cards. The course will also cover the use of a variety of other gimmicks in card magic.\nThe course will include chapters on the use of marked cards, duplicate cards, double backers, double facers, short cards, tapered cards, crimped cards, and more.\nIf you have been learning magic and sleight of hand technique from 52Kards.com or the 52Kards Youtube channel, then you will LOVE this course.\nRaspberry Mint\nMany backers have been asking if we will eventually produce a Mint deck that has a colored back design. This has been our intention all along as The Mint Collection is meant to be a complete line of playing cards with the Black Mint being the launch edition. The next edition we have planned is the Raspberry Mint deck (think the Black Mint deck, except in a beautiful shade of red), and we were originally going to release it next year sometime... However, due to the massive success of this project we are getting the Raspberry Mints printed at the same time as the Black Mints!\nA mockup of the Raspberry Mint Deck. The exact shade of red may be subject to change.\nIf this stretch goal is reached, then backers will be given the opportunity to choose how many Black Mint decks and how many Raspberry Mint decks they want to get with their pledged money. \nRaspberry Mints will also be available as a $10 add on. They will NOT be limited, and will continue to be sold at 52Kards.com after they are printed. \n The cards and tuck boxes will include all of the same features as the Black Mint deck (markings system, custom seal, embossed/foiled box, gaff cards, etc). \n Once the campaign is over we will be sending out a survey to all of the backers and you will be given the opportunity to add any additional decks to your reward package.\n Limited Edition\nWe have a BIG update to the Black Mint Playing Cards Kickstarter project! In order to celebrate the massive support the project has already received we are introducing a new LIMITED EDITION Black Mint Deck! It's a beautiful tri-color design with gold line accents on a borderless card(see the picture below to behold it's full glory!). The borderless back is perfectly suitable for the Black Mint design and the touch of gold adds a rich aesthetic to the pattern.\nA beautiful tri-color design with gold line accents on a borderless card.\nLimited Edition Black Mint.\nLimited Edition & standard Black Mints Limited Edition & standard Black.\nHere's a few important points:\nThe Limited Edition Black Mint will be available exclusively through this Kickstarter project and will never be for sale again after the campaign is over. The regular Black Mint cards will be available at 52Kards.com once they are printed; although Kickstarter backers will be getting them sooner and at a discounted price. \n The Limited Edition decks cost $15 each. To reserve your decks, simply add $15 to your pledge per deck. We will send out a survey at the end of the campaign to find out exactly what you want your pledged money to go towards.  Each person is allowed to purchase a maximum of 6x decks per person. We will strictly be enforcing this rule to keep these decks truly limited in nature. \n The intuitive Mint Marking System will still be included in the Limited Edition decks. \nWe are keeping the tuck box design a surprise for now, but trust us when we say it's going to be especially handsome. \nLimited Edition Black Mints are only available to backers of this project. After March 2nd you will no longer be able to become a backer. \n If you don't know how to manage your pledge and add more money to your contribution you can see this video for more information:\nAdd Ons\nBlack Mint Deck - $10 per deck\nRaspberry Mint Deck - $10 per deck\nLimited Edition Black Mint Deck - $15 per deck\nMint Stripper Deck - $15 per deck\nBlack Mint Uncut Sheet - $40 each\nRaspberry Mint Uncut Sheet - $40 each\nLimited Edition Uncut Sheet - $50 each\nStretch Goals\nFree USA Shipping when you get 6 decks or more\n Would you like to add extra rewards to your pledge level? Click this video to see how.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenge is getting enough funding to get the decks printed. The United States Playing Card Company requires a minimum order of 2,500 decks in order for them to print your design. As you can imagine, this amounts to a large amount of money, which is why we are asking for your support in this Kickstarter campaign.\n\nEverything else is ready to go. Once we have the funds we will be ready to print. Your rewards will be sent to you as soon as production is complete, which we expect to be in June of 2016 (hopefully sooner).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "MINT 2 is Coming...", "update_content": "Hey Backers!!!

Back of this deck will be printed with exclusive real gold based pigment inks. First ever new debosing technology will be used to produce Velvet tuck box with extreme detailing of debossing pattern. Deck will include white cover \"jacket\" with gold foil stamped logo. Custom shape and design for numbered seals which could contain owner's name. \nOnly very limited amount of decks will be printed (400 decks only) and only 370 decks will be available on Kickstarter. \nWe use FREE WORLDWIDE registered airmail delivery to every backer.\nName of the deck was inspired by Branle, 12th-century French chain dance adopted (c. 1450\u2013c. 1650) by European aristocrats, especially in France and in England, where the word branle was anglicized as \u201cbrawl.\u201d Aristocrats frequently performed pantomimic branles in which they scolded each other like washerwomen or courted (as in the branle de Poitou, the possible ancestor of the minuet). Certain branles, especially in France, were designated for specific age groups, such as the lively branle de Bourgogne for the youngest dancers.\nBranle Playing Cards deck portrays history and culture of XVI-XVII centuries. Each of the suits can be associated with a particular European country. For example, the peaks - Britain, hearts - France, clubs - Spain and diamonds - Eastern Europe (Rzeczpospolita, Transylvania, Hungary). Suits are not linked to these countries directly, but the association is undoubtedly present.

We are now back with another exciting deck of playing cards inspired by femininity, but more importantly, using the latest in printing and manufacturing technology.\nImpressions Foil Femme by MPC\nMPC Ace of Spades with foil back\nThe Femme Deck\nFollowing on the huge success of our previous projects where we used high gloss, touch and feel printing technology to playing cards, which has had such widespread appeal and have definitely grown way above our expectations, we have been working altogether again on creating another card deck concept.\nWhile there are many playing card designs out there, there seemed to be not that many decks in the industry using softer tones such as pastel colors which is a surprise. The Femme deck is a concept deck inspired by beauty, femininity, love and romance. We finalized on pink and mint colors which were chosen carefully from research of reports of popular colors which could represent this concept.  The outcome of using the combination of these colors with raised high gloss embossing with metallic printing technology are absolutely beautiful and we're proud to share it with everyone. We introduce to you, the all new Impressions Foil Femme Playing Cards.\nThe Impressions Foil Femme decks are pretty much amazing and definitely playing cards that you'll not have seen before with this kind of beauty. With an added \u201ctouch and feel\u201d dimension to a well-established product, which we introduced to the gaming industry, feeling the touch of the cards is an exciting experience in itself.\nClose-up of card back\nWho's it for?\nThese playing cards are for everyone. Despite its femininity themed colors, they will appeal to all as there's no denying the colors coupled with this technology is a great match.\nMint deck\nPink deck\nThe astoundingly shiny foil back playing cards with raised UV printing is the first of its kind in the playing cards industry. What's more, they can very much be played with like a normal CMYK printed deck and with superb performance. We have had countless number of testing of prototypes. Keeping these cards true as a deck of cards, we are using professional playing cards grade air pocketed paper card stock (linen) with a black core center layer.\nDeveloping this deck is possible only through our skilled workforce and dedication to do what others have not done before. The knowledge that our mother company QP Group has acquired in its 33 years history and its ongoing investments in the latest technology, manufacturing methods and people have allowed us to create this exceptionally special Impressions Foil range.\nTechnology\nThe technology used behind our Impressions Foil Femme Playing Cards is a mix of traditional manufacturing methods plus state of the art secondary process industrial machinery. In short, we apply embossed gloss UV using pinpoint accuracy on state of the art machinery onto a layer of thin foil on the complex card back design which produces the outstandingly attractive and shiny metallic card back look.\nThe high gloss is very different to traditional spot UV as this revolutionary technology can produce a raise of up 250 microns in polymer height (which is Braille). We can also control the density of polymer applied, which is a ground breaking technology in printed materials.\nOur signature high gloss UV is widely acclaimed due to its glossiness and characteristics to enable players to touch and feel the cards. Reaching 99GU gloss, which is the highest possible on printed material, giving the foil layer an extra shine, further strengthening the metallic shine experience.\nComparison with normal printed cards\nThe Impressions Foil Femme Playing Cards are produced on 310gsm linen professional grade paper card stock. This is one of the top card stock that MPC offers, with black core center layer and equipped with an air pocketed surface creating a fantastically smooth handling experience.\nHandling\nWe believe that playing cards is definitely an art, but at the same time, we don\u2019t want to just create an art piece. We at MPC make sure that all cards that we produce are absolutely playable and would offer an exceptional handling experience for those of us who need it such as magicians and cardistry enthusiasts. You can see how they perform in the project video.\nOne handed fan\nDesign\nOn releasing playing cards under our MPC brand, we also developed our own unique playing card design to go with it. Our signature back consists of a symmetrical illustration of a fully grown tree.\nMPC tree back\nWe need trees to make paper and as a responsible paper product manufacturer and print company, QP devotes endless resources to help create a better environment by enforcing recycling efforts and expanding usage of recycled materials on mass productions. We have chosen a tree design to remind ourselves of our roots and values. The card face of these Impressions Foil cards adopts a standard design for practicality. All artwork were fully redrawn to create this design unique to MPC.\nThe Femme decks comes in colors pink and mint tree back, making it the perfect addition to your collection and more importantly, can become your everyday deck of cards for entertainment and performance.\nStretch goal\n$15K - Once we reach this funding goal, we will upgrade our regular seals on each tuck box to the special gold signed MPC seal.\nWe're working on more surprises.\nMetallic Tuck box\nThe tuck box contains a layer of thin foil and the revolutionary high gloss UV technology to apply different levels of polymer (very glossy raised ink) to certain parts of the artwork to form a touch and feel effect.\nFoiled tuck boxes\nUncut sheets\nWe have the Pink and Mint foil back uncut sheets available through our ULTIMATE COLLECTORS pledge or you can buy them individually for $30 each as an add-on.\nGifts\nAs always we\u2019re hoping to be able to include a gift for all our backers.

We plan on releasing several decks (or series) a year and each of these decks will have a different theme. We have always loved that look of the Minimalist art style and in what you can convey with just simple lines, blacks & whites and solid bold coloring. It is a style that is very unique and really stands out.\nOur face cards are the 10's, Jacks, Queens, Kings, Aces, and Jokers. These have what we refer to as \"Figure Art\".\nOur pip cards are the 2-9 and have what we refer to as \"Element Art\".\nWe spent a lot of time and went through several versions when developing the card back. This ultimately was the one we decided to use. It is a completely mirrored back and works on several visual levels.\nTop - Standard Deck / Bottom - Miniverse Deck\nOne of our all time favorite tuck boxes is the Heretic set by Stockholm 17. It is a thing of beauty in its nearly all black design. Right from the start, we knew we wanted to keep that minimalist look throughout everything and it made sense to make our tuck box very stark. Bits of color, mostly blacks and greys, and with just enough information on it so you knew what deck you had in your hands.\nStandard Tuck Box\nPrices include S&H costs.

It is basically the equivalent to a red poker deck... while the standard deck would be considered a black poker deck.\nNew Features - Back of the cards are now red (of course). All the King cards have different & new figures not seen in the standard deck. The background behind the main art for the front of the cards is reversed. Alternative versions of the Joker cards. Alternative red colored tuck box.\nMiniverse Deck\nUNCUT SHEET ($40 US / World - Email for Quote)\nThis is a 310 GSM Linen Finish Uncut Sheet.

Comes in either a Hardcover bound edition or a digital PDF edition.\n(*BONUS - Hardcover also includes the Digital PDF Book version as well)\n\nSo what has changed from the previous campaign?\n1. MPC will now handle all the card production. This way it makes things a bit more manageable for us.\n2. Much lower funding goal of only $2100.00 instead of the original $8000.00. This one should easily be obtainable.\n3. Deck prices are a little bit cheaper... for the most part. We've tried to pass those savings onto our backers. Every little bit helps nowadays.\n4. We've put up all new and really interesting Add-On's for you to get. Some we have never seen offered before in a campaign, Please check those out above.\n5. We had to remove some of the previous characters. BUT, there are new ones in their place that are just awesome. Check them all out.\n6. All the artwork has been improved and enhanced. The background have a more 3D look and feel to it and all the figures have a slight shadow behind them that makes them seem like they are jumping off the card. Really cool looking stuff.\n7. Our backers had suggested easier to read cards. Well... you asked for it and you got it. First, we made the numbers/pips and suits much larger. Next, we removed the right handed side numbers/pips in favor of a more streamlined look, as well as, going back to the industry standard of Red/Black coloring on all the cards.\nI noticed that Mighty Heroic Minis states it is Series 1.1. What does this mean?\nIt just simply means that this is Series 1 Deck 1. \nSo... series 1 will always be your Mighty Heroic Minis. In the future, if we do a second deck of all new characters, it would be Mighty Heroic Minis \u2013 Series 1.2 or Series 1 Deck 2. That way you always know what specific deck you have in your hands.\nI see there is a tier that has a \u201cLimited Edition\u201d Mighty Heroic Minis LE deck. What is that?\nIt is truly a unique deck of cards. It uses MPC\u2019s new High Gloss technique for printing. So far there have been about 5 or so decks on the market that use it. But, when you see them, you will be blown away. I was stunned on how beautiful and different they are than anything else out there. Check out this video to see what we are talking about.\nPLAY\n\nHow are the funds going to be used?\nTwo Geeks Gaming is a small design company specializing in Card Games, Tabletop Games and Custom Artwork. We have invested thousands of dollars into getting the company started and designing this one deck. We also have three more decks planned for release in the upcoming 2016 year. \nSo the bottom line is this... if there are any profits made from this campaign, it will go right back into development for our next deck and future projects.\n Twogeeksgaming01@gmail.com\nRead about us here\nRead about us here\n                ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe artwork, design, planning, and budgeting has already been completed.

I started the design over 1 year ago, and I have continuously improved on since I wanted to make an elegant and intriguing version.\nBEFORE-AFTER, SPOT THE DIFFERENCES :)\nIn this case the face of the Queen Of Spades has been modified\nAbout the production: The deck will be printed by Expert Playing Card Company (EPCC) with classic finish. The goal for this deck is a little high because the deck is full of features and the production costs are very high (twice a normal deck). I need to produce at least 2000 units to keep the production costs affordable.\nAbout me: Requiem Team is just me, one-man-band. My name is Lorenzo, I live and work in Stockholm, Sweden. Designing and illustrating playing cards is my passion and this is my 4th Kickstarter campaign; the previous three have been funded and fulfilled, just take a look at Requiem, Heretic and No17. I hope you like No.17 Le Chat Rouge and that you want to support it by backing and sharing. Thank you for being here! :)\nIn every campaign I run, I give gifts to the backers ;) but there are a few rules about those.\nFirst of all, the gifts are not add-ons. Only the copper coin and the uncut tuck-box sheet, and the normal decks can be added on top of your pledge.\nThe gifts are automatically assigned during the shipping process. If the guys at the fulfillment center pack one deck, they will put the gift for one deck. If they pack 2 decks, they will put the gifts for 2 decks, etc etc.\ngifts overview\nHere is how it works:\nIf you have one deck, you get one sticker. \nIf you have 2 or 3 decks, you get one sticker and one button pin. \nIf you have 4 decks, you get one sticker, one button, and one magnet with bottle opener. \nIf you have 6 decks, you get one sticker, one button, one magnet with bottle opener, and one half-brick box for your 6 decks. \nIf you have 12 decks (or brick), you get one sticker, one button, one magnet with bottle opener, 2 half-brick boxes for your decks, and one copper coin. \nIf you are in the 17er reward, you get all.\nAll the court cards (J,Q,K) are illustrated and the 4 aces are big and ornate. The pips (2 to 10) are improved, and the jokers are \"jester-cats\". All the cards have an elegant black border. It is easy to play with, readability is very good, and the cards are made with casino quality paper and finishing.\n The back is full-bleed  with red foiled accents.\nphotoshop rendering\nNote: all the graphics are ready and final. Small tweaks and improvements might be made during or after the campaign.\nFor this deck I decided to make a tuck-box without ink, it will be foiled in black and red, embossed, on black paper. More will be unveiled during the campaign, such as the back side and other details.\nback of the tuck, with cutout in the middle, showing the backs of the cards (stretch goal)\nRed Label Limited Edition Deck\nThis deck is NOT AN ADD-ON. You can get it ONLY IF you are in the limited reward (now sold out), or in the reward called \"The 17er\".\nI will produce approx. 110-120 units, it depends by the count at the end of the campaign. It is an exquisite piece for collectors and playing cards lovers.\nHere the specs:\ncards: same as the normal deck \ntuck-box: same die-cut, but completely black. no foil and no embossing \nLaser-cut \u201csleeve\u201d on red metallic paper, that looks like a label. Actually I\u00b4d call it \u201cjacket\u201d, since it is open on the back (see update #3)\ngolden foil under the front\nsignature \nnumbered \nshipped from the US with tracking number \nawesome Carat case included (transparent acrylic case, lid with magnets) \nshipping included. \none per backer \nassembled in Stockholm\nRed Label Prototype in its Carat Case\nStretch goals and Add-ons will be unlocked and unveiled during the campaign. I will send updates to keep you posted about these question marks.\nIt is important that you take a quick look at the updates, and see what's new, and how the deck will improve.\nADD-ON: Copper Coin for 101 SEK\nThis is a 1.5 inch antique copper coin, with epoxy on both sides with reed edge. \nThe price for the coin is 101 SEK (approx. $11.8)\nIf you want one, just add 101 SEK  to your pledge. If you want 2 coins you add 202 SEK, if three coins 303 SEK, etc etc. The coin does not affect your shipping cost.\nphotoshop rendering\nADD-ON: Uncut Tuck-box Sheet for 203 SEK\nThis is a flat tuck-box without cuts and score lines. There will be the 2 foils and the embossing.\nThe price for this one is 203 SEK (approx. $24.5 USD, \u20ac21.5, \u00a316 GBP) shipping included anywhere in the world. It will look more or less like the picture, here the details:\ndimensions: I estimate 13x29.7cm / 5.1x11.8in, but they might be slightly different. \nshipping cost included shipped from Stockholm \nwith signature \nnumbered \nphotoshop rendering\nWhat is an ADD-ON ?\nThere are items called \"add-on\". It simply means that you can add them to your pledge. The add-on is not a reward tier. All you have to do some simple math, push the blue button called \"Manage\", and modify the total amount. Scroll up and find the button next to the cover image.\nHere a couple of examples to make things clear.\nExample for US backers: You are in the 1 deck reward, therefore you pledged for 130 SEK. You want to ADD the uncut tuckbox sheet (203 SEK). Just do 130+203 = 333 SEK\nExample for international backers: You are in the 1 deck reward, therefore you pledged for 170 SEK. You want to ADD the uncut tuckbox sheet (203 SEK). Just do 170+203 = 373 SEK\nJust mail me if you need help :)\nCustom Box for 6 decks, included!\nThis box is FOR FREE for backers with 6 decks or multiples of 6. This is a self-assembling sturdy box, with magnets, and it will wrapped in protective plastic (with 6 decks inside of course). On the top lid: custom red-foiled graphics as shown in the pictures (photoshop rendering on the real box).\nSince I am based in Stockholm, the campaign is in Swedish Crowns (Kr SEK). The conversion rate to USD  (Euro and British Pounds) in this list is updated every day of the final days. There are fluctuations all the time, about \u00b11.5%. but you can keep track of them here \ncurrency conversion rate updated on November 7th\nYou can follow me and stay up to date on several social media platforms.

NYC NY1001).\n\nThe estimated delivery date is just that, an estimate. it depends on the factory and their workload. I will send the final files at the conclusion of the campaign, but I cannot speed up the production. There is a possibility of earlier delivery, but it all depends on how quickly EPCC completes the production, once I approve all the printing proofs.\n\nPrinting a deck of playing cards is a standard procedure, but errors may occur, you never know, the devil is in the details. But this is my fourth project and I do not foresee any issues. I'll keep my eyes open and follow every single step of the project to make it real, as I did for Requiem Playing Cards, Heretic Playing Cards, and No.17.\n\nBe aware that the colors on the screen will not perfectly match with the colors on printed paper.

Taking this deck as a starting point, I tried to create my own vision of the Underworld. Although a joyful and positive person myself, I had always been attracted to dark themed artwork. I find fascinating how artists throughout the centuries have imagined the world of the dead and how they dealt with the greatest fear of mankind.

The Original Edition may be reprinted but the tuck case of any future reprints will be basic and less elaborate in production compared to the KS Original Edition\n>>>>>>>> THE REWARDS WILL BE SENT FROM THE USA <<<<<<<<\n\nUPDATE!\nAll KS backers will get their decks hand numbered and signed (upon request) on the tuck case! The decks sold during KS will be the only ones numbered and signed. The rest of the decks will just have the total number produced written on the tuck case.\nRendering of the tuck cases\n The picture above can hardly give an idea of the finished product as it cannot capture the shine of the gold stock combined with the foil or the surprising contrast between the matte and somewhat textured black stock and the shiny foil.\n From a black background emerges a bizarre world of  spooky creatures that dwell in the darkness...\nAnimated edition QoS\nQueen of Diamonds\nJack of Diamonds\nAce of Diamonds - Original Edition\nKing of Hearts- Original Edition\nAce of Heatrs - Original Edition\nAnimated (Limited) edition deck will have the courts and figures framed in a marble-like intricate border.

I've been designing custom Playing Cards since early 2012. During that time I've always work on my Playing Card designs late at night, hence the moniker of Midnight Cards! After going with a quirky and unorthodox theme for my last project, I wanted to ground my next Deck in the essentials of a high-quality Playing Cards design. I'm proud to present the Grinders Deck!\nThe design of the Grinders Deck is meant to embody the workhorse mentality of a professional Grinder, but also contains elements of grandeur and opulence. (CLICK ON ANY PROJECT IMAGE FOR A HIGHER RES VERSION)\nTUCK BOX:\nThe Grinders' Tuck Box will utilize a Black matte stock. NO inks will be printed on the Tuck. The extremely intricate design elements will be stamped in Copper AND Silver Foil. SHINY!!\nThe Grinders Tuck Box, Cards and Custom Brick Box (see below!) will all be printed by Legends Playing Card Co. This will be my third personal design that will be printed by Legends. They do an amazing job!! The Cards will utilize Legends' awesome Classic Finish. Classic Finish is a softer and slicker paper. It's more comparable to a vintage Bicycle Deck.\n         THE JOKERS:\nThe Jokers for the Grinders Deck focus on a well kept Poker player ready to make his move! I drew the character in a similar hard-edge outlines with rough painted interiors, similar to the Court Cards. The Red Joker has a Queen of Hearts reveal. Which is good for any aspiring Magicians!\nBACK CARD:\nThe Back Card shares a lot of the intricate details from the Tuck Box. Some elements in the Back Card design contain subtle references to the games of Poker and Roulette. Roulette is another game that has it's share of professional Grinders. Plus, Roulette is one of my favorites while visiting a Casino! (CLOSEUP DETAILS BELOW)\nFACE CARDS:\nThe Face Cards are designed with the intention for maximum playability. The Courts Set is from a more classical design than most modern Courts. I have modified them and added plenty of elegant details and handpainted elements to make them unique on their own!\nCUSTOM BRICK BOX:\nEvery TWELVE (12) Deck order will come packed inside a custom Grinders Brick Box. It will have a custom Diecut, including a top panel that folds into a display Header with the circular Logo shape Diecut above the other elements (seen below in the Render with the grey background). The Brick Box printing specs will be exactly the same as the Tuck Box - the same thick Black matte stock, Copper Foil AND Silver Foil! The Grinders Brick Box is NOT available by itself or as a separate Add-On item (it's only available with 12 Deck orders).\n2\" DEALER COIN:\nThe Grinders Coin will be produced by Coins For Anything. The 2-Sided Coin will measure 2\" in diameter, and will have an Antique Copper Finish. Black Enamel will highlight the details on each side, and White Enamel will bring out the Grinders Logotype on the Coin Front. I have designed numerous Coins that CFA has produced. Above is a photo of the prototype Coin!! \nTo add any extra items to your base Pledge Reward, just click on the Blue \"Manage Your Pledge\" Button and change the dollar amount to account for the added item(s).

All U.S. Pledge Rewards will be fulfilled from Texas, by Gamblers Warehouse. All International Pledge Rewards will be fulfilled from Hong Kong, by Legends Playing Card Co.\n\nARE THEY LIMITED? - Of course! I have never reprinted any of my personal Decks, and never will. I will only print the quantity of Decks and Brick Boxes needed for Pledge Rewards and off-Kickstarter orders, plus a few hundred extras for a future Midnight Cards online storefront.\n\nWHY ONLY ONE DECK? - My last project, Bowl-A-Rama Playing Cards, turned into a pretty complex assortment of merchandise between two separate Kickstarter campaigns (three separate Decks, Wooden Nickel Sets, handmade Bowling Pins and three Uncut Sheets). So, I chose to keep this project VERY streamlined - one Deck, one Brick Box and one Coin. IF the Grinders project is a big hit, there MAY be a second Deck.\n\nNO STRETCH GOALS? - After running many Kickstarter projects, I've noticed that listing Stretch Goals publicly on the project page sometimes leads to Backer peer pressure to Unlock items that didn't make it. More than once I've added a Stretch Goal or two to a campaign (usually a premium printing extra), even if the funding level didn't reach the Stretch Goal amount listed. It has definitely affected the bottom line in those projects! So, for this campaign I will have a Stretch Goals list of my own, but I will not share them online. They comprise of the usual - Interior Printing, Embossing, second Deck...... If / When the project gets close to a Stretch Goal, I will post a Kickstarter Update to announce that specific Stretch Goal's details.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Randy Butterfield (Midnight Cards)\n14 created \u00b7 232 backed\nI'm a Graphic Artist located in Indianapolis, IN with my wife, Susan and kids Violet and Aaron.See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Under 48 HOURS remaining for OCULUS Deck", "update_content": "Hey Everyone,\nJust a quick heads-up to let you all know that the OCULUS project is down to it's last 48 hours.

Further the design elements should have followed through to the inside of the tuck box. Lastly... the card backs.

A black border - or any other color besides white - would show wear too quickly.

The art style and design pay tribute to the philosophical and artistic trend Art nouveau, promoted and popularized in France in the late 19th century.  \nNOUVEAU, chosen as the official United Cardists 2016 Annual Deck, is a custom deck of playing cards (poker size) designed by Bona fide Playing Cards and manufactured by Expert Playing Card Company.\nNOUVEAU & NOUVEAU BOURGOGNE (scroll down to stretch goals to see more on BOURGOGNE deck)\nPrototype\n100% Custom playing cards deck\nLimited Edition (one printing, never to be reprinted)\nPoker size\n54 cards\nPrinted by EPCC\nMaster Finish quality\nOfficial United Cardists 2016 Annual deck.\nPrototype\nThe playing cards as we know them today are inspired by the designs produced in Rouen, France, back in the 16th century. There are different theories about who the court cards represent, though it\u2019s hard to find a widely accepted one as the Rouen cards were so badly copied that the current designs are gross distortions of the original cards. For NOUVEAU, we decided on the historical and mythological characters some believe were used for the creation of the first decks in Rouen.

We decided on one of the most spread ones regarding the original French suits, where Spades were believed to represent nobility, Hearts the clergy, Diamonds the merchants and Clubs the commoners and the peasantry.\nAs for the art style, we thought something of French inspiration was the best idea as we\u2019re paying tribute to the original French deck. It was a hard decision, taking into account that France was always known as a place of artistic reference, so after some thought we chose to use one that was popular during the 19th century: Art Nouveau\nArt Nouveau is a style of decorative art, architecture and design promoted and popularized in Paris in the late 19th century and characterized by intricate linear designs and flowing curves based on natural forms.\nNOUVEAU Uncut sheet\nPrototype\nPrototype\n$10,000 NOUVEAU Deck -- REACHED! \n$15,000 NOUVEAU BOURGOGNE Deck -- REACHED!\n$18,000 NOUVEAU Deck Embossing -- REACHED!\n$20,000 NOUVEAU BOURGOGNE Deck Foiling -- REACHED!\n  NOUVEAU BOURGOGNE\nNOUVEAU & NOUVEAU BOURGOGNE COMPARISON\nNOUVEAU Backs & Jokers\nNOUVEAU BOURGOGNE Backs & Jokers\nNOUVEAU Courts & Ace\nNOUVEAU BOURGOGNE Courts & Ace\nNOUVEAU Numbers\nNOUVEAU BOURGOGNE Numbers\nNOUVEAU Uncut Sheet\n                                                     NOUVEAU BOURGOGNE Uncut Sheet\n18\" x 24\" NOUVEAU & NOUVEAU BOURGOGNE Art Prints printed on fine archival photographic paper\n   \nNOUVEAU Coins (2\" Antique Brass Coin)\n                                         \"The end of the story of this deck is a happy ending.

Taking that into account, we've left a generous amount of time to ensure the production and delivery of all the items without delay. The deck will be printed by Expert Playing Card Company and fulfilled by Gamblers Warehouse.

Even though I was born and spent most of my adult life in the United States, so much of who I am is attributed to those years.\nI learned so many things about my other nation and got to experience a whole new worldview. The thing that stuck with me most about the mexican people was their love for life. They celebrate daily; they celebrate their history, their culture, their food, their music, their entertainment, their sports, and their traditions. It was such beautiful thing to experience just how much the mexican people loved their country.\nIt is because of this that I decided to create a lively, unique deck of playing cards that would adequately celebrate and portray my deep love for my mexican heritage.\nIf you've ever seen a mexican blanket or poncho, then you know what inspired this back design. \nThe poncho has been worn in Mexico for hundreds of years. Originally created by the Native Americans of the Andes Mountains, the poncho was not a fashion statement, but a means to keep warm in the harsh winters. Today, these vibrant patterned garments are seen as an iconic symbol for the mexican culture.\nEach suit has been recreated to honor mexican cuisine. The corner pips remain standard for easier game play.\nThe Spades\nMexico is the world's leading producer of avocados. The town Uruapan, Michoacan claims the title of \"Avocado Capital of the World\".\nThe Clubs\nThere are approximately one hundred and fourteen species of nopales known to Mexico, making it so prominent in the country that it is even on the mexican flag.\nThe Diamonds\nTortilla chips have always been considered to be a Mexican food, more commonly known in Mexico as totopos or tostadas.\nThe Hearts\nThe Tomato's use as a food originated in Mexico, and spread throughout the world following the Spanish colonization of the Americas.\nThe Ace of Spades is modeled after the coat of arms seen in the center of Mexico's flag.\nEach of the 12 court cards have been completely redesigned to represent and honor a variety of figures.\nThe Kings\nZapata, The King of Spades, honors a leading figure in the Mexican Revolution.\nEl Azteca, The King of Clubs, honors the Aztecs of Mexico.\nEl Borracho, The King of Hearts, is a tribute to Tequila; Mexico's most famous distilled beverage.\nEl Campesino, The King of Diamonds, honors a traditional class of mexican farmers.\nThe Queens\nLa Santa Muerte, The Queen of Spades, is a female folk saint venerated primarily in Mexico. A personification of death, she is associated with healing, protection, and safe delivery to the afterlife by her devotees\nLa Virgen de Guadalupe (Our Lady of Guadalupe), The Queen of Clubs, is the recognized symbol of Mexican Catholicism.\nLa Soldadera, The Queen of Hearts, honors the strong and confident women of Mexico who went into combat alongside men during the Mexican Revolution.\nLa India, The Queen of Diamonds, represents the indigenous women of Mexico.\nThe Jacks\nEl Torero, The Jack of Spades, honors the national sport of Mexico: Bullfighting. Mexico City is home to the biggest bullfighting ring in the world, La Monumental, built in 1942.\nEl Taquero, The Jack of Clubs. We all love someone who can make delicious tacos.\nEl Luchador, The Jack of Hearts, is a tribute to Blue Demon, a Mexican Masked professional wrestler who was widely considered to be one of the greatest Mexican wrestlers of his time.\nEl Mariachi, The Jack of Diamonds, honors Mexico's most famous musicians.\n Viva Mexico comes with two fun and unique Jokers! \nPi\u00f1atas are a symbol of the celebratory nature of the mexican people. They unite all ages through joy and laughter. \nThe broken pi\u00f1ata includes a 7 of hearts reveal !  \n FRONT\nBACK \nSEAL\nPrinting and fulfillment will be done by\nThey are able to achieve a level of quality other playing card manufacturers cannot.\nAs far as fulfillment goes, shipping directly from their warehouse will be much faster and more affordable than doing the fulfillment myself.\nAdditional rewards will be shipped by the creators or myself.

Why? Because I want to give ALL BACKERS the best deal. \nOne deck is $13 with shipping. 3 decks however, is $33, as oppose to $39 ($13 x 3) if I included U.S shipping to every tier.

I loved the beauty of the land and friendliness of the people. I came to understand the mystique of Texas, what John Steinbeck famously referred to as something more profound, something exceeding a mere \u201cstate of mind.\u201d\nYears later, as I first began designing playing cards, I dreamed that some day I\u2019d introduce to the world a very special deck\u2014a deck unlike any other\u2014that would adequately express my deep affection for this place.\nThat day is finally here.\nI\u2019ve made certain that the decks in this series are worthy of their namesake, worthy of the millions of friendly, hardworking, self-determined people that have called it home. I\u2019ve spared no expense for this project. From the highest quality playing cards available, to the most sophisticated printing methods for the packaging, I\u2019ve overlooked no detail in the design and production of this deck.\nWith this series, I\u2019m especially excited to finally unveil a new engraved intaglio tax stamp, which handsomely functions as a belly band. This is an unprecedented feature among luxury playing cards. Intaglio-engraved tax stamps have not been used for decades due to the difficulty of their production, which in turn leads to unfeasible costs. With this feature I not only get to honor my home state in a unique way, but also get to further challenge the boundaries of design within the playing card world.\nYou don\u2019t have to be from Texas to appreciate the ideas that inspired these cards. Elegant and classic, they\u2019re inspired by and represent universal concepts: freedom, friendship, hard work, bold living, natural beauty, innovation, and self-determination.

Initially ambiguous in its future, this document has transformed over time into an icon that has rippled throughout world history with positive change. To me, the Magna Carta is one of the most inspiring examples of timelessness. Today the Magna Carta is the foundation of liberty and human rights in many parts of the world. This deck series was created to honor and celebrate this landmark occasion.  \nThis series is split up into two factions. Royals vs. Rebels. The Royals deck commands attention in rich black, representing the King and his empire. The sleek back design features the gorgeous crowned lion in which 3 heads represent the 3 lion crest of the Angevin Empire. \nThe Rebels deck is featured in white, displaying intricate linework and a composition showing multiple \"regions\" to symbolize all the different barons uniting against the King. The ribbon displays the famous phrase, Legem Terrae meaning \"Law of the Land\". Together the ribbon from the Rebels deck and the ribbon from the royals deck unite to create a perfect circle representing a temporary moment of unity between the two sides referencing the circular shape of the King's seal. \nThe court cards were carefully selected based on actual people involved around the Magna Carta. The suits were used to help show the family factions within this time period. All of these cards were inspired by existing illustrations of the people we could find from that time and translated into the elegant designs you see here. \nEach suit carries symbolism based on the court cards that they hold. The Spade features a cross in the center representing the cross on King John's coat. The Club hides a lion face representing the Angevin Empire. \nA sword skewers the Heart, adorning the fleur de lis for Louis VIII. Finally the Diamond proudly displays the crest symbol of Robert Fitzwalter, the leader of the baronial opposition. \nThe Jokers feature an authentic recreation of the face and back of King John's seal. \nThese tuck cases feature a realm of modern elegance that compliments the older illustrations in a beautiful juxtaposition. The designer packaging features a peek of each suit in front and back of the case. In keeping with my passion of interactive packaging, these decks pair perfectly together to help create any suit you choose. \n Royals and Rebels Deck Features\nTuck cases are foiled with eye-catching gold and embossed on premium stock to provide a sense of depth to the touch.\nInner tuck case is lined with an exact replica of the actual 1215 Magna Carta document in archive from The British Library.\nCards are made with Aristocrat stock and coated with premium magic finish for increased longevity and performance.\nCard designs feature gorgeous metallic gold accents throughout that help unite the cards to their cases and to each other.\nPrinted with the United States Playing Card Company\nEmbossing pattern was based off of Knight's pleats.\nFor collectors I've crafted a special King John deck representing the origin of the Magna Carta. This deck is crucial in helping tell the story of the abuse in taxation which spurred the eventual rebellion. The deck represents the motivations of the Magna Carta, featuring King John tuck case but with the Rebel Baron's gold in hand representing the taxation crisis.\n Limited Edition GOLD King John Deck Features\nOnly 500 printed\nFeatures a completely new tuck case adorning the majestic Ace of Spades of King John with the gold of the Rebels\nGilded shimmering gold edges by USPCC to help maintain final deck sealed in mint condition.\nTuck case is foiled with eye-catching gold and embossed on premium stock to provide a sense of depth to the touch. \nCards are made with Aristocrat stock and coated with premium magic finish for increased longevity and performance. \nCard designs feature gorgeous metallic gold accents throughout that help unite the cards to their cases and to each other. \nPrinted with the United States Playing Card Company\nKICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE: Limited Edition SILVER Gilded King John Deck\nBy incredible demand we've launched the silver gilded King John deck to allow those wishing to complete the mural to do so. They feature all the same premium quality stocks and finishes as the Gold edition except with the modification of having silver gilded edging. These decks are only available through Kickstarter to reward our early supporters. We will not be selling these after at our store meaning this complete mural will surely become a true collector's display.\n\nThese decks feature gorgeous mirror-like gilding across the sides of the deck that compliment the linework of the Rebels deck. Gold and Silver King John decks will be differentiated by individually numbered tax stamps to truly emphasize the authenticity of these decks. \n\nA strict 2-deck limit is in place for these decks. They are only available as an add-on or through tiers KJS and KJS2. Gilded decks are not available through S1 tier.\nAs a way to pay tribute to this event, you can now recreate it with the world's first hexapytch deck series. Often times the sides of a tuck case are wasted away with filler text, being an underutilized area for artwork. Inspired by old book collections which featured beautiful murals across their spines, I've illustrated this famous event based on the iconic image of the signing. \nEach deck reveals a slice of this moment in history with illustrations of different members related to the Magna Carta. A different faction is featured on either end so that you literally get to choose sides.\nThe visual system was designed to work with every tier combination to create a cohesive image. So whether you pick the full Master Mural brick or couple decks you'll be sure to have a real piece of history to display proudly.\nMagna Carta Attire\nThese shirts feature the Royals Ace of Spade and the Rebels Ace of Hearts. Each shirt is crafted in the USA using soft comfortable fabric that feels like you've owned it for years! Shirts are screen printed on genuine American Apparel 50/50 blend. All sizes available and will be taken at the end of the campaign. \n\nWhite press on Heather Black. (Click to enlarge)\nBlack press on New Silver. All shirts for $22. (+$7 int)\nUncut Sheets\nUncut sheets have always held a special place in my heart as a collector. I'm honored to be offering these gorgeous uncut sheets directly from the factory. Each sheet is individually numbered and signed by the artist printed once and never again.\n2\" King John's Seal Coin\nDuring the time there was nothing more powerful than the King's seal. Instead of signatures King's would implement a double-sided seal to create a coin pendent that would signify the ruling power's approval. This 2\" seal is authentically replicated with an antique gold finish so that you can now hold the power of the King as well.\n How to Add On Items:\n            ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMany of the risks and challenges stem from production and shipping. This is my second Kickstarter and fourth time printing with our partner factory. I've properly calculated and compensated for these two things to ensure that my backers will get their project within a timely manner.\n\nThe producers of these cards will be with The US Playing Card Company and the shipping services will be with USPS. I have produced decks and fulfilled large scale orders with both these partners before. Thanks to our previous history with these companies with 2 other runs, any unexpected hiccups that occur should remain minimal.

This makes it easy to put both Light and Dark decks into a single game, while the front artwork still allows the decks to be split back out easily. The artwork on the back features an animation effect unlike any other deck in your collection. \nThis animation is done without marking the backs. Every card back is the same with a single orientation. The animation can easily be achieved by simple splitting the deck, rotating one pile and shuffling:\neach corner beetle is flipped, so rotating half the cards in a shuffle will create the animation\nPLAY\n\nThe deck shown in the video was created by MPC (not LPCC). Final deck will be slightly different--but in a good way :)\nThe Cards - Light Deck\nA sample hand: Light Deck\nThe Cards - Dark Deck\nA sample spread: Dark Deck\n Tuck Boxes\nI don't have proofs yet that include the silver and orange metallic foil for these designs, but here's the basic design concept:\nTuck Box Foil Accents\nI really like the gold-like orange foil that Legends used on their Day of the Dead deck, so I'm choosing that color for the Light Deck. The Dark deck will have a silver foil accent. These are the accent parts, so imagine these parts of the artwork on the tuck boxes in the silver and metallic orange.\nInterior Box Printing\nBoth decks will get this interior print:\nJokers\nDark Variant\nLight Deck Variant\nHearts - Light Version\nHearts: Light Version\nHearts - Dark Version\nSpades - Light Version\nSpades: Light Version\nSpades - Dark Version\nClubs - Light Version\nClubs: Light Version\nClubs - Dark Version\nDiamonds - Light Version\nDiamonds: Light Version\nDiamonds - Dark Version\nProduction\nThis deck of playing cards will be printed by the Legends Playing Card Company, run by the talented Lawrence Sullivan. After researching countless suppliers, it became clear that LPCC is the right choice. LPCC produces the highest class of playing cards due to their attention to detail with exceptional durability, ultra-precise printing registration, and the \u2018glass like\u2019 edges of their signature \u2018Diamond Cut\u2019 process. I am sparing no expense to make this an exciting deck for both players and collectors.\nAbove: Two new decks, Bicycle (left), Legends (right). Above: Two new decks, Bicycle (left), Legends (right).\nLearn more about LPCC's commitment to playing cards and their quality on the LPCC Site.\nPlease note that the cover image and all other photos of real cards shown in the video and on this page are not done by LPCC. I made a bunch of prototypes using MakePlayingCards.com, which I highly recommend for ordering single decks (and they produce some great cards too)--but the final decks will be a bit different than what you see in the samples on this page.\nAdd-Ons!\nBackers in the USA can add $10 to any reward tier to get:\n\u25ba 8 Die Cut Stickers (one of each design)\n\u25ba 3 Beetle Greeting Cards (one of each design)\nNote: The $44 tier will also get 8 stickers instead of 3, but I can't change the wording on the rewards after launch.\nphoto by Lena Eivy (lenaeivy.com)\nDie Cut Stickers!\nI've got die cut stickers available from StickerMule! Since I'm ordering these in bulk, I can include them inexpensively for backers in the US. Outside the US, you'll have to order from StickerMule, but their rates are great and all profits will go toward this project funding!\nHand Drawn Stickers!\nThere's a limited reward tier ($44) that will allow you to get one of these hand-drawn, ink sticker sheets. You'll also get 4 decks, 3 die cut stickers and a greeting card so get that while you can! \nThe sticker sheet will be randomly chosen from my stack:\nColoring Book\nI'm having a coloring book made by Lulu: http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/adameivy\nI'm still trying to figure out if I can order these in bulk. Add-on status TBD--but you can order them right now from lulu for $8/each and all profits I collect from those sales will go toward this project funding!\nUse this code on Lulu to get free shipping (until August 24th): FGA815\nThe Coloring Book\nPLAY\n\nI have submitted a new version of the coloring book to make the art more distant from the center fold of the paper. That version is up on the lulu store.\nGreeting Cards\nI'll also be including Greeting Cards, printed locally in Seattle by TCC Printing.\nThe Making Of\nIt was a long time in the making and I learned a ton. I created a lot of print concepts along the way.\nMore information on the process can be found on the Procreate forums: http://procreate.si/forums/index.php?topic=6930.0\nStretch Goals - TBD\nTBD. I decided that the decks absolutely must have the interior print and foil finish regardless of how much we overfund. Extra goals could include more stickers, more greeting cards, postcards, who knows!\nSocial Following\nHelp spread the word by following and sharing this project:\nInstagram: @atomantic\nFacebook: @Beetle Royale\nSpecial Thanks\nThe video was produced by RoqFilms (Quoc is awesome)\nThe background music in the video came from the talented Josh Woodward:  http://www.joshwoodward.com/\nThanks to all the members of the Seattle Sketch Pistols Drink and Draw who gave me feedback and watched this thing progress.\nAnd I couldn't have done this project over the last 18 months without my supportive and talented wife, Lena Eivy, who did the cover photo, pictures of me in my process as well as various product shots, and my loving daughter Ilya who inspired me to draw again.

Thanks!!! for checking out my campaign for a custom, hand-illustrated deck of playing cards. This unique poker-sized deck depicts scenes and characters from the legendary Trojan War.\nI am Chris Staples. duxoop is where I make stuff. This is The Fall of Troy...\nWhy Back The Fall of Troy?\nBecause you love high quality.\nBecause you love creativity.\nBecause you love poker.\nBecause you love the people who love the above.\nI have been a professional designer for nearly twenty years (yikes) and have had experience with many kinds of print jobs, including playing cards. I plan to have the deck printed at MPC in order to utilize some of the exciting new techniques and technologies that they are playing with. In short, if you like what you see in this campaign, you will love the finished product.\nAjax ][ King of Hearts\nWhile adhering to time honored conventions of playing card design, the Fall of Troy presents a unique style within the class of custom decks.\nHelen of Troy ][ Queen of Hearts\nWhy Playing Cards?\nPlaying cards are a great medium for sharing and enjoying art. As their name indicates, they are for playing. They are made and meant to be touched and handled, a counterpoint to their museum-hung cousins or book-bound brethren. Playing cards bring us together as groups and entertain us in solitaire. One deck is a box of canvasses, each canvas tells a story - rich with characters and drama. So much from something that fits in your pocket.\nAjax Carries Slain Achilles ][ Ace of Spades\nWhy the Trojan War?\nThe legendary Fall of Troy story has entertained audiences for thousands of years. For centuries the tale was passed down verbally until Homer committed part of it to the written word. The Iliad focuses on brilliant Achilles, and his supreme rage in the last year of the Trojan War. Homer's epic poem is the first of countless histories, dramatizations, songs, books, films, paintings, etc, to be inspired by the Acheans' ten year assault on Ilios. Works such as, Aeschylus' trilogy, the Oresteia and William Shakespeare's play Troilus and Cressida have recycled the themes and ideas of the Trojan War throughout antiquity. The homage continues even in this modern age with songs like \"Achilles Last Stand\" by Led Zeppelin and films like Troy, directed by Wolfgang Petersen and starring Brad Pitt as Achilles and Eric Bana as Hector.\nPacked with all of the action (and more) of today's Hollywood blockbusters and personified by characters with strengths and frailties that ring so true even now, it comes as no surprise that the story of the Trojan War persists and continues to excite readers, watchers and listeners of all kinds. Playing cards are a perfect platform to portray this ancient, yet timely drama and more importantly another way to introduce this vivid piece of human history to the people of today... and stuff.\nAres the God of War ][ Jack of Spades\nThe Design\nMuch of the fun and challenge in creating The Fall of Troy deck has been striking the balance between ancient styles and modern layout, as well as, finding methods common to both eras, such as the conventional use of symmetry in playing card design.\nThese cards have been designed to stand out comfortably among any decks of playing cards on the table. The Fall of Troy compliments our favorite standard decks, such as the classic Bicycle deck, while at the same time pairs well with the new high end custom art decks that continue to emerge, thanks to communities like Kickstarter. (Two stunning Kickstarter examples of this burgeoning form are the Leonardo and BRuT decks by Dent-de-Lion du Midi and Uusi respectively.\nAs seen on...\nThank You!\nThanks again for taking the time to check out The Fall of Troy.

Som videoen indikerer, er det et meget simpelt spil. Det er velovervejet, at spillet er simpelt, for at det er gennem gendkendeligheden, at der opst\u00e5r et rum, hvor man f\u00f8ler sig tryg. Det g\u00f8r, at SNAKs intention om at rammes\u00e6tte samtalen ikke bliver forceret. Mange har delt med os, hvor overraskede de blev over, hvor meget de fik lyst til at dele med deres medspillere.\nTre \u00e5r efter SNAK-spillets lancering er vi en hel masse erfaringer og gode historier rigere, og derfor vil vi relancere spillet med de \u00e6ndringer, vi er kommet frem til. \nHVORFOR?\nEn god snak er vigtig, men det kan v\u00e6re sv\u00e6rt at f\u00e5 skabt plads til den. Det er netop det, SNAK kan hj\u00e6lpe med. For det er gennem den gode samtale, at vi ser og h\u00f8rer hinanden. Vi udvider vores egen og andres forst\u00e5else. I sidste ende er det netop vores relationer, som danner mening i livet og giver styrke til dagen og vejen, og derfor er det s\u00e5 vigtigt at have gode snakke.\nBEVAR SNAK\nGrunden til at denne crowdfunding k\u00f8rer er, at der ikke er flere spil tilbage, og der er ikke skabt nok kapital gennem de f\u00f8rste tre \u00e5r til at kunne forts\u00e6tte. Derfor har vi brug for din hj\u00e6lp!\nUDVIKLING AF SNAK SNAK har gennem tre \u00e5r skabt store oplevelser for mange, men en udfording ved SNAK-spillet er, at det kan v\u00e6re sv\u00e6rt at bringe p\u00e5 banen. Derfor har vi gent\u00e6nkt muligheden for at g\u00f8re spilles mere let og sjovt.

Derfor h\u00e5ber vi at se spillet blive brugt p\u00e5 bl.a. arbejdspladser, hvor behovet for at l\u00e6re hinanden bedre at kende ofte kan v\u00e6re sv\u00e6r at s\u00e6tte fokus p\u00e5. Med SNAK 2.0 bliver det forh\u00e5bentlig mere naturligt.\nHVAD G\u00c5R PENGENE TIL?\nPengene g\u00e5r til at kunne s\u00e6tte produktionen af SNAK 2.0 i gang. Der skal produceres 5000 nye spil, og det er de 25.000 kr. vi har s\u00f8gt om i vores crowdfunding faktisk ikke nok til, men de er nok til, at vi t\u00f8r kaste os ud i at g\u00f8re det.\nSTRETCH GOALS\n40.000 kr. \u2013 Hvis vores crowdfunding ender p\u00e5 40.000 kr., m\u00e5 I bestemme noget sindssygt, der skal ske.

Frederik har en nerve og en energi i ham som smitter publikum og de mennesker han st\u00e5r overfor. Jeg er en fan hele vejen, og hver gang vi har lejlighed til at arbejde sammen, f\u00e5r jeg bekr\u00e6ftet at Frederik er begavet og varm, autentisk og en god ven.

Frederik, som er motoren i projektet, er far til to, og dermed f\u00f8lger et ansvar for at holde en stabil hverdag k\u00f8rende. En hverdag, hvor han ved siden af ogs\u00e5 skal tjene til dagen og vejen. Derfor har SNAK langt fra det tempo, som vi dr\u00f8mmer om.\n\nSNAK er en virksomhed, som laver et humant projekt. Ofte ligger det i et gr\u00e6nseland mellem et humanit\u00e6rt projekt og real business. Det er en udfordring, vi nyder, for det skaber mening at g\u00f8re det p\u00e5 den m\u00e5de.

Netop derfor laver vi denne crowdfunding-kampagne.\n\nEn sidste udfordring er, at det er dr\u00f8nsv\u00e6rt at komme igennem til de store k\u00e6debutikkker, som vi h\u00e5ber vil s\u00e6lge SNAK-spillene.

The Romans capitalized on their creations and crafted war as a strategic art ruled by precision.

The art of war and death was screaming forward changing the scope of conquest and World power.\nThe crown jewel which would open the door to the threat of mass slaughter as a form of deterrent and change the tide of war.... the Atomic Bomb.

Minerva is the Roman goddess identified with Athena.\nAthena is portrayed as a shrewd companion of heroes and is the patron goddess of heroic endeavor. She is the virgin patroness of Athens. The Athenians founded the Parthenon on the Acropolis of her namesake city, Athens (Athena Parthenos), in her honor.\nVeneration of Athena was so persistent that archaic myths about her were recast to adapt to cultural changes. In her role as a protector of the city (polis), many people throughout the Greek world worshiped Athena as Athena Polias, frequently as their city-state patron goddess. While the city of Athens and the goddess Athena bear the same name (Athena the goddess, Athenai the city), it is not known which of the two words is derived from the other.\n Lancelot de Mole (Inventor of the Tank)\nHe made several approaches to the British authorities in 1912, in 1914 and 1916, in relation to what would become the tank. It was, obviously, ahead of its time; because, in 1912, the need for such a military device had not yet arisen. And, to further complicate matters, due to various bureaucratic blunders, his correspondence was set aside, and not given to the appropriate officers.\nEventually, in 1919, long after the military tank had been built and used in warfare during World War I, a Royal Commission recognized the importance of de Mole's innovative work, and noted the unfortunate consequences of his submissions being overlooked and, therefore, having no connection with the development of the tank at all, that a far better tank would have been developed than the one that the British eventually used, and that it would have been developed at a much earlier date.\nClara Barton (Founder of Red Cross)\nClarissa \"Clara\" Harlowe Barton (December 25, 1821 \u2013 April 12, 1912) was a pioneering nurse who founded the American Red Cross. She worked as a hospital nurse in the American Civil War, and as a teacher and patent clerk. Barton is noteworthy for doing humanitarian work at a time when relatively few women worked outside the home. She had a relationship with John J. Elwell, but never married. \nANTON FOKKER\nAnton Herman Gerard \"Anthony\" Fokker (6 April 1890 \u2013 23 December 1939) was a Dutch aviation pioneer and an aircraft manufacturer. He is most famous for the fighter aircraft he produced in Germany during the First World War such as the Eindecker monoplanes, the Dr.1 triplane and the D.VII biplane.\nAt the outbreak of World War I the German government took control of the factory. Fokker remained as director and alleged designer of many aircraft for the Imperial German Army Air Service (Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte), including the Fokker Eindecker and the Fokker Dr.I, the triplane made famous in the hands of aces such as Manfred von Richthofen (the Red Baron). In all, his company delivered about 700 military planes to the German air force as well as supplying the German navy and Austria-Hungary.\n The First Joker (The Atomic Bomb)\nA thermonuclear weapon weighing little more than 2,400 pounds (1,100 kg) can produce an explosive force comparable to the detonation of more than 1.2 million tons (1.1 million tonnes) of TNT. A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast, fire, and radiation. Nuclear weapons are considered weapons of mass destruction, and their use and control have been a major focus of international relations policy since their debut.\nNuclear weapons have been used twice in nuclear warfare, both times by the United States against Japan near the end of World War II. On 6 August 1945, the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a uranium gun-type fission bomb codenamed \"Little Boy\" over the Japanese city of Hiroshima; three days later, on 9 August, the U.S. Army Air Forces detonated a plutonium implosion-type fission bomb codenamed \"Fat Man\" over the Japanese city of Nagasaki. The bombings resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel from acute injuries sustained from the explosions. The ethics of the bombings and their role in Japan's surrender remain the subject of scholarly and popular debate.\nExample of the Number Cards (Standard Edition)\nExample of the Number Cards (Limited Edition)\nThe face corners will all have a silver metallic ink.

TriKard is the same collaborative group that brought the award winning Aquila Playing Cards to Kickstarter just over a year ago as Kardify Projects. That collaboration between exceptionally talented Indonesian designer Ade Suryana of \u201cThe Three of Clubs\u201d and the team from the on-line playing card resource site, Kardify.com, helmed by Ivan Choe and Anthony Ingrassia, struck a surprising balance with each bringing their own unique piece to the puzzle, but ultimately striving for the same goal, quality products that can be enjoyed by all Playing Card aficionados. TriKard Projects is our long term commitment to that vision.\nDesigned by Ade Suryana, Viridian playing cards feature a custom vintage design, reimagined courts, a beautifully crafted tuck case and a stamp bearing an intricate custom design. A deck that is as beautiful as it is functional, Viridian is the first in Trikard\u2019s new line of Signature playing cards - versatile for magic, card flourishing or even just a game of poker.\nA modern twist inspired by the classics.\nViridian combines distinctive design with the peerless quality of Legends Playing Card Co. The beautiful typography is based on vintage typeface and inspired from old Billheads and ephemera. The tuck is also elegantly adorned with beautiful organic patterns which is especially striking. Viridian will be meticulously printed on Classic Finish card stock by LPCC, well known for their innovation, attention to detail with exceptional durability, ultra-precise printing registration and the \u2018glass like\u2019 edges of their signature \u2018Diamond Cut\u2019 process. \nTriKard Custom Seals\nEntirely new, yet immediately familiar.\nFrom the moment you take the Viridian cards out, you will be comfortable using them. The deck looks amazingly fresh. But it\u2019s visually reminiscent of what you\u2019re used to seeing, and is designed around familiarity. The pips on Viridian have been given an update with timeless custom suits and a bigger font for the lettering and numbers.\nMeticulously designed from the ground up by hand.\nThe court cards are stunning and each card has a different face and each with its own uniquely designed wardrobe which looks amazing with the theme color: green and deep red. This gives a good balance of having a beautiful design while keeping the integrity of a standard deck of playing cards.\nBeautifully crafted. Sure to draw compliments every time the cards are cut.\nViridian features an intricate, mirror image floral design on the card backs inspired by traditional playing cards. The attention to detail and craftsmanship, makes this deck truly unique and one of a kind.\nInspired by vintage design and refined by modern aesthetics.\nThe Ace of Spades features a beautiful intricate design that is bold and stylish. The abstract floral pattern adds to the elegance and identity of Viridian.\nExample-U.S Backers: You pledged for the Dual reward tier at AUD $25.00 and would like to add-on 1 additional Viridian deck to your reward.\nYour total pledge amount would be AUD $39.00\nAUD $25.00 (Your Pledge Tier) + AUD $14.00 (Add-on A1) = AUD $39.00 Pledge\n_________________________________________________________________\nExample-Non US Backers: You pledged for the Dual reward tier at AUD $25.00 and would like to add-on 1 additional Viridian deck to your reward.\nYour total pledge amount would be AUD $62.00\nAUD $39.00 (Your Pledge Tier + AUD $14 Shipping) + AUD $23.00 (Add-on A1) = AUD $62.00 Pledge\nPlease use the add-on chart above as a guide or contact us with any questions.\nIntroducing Carmine Playing Cards.\nThis striking deck of cards is the sequel to Viridian and was planned to be released next year. As a Stretch Goal, $19,800 (~$14,500 USD) will allow us to bring Carmine exclusively to our backers early before the public release next year. (Additional mixed reward tiers will be added once we reach the stretch goal)\n*Image of prototype deck\nViridian Playing Cards are designed by Ade Suryana.

The designs for both Viridian and Carmine have been completed and ready for production. The decks will be printed by LPCC on their classic finish stock. \n\nPrinting will begin within 35 days after the paper proofs are confirmed. The paper proofs can take anywhere from 3-8 week to get to us. We have been in constant contact with LPCC thoughout the planning phase and will continue to do so during the production phase. \n\nFulfilment can be one of the most challenging aspects of any project. To ensure the best experience for all our backers, we have decided to stick with Collectible Playing Cards (CPC)- the same company that successfully delivered Aquila Playing Cards all across the globe. As we have good relationship with CPC, we will oversee the fulfilment to ensure the process is smooth and efficient.\n\nDelays may occur and in such case we will be updating everyone with regards to the delivery status. We have given ourselves a buffer and we are confident we can deliver Viridian to you in the time we\u2019ve quoted.\n\nAs the project is quoted in AUD$ and payments are in USD$, there will be Foreign Exchange Risk due to volatility in the currency exchange rate.

There's nothing like enjoying a refreshing soda and playing with your brand new Pin-Up Deck :)\nThe Pin-Up girl craze started as far back as the late 1800's. Back then they were known as Calendar Girls. These lovely ladies were put onto Calendars to help spice up the ad industry. Needless to say, calendars sales were never hotter. \nThese women knew how to get their way and they did with style as sass. Pin-Up girls have always shown the best aspects of a woman, including their work ethic, their determination and their edge. Oh, and they made sure they looked fabulous when doing so. \nWar Time Girls. It started back in WWI When Gibson Girls were willing and ready to join the fight for their country! During WWII there was a peak in the Pin-Up with girls dressing a bit more scandalous and giving way to a golden age in US History throughout the 40s and 50s. Celebrities started getting in on the fun as well with Rita Hayworth as the leader of the pack. Little did we know it would open the flood gates to a whole new generation on bombshells. \n60s Pin-Up brought with it the sexy swim suit and of course Playboy. Also with the help of Audrey Hepburn , Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren woman were beginning to feel a lot more confident in their skin.\nWe haven't seen as many appearances by these beauties in today's culture. Dita Von Teese and Katy Perry are a few that come to mind. However, these ladies always seem to make a comeback. \nWith a new era upon us we can not wait to see what these Pin-Up ladies have in store.

Almost 8 years ago it was the very first time when I thought about creating playing cards but it happened only now; finally, during three month I made my own deck and it\u2019s brilliant.\nThe name of cards - AO MATU, it goes from Tongan language, one of the muiltiple languages in the Polynesia. AO mean WORLD, MATU is ISLAND. I spent a lot of time making each character uniq. Every card has its own cool detailes, marked with 4 distinguishing motifs.

Now we are completing that set with our final deck suggestive of the wild, chthonic forces of nature as opposed to the stabilizing, societal forces represented in our second deck. In addition and unique to this Kickstarter campaign is an altogether new game, designed for use with our decks and capturing the heroic spirit of early society in Celtic Europe. \nPrinting the 3rd and final deck in the Celtic Myth playing card series\nProviding the rules and final game components to ARD R\u00cd, a competitive card game designed for 2 to 5 players in which players take on the role of ancient Gaelic warlords and vie amongst each other to become High King.\nGAME REVIEW\nGeekDad Review by Will James (7 June 2015).\nTHE CARDS\nEach of our decks in this series contains imagery hand-drawn from the history and mythology of the Celts, presenting illuminations rich with symbolism. The first two decks in the series were printed and delivered to our Kickstarter backers last year (to whom we offer our deep gratitude). This final deck features vertically symmetrical (i.e. two-way) designs for the face-cards and back showcasing the more chaotic elemental forces of Celtic legend and cosmology.\nTo give you a sense of the detail contained in each deck, the image below showcases the King of Clubs (Spears) from each of our three decks: The first two (left to right) are from the previously printed decks, and the third is one of the cards which will be included in this deck (featuring the Femorian King, Balor).\nFor a look at all the court cards, continue reading below.\nOur cards are uncommon in that our artist, James Acken, has used his background as both a scholar and artist to draw these images, creating a detailed tapestry of symbolism throughout.\nEvoking the highly involved symbolism of the Book Kells and other medieval artifacts, each Court card represents important figures from the Book of Invasions, Colloquy of the Ancients, and other medieval legends. In this image, Lugh and Balor, the embattled grandson and grandparent from the Second Battle of Magh Tuireadh, are shown in opposition to one another, Lugh with his unstoppable spear and Balor with his irresistibly poisonous gaze. As with the prior two we successfully Kickstarted, this deck will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company (USPCC) and will contain:  \na custom back,\n12 custom-designed Court Cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings),\n36 custom-designed pip cards (unique to the set, but common across it) ,\n4 custom-designed Aces (unique to the set, but common across it),\n2 custom-designed Jokers, and  \n1 info card concerning the company or a custom designed Cut Card (depending on if we break through the 12.5K Stretch Goal).\n1 info card detailing the symbolism of the card back and where one can go to find more information (www.culturlan.com). \nThe tuck box featuring the card back, as well as the majority of the court cards, can be viewed below.\nABOUT THE PIPS\nWhile the usual suits are recognizable in our deck, we present them as the four jewels of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann, magical items of immense power representing among other things martial prowess, wealth, abundance, and leadership.\nAll of the Spades are bisected by the Sword of Nuadha, also known as the Sword of Valor, which was said to help the bearer to defeat any opponent they faced in combat. It provided its bearer with the insight to discern order from the seeming chaos of battle.\nThe Diamond symbol surrounds the Lia F\u00e1il, which is a stone in Ireland said to shout aloud when beneath the one meant to be the High King. Still standing in the heart of Ireland and comparable to the Stone of Scone of Scotland, the Lia F\u00e1il represents the wealth and status inherent to the Celtic ideal of nobility and good rulership.\nHearts represent the Dadga's Cauldron embodying the principle of abundance. The cauldron throughout Celtic tradition is a symbol of poetic inspiration, brewing intoxicating pleasure from the viscera of human experience.\nThe Clubs are each pierced by the Spear of Lugh, as shown in the picture featured at the top of the project page. It was not only irresistible but the weapon of a true leader as no army could stand against the one who wielded it.\nTHE GAME\nPLAY\n\nARD R\u00cd is a 2 to 5 player strategic competitive card game, designed for players ages 14 and up. Average game-play time is 30 to 60 minutes. \nIn the game, players take on the role of ancient Gaelic warlords and compete among each other to collect the most wealth in order to force the other players to acknowledge them as the ARD R\u00cd (i.e. the High King).\nThere are two different types of cards in the game: \nCattle cards, represented by the numbered cards and the Aces, and \nWarrior Cards, represented by the Court cards (i.e. Jacks, Queens, and Kings) \nCattle cards are synonymous with wealth and are worth the number represented on the card. For example, a 10 is worth 10 cattle-points, and a 4 is worth 4 cattle-points. Aces each represent a Bull and are worth 15 cattle-points apiece. The different suits represent different types of cattle. Cattle cards are played face-up into a player\u2019s gort (i.e. their cattle-field). This is the open area in front of each player. \nWarrior cards are ranked such that Kings will defeat Queens and Jacks in battle, and Queens will defeat Jacks. When cards of equal rank battle, both are killed. Warrior Cards are initially played face-down into a player\u2019s Roundhouse, which is the open area adjacent to a player's gort. When they have proven themselves in Raiding or Defense, warriors are turned face-up and are considered \"Proven\". Proven warriors provide the player who controls them with additional benefits (though they also come with additional restrictions).\nPlay progresses through the seasons of the year, with each season providing players with the opportunity to engage in specified actions. For instance, Cattle are added to a player\u2019s wealth in Spring, with Warriors flocking to banners in the Summer. Wealth is acquired from the wilds during the harvest time of Autumn, with the Harvest Feast of Samhain occurring at the end of that season. At the Harvest Feast, players are required to feed those Warriors they wish to remain under their banner. Winter is a time of hunting, raiding, and politicking, when fortunes can change in a heartbeat. \nPlay continues until one player accumulates enough wealth or warriors to force the issue and cause the others to acknowledge them as High King. \nThe game comes with three editions:\na Children's Edition (designed for children ages 5 to 13), \nthe Basic game (described above), & \nan Advanced Edition which features special powers for each of the figures displayed on the Jacks, Queens, & Kings - drawn directly from the mythology.\nPlease note that while 1 deck can support a 2-player game, we recommend 2 decks for games of 3 to 4 players, and 3 decks for 5-player games.\nTHE TUCK\nFor our third deck, we are offering our packing in Classical Gaelic, the common ancestor of Irish and Scottish Gaelic.\nTHE CARD BACK\nTHE COURT CARDS\nIn the emblem of the diamond is the silhouette of the Lia F\u00e1il.\nThe spear of Lugh is at the heart of the suit of clubs.\nHearts are based on the cauldron of the Daghda, a cauldron that shows up in Welsh mythology as a cauldron of poetic inspiration.\nSpades are based on the Sword of Nuadha.\nABOUT THE SYMBOLISM\nThe early cultures of Europe conceived reality as being more than what it seemed. Appearances were inherently deceiving because super-normal powers could appear human, animal, and any combination thereof. Giants were not always enormous, hulking monsters but could appear as a normal human being or an insignificant animal. This is why the ogre in the original Puss in Boots could turn into a mouse and be eaten by the eponymous hero. \nNevertheless, the clever and resourceful could look past appearances and see the reality behind them by reading the unobtrusive clues. These clues form a vocabulary of symbols associated with the powers behind them: the swans associated with Manann\u00e1n mac L\u00edr, the battle, madness and death associated with the Neamhain, or the golden, youthful beauty associated with the Bodhbh Dearg. Each image on the cards is constructed by assembling such symbols and depicting them with the clarity and realism expected by modern audiences. The lover of Celtic myth, returning to such collections as Jeffrey Gantz\u2019s Early Irish Myths and Sagas or Tales of the Elders of Ireland by Ann Dooley and Harry Roe, will find the characters more familiar and recognizable having studied our cards. \nIn addition, all of the images reflect the material culture of the medieval and classical Celts, incorporating La T\u00e8ne and Hallstatt designs with that of the Book of Kells and Tara Brooch among many others. Our goal is to reconnect with the artistic inspiration of the Celts from the long past and extrapolate it into our time, remaining true to the original muse while bringing it into our modern world. \nADD-ONS\nADDITIONAL DECKS ($12):\nPlease add $12 for each additional deck you'd like us to include with your pledge rewards. You will be able to specify which deck you'd like mailed to you (the asymmetrical, the original symmetrical design, or our newest deck) at the end of the campaign.\nCanadians: Please include an additional $3 per deck for S&H.\nAll other international locations: please include an additional $6 per deck for S&H.\nAsymmetrical Deck\nOriginal Symmetrical Deck\nSTRIPPER DECKS ($15): Please add $15 for each stripper deck you'd like us to include with your pledge rewards.  \nCanadians: Please include an additional $3 per deck for S&H. \nAll other international locations: please include an additional $6 per deck for S&H.\nCHALLENGE COINS ($12):\nThe two sides of the Challenge Coin\nEach coin is 1.75\" with an antique silver finish and a reeded edge (note please that the metal is NOT silver; it has a finish designed to make it appear similar to antique silver).

He brings more than seven years\u2019 experience researching and teaching mythology, history and related subjects at the university level. The combination of his academic background with his artistry provides him with the ability to produce images that are deeply informed by myth and long-established traditions of storytelling.\nABOUT THE GAME DESIGNERS\nArd R\u00ed has been designed by three members of the Cult\u00farl\u00e1n team and refined by an army of play-testers, to whom we owe a deep debt and are profoundly grateful. \nThe three members of the Cult\u00farl\u00e1n team are James Acken, Jay Henry, and Todd Silverstein. All three have been gaming addicts from an early age and can still often be found playing games or \"discussing\" rules while desperately searching for supporting evidence of their interpretation on BoardGameGeek and other sites.\nABOUT THE COMPANY\nWe at Cult\u00farl\u00e1n seek to re-contextualize historic practices and beliefs in an effort to make them more accessible. Through a combination of free market tools, academic expertise, and innovative creativity, we attempt to blur the boundaries between education and entertainment, offering highly functional products and services informed with a deeply knowledgeable aesthetic.\nwww.culturlan.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've previously successfully funded and printed a playing card project through Kickstarter and we have a very good handle on the process. Additionally, we are working with great people at the USPCC Custom Division to print these decks. To top things off, the game has been playtested extensively and almost all of the card artwork is finished; we are simply waiting on the funds to go to print.\n\nAll of that said, there is always the chance of an unexpected delay.\n\nWe will work hard to ensure no delays occur, but should we at any point believe we are behind schedule, we promise to advise you of the issue and what we are doing to resolve it. We also promise to stay in contact with you at least once per week until project rewards are shipped.

I highly recommend you to buy the game upon release. I know I will.\"\nDeyan Georgiev, BigBoxGamers.com\nHello Everybody, And Welcome To The World Of Battalia!\nFirst, let me introduce ourselves with one sentence. We are a small team of passionate board game players, (including a warrior, a snow queen, a leprechaun, a dwarf, a giant and a dream walker), who also have some experience in board game publishing and who with a little help form their friends, after more than 2 years of development, have finally finished their first own game. Hurray!! If you want to learn more about us, check our bio, website and the information at the bottom.\nNow, let me walk you trough our project.\nWhat kind of game is this?\nBATTALIA: The Creation is a medium weight strategy game for 2-4 players, ages 13 and up. An expansion for up to 6 players is on our schedule, but for now let\u2019s focus on the basics: the game combines the mechanics of map construction, deck building, hero and area control and unique calendar mechanics.\nIn-Game Layout\nWhat actually happens during the game?\nIn the base game, you will buy useful artefacts and hire battle units to support your armies, you will build roads and cities and send your heroes to battle - you will have to find the most powerful mixture of all these assets and apply them at the right moment, so you could claim to be the rightful ruler of Battalia and win the game. A victory can be obtained through aggressive conquest or a peaceful development of your own city system (if you are lucky and the others let you ... :) .\nThe interesting game play will provide you with the opportunity to make key decisions and turn the tides of even the grimmest outcomes. A player can outmaneuver and BE outmaneuvered by his opponents at any point during the game. Dynamic atmosphere and intense battles are key factors in the overall experience, however the game strives to stimulate planning and strategy over rash and impulsive decisions.\nIn general this is not a luck based game, because of the core deck building mechanics, but a die is integrated as an optional element and is the ingredient, which spices up the game for all the fortunate fellows! You will find also an element of bluffing, when you fight your battles, so put the poker face on and be ready to outsmart your opponent.\nThe game is defined by the unique combination of mechanics, aesthetic art style, and the presence of large scale 3D Hero figures in four colors, representing the leaders of the players army and their movement on the board.\n\n\nGame Features:\nBasic game mode\nAdvanced game mode for experienced players\nAlternative game scenarios - including completely new game setup for adventurous type of players.\nModular map, built during the game \nFour factions - the Bearfolk, the Cloudborn, the Emberians, the Islanders\nUnique calendar mechanics\nUnique cards purchase mechanics\nVideo rules (available at the end of this summer)\n\nWhat is in the box?\nThe game contains the following components:\nGame board\nA special dial, called \u201cThe Sun Oracle\u201d\nAt least 333 cards\nA bunch of city tokens - 61 pcs.\n8 Miniatures\n4 Reference sheets\n1 Die - standard D6\nAnd of course - a Rulebook - 12 pages\nAnd here is the components breakdown:\nUnits are the heart of any players deck. There are four types resp. ranks - Frimen, Chiefs, Priests and Lords. These cards are used for creating new artefacts, building roads or cities and of course for conducting battles.\nThere are seven types of artefacts, each of them with its own special ability. The players use them for faster development, to upgrade their units, to transform their factions, to travel on the game board, etc. - they will give you a lot of flexibility.\nThe Great Artefacts are powerful objects crafted in ancient times. Every one of them has its own unique ability and provides big advantages to the player who earned it.\nTerrain cards can be cities or roads. They are used for the construction of the map, and.. well - to gain victory points. No matter how strong is your deck, if you don\u2019t have cities, you have nothing!\nWhat we have here is 56 x 56 cm game board, city tokens to mark the level and the owner of the cities, reference sheets to help the players with the different costs in the game and the supply cards which are actually very, very important cards, as they are used for hiring units, building roads, traveling and more. \nNow, let me tell you a few words about the Sun Oracle, shortly called Orac, as it is a key element of the game. The Oracle is almighty ancient monument, eternal apprentice of the nature itself and the hand of the gods among humans and beasts. The Oracle provides advantages to the players and it could support you, if you catch the lucky moment on a sunny day... It counts the days and guides you through the never-ending competition between the folks that inhabit these lands.\nSome pictures of the first prototypes and size reference.\nThe miniatures. There are 8 large scale miniatures which represent the players\u2019 heroes in the game. These figures are the leaders of a player\u2019s armies and mark players\u2019 presence on the game board. Plus - they look amazing!\nThe factions.\nFour factions coexist in the world of Battalia. Most of the cards in the game (units, artefacts and terrain cards) and the 8 figures belong to one of the four factions. A leading concept in the game is that the four factions can freely collaborate with each other, but many units from the same faction, using their own artefacts, are much stronger together. Also, unlike all other games where the players choose their factions, in this game the factions choose the players.\nThe Cloudborn\nThe Bearfolk\nThe Islanders\nThe Emberians\nBATTALIA : The Creation - PDF English rule book - not final, we are still editing spelling & wording!\n                                          Like Battalia: The Creation on facebook\n    Here the short Introduction from OTSBGR, which came last, but gives a very good quick overview :\nYou definitely should watch this one!

We are cooperating with more than 30 famous publishers like FFG, KOSMOS, Hans im Glueck, AMIGO, IELLO and others. During this time we have published Bulgarian localized editions of many worldwide popular board games such as \u201cGame Of Thrones: The Board Game\u201d, \u201cSid Meier\u2019s Civilization\u201d, \u201cThe Legends Of Andor\u201d, \u201cUbongo\u201d, \u201cCarcassonne\u201d, \u201cWizard\u201d, \u201cAtlantis\u201d, \u201c King Of Tokyo\u201d, etc\u2026 This means a lot of EXPERIENCE for us! Our production sites are located mainly in Germany, US and China, so international logistics are not an obstacle for us and meanwhile we know very well how to play the \u201cbig game\u201d called PUBLISHING.\nPlease note: the estimated delivery date is mid-November 2015, but please keep in mind that this is only an informed guess. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others. We will do our best to minimize this as much as possible, but if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all we are always ready to refund pledges in full.\nOf course, there are risks with every project, but we hope that our track record in publishing and our commitment to do everything as good as possible will gain your trust in us , dear Backer! Battalia: The Creation will be our first own \u201cbaby\u201d and we don\u2019t want to do anything wrong after two and a half years of development.\n Production shipping or customs delays are always possible, but since our game is 95% complete, a small delay is probably the worst thing that could occur on this project. The most sophisticated part of our project is probably the production of the Battalia heroes. Yes, exactly \u2013 these large and beautiful, but really complicated for production figurines. They are expensive, the process takes a lot of time and commitment, but the result is really worth the effort \uf04a. To ensure a smooth and accurate production and delivery, we are cooperating with an old partner who is among , the best production factories in Germany - a renown specialist in the board game field with really high quality standards for everything they produce \u2013 miniatures, game material, game board, boxes and so on\u2026. This should put everyone's minds at ease, regarding quality and delivery schedule!\nWe have no reason to expect that something could go terribly wrong, but in case that this happens, please check our refund policy.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 60 days of the campaign\u2019s end, charges included, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. After this period a refund without any explanation is still possible, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and Stripe payment processing fees (as we will not be refunded by them after this 60 day period). However, once we\u2019ve begun packaging your rewards for shipment (usually 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), refunds are no longer possible. \nImportant: If a game or component cannot be delivered at all (which is very unlikely), at your wish we will refund you the full amount, including fees, or we will try to work with you per e-mail and find a satisfactory solution for your individual case.\nPlease note: All refunds requested during the original 60 day period are returned to your credit card via Stripe. Refunds requested after this period will be processed via PayPal only!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "FANTASMAGORIA Games LLC\n3 created \u00b7 56 backed\nFantasmagoria is a young board game publisher and a creative studio.

I think the fire, water, air, and earth factions need faction specific powers, advantages, and maybe even weaknesses. These can be tied to the heroes (i.e.: each hero can have a unique thematic power, which also helps to differentiate the heroes from each other) and also to some of the cards (for instance, if you play an earth cohort, you activate an additional and different effect from a fire cohort; or an air amulet has a different additional effect from a water amulet; a water weapon gains an additional bonus against a fire hero, etc.). These additional effects can be in the form of optional advanced rules, for those who would prefer a totally symmetric game without thematic effects.

The main symbol is the Uroboros, the immortal God-snake who eats its own tail, represents the beginning and the end of time.\nThere are three different Omnia decks, and every deck represents a dimensional plane in the Omnia Universe. Oscura is the dark side, Illumina the bright one and Suprema is the plane where the Gods live.  \nEvery court live a different reincarnation in each deck: in Oscura their soul is more dark, they are more malicious, angry or sad. In Illumina they are much more happy, brave and generous. In Suprema they are ascended to Divine, and show their power with elaborate armors, jewels and wings. Think every deck as a different mirror, who reflects every Omnia court with a different soul.\nSome symbology\nThe Ankh was the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic character that read \"life\". It represents the concept of eternal life, and the Egyptian Gods are often portrayed carrying it by its loop.\nThe Ibis was an object of religious veneration in ancient Egypt, particularly associated with the deity Thoth. He is responsible for writing, mathematics, measurement and time as well as the moon and magic.\nAnubis is the Greek name of a jackal-headed god associated with mummification and the afterlife in ancient Egyptian religion.\nThe Philosopher's Stone is a legendary alchemical substance said to be capable of turning base metals such as lead into gold.\nOdin is the chief god of the Norse pantheon. He gave one of his eyes for the price of wisdom, and usually disguise himself as an old man. He uses a legendary spear, Gungnir.\nFreya is a goddess associated with love, sexuality, beauty, fertility, gold and death. She and Odin are the Omnia Suprema Jokers.\nJanus is the god of beginnings and transitions,and thereby of gates, doors, doorways, passages and endings. He is usually depicted as having two faces, since he looks to the future and to the past.\nFortuna was the goddess of fortune and personification of luck in Roman religion. She might bring good luck or bad: she could be represented as veiled and blind, as in modern depictions of Justice, and came to represent life's capriciousness.\n Badges & Goodies\nIf you are a proud backer of Omnia Playing Cards, you can support the project changing your profile image (Kickstarter or Socials) with our badges. All the courts are included.\nI also added some Omnia mobile phones wallpaper (Nexus5, iPhone 5&6). Free, even if you are not a backer! \nUPDATED! Illumina and Suprema phone backgrounds are available!\nDownload the badges \nDownload the backgrounds here\nCredits & Notes\nOmnia is a Thirdway Industries deck, and will be available on Thirdway Store when the campaign will be over. \nFollow Thirdway Industries on the socials!

Although there were some technical difficulties with the one of the printers and other issue, I've taken what I've learned from that experience and will apply a more efficient yet effective process to allow for another successful campaign. As always, I have done a lot of research and followed up on a lot of companies to ensure that this project goes as smoothly as possible. There may be the risks of the unforeseen but I have prepared myself enough with knowledge and research to minimize it if necessary.

Love means different things to different people. \nSo, here is \"What is love?\u201d in my opinion:\nUncut Sheets\nThe front side of \"Love is ...\" uncut sheet (frame not included).\nSheet dimensions (paper): approx. 510mm x 750mm, 20\" x 29.5\" (frame not included).\n\"Love is ...\" tuck case.\nAvailable with embossing on the tuck case! \n STRETCH GOALS:\nThis deck will be printed at the highest quality by MPC on 310gsm French casino quality card stock with black core (linen finish), unless we could reach our Stretch Goal ($10,000), which will allow me to print with the USPCC (United States Playing Card Company) on magnificent Bicycle card stock. In this case, the run will be 2500 decks.\nYour support of this Kickstarter campaign will help me cover the costs of setup fees, proof charges, printing, photography, and the time to create the 54 original pieces of art. \nMy goal is to create decks that are playable, unique, and valuable.\nI hope you can back me and help me realize my goal!\nThank you so much! :)\nADD - ONS:\nThese Add-ons can be added to any backer level. \nTo add on a product, keep your pledge level the same, and simply add the amount listed below to your pledge amount. You will receive a survey at the end of this campaign so that you can detail what your pledge was for, and you will receive any extra items that you want.\nThank you!  \nIf you missed my \"Russian Folk Art\" Project: it is available at www.nataliasilva.net", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks of production delays, but whatever problems arise, I will quickly resolve any issues.

Have your pick of Regal\u2019s four (4) fancy color themes (one color to a deck): red, purple, blue, or green.\n\u201cI was really influenced by the classic standard English courts, but I wanted to do them in a cleaner, more sophisticated and regal appearance\u2014hence the name.\u201d\n\u2014John Powell, designer of Regal\nJohn Powell has become a Gambler\u2019s Warehouse mainstay with a number of top-selling custom decks already to his credit, including the sinister Double Black and the stunning Occults.\nRegal playing cards are unmistakably unique yet practical and familiar\u2014a must for any serious collector.\nEach deck of Gambler\u2019s Warehouse Regal playing cards includes:\nCustom Face Cards, Court Cards, Jokers, and Tuck-Box\nPrinted Inner Tuck Design\nPrinting by EPCC\nMETALLIC GOLD INKS ON CARDS & TUCK BOXES\nREGAL RED\nThe Heart of Regal Playing Cards\nRed is the color of fire and blood, so it is associated with energy, war, danger, strength, power, determination as well as passion, desire, and love. In heraldry, red is used to indicate courage. It is a color found in many national flags. It's richness and connections to romance love and rage that were in every Regal house throughout the ages.\nREGAL BLUE\nA Reflection of the Sea and Sky\nBlue is the color of the sky and sea. It is often associated with depth and stability. It symbolizes trust, loyalty, wisdom, confidence, intelligence, faith, truth, and heaven its close association with royalty and the royal family, blue blood and such was an easy and obvious choice to make when selecting for our Regal deck palette.\nREGAL GREEN\nPower in the Form of a Deck\nGreen is the first color I began to design the deck with it immediately had a tie in my mind with the Regal family. Green is commonly associated with money and wealth. Money = Power. Power over everything has always been a hallmark of nearly every Regal monarchy known to man. It seemed like the easiest decision to make for me.\nREGAL PURPLE\nThe Epitome of Luxury and Extravagance \nPurple combines the stability of blue and the energy of red. Purple is associated with royalty. It symbolizes power, nobility, luxury, and ambition. It conveys wealth and extravagance. Purple is associated with wisdom, dignity, independence, creativity, mystery, and magic all of which were the foundations we based the Regal deck off of.\nREGAL ACES\nREGAL DUO SETS\nRegal decks are available in single decks or specially priced as sets of two.

The diamonds have clearly an Egyptian resemblance, but overall they belong to a parallel world. There is a thing that connects all the court cards: the text circling the background is a part of the Aeneid, a Latin epic poem written by Virgil between 29 and 19 BC, that tells the legendary story of Aeneas, a Trojan who traveled to Italy, where he became the ancestor of the Romans. \nI am Lorenzo, I live and work in Stockholm, Sweden.

Thick lines, a weathered look, high grade linen textured paper and a simple yet striking design makes these cards the perfect gift for patriots, conservatives and liberals alike.\nIn our deck are many great quotes by the Founding Fathers, this is one of them: \"When the government fears the people, it is liberty. When the people fear the government, it is tyranny.\" -- Thomas Paine\nThe message they fought and died for got through and was penned in the Constitution, \"We the people\"! \nYou are on the front lines of the political battles of today.

Not only did its design build upon the achievements of the industry leaders, but it was accessible to the common man.\n King of Spades: Henry Ford\nBecause he created an automobile nearly any American could own, the Model T - which in 1922 were driven by half of all drivers in America, and the credit he is given for the popularity of the assembly line it has been said that Henry Ford \u201c[put] the World on Wheels.\u201d\nQueen of Spades: Mary Anderson\nMen laughed at Mary Anderson.They made fun of her and her silly little device.But in 1905 they stopped laughing when she was granted U.S. Patent No. 743,801 for her \u201cwindow cleaning device for electric cars and other vehicles to remove snow, ice or sleet from the window.\u201dYes the windshield wiper was invented by a Southern Belle named Mary Anderson.\nJack of Spades: Karl Benz\nKarl Benz, was a German engine designer and car engineer, generally regarded as the inventor of the first automobile powered by an internal combustion engine, and together with Bertha Benz, pioneering founder of the automobile manufacturer Mercedes-Benz.\n Ace of Spades: The Wright Flyer 1\nThe first flight, by Orville at 10:35 am, of 120 feet (37 m) in 12 seconds, at a speed of only 6.8 miles per hour (10.9 km/h) over the ground, was recorded in a famous photograph. The next two flights covered approximately 175 and 200 feet (53 and 61 m), by Wilbur and Orville respectively. Their altitude was about 10 feet (3.0 m) above the ground.\nKing of Diamonds: Wilbur Wright\nWilbur Wright was the oldest of the two Wright brothers, together invented the world's first successful airplane. The brothers successfully conducted the first free, controlled flight of a power-driven airplane on December 17, 1903.\nQueen of Diamonds: Amelia Mary Earhart \n(July 24, 1897 \u2013 disappeared July 2, 1937) was an American aviation pioneer and author. Earhart was the first female aviator to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. She received the U.S. Distinguished Flying Cross for this record. She set many other records, wrote best-selling books about her flying experiences and was instrumental in the formation of The Ninety-Nines, an organization for female pilots. \nJack of Diamonds: Orville Wright\nOrville Wright was the youngest of the two Wright brothers, together invented the world's first successful airplane. The brothers successfully conducted the first free, controlled flight of a power-driven airplane on December 17, 1903.\nAce of Clubs: The Light Bulb\nIn addressing the question of who invented the incandescent lamp, historians Robert Friedel and Paul Israel list 22 inventors of incandescent lamps prior to Joseph Swan and Thomas Edison. They conclude that Edison's version was able to outstrip the others because of a combination of three factors: an effective incandescent material, a higher vacuum than others were able to achieve (by use of the Sprengel pump) and a high resistance that made power distribution from a centralized source economically viable.\nKing of Clubs: Thomas Alva Edison \nThomas Alva Edison was an American inventor and businessman. He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and a long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. Dubbed \"The Wizard of Menlo Park\", he was one of the first inventors to apply the principles of mass production and large-scale teamwork to the process of invention, and because of that, he is often credited with the creation of the first industrial research laboratory.\nQueen of Clubs: Ida Henrietta Hyde\nThe smallest functional unit of an organism is a cell.  And, though microscopic, there is valuable information hidden inside these small structures.  We cannot see that information with the naked eye.  But when a woman, who burrowed her way into the science arena, came up with a microscopic version of the electrode, it revolutionized neurophysiology and illuminated the possibility of research on a cellular level.  An electrode is an electrical conductor used to make contact with non-metallic surfaces.  The invention of a microelectrode, that could stimulate a living cell and record the electrical activity within the cell without damaging it, has changed the face of nerve and tissue understanding and research. \nJack of Clubs: Nicola Tesla\nLittle did Duka Tesla know that her fourth of five children would harness the power of Niagra Falls, work for-and then against- Thomas Edison, create the A.C. induction motor that would be used all over the world in household (and industrial) appliances, conceive the polyphase alternating current system, win the \u201cWar of Currents\u201d over Thomas Edison, and through his inventions \u201clight\u201d the entire planet we call earth. \nAce of Hearts: The Invention of the Telephone\nOn June 2, 1875, Watson accidentally plucked one of the reeds and Bell (Alexander Graham Bell), at the receiving end of the wire, heard the overtones of the reed; overtones that would be necessary for transmitting speech. That demonstrated to Bell that only one reed or armature was necessary, not multiple reeds. This led to the \"gallows\" sound-powered telephone, which could transmit indistinct, voice-like sounds, but not clear speech.\n King of Hearts: Alexander Graham Bell\n(March 3, 1847 \u2013 August 2, 1922)was an eminent Scottish-born scientist, inventor, engineer and innovator who is credited with inventing the first practical telephone.\n Queen of Hearts: Ada Lovelace\nAugusta Ada Byron and now commonly known as Ada Lovelace, was an English mathematician and writer chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. Because of this, she is often described as the world's first computer programmer.\nJack of Hearts: Samuel Morse\n(April 27, 1791 \u2013 April 2, 1872) was an American painter and inventor. After having established his reputation as a portrait painter, in his middle age Morse contributed to the invention of a single-wire telegraph system based on European telegraphs. He was a co-developer of the Morse code, and helped to develop the commercial use of telegraphy.\nHow to add to your pledge:\n1.

On the back there is a scene with the Delirium Gods of War.\nHere is the opened Delirium Prism Tuck Box. \n A rendering of the Delirium Prism with JoD card (Delirium Heavy Infantry)\n Another view of two Delirium decks, front and back.\nThe prismatic effect on the Tuckbox is just photoshop, the final result of the prismatic effect will be different.\nDelirium Cards\nDelirium courts have a classic vibe but crazy expressions. Here are some courts, aces and jokers. The inspiration of this deck is just a simple burraco deck by Modiano.

I definitely won't be supporting REGAL and it's not because the card design isn't good.", "time": "over 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Da'Mon - World's Worst Magician", "content": "This is my first project that I backed on Kickstarter, and it has been a really lackluster experience. As a Customer supporting an idea and helping it see production, the only thing that I ask is transparency. It's a little frustrating sitting here almost 2 months after the original launch and watching this company launch multiple projects while neglecting this one. It only takes a few minutes to provide a little clarity and help ease frustration, please take the time to do so. I also backed the Spirit playing cards but won't be continuing as a loyal Customer if this is how it will be each time.", "time": "over 6 years ago"}, {"username": "Jeff Jenness", "content": "Two weeks past last update and one week passed the \"probable\" shipping date.
