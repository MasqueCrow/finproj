[{"backer": "Ronny Anderssen", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Engage in power struggles and build your crew\u2019s reputation. Salvage and steal to survive and endure a ruthless universe. And above all, do anything you can to get that next job.\nThis sci-fi tabletop roleplaying game takes you to the grimy blue-collar future of a universe filled with risk, but also opportunity. DEATH IN SPACE presents a vision of space where technology is broken and dirty, and society is harsh and desperate. The player characters make up a crew with their own spacecraft or station, and take on the jobs they can find, in order to earn some well-needed bucks and get ahead in the power struggles of the stellar system. \nThe people making this game are Christian Plogfors and Carl Niblaeus of Stockholm Kartell. With this Kickstarter, we hope to get the funds to print the core book for the game, which should contain everything you need to start playing. We want to continue making material for the game after the game is out, in the form of adventures and other material to use in your game. \nFollow us on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or on the website. \n\nHere's a preview of what we hope the standard edition of the book will look like (the holographic foil is stretchgoal-dependent):\nDEATH IN SPACE has its roots in the OSR scene, and follows similar design principles. In terms of setting and tone, inspiration comes primarily from the gritty science fiction of films like Outland and Prospect, classic westerns and the grimy future of early 80\u2019s science fiction movies. \nIt is a game about adventure and uncertain journeys out into the darkness of space, it is about you and your crew making a home of your spacecraft or station, in tough competition with everyone else, and most of all, it is about enduring in an abandoned frontier system where your only hope of surviving is to take any contract you can find, sometimes having to put your fate in your enemies' hands.\nInspiration\nThere are a lot of great and inspiring games out there. In terms of rules and approach, we have found inspiration in some form, large or small, in for example the following games (alphabetically listed): Coriolis, Into the Odd, Knave, Mothership, Mutant Year Zero, M\u00d6RK BORG, Offworlders, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells, Mutant  (1989 edition), Traveller. Out of these, M\u00d6RK BORG, Knave and Coriolis deserve a special mention.\nMost of the inspiration for the tone and feel comes from movies and series. Some of these, that have inspired elements of the setting in one way or another, are (alphabetically listed): 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Fistful of Dollars, Alien, Blade Runner, Escape from New York, The Expanse, Firefly, IO, Moon, Outland, Prospect, Sunshine, Total Recall, The Warriors. \nVisually, much of the inspiration comes from abstract geometric art and design, and old computer interfaces and manuals.\n\nIn terms of music, one of our stretchgoals consists of a dedicated soundtrack for the game, by our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon. You can already listen to a preview of what that will sound like on Spotify (or scroll down to the stretchgoal list and listen immediately). \n\n\nStandard edition with holographic foil (not final)\nKickstarter exclusive edition (not final)\nOur main goal is to print a durable book of excellent quality that is easy to use at the table. We aim for an offset printed book with a sewn binding and possibly some fancy extras, depending on which stretchgoals are funded.\nThe book should land at about 128 pages and measure 6 by 9 inches. You can choose from two cover versions: the standard cover, and a special edition, only available in the Kickstarter.\nRegarding the covers, we plan for the special edition to be a cloth bound book, and the regular edition cover to be embellished with holographic foil (the silvery kind with reflecting colors), if we fund the corresponding stretchgoal (otherwise, the holographic parts will be a solid color). Apart from that, there are more possible upgrades to the book in stretchgoals. Basically, we don\u2019t want to pull any punches, and will try to make this as nice a book as possible.\nContentwise, the core rulebook contains everything you need to start playing immediately:\n Light-weight rules, intended to be easy to use and quick to learn\n  A system for quickly generating player characters and their spacecraft or space-station\n   60+ different modules to make the spacecraft or space-station your own\n  An introduction to the default setting, the Tenebris stellar system, its main locations and history (with many pieces of the puzzle left for you to fill in)\n  A system for repairs, where you collect spare parts to repair your stuff\n   20 cosmic mutations, representing physical manifestations of the void through your body\n  A system for spacecraft confrontations and boarding\n  An introductory scenario to jumpstart your campaign\n   40+ tables and generators packed with setting flavor\nBelow are some preliminary spreads to give you a flavor of how the interior of the book will look like:\nThe rules of DEATH IN SPACE are intended to be easy to use and hack but also to support and introduce the setting through the rules. While inspired by OSR games, the primary intent is not to be fully compatible with the rulesets and modules of old, but rather to try to capture the quickness and simplicity of these rulesets, tweak them according to our preferences and add some setting flavor (however, the rules are still close enough to other OSR rulesets that material should be possible to use with some simple conversions).\nThe basic rule when you try to accomplish something, say force open an airlock, or resist the effects of strange radiation, is to roll a d20 modified by one of four ability values, the ability determined by the nature of the task. If you roll over a fixed difficulty, you succeed. Failing checks gives you void points that you can use to increase your chances the next time you attempt something. Beware of saving up too many though, that might result in some nasty consequences. Void points are also used to activate cosmic mutations, strange powers from the void. \nThe player characters are all part of a crew with their own spacecraft or space-station, their sanctuary in a dangerous universe. Characters are generated in a quick randomized fashion, making it quick to make a new one when (not if)  your character suffers an accident. With a list of 60+ modules that provide new possibilities, the players can successively customize their ship or station and really make it their home and base of their adventures. If your ship or gear should break, you can repair it as soon as you collect the necessary spare parts. In case you encounter rivals on your travels, the rules for spacecraft confrontations determine the outcome and whether you can avoid being boarded.\nDEATH IN SPACE focuses on the Tenebris system\u2014a system of planets and objects revolving around the star Tenebris. It is a stellar system ravaged by war and strife, where a greed-fueled mining for precious gems ended in a conflict that laid waste to the intricate trade networks that ensured technological production. With no new parts to find, almost every single object built today, from weapon to spacecraft, is put together from discarded, salvaged or stolen parts. Nothing is new.\nAs if rebuilding the system after the war was not enough, there are reports from stargazing cosmologists that the universe has stopped expanding, and that it has instead begun collapsing at an accelerating rate. The news that civilization is at its end have created a sense of hopelessness and disorder, and in many sectors of the system former vassals have taken this chance to seize control from distant rulers.\nPlayer spacecraft concept by Mattias Astenvald\nIn the heart of the Tenebris system is the Iron Ring\u2014a huge, ring-like structure surrounding the moon Inauro like a belt of metal. This is the center of activity in the Tenebris system, and here miners and salvagers huddle in cramped living quarters, waiting for their next contract and a chance to earn some much needed money. In other parts of the Ring, far from the bustling market-places and common areas, there are dark, empty sectors, where shady types hide from attention.\nAmong the people of the Iron Ring, cryptic rumors are spreading about a void accelerating the collapse. A void that whispers strange sentences to the unlucky through the ever present thick static noise that grows stronger and stronger as you travel towards the edge of civilization. A void that infects and corrupts and imbues their bodies with odd powers.\nIn the middle of all this are the player characters: hard-working explorers and laborers hoping for a big score.\nThe 99% Void Safe reward level\nVoid protection. With this reward level you get the core book in print, with the cover of your choice (regular or special edition). The book will be wrapped in foil, to keep it safe from the strange void radiation. Better safe than sorry. \nThis is a mockup and not the final product.\nT-shirt. Premium cotton t-shirt from Spreadshirt. We're aiming for a design based on the book cover.\nHandouts. Two maps for the adventure in the core book\u2014Welcome to the Ring\u2014printed on high quality paper. \nStickers. One prismatic sticker portraying the spacecraft by Mattias Astenvald, and one holographic sticker using the graphics from the standard cover. These designs are exclusive for the Kickstarter. Below are preliminary designs.\nSetting location and printed note. We create a location connected to the Iron Ring\u2014an establishment, a station, spacecraft or similar\u2014and dedicate it to you. The locations are planned to be included in a table in the book. You get an individually crafted and printed thank-you letter that also includes the location name and description. \n50000 SEK \u2013 We make this book \nA high-quality offset printed 128-page book including all you need to start playing.\n75000 SEK \u2013 Holographic foil cover\nWe add holographic foil to the regular book cover and make this book glimmer.\n100000 SEK \u2013 Soundtrack\nWe ask our musician collaborator Helium Kid Kanon to make a full-length soundtrack for DEATH IN SPACE, that you can use as background music for your games. Every backer gets the soundtrack digitally, and it will also be made available on Spotify and Bandcamp. Here is how Helium Kid Kanon describes the soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE:\n\"Sound waves from dark, vibrating aegrine were found on a 570 million year old, volcanic island. When passed through a cloud chamber, they turn into an oozing, analog warmth, layered with sparkles of cosmic noise. These are some of the parts, arranged into a multi layered space. A composition that can trigger chronesthesia. The soundscape for DEATH IN SPACE.\"\n 150000 SEK \u2013 Pamphlet adventure\nWe make a pamphlet adventure. All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver.\n200000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add more spacecraft illustrations by artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n250000 SEK \u2013 Map poster\nWe make a map poster of the Tenebris system. For the map, we will receive some help from graphic designer and animator Gabriel Herrin. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect \u2013 one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE \u2013 so we are very happy to have him onboard! All backers get it in pdf form and we include it in print with all rewards except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver. Note that logos are placeholders and will be replaced.\n300000 SEK \u2013 Bookmark ribbon \nWe add a bookmark ribbon to the book, to make it easier to find the page you\u2019re always flipping to.   \n350000 SEK \u2013 More illustrations\nWe add even more spacecraft illustrations by our artist Mattias Astenvald to the book.\n500000 SEK \u2013 New adventure\nWe ask Rickard Antroia to write an adventure for us. The adventure will be released in pdf and all backers get it digitally. Rickard is a writer and designer who has written adventures for Coriolis and Tales from the Loop and worked with editing on Tales from the Loop, Things from the Flood, Vaesen and Alien RPG. He wants to take you on an epic journey to the edge of the universe.\n700000 SEK \u2013 Cults and factions\nPelle Nilsson - from Ockult \u00d6rtm\u00e4stare Games, author of games such as M\u00d6RK BORG and Barkh\u00e4xan among others, contributes to the game by providing a number of cults or factions of the Tenebris system that you can use in your game.\n\n800000 SEK \u2013 Online generator \nWe ask Karl Druid to make an online character generator for us. Karl writes material and makes virtual paraphernalia for tabletop RPGs. He is for example behind the M\u00d6RK BORG online generators scvmbirther and dngngen.  \n\n900000 SEK \u2013 Printed pamphlet #2 \nWe print the adventure pamphlet by Rickard Antroia from the 500k stretch goal. All backers with physical reward levels get it (all reward levels except Orbit Vagabond and Event Horizon Diver). This means that if you get the printed book, you get two different printed adventure pamphlets with it.\n\n1,100,000 SEK \u2013 Solar Fields song and Tenebris system soundscape\nMagnus Birgersson, also known under the name Solar Fields, will write and produce a track inspired by the material included in the book! Solar Fields has released 17 albums and appeared in over 60 compilations, including the in-game scores for the computer games Mirror's Edge and Mirror's Edge Catalyst. You can find his music on Spotify and on other platforms.   \nIn addition, if we pass this stretchgoal, Helium Kid Kanon will create a number of immersive soundscapes that represent various locations and environments in the Tenebris system. A perfect background to amplify your experience while exploring our world.  \nThe songs for the soundtrack and the soundscapes will be published on streaming platforms like Spotify, and backers get them digitally.\nThe majority of the money we collect will fund the printing cost for the book and any other funded print material. The remaining funds will be used to pay our collaborators for their work and costs. \nDEATH IN SPACE will be published by Free League Workshop, Free League Publishing's sublabel for externally designed games. They are responsible for shipping and distribution.\nWe plan to use a pledge manager, and charge shipping separately after the campaign has ended. See the map for our current best estimates of shipping costs*. The current plan is to ship the game from the UK as the default, but with distribution hubs in the EU and US as well. \n* This is based on shipping one book, the map and a pamphlet, and the Moon Outlaw and 99% Void Safe reward levels may therefore incur some extra shipping charges\n\nChristian Plogfors. When he is not writing for DEATH IN SPACE, Christian spends the rest of his time on the layout and graphics for the game. He has been designing worlds for computer games for 18 years, now as a senior level designer, and has contributed to games such as Battlefield, Mirror\u2019s Edge and Star Wars Battlefront. When relaxing, he likes to write material for his Into the Odd hack Into the Jungle. He has also contributed with material and layout for the Night Yeast zine.\nCarl Niblaeus. While almost every sentence of the game has been dissected by both Carl and Christian, Carl has had the last word on much of the language in the book. In the RPG world, Carl has contributed to M\u00d6RK BORG zine Feretory, the Night Yeast zine, and released one or two old school modules before that. He also helps running the so-called Old School Corner (\u201cOld School-h\u00f6rnan\u201d) at GothCon, Sweden\u2019s largest RPG con. There he referees his own and others\u2019 creations. Outside of RPGs, Carl has a PhD in astroparticle physics, and has spent many years researching the underpinnings of our own universe. In DEATH IN SPACE, this knowledge is used to inspire the creation of another.\nCollaborators\nApart from us there are a number of collaborators who provide invaluable assistance in making the game.\nJohan Nohr. As one half of the team behind M\u00d6RK BORG, Johan should be well-known to many in our audience. With M\u00d6RK BORG, he works tirelessly to make it look as great as it does, and we are very happy to have him onboard. In DEATH IN SPACE, Johan has worked with the illustrations, adding touches to give them a more personal feel.\nMattias Astenvald. Mattias is an artist located in Uppsala, Sweden, working in the digital gaming industry. For our game, he helps make reality of our spacecraft and we hope to make use of his great skills as much as we can. \nGabriel Herrin. Seattle-based graphic designer and animator. Gabriel did some work on the movie Prospect, which is one of the big sources of inspiration for DEATH IN SPACE, so we're really happy have him onboard. He will help us make company logos for the map poster. Check out more of his stuff here.\nStockholm Kartell is a creative coven of writers, designers and idiots.

After the campaign we want to spend about 2 months finalising the last few details before doing a proper round of editing and proofreading with a native English speaker.

You discover the tomb is inhabited by an undead queen and her spectral knights. In your exploration you have learned that she was murdered by the patriarchal structures of her own holy order. The method of her execution has denied her eternal rest. She plans murderous vengeance against the living but offers mercy under two conditions. First, help install her as an eternal monarch upon the religious throne. Second, eradicate the bloodline of those who betrayed her. What do you do? \nDungeons & Dilemmas is a collection of system agnostic techniques for designing dungeon-based adventures that engage the players on an emotional and ethical level. The presented process approaches dungeons as their own unique narrative structure, and the encounters within them as moral puzzles.\nDungeons & Dilemmas treats deeper emotional engagement as an additive dimension of play on top of the exploration, hazard avoidance, monster fighting, and treasure collection elements of traditional fantasy adventure games. All the ideas, tools, and techniques presented speak to the strengths of existing rule systems in common use. GMs and players won't have to hand-wave away or house rule their games to accommodate this material.\nFor several years, I have been using these techniques to keep players emotionally engaged and ethically challenged with adventures that reach beyond the stereotype of \"murder hobos\" and excuses to just \"kill things and take their stuff.\" #ZineQuest has provided a unique opportunity for me to share these ideas with you and hopefully help you think about the dungeon fantasy format in a slightly unique and fulfilling way.\nDungeons & Dilemmas is particularly well suited to games like: \nTorchbearer\nDungeon World\nAny of the numerous OSR-style games such as  Old-School Essentials \nAnd, of course, the current edition of the most popular fantasy adventure game.\nProject Structure\nThe current plan is a 5.5 x 8.5 saddle stitched booklet with black and white interior.

It never fails to surprise me when a pop-up unfolds into 3D space from seeming nothingness. I hope you guys will have some of the fun that I had when I got to put these together. These kits are part miniature model, part 3d puzzle, and all paper-craft! As you build them, you'll be guided by the instructions and labels found in the kit, and also full instructional walk-through videos where I build them with you step-by-step. I put a lot of work into making sure these designs would work consistently and look good. It makes me happy every time I see them!\nThese pop-ups are a great way to fill your table up with neat working terrain that doesn't break the bank and is easy to carry around and store.\nThis time around, we are only offering the digital files. That being said, these files are designed to be printed on both A4 and American standard 8.5 x 11 inch letter-sized paper. All of the files (at least those that are completed at the end of the Kickstarter, including the first 5 settings) will be made available to all backers as soon as the Kickstarter funds are distributed to us (Usually within 2 weeks of the project end date).\nAfter printing, the pages will look something like this:\nYou'll need additional supplies such as a hobby knife, double-sided tape, and backing material in order to assemble your pop-ups.  Once you put them together, you will be able to combine them into fantastic miniature worlds!\nOur initial funding goal will cover the design of the first five settings and one flat terrain peice. These will include the Mageboat, the Market Square, the Traveler's Wagon, the Castle Wall, Charlie's Castle, and the Mysterious Grate Flat Hex. \n Mageboat\nThe Mageboat is a watercraft designed to be steered and propelled by magical means. At a 28mm scale it would measure 50 feet from bow to stern. Take your adventures to the high seas with this sturdy vessel!\n Market Square\nAt the Market Square, you can find food, drink, weapons, and a host of other curios. This is probably where that stolen painting wound up, now coated in a thick layer of dust, after nearly 2 decades.\n Traveler's Wagon\nThe travelers are the continent's most prolific traders, and are always a welcome sight. But this cart seems to have been left unattended. Its team of horses and usual occupants are mysteriously missing. It was probably the giant ants. Again. Yes . . . that was what happened.\n Castle Wall\nThe castle wall is the perfect place to hatch a \"storming the castle\" plot. All you need is a wheelbarrow and a holocaust robe. You probably already have both! Print out and assemble 6 copies of the castle wall and you'll have yourself a stronghold!\nCharlie's Castle\nCharlie's castle is a very small castle (more of a fort really) that is mostly used as a customs checkpoint these days. It's fortunate that you adventurers came along, you can clear out the tribe of goblins that have set up camp within its walls. \n Mysterious Grate Flat Hex\nNot technically a pop-up, this hex tile provides some space for your characters to cross on their way to somewhere else. Because is it really a journey if no one journeys? Also, what's going on with that mysterious ground hole?\nWe are excited about making as many pop-up settings as we can to be included in this kit! That's why we are going to keep adding more stretch goals as these ones are met. Our current plan is that every additional thousand dollars pledged to the kickstarter adds a setting to the digital kit!\nCORRUPTED SHRINE: $3000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nThis shrine honors the great philosophers and scientific minds that together founded the Elipsiconian council. Unfortunately, the shrine has lately become the site of several unexplained deaths. It's up to you to discover it's dark secrets! (This setting is a redesign using the basic structure of the Gazebo from our previous Pop-up Kickstarter.)\nTRINKET SHOP and WATERFRONT FLAT HEX: $4000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nWhere do all of these magic amulets and stuff come from? The trinket Shop! Full of magical whosits, whatsits, and at least 20 cursed thingamabobs, the trinket shop is the perfect place to get objects that may or may not offer any magical protection at all.\nThis flat hex serves as a transition from land to water. Here you can fish, swim, and relax as you prepare to head back into the nearby ruins.\nLONE TOWER : $5000 Stretch Goal  - REACHED!\nThis lonely tower is where the orcish sniper is holed up, shooting hapless travelers as they move along the nearby roadway. You guys should head up there and make sure he (OR SHE! Petra asks why it couldn't be a female orcish sniper. Girls can be snipers too!) is stopped. \nTHE DOCKS : $6000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nThese serviceable docks are where people are talking about when they say \"Meet me down by the docks.\" Here the men of the sea come ashore, some boisterously headed for the tavern, others slinking through the shadows like rats.\nThe Pale Tree : $7000 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nIn the woods near my childhood home, there was a large dead tree. It served as a landmark for my brothers and I as we hiked through the woods to the river. I always imagined there was more to that tree. Was it truly dead? If so, why didn't it ever fall?\nThe Mausoleum : $7479 Stretch Goal - REACHED!\nAlthough the manor it once served has long ago burned to the ground, the mausoleum still stands, relatively untouched by time. Recently, the villagers have been hearing an unnatural wailing that seems to be coming from within. It's probably just some surly teenage half-elves, but the mayor would like you to check it out. (The Mausoleum is a redesign of the basic structure of the wooden fort from our first pop-up Kickstarter.)\n\nThe Tavern : $9000 Stretch Goal\n(Rough prototype pictured here) The local watering hole is a great place to gather information or simply regroup after a long day of spider-fighting. This pop-up is designed so that the roof folds back, creating an upper platform and allowing easy access to the interior of the tavern. \n\nAs we reach these goals, more will be added to the kickstarter. We already have some pretty awesome stuff planned, but we also want your suggestions for the terrain you'd like to see in the set!\n$18 Recolored version of Pop-Ups from our original Pop-UpKickstarter\nThis set includes PDF files to create 8 pop-up hexes, 1 large two-hex setting, and 3 smaller diamond settings that can be combined into a single hex. This version will be recolored to match the pop-ups produced by this kickstarter. This add-on also includes files for the original colored and uncolored versions.\n$10 Retextured version of Pop-Ups from our Halfling Adventurers Kickstarter\n(No pictures of this yet)\nThis set includes PDF files to create 4 pop-up hexes and 1 flat hex. This version will be retextured to match the pop-ups produced by this kickstarter. This add-on also includes files for the original version.\nWe are excited to get these pop-up files completed and have them in your hands so you can make them too!

You further acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the order (and the project) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented on Kickstarter.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities.\n\nTypically, import duties are paid up front as part of your shipping costs (which is what \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d means), however, there are certain countries where regulations prevent advance payment by a third party, and you may be responsible to pay customs taxes directly.**\n\n**These countries include, but are not limited to the following: Central and South America (including Brazil), Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Turkey, UAE, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. All customers in these locations must handle their own tariffs, and they order at their own risk, not ours. For Brazil in particular, we suggest you have your product shipped to an address of someone you know outside Brazil who plans on travelling there to hand deliver.\n\nYou are also responsible for providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAs per the terms stated on Kickstarter, a full refund will be provided if the request is received within 14 days of the close of the campaign.\n\nOtherwise such a refund will be at our exclusive discretion and will be net of handling costs, Kickstarter commissions and credit card processing fees (15%).\n\nIf you fail to check out and pay for your order, including shipping costs, before the posted payment deadline, you may be forfeiting your products. Unclaimed games will be released after the closing date to online and retail sales since we lose money on unclaimed games due to storage fees.\n\nRefunds and/or cancellation requests will only be considered before we set the print run size for mass manufacturing with our factory in China, which takes place upon the posted payment deadline for the Pledge Manager.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "8-Bit America", "descp": "Get a copy of 8-Bit Attack that is ALREADY printed and ready to be shipped!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign in the pledge manager.

We have some graphic design work left for the rule book and the back of the box, but we don\u2019t see any potential delays being caused by these tasks.

Roger, by the way, said not to do it! \nThe magazine covers, or fuses, content on all types of gaming including retro, modern, Indie, table top and even toys and there have been 7 issue to date that have been hugely successful with issue #1 selling over 1,250 copies and the others not too far behind.\nEach issue has bespoke artwork, not found anywhere else - it is created specifically for the magazine by Trevor Storey (issue #2 onwards) based on an article or an idea that inside the magazine. The issue #1 cover was produced by Wil Porter - he of Super Play covers for Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) magazine.\nTo continue the idea of the Crash and ZZap! 64 annuals also produced by us, the idea of a FUSION annual was always in the mind - so here it is.  \nThe annual is 120 pages in length and A5 in size, hardback and is colour throughout with high quality 135gsm glossy paper inside just like our Crash and ZZap! 64 Annuals. \nThe cover is shown below and is a Bladerunner type space scene - the first time a cover is not directly  related to content inside, it just looks great. The cover is also drawn by Trevor Storey:  \nThe quality of the annual is exactly the same as the Crash and ZZap! 64 Annual in terms of paper thickness and feel - this annual is not A4 but A5 so will fit nicely in backpacks and bags for reading on long journeys.\nWithout giving away too much of what the inside looks like, here are some double page spreads of what you will find inside to give you a taste of what to expect (remember there are 120 pages in total): \nWe also have a great interview with RJ Michael and features written by The Oliver Twins (Philip and Andrew), Dave Perry (The Games Animal), Stoo Cambridge (Sensible Software), Simon Butler (Ocean Software) and many, many more!\n\u00a310K Stretch Goal\nEach backer will get a 52-page ZX Fusion issue that concentrates just on the ZX Spectrum if we hit the \u00a310K mark.\nChris MacAuley\nChris McAuley broke into the comic book scene last year as a colourist for Marvel and 2000AD. Under the watchful eye of comic book legend John Charles he has worked on characters such as Spiderman, The Incredible Hulk and Judge Dredd. His work recently featured in the Glasgow Museum of Modern Art . Here we have 2 original images for Fusion - they will be signed by Chris and limited to 25 prints of each.\nImage #1\nImage #2\nPosters, canvasses, aluminium prints of each individual cover - just pick the perk you would like then tell us in the questionnaire sent after the Kickstarter which image you would like. I will include multiple perks so you can pick a selection of merchandise with the same image. In the Updates I will let you know to add further perks of the same kind with other images on them.\nSo as an example of the perks on offer with the imagery above...\nPicture Acrylic Block - 6\"x 4\" \nCanvas - 16 x 12\"\nCushion\nAcrylic Photo Print - 12\" x 8\"\nHere is an example of one of these with the ZZap! 64 2019 Annual:\nBoxed Framed Print - 12\" x 8\"\n\nAluminium Prints - 10\"x 7\"\nBinders\n A FUSION branded binder with issue #1 to #6 inside:\n Fusion Retro Books are responsible for producing high quality retro books that follow two distinct series paths.

Return to District 9 and relive the three days of the film from a whole new perspective. Lead your Faction through the alien slum in a search for the tech that will give you the edge. Salvage the most technology, take control of the district, and claim your victory!\nDistrict 9: The Boardgame is a Kickstarter EXCLUSIVE!\nIf this is your first time on Kickstarter - please check out our handy guide.\nThere are three phases in the game that represent the same three days in the film. There are key moments in the film which act as a timing mechanism for each phase. \nDay 1: Wikus is moving around the District evicting Prawns from their homes. When he locates and is infected by the Alien Canister the day will come to an end.\nDay 2: Wikus starts transforming into an Alien and roams the District hiding and looking for answers. Other Characters from the film appear including Christopher Johnson, the day ends when the both of them meet.\nDay 3: The Alien Dropship crashes into the District and Wikus suits up in the Mech destroying anything in his path. The day and the game will end when Players take down the Mech. \nYou need to make sure you are fully equipped before entering the District. Spend Influence to add Crew and upgrade Equipment on your Vehicle to increase your Strength and Defense stats.\nYou will need to get around the District in your search for Alien Technology. Spend an Action to move your Vehicle and Units around the District, Zone by Zone.\nTensions in the District are rising. As an action, Players may engage other Factions, Units and Prawn threats in your Zone.  There are no dice in District 9: The Boardgame, the fate of combat is resolved through the flip of a card.\nThe Evict and Claim actions allow you to pick up the Alien Technology and add them to your Vehicle. Prawn will start to emerge and may get hostile as you evict them from their homes and claim their technology. \nCheck out our Rulebook!\n5-6 Player Expansion rules\nFor more information and naming the card - see Update #13.\n\nThe scale of the pieces in the game alongside a card.

This universal resource and its collection of 70 places characters might visit in the course of their adventure went on, in fact, to become Skirmisher\u2019s most successful title and a Platinum bestseller at the popular DriveThruRPG retail site. \nWe designed City Builder as a resource that storytellers could use to create fun and believable communities, and interesting and compelling places within them, for their game settings. Altogether it contained guidelines for creating communities of all sorts and sizes and entries for dozens of different kinds of places characters might visit or spend time at, from taverns and inns to temples and guilds, organized into 10 thematic categories (i.e., Craftsman, Entertainment, Professional, Tradesman, Mercantile, Service, Scholarly, Religious, Governmental, and Underworld Places). \nAs successful as City Builder became for us, it was still one of our earlier titles and eventually did not represent what we were capable of as a company in terms of writing, editing, layout, design, art, or access to technology. Our awareness that City Builder could be even greater was, in fact, our motivation for creating what we are now calling the Platinum Edition of the book and, in doing so, taking it to the next level and turning it into a publication that is representative of where we are today. \nProof render, actual product may vary in appearance (look even better).\nWith the Platinum Edition of City Builder we have created a dramatically improved version of the original book and upgraded it in every way possible to make it more user-friendly, enjoyable to read, and visually appealing. As part of this we have: \nCompletely redesigned the book to make it full color and give it a more contemporary and accessible look; \nExpanded the book from 176 to 192 pages (which, if all Stretch Goals are unlocked, will be further expanded to approximately 222 pages); \nThoroughly revised all of the text, to include expanding and reediting it as necessary and reorganizing the contents of some of the entries or their places within the book; \nMade entries more standardized and parallel in structure; \nAdded information to entries when applicable about how they might be approached in unique ways by various fantasy races; \nAdded three completely new entries for specific places; and, \nReplaced the original disparate collection of images with a suite of more than 100 new illustrations that give the book an even nicer and more cohesive look and which have a complementary style reminiscent of Renaissance-era manuscripts like those created by Leonardo da Vinci. \nProof render, actual product may vary in appearance (look even better).\nThis new edition of our most popular title is now an even more essential asset to storytellers creating villages, towns, cities, and other sorts of communities for ancient, Medieval, Renaissance, and fantasy settings. We sincerely believe that the Platinum Edition of City Builder has a place on every game master\u2019s bookshelf and have made every effort for them to want it to be. And if we exceed our basic funding goals for this project there is even more we will do with it! \nHere is a preview of what's to come.\nBackers that pledge enough for a print copy of City Builder will receive a code for an at-cost print copy fulfilled by DriveThruRPG.com \u2014 print on demand costs of $16 have already been deducted from the cost of the reward. This will allow backers to enter their shipping details and order at their leisure, and helps us keep costs down for everyone while delivering your rewards reliably and quickly. \nPDFs will be fulfilled with a complimentary download code from DrivethruRPG.com as well.\nFollowing are a number of stretch goal rewards we will provide to backers of the Platinum Edition of City Builder if we exceed our basic funding goals for it. They include a suite of 12 full-page original images by fantasy artist Amanda Kahl and a number of new places by game developers Michael O. Varhola, Clint Staples, and William T. Thrasher in addition to the 70 that currently appear in the book. \n$4,000: 12 Additional Full-Page Illustrations. If we exceed our basic funding goals by just $1,000 we will commission 12 full-page, full-color illustrations by noted fantasy artist Amanda Kahl and use them in place of the historic fine art images that currently appear at the beginning of the Introduction and Chapters 1-11. \nSketches by Amanda Kahl of some of the images that will appear as chapter heads in the book.\n$5,000: Pilgrimage Route (new Religious Place; Michael O. Varhola). Whether located entirely within cities or stretching through the lands between them, trails connecting religious places and walked by heroes, deities, and demigods can be great venues for quests of all sorts. \n$6,000: Tournament Ground (new Entertainment Place; Clint Staples). From Medieval jousting fields to athletic facilities like Olympia, tournament grounds can be places for characters to both enjoy spectacles and test their mettle against others. \n$7,000: Observatory (new Scholarly Place; William T. Thrasher). Knowing if the stars are right for launching quests, understanding constellations, and interpreting astrological phenomena are among the things that might lead characters to visit observatories of various sorts. \n$8,000: Farm (new Tradesman Place; Michael O. Varhola). Agriculture is the basis of most civilizations and farms among their most common features and are, consequently, places characters are likely to visit in the course of their adventures. \n$9,000: Caravanserai (new Service Place; Clint Staples). From fortified rustic inns to walled campgrounds in deep deserts, secure rest areas along trade routes are often vital resources for everything from merchant caravans to adventurous characters travelling from one land to another. \n$10,000: Mortuary (new Tradesman Place; William T. Thrasher). Properly preparing the deceased for burial or whatever other way their remains will be disposed of is important in all cultures (and can be even more critical in worlds where the dead do no always remain quiet). \n$11,000: Hermitage (new Religious Place; Michael O. Varhola): From hollow trees, rough caves, and lonely ruins, to neat woodland cottages, places used to shelter and nurture a spiritual environment for religious ascetics might be either deliberately visited or stumbled upon by characters in the course of their explorations. \n$12,000: Laundry (new Service Place; Clint Staples). Characters who have to look their best and rid themselves of dust from the road or the blood of their foes might need to visit laundries (which can themselves serve as venues for interesting encounters and adventures). \n$13,000: Water Feature (new Service Place; Michael O. Varhola). From natural oasis and springs to ornate fountains erected in city squares, places where people can obtain fresh water are essential to communities of all sorts and sizes. \n$14,000: Mint (new Craftsman Place; Jim Clunie). Coinage is one of hallmarks of sophisticated mercantile societies and the places devoted to creating money are among those most closely guarded from bandits, foreign agents, and other enemies. \n$15,000: Trade Fair (new Mercantile Place; Michael O. Varhola). Seasonal fairs where merchants meet to trade goods from different lands are key to the economies of communities and the countries of which they are part, and can also have important religious and entertainment aspects. \n$16,000: Animal Trainer (new Tradesman Place; Michael O. Varhola). Whether they need to purchase wardogs and mounts or have creatures like griffons and dragons trained, characters will have to visit the facilities of animal trainers of various sorts. \n$17,000: Map Maker (new Craftsman Place; Michael O. Varhola). Characters needing to navigate their way across foreign lands or distant seas may seek information about such strange places from those skilled at creating maps of all sorts. \n$18,000: Colosseum (new Entertainment Place; Michael O. Varhola): Purpose-built amphitheaters used for everything from gladiatorial combats to mock naval battles are among the places built by affluent societies to entertain their populations. \n$19,000: Taxidermy Shop (new Craftsman Place, Michael O. Varhola). Whether they want to have monsters they have slain preserved for posterity or more effective animation, or learn about obscure creatures they expect to encounter, characters might find themselves visiting the workshops of taxidermists. \n$20,000: \u201cIn the Footsteps of Hercules\u201d Companion Book. This specific example of a Pilgrimage Route will be at least twice as long as a regular entry of this sort (e.g., 3,000-4,000 words). It will include an overview of the trail and its history, synopsis of its twelve stages and the prevailing terrain and conditions associated with them, entries for all the major communities along it, and a number of adventure hooks. It will be system-free and compatible with any traditional fantasy campaign setting. \n$21,000+: For every $1,000 from this point onward we will add one new specific place that can be found along Footsteps of Hercules pilgrimage route (e.g., a Temple devoted to Hercules, a pilgrim Hostel established in the ruins of an ancient citadel, a Shrine dedicated to the goddess Hera, the Tournament Ground established by Hercules for the Olympic Games). Each will include a detailed description, information about non-player characters associated with it, a custom map/floorplan, a custom full-color illustration, and two or three adventure hooks.

Wouldn't it be nice if they couldn't wait to play around in your world? If they were pushing you to spend more time in the land you create?\nThat's why I developed these downtime procedures over decades of play and now I can share it with you!\nWhat's in it? \nSystems that motivate players\nSimple usable procedures that work\nCreativity and inspiration for adventure\nNo longer will your players wonder what their characters should do with all their gold. It includes clear, common-sense rules for everything from starting a cult, making sacrifices to gods, to hiring mercenaries and building vehicles and castles.\nGoing to an arena fight? Take seconds to determine the purse, peruse mechanics to handle the arena crowd, pick some ideas for interesting arenas, and select an opponent like the Necrourge: a master of the dark arts of necrourgy, who raises the bodies of traitors or other criminals after they have been forced to fight in the arena and died. \nI've got a vision of usable downtime procedures that motivate players and provide inspiration to Dungeon Masters collected in a published volume. I want one for my table. But I don't have the funds to hire a cover artist. So I'm Kickstarting this to pay Skullfungus (\"I draw dungeons, their inhabitants and everything in between\") to create a beautiful cover. The book is written, layout is effectively complete, and nearly all of the interior art is finished. \nWhat's it for?\nThe downtime goals give agency to players, and let them build a dynasty. Imagine a group eager to explore your world because they have their own plans! These objective procedures give players tools that fire a desire to dive into your creative world, discover its detailed history, and make their mark on it.\nIt gives your players the tools to make their wildest ideas come to life, without breaking your campaign or your suspension of disbelief, all the while driving them to adventure in your world. On Downtime and Demesnes is filled with tools that work. Build a flying ship, enchant it; or build a wizards tower and raise fortifications in the surrounding lands. All with simple, scalable, rules. \nThis is a book used in every game you run. Your next campaign, the one after that, the one after that. . . Not one wasted word. Every page is crammed with content and creativity. No filler. Tools that let players build castles and control land, without disassociated mechanics. This is the stronghold book you've been looking for. \nCurious about the content? Check out the table of contents from the book. Want to see what's written? Back the project and read the art free PDF.\nWhat are the Details?\nThere are two versions, one for basic Dungeons & Dragons, compatible with classic games, and one for 5th edition games. I play both kinds of games, and I needed rules for this while running my megadungeon using Basic and Expert Dungeons & Dragons, as well as world-spanning campaigns using 5th edition Dungeons & Dragons. Both are A5 softcover, designed for portability and quick reference at the table. No one wants to lug around another hardcover to their local game. \nThis Kickstarter is also part of the Break Kickstarter promotion! Instead of providing stretch goals, you'll be going on a \"choose your own adventure\" by selecting different content for gaming creators to add to the book! Once the Kickstarter funds, find out the name of the first creative. At 1,500$, the backers will decide what they will add to the book, and we'll unveil the next creative on the list!\nStretch Goals\nWell that took off! \nEvery day, we are going to vote on new stretch goals. Will we unlock them all?\nWho am I?\nI'm an independent writer and artist, who's been producing gaming and gaming-related products for years. You've likely already read stuff I've written. My free book, Tricks, Traps, and Empty Room Design, has been downloaded hundreds of thousands of times; my blog Hack & Slash has been popular for years; and since I've gone full time, my high-level module Eyrie of the Dread Eye has nothing but five-star reviews.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, but the work is written, the art and layout are mostly complete, and the stretch goals are small pieces (<2000 words) of bonus content. The layout can't be 'completely complete' until the stretch goal content is in, but I've been working with Indesign for over a decade now. I have finished products like this dozens of times, and consistently receive astounding 4.5+ star ratings on my products. \n\nI have a lot of experience working with DriveThruRPG to produce printed copies. I expect all the extra content (the color art for the cover and the articles by guest writers) to be complete within 6 weeks of project completion, and checking the print proofs for sale approval to take 6 weeks. This provides an extra 8 weeks as a buffer for issues and late content. I expect digital copies to be distributed in mid-October, and print copies to be available on DriveThruRPG by the end of November. \n\nI don't suffer from depression, and I am a productive person who is online frequently. I like to work. The fact that the project is nigh complete except for the cover, all bonus content is already planned and accounted for, and the only external systemic reliance is DriveThruRPG give me a great deal of confidence I can complete this project on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Peasant", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the draft of the book, vote on stretch goals, and follow the campaign updates!\nINCLUDES:\nAccess to a copy of the art-free draft of the book\nAbility to vote on stretch goals\nFollow comments and backer updates!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2019"}], "stat": ["172 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Citizen", "descp": "This gives you access to a digital copy of the final book!

A few years ago, another company successfully launched an Evil Dead 2 board game campaign that was never fulfilled to its backers. This other company collected all of the money and delivered nothing to thousands of Evil Dead 2 fans that participated in their project. Because of this travesty, Jasco Games, in collaboration with Lynnvander Studios, the Evil Dead 2 licensing group, and our other partners have come together to bring Evil Dead 2 The Board Game back from the dead. We're calling this campaign a Heartthrob Campaign. What that means is if this campaign successfully funds, all of the backers of the previous campaign (that we had nothing to do with), will be getting a copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game for only the cost of shipping (that's right, free + shipping). \nReturning Backers\nWe cannot deliver exactly what previous backers pledged for, as that was not our project, however, we hope that you will all love this game and appreciate what we are trying to do for our beloved gaming community. Our Evil Dead 2 board game is an entirely NEW game designed by Lynnvander Studios and directed and tested heavily by Jasco Games and our play testers. If you were one of many backers of the previous campaign, refer to the section below called \u201cOriginal Backers\u201d  to find answers to some commonly asked questions and to verify that you are on our backer list to receive your copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game.\nNew Backers\nIf you are a new backer, we welcome you as well! You will not only be getting a fantastic board game for $59 (An $80 retail value game when it hits stores), that is completely designed, tested and ready to print upon funding of this campaign, you are also helping bring thousands of people a new copy of Evil Dead 2 The Board Game! They really got hurt by the other company and we, as a community, are very proud to have the opportunity to do right by those backers. \nIf you have already done the math on this, you will see that this Kickstarter campaign was designed to do a good thing. Profit is not the main purpose of the campaign, which is why we are selling the games as close to our production cost as possible while including the free game to original backers into that cost.\nSo, now that's explained, let's take a look at this beautiful board game, shall we?\nNow includes Combat Ready Ash!\n\n1. Search For Items \n2. Battle Deadites \n3. Evil Can Get In You, And Turn You BAD!!!\n4. Battle Your Former Friends \n5. Seal The Portal (Or Open It) \n6. Save The World  \nYou know how it is. You get together with your friends and decide to have a nice weekend in the woods. Maybe head up to the cabin, go for a walk in the woods. No city, no distractions, just some time with your mates and your girl. Groovy!\nAnd then some evil darkness decides to crash your party, possessing people. And before you know it, the dead start rising from the ground, looking for this magic book or perhaps just a tasty snack. The only hope to stop them is to find that book ourselves and seal the portal near the cabin. But be careful, \u2018cause the evil can get in you and turn you bad. And evil has its own plan for the portal, wanting to open it up and release Deadites on the world.\nIt\u2019s down to us to save the world.\nDetailed Model Turns (Good & Evil)\n\nHuman Ash and Deadite Ash\nHuman Linda and Deadite Linda\n\nHuman Ed and Deadite Ed\n\nHuman Annie and Deadite Annie\n\nHuman Jake and Deadite Jake\n\nHuman Bobby-Jo and Deadite Bobby-Jo\n\n Monstrous Bosses\n\nKiller Tree, Henrietta, and The Hand\nRotten Apple Head and Limbs\n\n\n                      CLICK THE IMAGE BELOW TO DOWNLOAD THE BETA RULEBOOK! \n\n Evil Dead 2 Cinestory - The Movie as A Graphic Novel! \n\nThis 332 Page hardcover book is a full color illustrated graphic novel of the entire Evil Dead 2 movie.

One integrated, innovative system - Infinite Creativity!\nAs Till, CEO of DUNGEONFOG, puts it: \n\u201cWe want to help Game Masters and storytellers to focus on their story, while they create a living, breathing, interconnected map system for their narratives.\u201d\nSince it our campaign story has become rather long and this has been requested: If you are looking for the ONE-TIME-BUY KEY check out our Platinum pledge level. More info can be found down in the Stretch-Goal section\nPROJECT DEIOS will allow for the seamless combination of battlemaps, city maps, regional maps and entire world maps. Our DEIOS suite will connect previously incompatible types of maps to offer an interconnected experience for boundless map-making. \nOnce we\u2019ve realized our vision, the \u201cDEIOS Suite\u201d will be integrated into the existing DUNGEONFOG Editor. We\u2019ll offer diverse packages for our users so that everyone will be able to choose the tools most suitable for their needs. \nCore Functionalities\nOur base funding includes all DEIOS Suite core functionalities that need to be developed from scratch. Other base functionalities, like brushes and shape tools, are already available through the DUNGEONFOG Battlemap Editor and are not listed here:\nThe Citybuilder coherently assembles sections according to archetypes - e.g. poor human district or elvish administrative quarters - and logically auto-generates housing structures, squares and parks.\nEach house is equipped with its own automatically generated map-notes, including residents per house, construction costs, etc. and will be used to create note-based outlines for your cities. As is customary for the DUNGEONFOG system, notes can always be edited and expanded.\nEvery section can be set to a specific archetype, which will affect the random asset-pool for buildings:\nWealth level: Poor, Average, Rich, etc.\nType of building: Merchants, homes, administration, etc.\nRace/Species: Dwarven, Elvish, Human etc.\nPlan Settlements With Just A Few Clicks\nYou can also place landmarks and buildings manually. Temples, markets, towers, etc. can be planted precisely where you want them to be at any time. The remaining space can then be filled with buildings based on the selected archetype of the section.\nPin locations and link them to battlemaps\nPlay directly on the maps with our Fog-of-War viewer\nEach building, square and street can be mapped out in as much detail as you desire and require, including battle and dungeon maps. Let your imagination guide you without boundaries!\nClever Coding For Boundless Creation\nVector-based drawing enables you to manipulate landmasses to an unprecedented extent: Select, move or resize landmasses without losing quality on the graphics. Add, subtract or even combine landmasses to create unique regions. \nVector-based drawing allows you to revisit and manipulate all objects\nNever before was composing original regions and landmasses easier and more intuitive. By cleverly balancing tool functionality and harmonic art composition, the DUNGEONFOG core mechanics offer the perfect fusion of practical application and elegant map design.\nBIOMES\nBiomes are quickly and easily allocated with an intuitive brush tool. This renders different forms of vegetations, geographical formations and landscapes effortlessly and stylishly.\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Grassland\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Forest\nPre-Alpha Prototype Biome - Mountain range\nWith PROJECT DEIOS, you will have access to a base setting for fantasy assets that will include more than 200 assets, for biomes like:\nBiome Samples\nSince the monthly DUNGEONFOG prop packs enjoy high popularity, we will continue to develop new textures, settings and props on a regular basis.\nPROJECT DEIOS combines all your ideas, detailed maps and concepts for continents into one giant map model. Through clever segmentation and the gradual increase of detail complexity, your world creation is a stable, coherent concept without boundaries.\nAdvanced Export Functions\nEach region can be selected, viewed and exported separately, including all contained landmarks and linked maps. The scales are automatically adjusted to fit your viewport and level of zoom.\nPolitical borders can easily be drawn - the DUNGEONFOG core functions circumvent unwanted overlaps and neatly translate all attributes to practical and editable Game Master notes.\nClimate zones, water currents and other characteristics are effortlessly added with easy-to-use brushes. Each feature stays continuously editable, allowing you to change or add whatever you want as your story progresses.\nEach landmark you place on your creation is automatically attributed its individual location. PROJECT DEIOS stores all locations, landmarks and properties in a geospatial data model. This allows your creativity to venture out endlessly, because map sizes are almost unlimited.\nBuilding an entire world from scratch might seem a bit intimidating. With the community maps feature, you can form creative alliances and collaborate on your storytelling endeavors. You can also share your worlds or use and adapt maps from fellow Game Masters or authors. There is no need to hide your creativity away - be proud and enrich multiple adventures with your ideas!\nJoin A Community Full Of Stories And Creation\nThe three pillars of DUNGEONFOG have always been \u201cPlan - Create - SHARE\u201d. We will stay true to our core functionalities, even while expanding our scope to make effortless world creation a reality.\nA great advantage of the innovative DUNGEONFOG map-making toolset is the simple but crucial feature that every object, entity and map stays perpetually editable and can be reused and even shared. This enables Game Masters, Authors, Storytellers and RPG enthusiasts to collaborate, exchange feedback and help improve each others\u2019 worlds. \nYou can draw from the users' collective creativity by using community maps, adapt them to your story\u2019s needs and make your own original ideas accessible to others.\nCollaboration Opportunities\nWe\u2019ll even go a step further, and explore how we can make collaboration between multiple authors on shared maps a possibility. Collaboration is not just working together on one map - but also using other users\u2019 maps to add to your own stories. Discovering a beautiful world map will spark new ideas and with PROJECT DEIOS, you\u2019ll have the platform to add your own creative stories to existing maps and let marvellous adventures unfold.\nWe think that everybody should be able to create maps with the new DEIOS Suite! After launch, we\u2019ll offer Free Access with limited features to everyone.\nIf you'd like to have access to all of our features, consider backing us at the Bronze level or higher for access to the full DEIOS Suite. \nKickstarter only\n\n\nYou and your support through Kickstarter will bring the DEIOS Suite to life. So we\u2019re offering you special bargains as a thank you, which are only available exclusively during this Kickstarter campaign:\nKickstarter-Exclusive Art Packs\nWhen supporting our campaign at Silver (pick one), Gold (pick two) or Platinum (all) level, you will receive our additional, Kickstarter-exclusive art packs, each containing 25 assets for cities, regions and world maps.\nKickstarter-Exclusive Video Series By The GreatGM\nCreating entire worlds with manifold distinct areas and settlements offers possibilities for near endless adventures. It might be easy to get lost in boundless creativity and to lose sight of one's goals, were it not for the guidance of wise masters and the help of fellow adventurers. \nIn his exclusive 6-part video series, The GreatGM lends Kickstarter supporters (Gold level and above) a helping hand and shares his vast knowledge of worldbuilding and storytelling. Since his new series is exclusively tailored to the DUNGEONFOG system and the  DEIOS suite, all viewers can expect valuable hands-on tips and masterful tricks from The GreatGM himself.\nDUNGEONFOG, World Anvil, GreatGM and Caeora Have Teamed Up For This Project\nAt its core, DUNGEONFOG was founded to support Game Masters and storytellers on their creative journey, and to make map-making easy, intuitive and practically useful. But we\u2019ve realized that we\u2019re not alone on this quest. World Anvil, The GreatGM and Caeora also aim to transform map-making, storytelling and worldbuilding into an extraordinary experience for you. So we\u2019ve teamed up!\nPROJECT DEIOS is our shared vision - ONE system that can support ALL your map-making and storytelling needs. DUNGEONFOG was a massive Kickstarter success back in 2017, and our toolset makes the mapping process effortless, quick and perpetually interconnected. With these incredible partners, we\u2019ve formed a team of experts in the world of storytelling, worldbuilding and map-making to make PROJECT DEIOS a reality.\n www.dungeonfog.com \n www.worldanvil.com \nwww.greatgamemaster.com\nwww.caeora.com \nWorld Anvil Integration\nOur partner World Anvil brings a lot of experience with collaboration features to the table. Drawing on their expertise, we will develop a permission-based co-authoring, commenting and sharing system. Simultaneously, we have a keen eye on the smooth technical connection between DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil. \nWe\u2019ll start with basic integration features, like accessibility of DUNGEONFOG maps while editing a world in World Anvil, or accessing your written world descriptions as a resource while creating maps in the DUNGEONFOG editor. \nWe\u2019ll also pay attention to the functionality of pins: Creating locations will auto-generate pins, and therefore, redundant manual pinning will not be necessary. In addition, we\u2019re exploring many ways to integrate World Anvil\u2019s extensive Campaign Manager and their character manager, Heroes, with PROJECT DEIOS. For example, our player viewer could be integrated with Heroes, so that all party members know their location at all times, or the location of the main villain.\nEasy Collaboration\nThe joint communities from DUNGEONFOG, World Anvil and The GreatGM is a thriving community of map makers, storytellers, writers and Game Masters at your disposal. This makes sharing resources easy as never before. A thriving community also enables you to cheer for great maps by others and draw motivation from users that used your work.\nArtwork and Assets Will Be Created By Caeora \nThe assets will not only be created in his beautiful unique style, but will also pay attention to scaling & line art so that every map you create will always look stunning - whether you play digitally or export them in high resolution.\nOur dream is to help Game Masters, Authors and storytellers create entire worlds in all their detailed glory. Creating something this boundless is a huge endeavour! \nOur primary goal is to get enough funding to cover an additional developer and have enough funds to pay our partners for their work.  \nTo cover all core functionalities, we estimate the costs to be around 100,000 EUR (about $112,140). Since we launched DUNGENFOG, we managed to build up some resources that cover about 40% of the estimated development costs. Our partners agreed to help us with an additional 10%, which means we can already cover 50% of the development costs of our DEIOS Suite.\nSo we don\u2019t ask you to fully finance our dreams - rather, your support could pick us up halfway and carry us to the finish line. Therefore, we set the funding goal to 50,000 EUR (about $56,070). With additional  resources, we can hire additional developers and speed up the development process immensely, getting DEIOS into your hands sooner!\nProject DEIOS Pricing After Launch\nWe want to make sure that prices are compatible with using the DUNGEONFOG system as a hobby. At this point, we estimate the full package (meaning the \u201cDEIOS suite\u201d including the DUNGEONFOG Battlemap Editor) to cost around \u20ac 7.90 (about $8.80) per month. \nBattlemaps are included in DEIOS - so you only need the DEIOS subscription\nOur DUNGEONFOG battlemap subscription will remain untouched and will be available as a separate subscription as well.\nWe will offer monthly, quarterly, half-yearly and yearly subscription models with respective discounts. As is usual for DUNGEONFOG, you\u2019ll always be able to pause your subscription without losing your creative work. \nWhile planning this project, it was highly important to us that we grant our supporters early access to the DEIOS Suite development stages. Therefore, our timeline includes several stages of development releases to keep waiting time short, while at the same time enabling room for early feedback and improvement. \nNow that we have reached our funding goal - let's talk about stretch goals! \nAs enthusiastic map makers and RPG adventurers, we have a full array of additional ideas we thrive to implement - so here they are:\nPortals and Planes - FUNDED!\nPROJECT DEIOS is conceptualized to evolve and grow infinitely. Our first stretch goal includes the possibility to not only build an entire world, but to conceptualize multiple planes of existence. To support even the most fantastic ideas, we will offer biomes and props to create adventures taking place in five additional settings - and it is up to you to decide which ones will be included in the DEIOS Suite. \nWhen we reached this stretch goal after the end of the PROJECT DEIOS Kickstarter, we will give backers the opportunity to vote for their 5 favorite settings, which could include:\nWe will notify all eligible (silver+) backers after the campaign where to place your vote\nOnce the stretch goal is reached and the funding is over, we will contact all eligible (Silver+) backers and ask you to help us decide on the new settings.\nIf you would like to add to that list, join us on Discord or post here in our campaign comments with the addition: \u201cSETTING -\u201d  (Example: \u201cSETTING - Candyland\u201d).\nOnce the campaign is over, we will send you a link to our voting tool and you can help us to determine what of those 5 settings will be created first.\nEach setting will include artwork for biomes, city buildings and landmarks and will contain more than 100 different assets for your worlds.\nThe setting will then be available with ALPHA 2 so you can test and review it as soon as possible.\n SOLAR SYSTEMS, STARMAPS and 3D World Mapping - FUNDED!\nEven multiple planes of existence are not enough for you? \nWhen we reach this stretch goal, you don\u2019t need to feel tied to one world alone - let your imagination venture out into unexplored galaxies and the unlimited possibilities of space. \n When reaching this stretch goal, we will add tools to create \nGalaxies\nSolar Systems\nand mapping tools to create a 3D mapping of your world as globe, disc, cylinder or dyson spheres.\nAll maps will remain linkable and you will be able to expand your creation into whole universes.\n RANDOM LANDMASS SEEDING AND CITY GENERATOR - FUNDED!\nWhile creating entire worlds and galaxies, not every village, town or region has to be created individually. Sometimes, a specific vision of a city demands special attention to detail only in certain places, while other districts could be more generally conceptualized. \nOr a story calls for a highly characteristic and specific shoreline, while the vast central plains don\u2019t need to contain that much detail. \nFear not, we have you covered: When we reach this stretch goal, we will develop a tool set to generate entire cities and landmasses randomly. All you have to do is adjust the parameters to you needs and create a randomly generated map.\n Random city generator: Adjust size, demographics and layout (medieval , western, etc.) and we will randomly populate your city map with districts and buildings.\n Random landmasses: Adjust landmass-types amount of water on you map, sizes,  island scatter and more to randomly generate world maps.\n Save the seed for your randomization and share it with your friends\nTo celebrate this unlocked stretch goal, we have added an additional +25 Asset Pack to the pool!\n\u20ac 175.000 - New Setting - FUNDED\nWith 175k funded, Caeora will now add another new setting that you can vote on at the end of the campaign.\n\u20ac 250.000 DESKTOP APPLICATION - FUNDED\nWe can now hire an additional application developer full time and finish the desktop application together with the launch of DEIOS.\nOne-Time-Buy License Keys\nAll Platinum backers (and beyond) will receive in addition to all the other rewards 1 license-key to the standalone desktop application, which will run without subscription.\nThis means, that during our extended development time and beyond you will have:\nAccess to our ALPHA and BETA (online), \nAll Kickstarter settings and artpacks (also as part of your standalone license).\nPremium Access to Online DEIOS Suite until Desktop App has been released.\n1 License Key to standalone desktop application, that you can either use to activate your standalone desktop application, or gift a friend.\nAbout the Desktop Application\nOnce released, the software will available for download to any premium user at no additional cost.\nIn addition, we will offer a standalone license, that comes without subscription.\n+\u20ac 25.000 - The Indefinite Stretch Goal x6\n\n For every additional \u20ac 25.000 beyond our 250k stretch goal (275k, 300k, etc.) we'll increase the assets for all 7 settings by: \n + 50 battlemap assets  \n  + 15 additional landmarks  \n  + 15 additional special buildings for cities\nAnd + 50 new assets for solar systems & galaxies\n(in total 600+ assets)\n\n\nStep 1 - UNLOCKED: Digital badges for DUNGEONFOG and WORLDANVIL | +1 asset\nSuccess! All backers will be able to claim these exclusive badges for their DUNGEONFOG and World Anvil profiles. And every backer will receive one additional exclusive LANDMARK ASSET added to his DUNGEONFOG account (You will be able to vote on the assets in our Kickstarter survey). \nStep 2 - UNLOCKED:  +3 month | + 3 asset\nSuccess! With all three Social Stretch Goals unlocked, we are now adding + 3 MONTH run-time to all PROJECT DEIOS subscriptions and every backer will receive three additional exclusive LANDMARK ASSET added to his DUNGEONFOG account (You will be able to vote on the assets in our Kickstarter survey). \nStep 3 - UNLOCKED: 3x +25 Asset Packs\n Wow - You have unlocked ALL our social Stretch goals!

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project has the potential to completely change the lives of all of us here at the studio, so we're putting our all into it.\n\nWe've been very open with the development of DUNGEONFOG so far and we take comments and concerns from our community very seriously. In fact, a lot of the changes in the editor came from community suggestions. We will continue to take and implement suggestions for Project DEIOSlong after this Kickstarter campaign ends.\n\nWe\u2019re trying to make everything compatible with as many operating systems & browsers as possible. Due to the use of newer tech, some older computers and browsers will not be able to support all features. Please try the free version of DUNGEONFOG to see if your computer has problems running the current battlemap editor.\n\nWe\u2019re aiming for fairly regular build updates with monthly intervals, and the progress can be seen by all. When we say we will try to include something, we really will find a way to try it. We will try our hardest to make DEIOS a tool everyone will enjoy and will remember.\n\nWeb development isn't always smooth sailing and there are a lot of uncertainties (especially the programming part), so that's why we\u2019ve added a bit of a cushion to our timeline and chose Spring 2020 for the release date. This will give us a bit of breathing room so that we can get it to you on schedule... or maybe even earlier!\n\nIf it comes out early, it'll be a pleasant surprise.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*** For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Set in the heart of the Palace of Mists, the legendary comic book hero Okko and his traveling companions must hunt down powerful Oni (demons) and thwart their dark conspiracies.  \n\nBeyond the Gates of Jigoku  \nThis new expansion compels Okko and his band of intrepid demon hunters to pass through the hellish Gates of Jigoku to fight its demonic denizens in their own realm. But beware, for in the dark and desolate domain of the oni, their corruption is much more powerful than anything your adventurers have experienced in the world of the living!   \nOni Hunters \nThis expansion gives you the opportunity to play new scenarios or replay your favorite scenarios, without the need for an Oni Player by introducing both cooperative and solitaire modes to your Okko Chronicles games. Now the game is playable for 1 to 5 players ! \nMiniatures Storage Box\nA box to store all the miniatures from Okko Chronicles.   \n\n\n\nThis expansion includes several new tiles representing the hellish environments of Jigoku. \nNot bound by the physical laws of the mortal world, this nightmarish realm seems to conform only to its own twisted and devious logic.   \nAs a result, the Jogoku tiles can rotate, flip or even be replaced entirely during the course of a game, making adventures in the ever-changing kingdom of the oni an extremely disconcerting prospect...   \nThe following symbols are used on these new tiles to tell you how they are revolved: \n At the beginning of the game, each Hero takes a card to track their current level of corruption and its effects as they explore the lands of Jigoku. \nThe longer a hero remains in these accursed lands, the more likely they will be to fall under the influence of its evil influences.   \n  Fortunately, some of their equipment may mitigate the harmful effects of Jigoku\u2019s rampant corruption. \n\nOverview of the Cooperative / Solo system:    \nThis expansion allows everyone to play the Okko Chronicles scenarios as Heroes, without the need for one of them to take on the role of the Oni and its agents.\nOverview of the Cooperative / Solo system:    \nAt the end of each Strategy phase, players draw the top  card from the Adventure deck:\nThis card indicates how to place or move the Corruption tokens on the board, what Enhancements the Oni\u2019s Mortal Thralls or Supernatural Creatures will gain and any effects that will need to be resolved until the end of the round.     \nDuring the Activation phase, after a Hero has finished their Activation, the players draw a Reaction card. This card indicates which of the Oni\u2019s agents are activated and what actions they will perform.  \n\nNo SG included\nAs the various Stretch Goals are unlocked, they will be added to the Beyond the Gates of Jigoku and Oni Hunters expansion boxes.   \n\n\nOkko is a comic book that chronicles the adventures of a ronin and his companions as they hunt demons and other evil creatures across the continent of the Pajan.\n  The saga is divided into 5 cycles, each inspired by a critical element that sets the tone of the adventure\u2019s narrative: The Cycle of Water, The Cycle of Earth, The Cycle of Air, The Cycle of Fire and The Cycle of Emptiness. \nHUB, the author of the Okko saga, has created many new illustrations and unique characters that will accompany Okko and his companions in their latest adventure. \nOkko Chronicles miniatures are on average 35mm in height. This scale is based on the height to the eyes of an adult human character.\n  Some miniatures will be much larger, while others will have smaller proportions, depending on the characters they represent.\n  For us, the quality of the miniatures is a priority and you can expect a level of detail equivalent to those shown here. \nIf you wish to order more than one copy of the game, it is possible to add as many Ronin (\u20ac80), Hunter (\u20ac45) or Master Hunter (\u20ac125) pledges as you want. Shipping costs will be reduced for each additional copy added!\n  And of course, each pledge is accompanied by all unlocked Stretch Goals!\n\n\nAll costs shown are in Euro (\u20ac) and are based on the exchange rate posted at the launch of this campaign (approx. \u20ac1 = $1.13).\n  Any pledges that are confirmed after the close of the 'pledge manager' will be dispatched at a later date from our European distribution hub, which may significantly increase the estimated shipping costs above. \nThe RED JOKER is an established board game publishing company whose CEO, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Condette, has been working in the games industry for nearly 20 years.

Since then, Aslak \u2013 Eye of the World was released by Delcourt in 2011. Written by HUB and Fred Weytens, drawn by Emmanuel Michalak and colored by S\u00e9bastien Lamirand, it tells the story of a Viking\u2019s quest for new stories. \nStephane Camosseto, Valentin Zak and Patrick Masson are 3 french freelance sculptors working in the miniature and collectible statues industry.\n  They have been working in this industry for 7 years for many different games and collectibles company, like CoolMiniOrNot, Guillotine Games, Demented Games, Studio McVey, Luftkrieg 1919, etc.\n  They have created Kazama Studio in order to gather their skills and be able to propose companies high end miniatures and bigger projects.\n  It was a pleasure working on this Okko\u2019s chronicles project with the awesome concepts from Hub. \nBorn in 1974, Arnaud Boudoiron has worked in a variety of sectors: press, publishing, advertising, comics and sculpture. He began a career as a sculptor for Rackham at the end of the 1990s. He is a talented artist and a gaming fanatic.\n  After working for several years in the comic book industry, he took advantage of the increasing interest in board games including miniatures to finally find his primary passion: sculpture. Arnaud has worked on games such as Zombicide, Black Plague, Conan, The Godfather, Mythic Battles, Rising Sun and Batman: Gotham City Chronicles. \nA passionate board gamer, Nicolas spends most of his free time immersed in their worlds. When he is not busy inventing new role-playing settings, he polishes the rules of his own system, modifying or honing the game mechanics of the games or preparing prototypes (though his wife would prefer him to be doing the dishes).   \nNicolas likes big games, whether they contain small wooden cubes or miniatures, provided that the theme is strong and is conveyed well through its mechanics.     \nA fan of Hub's work on Okko, and with dungeons crawlers some of his favorite games, Nicolas could not refuse a trip into the Pajan Empire with Okko and his friends. The RED JOKER is pleased to introduce his Solo and Cooperative game modes for Okko Chronicles! \nHaving graduated in sociology and Internet & multimedia engineering, specializing in transmedia, Andoniya joined The RED JOKER earlier in 2017 as its Community Manager.\n  A gamer in her free time, Andoniya particularly likes Vampire The Masquerade. She also loves games that tell real stories and allow her to play characters of her choice. A little geeky, she loves Goldorack (Grandizer), Pokemon and the X-Men. Her favorite heroine is none other than Wonder Woman. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our sixth crowdfunding campaign and we have already successfully delivered the following campaigns, The Valley of the Kings, Fortresses & Clans, Guardians\u2019 Chronicles: The Clash of Heroes and the first printing of Okko Chronicles. Meanwhile, our most recent campaign, Highway to Hell, is currently in production.\n\nIn regard to these two new expansions to the Okko Chronicles line; many of their core components have been finalized before the launch of this Kickstarter campaign, and many of the add=ons and Stretch Goals are already well into their pre-production. As a result, these should be ready to go to print before the end of this campaign.\n\nTHERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A ZERO RISK PROJECT OR CAMPAIGN. \nWhile this is not our first game like this, there will always be unforeseen developments in manufacturing and logistics that are beyond our control, as we have learned to our peril in the past. That being said, barring a catastrophic meteor impact, a zombie apocalypse or other forms of armageddon (holy or otherwise), we are pretty sure that, thanks to our previous experience, the game is well prepared and that we have chosen our partners wisely (manufacturers, printers, freight forwarders, distributors, etc.).\n\nRefund Policy\nAll pledges can be refunded up to 60 days before they leave the manufacturer, without question.

You have already taken us past all the stretch goals.\nThank you! \nAll of these stretch goals are things we would love to put into TaleSpire one day, but take significant resources. If we get funded to these levels we can make them a priority and get them to you sooner.\nPlease note that the US dollar estimates were made at the time we set up the Kickstarter and may differ from current values. However the amount in Norwegian Kroner (nok) is exact.\nHero Crafting System (~$175k USD / 1,486,647nok) \nAn entire system for building your own minis within TaleSpire. No 3D modeling experience required!\nCustomizable Rule System (~$225k USD / 1,911,404nok)\nWe will add a customizable engine which will arm players and GMs alike with all the information they need during play. It will place the knowledge at your fingertips without forcing your hand or taking control away from the GM.\nCyberpunk Themed Assets (~$275k USD / 2,336,160nok)\nAnd they did not weep, for there were so many worlds to conquer!\nThis stretch goal funds the slew of packs that will form the foundation of a cyberpunk world within TaleSpire.\nOh and for extra fun, here is a mini trailer for the cyberpunk assets!\nTaleSpire is a beautiful way to play pen and paper RPGs online. It's a place where you and your friends build and tell stories together.\nWe are marrying the beauty and physicality you find in miniatures with the expanse of digital worlds. Our aim is to get rid of everything that gets between you and your stories. And all of this whilst letting people be together regardless of where they are in the world.\nTaleSpire is not tied to a specific game or ruleset; if it's role-playing on a square grid we have your back.\nWe have already built the alpha and have been running it with the community for 6 months. Thanks to their support and feedback we know what still needs building, and what needs polishing. The community has really shown us how far they want us to take this.\nYour support will get us to Early Access. There is a solid 8 months of fulltime work to do and this Kickstarter will make that happen.\nFrom there we will take our solid base and expand it even further, once again grounding our moves in the needs of the Early Access community in the same way we have been with our Alpha community (HUGE LOVE TO THE TALESPIRE DISCORD GANG, YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE :D).\nMost importantly we believe that, for this game to be made without compromise, it needs to be independent of publishers. We have looked around and whilst this idea seems to be obvious and has clearly been discussed for decades it has never been made in quite this way. We feel that is almost certainly due to how risky it would be to do it 'right'.\nDespite bringing a pile of experience to the table, we are still a new company and we knew it wasn't right for us to ask for your money until we knew exactly what this needed to be, and could prove we could do it.\nWe have a working alpha, active userbase, over 20 updates shipped and we publish multiple developer logs per week. Even before the alpha we were experimenting with a pile of different prototypes so we are confident with what we need to achieve.\nIn short we have been doing this for some time now and we know we can keep it up.\nThe primary goal of the Kickstarter is to fund TaleSpire's development for 8 months. This includes full time wages for the core developers, server costs, creative tools and legal services required to bring this game to Early Access.\nThe timeline is aggressive. 6 months to the Beta and then 2 months to polish for Early Access.\nWe will start the timer from the end of the Kickstarter campaign. As the two full-time developers live in Norway we will have to comply with laws regarding the mandated amounts of leave companies must provide, so that will be factored into the delivery dates.\nThe goal is that the Beta will ship in February and the Early Access in April.\nEarly Access will fund and guide the next stage of TaleSpire's life. We will keep talking to you about how you play and where the game needs to expand to serve your stories.\nWith the start of the Early Access we will also begin releasing asset packs at fixed, regular intervals and ALL of those will be free. Post-Early Access the packs are how we plan to fund our future.\nIf we are so blessed as to reach the stretch goals, we will begin developing them once we reach Early Access.\n\nTaleSpire has a lot within its walls; let's go on a stroll through the main features.\nBuilding and play are one\nTaleSpire is a place where building and play happen throughout the whole play session. Want to destroy a wall to reveal a secret passage? Do it! Want to rain down piles of gold from the heavens? Sure! At any moment the GM (or GMs) can jump into building mode and change anything without interrupting anything else.\nYou will be able to build anything from tiny one shots to sprawling campaigns. Each board can be up to 30km across and 10km tall. We will be looking to make them even bigger post-Early Access.\nA campaign can have as many boards as you can build, and you can copy entire boards \u2014 which makes it easy to create alternate versions in various states of disarray if that is what your story calls for.\nBuild together\nBuilding doesn't have to be a solo activity. Grant other people GM rights to your campaign and build your world together.\n\nGorgeous sculpted scenery and miniatures\nTaleSpire gives you assets that look so good you'll want to claw them out of your monitor. \nRoll Call! Click for higher res version\n\nControl the atmosphere\nA necromancer is performing a poignant resurrection that deserves something special! With a click you can dim the lights, bring in the music and captivate your players. \nAs the GM you can store lighting, weather and music into 'environment pillars'. These let you swiftly change the mood of a moment.\nRain, snow, night and day are coming and you can wield them.  \nCustomizable dice with HEFT\nIn game dice that not only look great but feel great to roll. \n\n\nFrom play testing we found out players would do it so much that we needed a way for the GM to grab control at important moments in the story. Speaking of which\u2026 \n\n Cinematic Mode\nA foolish dwarf steps on a pressure plate \u2014 suddenly the camera snaps across the room and a necromancer strides into view.\nAs the GM you are armed with Cinematic Mode. Set up camera angles and take direct control of what every player is seeing. In that moment they cannot move their pieces and you are free to narrate the perils they have stumbled into.\nSetting up shots\n\nTools! Rulers, indicators, compass, etc\nPoint to point distance? Diagonal movement? Area of effect? No need to estimate when you can use our built in tools to tell you exactly what's what.\nGMs can do this privately or share it with the group so all are in on the plot. \nAn example size indicator used when placing tiles\n\nGM Requests\nCertain player actions request approval from the GM. This means events can\u2019t be unveiled accidentally before they make sense in the story. \nTurn based mode\nChoose the line-up, orchestrate the rounds! Keeping track is easy when you can switch to turn based mode at any time. When in this mode only the player whose turn it is can command their creatures. \nPLAY\n\n\nName and tint your creatures before bringing them into the game\nNo need to wait until reaching the board to set up your hero. Before jumping in, prep as many creatures as you like and assign them their campaigns. \n\nChanging your mini's base\nVariety == spicy life. \nWe know it's a subtle thing but dang it some days maybe your base should match your armor. \n\nFog of war\nThis powerful system keeps the path ahead obscured in a shroud until it is time to reveal it. \nPLAY\n\nNote: This video shows one of our fog of war prototypes. We are introducing a visual representation for the fog in the Early Access.\n\nScaling creatures\nNeed a bigger troll? Shrunk by a spell? The scale feature is at hand to help you. \nEmotes & spells\nSometimes waggling a piece just doesn\u2019t cut it: pick from a selection of actions and unleash sounds, animations & visual effects to really let that fireball spell send its message. \nFilter your session history\nDid Jeff move 10 feet or 15? Settle it with the session history!\nUse filters to see only what is relevant in the moment. \nGrant access with the smack of a button\nInvite codes let you easily grant people access to your campaign and are copied straight to the clipboard to they are ready to be thrown into your chat client of choice. \nShare slabs of tiles effortlessly\nSharing a slab is trivial in TaleSpire. Copied tiles are immediately available to paste as text outside of TaleSpire making it trivial to share useful chunks. Naturally this works in reverse, copy the text and paste in TaleSpire to summon the slab to your hand. \nMusic and sound effects\nTaleSpire will come loaded with mountains of sound effects, ambience, and a full soundtrack. From dripping caves to rowdy taverns, we have you covered.\nHere is an early sample from the soundtrack:\nModding! Add your own tiles, minis and more\nThe mods are fun and numerous: take this!\nTaleWeaver is the tool we use to bring content into the game. Import your models and apply the magic that lets them work in TaleSpire. \nWith the Early Access we will also ship the base of the scripting layer. To begin with, this will be focused on controlling tiles and props, but the system is going to grow in a big way as we continue to expand the game.\nYou and your players will be able to get mods from our official site (not yet live), but also from collections created and maintained by other modders. This means the power stays with the community.\nBookmarks\nBookmark Panel Prototype\nA light to guide you when all other minds go blank\n...by which we mean, save any point of the board as a bookmark and jump there with a click of the mouse\nFoam scenery blocks\nPlacing tiny tiles to build a hill is tedious; use the foam blocks to lay out large tracts of land.\nTunnel through them to make a perfect lairs for creatures favoring the dark.\nPowerful prop system\nYou can scatter not just tiles but props across the land. Props can be attached to tiles in myriad ways, and they respond sensibly when a player pushes into them. Make your rich settings without worrying about any details blocking play.\nAsset & feature suggestion sites\nWe will have official places to submit ideas for assets and features. These will be used to help guide the future of the game. We also promise not to destroy the focus by trying to include everything.\nGM Overlay: Notes, Hidden tokens/chests containing stuff useful for running a campaign\nKeep track without being swamped. As a GM you have an overlay mode where you can leave yourself notes. Place tiles, minis and prepare scenarios, all out of sight of the players.\nAnd plenty more!\n\u266b The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began \u266b\nCheck out our roadmap to see a high level overview of our plans.\n\n\n\n Concept Art\nThe following is the concept sketches for the Kickstarter Exclusive Minis and an in-game first pass at the dice.\nSee these updates for more info:\nDice: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bouncyrock/talespire/posts/2587520 \nMinis:  https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/bouncyrock/talespire/posts/2586452 ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe big one is of course time-frame. We have done a lot of experimentation to know what we need but it remains a lot of work in a fairly short period of time. We will need to leave polish and feel of some systems to late in the cycle. We can't reduce the amount of work to do so instead we will simply be as open as we can as to how things are progressing so that nothing comes as a surprise.\n\nThe other is subtler. Making things simple is complicated. There are many 'obvious' ways to do things which make for a worse or inconsistent experience. We need to keep focused and stay true to the *feel* that we are going for even if that means not supporting every imaginable feature, and especially if they seem trivial.

We started designing and printing our own tabletop battle mats 4 years ago and since then we have developed an award winning range of Wargaming/RPG battle mats and accessories in a range of materials.\nWe published our first Battle Map Book in April 2018, and have since published additional fantasy and science fiction volumes. After this we will be designing two modern day, post apocalyptic and cyberpunk themed encounter map books, and we have two additional fantasy volumes ready to release towards the end of the year.\nThis is our 5th Kickstarter for a gaming accessory and our second focused on Battle Mat Books.\nOur Collaborators \nJames Gray, (aka quigonjim), is an illustrator and artist who will be producing the cover art for each of the Dungeon books. Former clients and books include the anthologies Zombies, Robots and Westerns for Accent UK Comics, the Kickstarter backed Amnesia Agents with Jason Cobley and the upcoming Brawler anthology, card art for Oligarchy from Entropic Games and poster and T-Shirt designs for the band Dead Man's Whiskey. He also has a substantial back catalogue of Superbike and MotoGP artworks.   \nJohn (JC) is co-authoring the adventure module along with Matt.\nAnd finally thanks to the Brighton Dice Saloon, our FLGS,  for hosting our video & photo shoot. You can find out more about them here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have identified the following risks, and I outline here how we are managing them:\n\n- Getting the price right\nIt sounds basic but when costing a project there are a lot of things to remember, and they all add to the cost! We have used our experience from 4 successful Kickstarters and having our range in retail & distribution to price our books. We are able to offer our backers a good deal for coming on board early, however we have ensured all the hidden costs, as well as the basics like printing and transport, are covered in our price.\n\n- Delay\nThe first delay risk is what we term \u201cmission slip\u201d! I.e. that the project expands into new areas which add time to deliver. We have a very clear vision of the product we want to deliver, and again we can call on our experience to ensure we deliver it in a timely manner! For example the designs, while they will evolve based on feedback and new designs hopefully added, are very much underway and a long way down the road already.\n\n- Product quality\nThe main risks for producing a book to replace & improve on a standard RPG battle mat is that you end up with a product which has all the disadvantages of both. To avoid this we believe the book must lay flat and must line up next to another book to allow the adventure to flow. We have been designing and producing Battle Map Books since 2018, and we have the experience of our existing, award winning range to testify we know how to make a good battle mat book! Light and portable as well as flat, easy to use (lays flat when opened, just open & roll!) you can back with confidence that we produce the highest quality products.\n\n- Print quality\nBy using our existing printers we know exactly what we are getting, and we can produce any of our existing library as an example of the high quality of their work. We know what is required of our designs in order to produce a work of art, and our printers can deliver it with us \ud83d\ude0a\n\n- Fulfilment issues\nShipping thousands of products worldwide can be a daunting prospect, and it is the area which can easily grind a project to a halt. We will be using a fulfilment expert \u2013 GamesQuest \u2013 who are best placed to ship our products in a timely manner. They are experts in their field and able to offer fast effective service so your books will be with you as planned! This also covers risks from Brexit as GamesQuest have contingency plans in place.\n\n- We don\u2019t fund\nThis is the worst case scenario. That we don\u2019t attract enough funding to move forwards. In order to attract backers we will promote this kickstarter heavily prior to launch and throughout its live run. We have a (rather modest) advertising budget for social media and we will be calling on our network of media contacts and online influencers to help us spread the word. We have also added a number of social media goals all aimed at getting word out there far and wide. We prefer to spread the word through the RPG community as opposed to online advertising as it allows us to keep our costs reasonable and deliver more product for the money. This is the approach which has seen us successfully fund 4 previous Kickstarters.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "The Digital Dungeon", "descp": "Receive the dungeon in digital format to print at home or use online.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital dungeon - All designs from the books in digital format\nAll Unlocked Digital Stretch Goals\nD&D5e Adventure module set in The Dungeon (PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}], "stat": ["477 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a325 or more", "title": "The Dungeon", "descp": "Get one copy of The Dungeon at \u00a35 less than retail price.\nThe Dungeon is Two Modular 12\"x12\"Books presented as a set.\n*Shipping charged at the one set rate for your location listed on campaign page in shipping section of Kickstarter after campaign ends for any physical goods.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries (we can\u2019t predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). For backers in China, please read THIS UPDATE.\nOCEANIA: $20-$45 to Australia. $40 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries. \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n \u2022 $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. \nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available at conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included.

If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required). If you open your game and see that something is missing or broken, our customer service team will work hard to get you replacement parts and make things right. Simply contact them at https://support.cmon.com/hc/en-us.\nNote: Warranty does not cover accidental damage, theft, loss, or any other event that is not a manufacturing defect.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Blood Moon Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nBloodborne: The Board Game\nExclusive Kirkhammer Hunter\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["10,376 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Blood Moon Early Bird Pledge", "descp": "INCLUDES:\nBloodborne: The Board Game\nExclusive Kirkhammer Hunter\nAll applicable Stretch Goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "11,919 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "FAQ and Updated Rulebook", "update_content": "Welcome to the Dream, Hunters...\n\nNow that the game is released and we've gathered feedback from the community, we have assembled two core assets for you:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #118", "update_userinfo": "Update #118: You've Done Well.

Final rules are currently in progress.\nStill confused about what to pledge? CLICK HERE! \nCost:  While we would love to offer free shipping, there really is no such thing. Shipping is really expensive and we have tried to come up with pricing that accurately reflects our cost to get the game into your hands without creating a logistical nightmare on our side. There's a lot of plastic miniatures and awesome game to pack up here, and that doesn't make it any cheaper. Your shipping will be added in the pledge manager.  We expect that we'll have to come out of pocket a bit based on what we are charging and we are ok with that.    \nTracking: We will also be using non-trackable shipments in some cases in order to save on cost as tracking can add 30-50% or more in some cases. So please understand if we do not have tracking with your package we did so knowingly. Rest assured, that we will get you your game and any risk associated with a package not being trackable is on us.  \nDelivery time: While we would love to get everyone their games at the same time, it is just not possible. With so many different pledge levels and add ons, making sure the right pieces go in the right boxes takes time. There is a high likelihood that some areas of the world will get their games before others. Our commitment is to get the games ready and printed as fast as possible. Most of the work for Tsukuyumi is already done, with some small tweaks and new content to be added. Of course you can\u2019t forget about all those minis either! They are going through their final stages of revisions as you read this, and then its time to print!  At the factory we will break out the shipments to each fulfillment company with instructions to them that they should begin shipping as soon as possible upon receipt. In addition, because we have complete control over the U.S. shipments, you will not be able to order and receive the game on Amazon (or from any other US retailer) before our backers have it.  \nWhat does \"Exclusive\" mean? You've probably noticed we do not say Kickstarter Exclusive but rather show a logo with our image (or another company image) and the word exclusive.  What this means is that these items will never be available in retail and only through us or the company depicted on the logo.  However, while they may be available from us in the future, they will most certainly not be given away for free.  In most cases, the cost of putting together the same package you might back in our campaign is 50% or higher afterward.\nOther: Lastly, we will be using fulfillment companies in different parts of the world and while we have done our best to ensure we pick good ones, ultimately, once the games get into their warehouses there is little control we have at that point. We have always done our best to bend over backwards for our customers and if for some reason there are any issues with damages, missing components or missing shipments we will make it right. It just might require some patience.  \nWhy back this campaign? While we have had great success with other games like Deception: Murder in Hong Kong and Champions of Midgard, we are still a relatively small company and we just do not have the funds needed to fund every project we do without some help. Your pledge gets you all the exclusive unlocked content which will not be available in retail... only through us.  Plus, if you live in the U.S the game will be in your hands before someone can get it from an online retailer.  Lastly, we expect the standard retail version of the game to be $99 MSRP, which won't get any of the cool exclusives that you'll get on this campaign.  If you live outside the U.S, we will do our best to get it into your hands first. Also, pledging helps get us closer to taking a company retreat to the moon (it's research for the next expansions for Tsukuyumi. How else would we come up with this stuff?).\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a publisher that has brought more than a dozen games to market thus far, we feel confident in our ability to get this done.

We are confident that we will hit our release goals with no problems, shipping delays or Acts of God notwithstanding.

The Fail Faster Playtesting Journal will guide you throughout your playtesting process to ensure that you\u2019re capturing the right information as well as guide you towards improving your design. \nAt its core, the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal contains pages to keep track of 36 playtests. The journal is most useful if you dedicate one journal to each game that you are designing, but you could easily use one journal to keep track of all the different games you\u2019re designing. Each section has been tested and planned for optimal use of space.\nHere's an overview of what's included in this journal. Scroll down lower to see more details about each section of the journal. \nHere's a video of Jamey Stegmaier going into more detail about his thoughts on the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\n\nThis journal got a lot better as we achieved certain thresholds! We earned badges throughout the campaign and once we earned enough badges for a stretch goal to be unlocked, we held a poll. The poll asked if you preferred to redeem the badges for the first stretch goal, or if you preferred to wait and save up the badges for a different stretch goal. Majority prevailed! With 12 badges left at the end of the campaign, there was one more vote, but we can't edit the campaign once it's closed, so here's a snapshot of where we ended up:   \nVIDEO EXPLAINING STRETCH GOALS\nHere's a video explaining how the Stretch Goals work, in case this didn't make any sense! \nRED TROPHIES\nWhenever we made it to the end of any row in the Stretch Goal chart, we also unlocked a RED TROPHY! Red trophies unlocked more content for the journal and didn't cost any extra badges! Here's what we unlocked:\n1) Contract Checklist: A checklist of everything you need to consider before signing that contract! \n2) Blind Playtest Feedback form: A form to provide your blind playtesters to ensure you get the feedback you need. This will only be included in the PDF since it doesn't really make sense to include in the final copy of the journal. As a reminder, everyone who backs this campaign for at least 1 physical copy of the journal will also receive the PDF! \n\nFail Faster is the culmination of ideas from Jay Cormier who co-designed all of the games pictured above, with many more signed to come out soon.  He has detailed his journey on how he got his games published along with Sen-Foong Lim, at www.bamboozlebrothers.com. He teaches Game Theory at the Vancouver Film School and has done so for the last 6 years.   \nIt's possible that content and images shown below could change by the time we go to print. Mostly this will be due to listening to feedback from you, the backers!\nPlaytesters and Scores: The top left corner includes spaces for name, version, number of tests and date. Then an area to write your playtesters name - including a box to indicate if it's their first time playing the game and columns to keep track of various scores, or even times when players achieve specific thresholds.\nTimes: Here\u2019s where you can keep track of the time it took to explain rules and play your game and if you were able to play to the end or not.\nRules Changes and Focus: Do you have any rules changes since your last playtest that you don\u2019t want to forget? Write them here before you start your playtest. Then keep track of any observations you have as well as any questions your playtesters asked you while playing.\nWinning Strategies: Keep track of the winning player\u2019s strategy up here to see, over time, if there are dominant strategies. There's a nice reminder here to take a photo of the end game state. This can be useful when analyzing afterwards.\nFeedback: Feedback from your playtesters is written here. The questions that are asked vary on each page, and start by assuming you\u2019re in the Alpha phase of game design and by the end of the journal, the questions are more geared towards games in the Gamma phase. \nAdditional tools and resources\nThe journal is full of other interesting tools and resources that will help make you a better game designer.\nDesigner Progress \nOn the fold out cover, ten behaviours have been identified that, when followed, will make you a better playtester of your game and ultimately, a better designer.\nWhen you have accomplished one of these behaviours in your playtest, shade in the next box. When you reach a badge on any of the rows, flip open the fold-out cover and colour in that badge on the front.\nIf we unlock the sticker stretch goal, then the journal will come with stickers of each badge which will really pop when placed on the cover!\nYou can also keep track of your overall designer level by totaling up the number of badges you\u2019ve earned from previous journals. Write in the lifetime sum total in the top of your journal. If we reach our sticker stretch goal, then there will be stickers available to indicate your level as a designer for all to see.\nGame Idea Generator\nThe inside of the fold-out front cover contains a Game Idea Generator. Simply roll 2 dice three times to get a random Mechanic, Theme and even a Constraint. Don\u2019t have 2 dice lying around? No worries because that\u2019s also built into the journal.\nSimply flip the journal open to any page and the bottom left corner will have a random 2d6 result. This can be handy while playtesting your game if you forgot dice. Twenty-six of the middle pages also have a random letter tile on it for those games that require a random letter.\nHow to Get Your Game Published (in PDF version only)\nThere's a guide showing you how to get your game published. \nManufacturer Considerations\nThe back cover will have a page full of information from manufacturer, Panda that will help you as a designer.\nScoreboard\nThe inside back cover has a scoreboard in case you need one during your playtest. It folds out too, so you can still use the rest of your journal! It also has a metric ruler along the side. \n Goals\nThe front page has an area for you to write your own SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound), and if you work towards those goals, they too can earn you badges that you can put on the cover.\n\nProtips\nThe bottom of each playtesting page contains a different ProTip that comes from over 10 years of designing board games.\n Game Crafter Coupon\nEvery Kickstarter version of the physical journal comes with a $5 coupon for The Game Crafter - a great source for components as well as print-on-demand games. The retail version and any digital version will not come with this coupon.\nWatch Jay Cormier get interviewed by Edo about Playtesting as well as the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal.\nHere's an interview by Inquisitive Meeple where Jay Cormier dishes out a lot of facts and history about the Fail Faster Playtesting Journal\n\nPhotos: Dylan Hamm, www.dylanhammphoto.com\nVideo: Nathan Watkins,  nathanwatkinsfilm.com \nWeb Design: Jason Gorber, www.bearshark.com\nGraphic Design of Journal: David Mak, www.honeycombgraphics.ca\nSocial Media Consultant: Gerald King III,  ko-fi.com/mrking ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I've had numerous games on Kickstarter (Belfort, Tortuga, This Town Ain't Big Enough for the 2-4 of Us, But Wait There's More, In the Hall of the Mountain King), I've never had to run one myself.

We will work hard to make sure it is as smooth as can be. Together David and Heath have completed a combined eight Kickstarter campaigns. Each Kickstarter project brings many valuable lessons learned. Because of our experience, we feel very confident in our ability to deliver a quality product to you.\n\nWe have allotted time to finalize the project at the conclusion of the campaign, and then we will roll right into production. We have been working with our manufacturing partners in China and the United States for months on these Elder Dice designs to be sure the manufacturing process goes as smoothly as possible. We have a strong relationship with our fulfillment partner. These relationships are incredibly important and give us confidence in our ability to deliver your rewards in a safe and economical manner.\n\nHowever, with our experience, we know that unexpected issues can arise during the production process. Final preparations for manufacturing after the Kickstarter campaign could take longer than expected. There can be manufacturing delays that are beyond our control. When the product is inspected for quality control, a flaw could be found and a part may have to be remade. Molds may breakdown and have to be recreated. We will not sacrifice quality, even if it pushes the schedule back!\n\nThere can also be delays with shipping. Products can be delayed at sea, there may be extended customs inspections, and even adverse weather conditions may slow down local delivery. \n\nAlso, please remember that the images shown on the Kickstarter page and in the video are prototypes. The final dice may differ in detail and color. But, when you support Elder Dice, we promise to keep you up to date about its progress from the campaign\u2019s close all the way to when the dice are shipped.

Whenever I'm struggling with a design, I read the next chapter, and without fail I always learn something from the featured designer.\u201d \n-Jamey Stegmaier, Designer of Scythe\n\n\"You are asking interesting questions. These are not the standard questions which I have heard lots of times and have a spontaneous and direct answer to them. Your questions make me think a little bit more.\"\n-Reiner Knizia, Designer of 600+ published games\n\n\u201cGabe Barrett is simply one one of the best interviewers out there. He\u2019s talking with some of the greats in the game industry, giving you deep insights into their processes and perspectives.\u201d\n-Luke Laurie, Designer of The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire\n\n\u201cTons of insight from the top designers of our modern tabletop games \u2013 both inspiring and educational.\u201d \n-Sami Laakso, Designer of Dale of Merchants\n\n\"Board Game Design Advice is never far from my desk, both because it's a useful reference piece when I need help, and because it's a fun read as a fan of game design.\"\n-JR Honeycutt, Designer of Fireball Island\nExtended audio interviews with Reiner Knizia and Tim Fowers\nJames Hudson's top 3 tips for getting published\nJR Honeycutt's top 3 tips for working with a developer\n\nYou'll receive a digital copy of the book in three different formats: PDF, ePub, and MOBI. When the book is complete, you'll get an email with download links.\n\nAt this level, you'll receive a paperback copy of the book, and you'll get it several weeks before the book is available anywhere else (GUARANTEED).\nSee shipping rates below.\n\nThe hardback version of the book will not be available anywhere else and comes with a special edition cover. Every copy will be numbered and signed by the author.\nIf you order a hardback, you'll also receive a digital copy of the book, a bookmark, some stickers, and a 6 month subscription to BGDL+.\nOh, and you get FREE shipping!\nWhat is BGDL+?\nBGDL+ is a spinoff of the Board Game Design Lab podcast. \nIt provides members with extra podcast episodes, exclusive interviews, giveaways, and more. It's a way for game designers to take their work to the next level.\nMembers also get free access to design contests like the Board Game Design Challenge coming up in May.\nTypically, you become a member through Patreon and pay by the month, but if you back this campaign to receive a hardback copy of the book, you'll get a 6 month membership for free (a $30 value).\n\nIf you're a registered retailer, and you'd like to get some copies to sell at your store, this is the level for you. You'll receive 5 paperback copies of the book at a 50% discount.\nShipping costs $5 for the continental United States and $10 for everywhere else.\nYou'll also receive a complimentary digital copy of the book.\nIf you want more than 5 copies, please send me a message, and we can work something out.\n\nAt this level, you'll receive a hardback and digital book, access to BGDL+, and you can sponsor 1 week of content on the BGDL Facebook page and podcast. You'll receive:\nA banner on the BGDL Facebook page\nA banner in the weekly newsletter and podcast announcement emails\nA 90 second ad before that week's podcast\nFirst come, first served. Click HERE to see if the week you want is available before selecting this reward. Please click the \"+\" icon to add your name, select the week you want, hit \"Update,\" and select this reward immediately afterward.\nThis is a great way to tell people about your upcoming Kickstarter or game release. Typical episodes of the BGDL podcast average around 3,000 downloads.\n*All banners and ads must be approved by Gabe.  \nAt this level, you'll receive a hardback and digital book, access to BGDL+, a bookmark, stickers, and two 1-hour coaching calls done over Skype to talk about anything game design related with Gabe.\nIf you've run into some design snags, need help with a Kickstarter, want another set of eyes on your project, or just need some encouragement, this is a great reward level to pick.\nDates and times of meetings will be coordinated after the campaign is over.\n\n *The paperbacks & hardbacks are EU friendly. \nStretch goals for a campaign like this are obviously a little different than a typical project in the board game space. I can't exactly upgrade to a linen finish or add extra miniatures. So, the stretch goals are going to add more content to the book in the form of mini-interviews on specific topics.  \nHey. My name is Gabe, and in 2016 I created the Board Game Design Lab with one main mission: to help designers create great games that people love.\nOut of that mission came a podcast with over 115 episodes, a website full of resources, and an amazing community of designers trying to help each other become the best they can be.\nIt's been an incredible journey, and I can't wait to see what the future holds. If you think there's a game inside you (and I believe there is), I hope you'll come along on the journey to get it out of your head and onto a table. And don't worry, me and the BGDL will be there to help you every step of the way.\nwww.boardgamedesignlab.com\nSpecial Thanks\nI want to say a very special thanks to Drew Corkill who did all the awesome graphics for this campaign page. He also designed the covers for the book and is doing the interior layout and design.

All while charging at full speed through HyperDrive. \n6-in-1 USB-C Hub (HDMI, USB-C Data & Power Delivery, microSD, SD, USB-A, 3.5mm Audio Jack)\nPatented soft grips that secures HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro without interfering with the Apple Smart (Keyboard) Folio \nWorldwide Patent Pending\nAs slim as iPad Pro\nWorks with or without Apple Smart (Keyboard) Folio\nGrips are removable to work with other iPad Pro cases or devices \nWorldwide Patent Pending\n$1M Stretch Goal: USB-C Extension Cable\nReplace all other dongles with HyperDrive \nCompared to other dongles in the market and from the Apple Store, HyperDrive is more portable, has more features and is made of better materials. You would need multiple dongles to achieve what HyperDrive does, at a total cost much higher than HyperDrive.\nStop figuring out how to store and carry your dongles\nHaving multiple dongles means that you now have more items to manage on top of your iPad Pro, which increases the risk of misplacing them as you move around.\nWith HyperDrive, just pack and go\nHyperDrive is designed to be compact enough to stay with your iPad Pro wherever you go.\nDon't look silly with dongles. Just go with HyperDrive!\nStop hanging and juggling with multiple dongles. A single compact HyperDrive does the job of multiple dongles. Dongles never look sleeker than this.\nPrecision milled aluminum enclosure color matched to Silver and Space Gray iPad Pro\nPerfectly color matched to Space Gray and Silver iPad Pro\nThe same HyperDrive works with both 11\" and 12.9\" iPad Pro\nDesign\nWe wanted HyperDrive to feel like a natural extension of the 2018 iPad Pro with similar product lines, thickness, right angled edges and rounded corners.\nAs the 2018 iPad Pro only has a single USB-C port for the HyperDrive to latch on, we had to come up with an innovative solution to secure HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro.\nThe end result is a sleek, minimalist design that perfectly matches the 2018 iPad Pro with almost the same thickness, with removable soft grips that secures the HyperDrive onto the iPad Pro without interfering with its or the Apple Smart (Keyboard) Folio functionality. The Worldwide Patent Pending removable grip design also allows HyperDrive to be used with other iPad Pro cases or other USB-C devices and allows for future accessories like an extension USB-C cable to the HyperDrive.\nWorldwide Patent Pending\nWe decided to go with popular output ports (HDMI, microSD, SD, USB-A) most requested by users. Although HyperDrive takes up a USB-C port on the iPad Pro, it also returns a USB-C port as well, which supports USB-C 5Gbps data and up to 60W power delivery pass through charging through HyperDrive.\nFront view of iPad Pro + HyperDrive\nBack view of iPad Pro + HyperDrive\nProof of working prototype that is ready for production\nThe following unedited single-shot video demonstrates a fully functional pre-production HyperDrive with all (HDMI, USB-C, microSD, SD, USB-A, 3.5 audio jack) ports working. Using HyperDrive, the iPad Pro is able to connect to a HDMI display, connect to an external speaker via 3.5mm audio jack, import photos/videos from USB-C/USB-A flash drives and microSD/SD memory cards, all while being powered by a USB-C power source. HyperDrive for iPad Pro is plug-n-play and interfaces directly with iOS, with no additional apps required. Connecting devices to HyperDrive is like connecting devices directly to iPad Pro via original Apple USB-C adapters.\nSpecifications\n Output:\n                - HDMI supporting 1080p@60Hz, 2K@60Hz, 4K@30Hz\n                - USB-C data (USB 3.1 Gen 1, 5Gb/s) and Power Delivery (max 60W)\n                - micro SD (UHS-I 104MB/s)\n                - SD (UHS-I 104MB/s)\n                - USB-A data (USB 3.1 Gen 1, 5Gb/s)\n                - 3.5mm Audio Jack (USB 2.0 Audio, 48KHz, 16-bit Audio Input/Output, TRRS)\n Input: 1 x USB-C (USB 3.1 Gen 2, 10Gb/s\n DC/DC Efficiency: Up to 96%\n Device Operating Temperature: Less than 48\u00baC / 118\u00baF\n Enclosure: CNC aluminum available in Silver and Space Gray\n Dimensions: 3.66\" x 1.2\" x 0.35\" / 93 x 30.5 x 9mm\n Weight: 1.2oz / 34g\nRewards \nAvailable in Space Gray and Silver aluminum enclosure\nHyperDrive will be available in Silver or Space Gray.

These volumes were an expansion of the work that is presented at www.lovecraftianscience.wordpress.com, a blogsite dedicated to conducting scientific investigations into the Cthulhu Mythos that was initiated in September 2013.\nThe first volume focused on a variety of subjects, including discussions on Lovecraft\u2019s love for Science, the biology of some Lovecraftian entities, Einstein in a Lovecraftian universe, the short story \u201cFrom Beyond\u201d and mathematics in \u201cThe Dreams in the Witch-House.\u201d It also included a number of articles that backers requested such as discussions on Cthulhu, how humans and Deep Ones can interbreed and the Dreamlands. A chapbook Biology of the Old Ones was also produced.\nVolume 2 of the Journal contained a set of articles with the overarching theme of the Lovecraftian Solar System, with articles on the planets of our solar system, exoplanets, comets and meteors. Again, another set of articles were produced on questions posed by backers, which includes subjects such as the Shaggai and the Shan, Warfare of the Old Ones and What Exactly is Azathoth? The chapbook associated with the 2nd volume was titled Essays on Yuggoth.\nSO WHAT\u2019S THIS KICKSTARTER ABOUT?\nThis Kickstarter is for the 3rd volume of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science and the overall theme will be stories that Lovecraft either ghost wrote or co-wrote. Similar to the previous volumes, the 3rd volume will be approximately 135 to 150 pages in length and will include a least one illustration for each chapter. In turn, each chapter will be a discussion of scientific ideas or concepts of each revision tale. These tales will include:\n\u00b7 The Mound, with by Zealia Bishop\n\u00b7 Out of the Aeons, with Hazel Heald\n\u00b7 The Horror in the Museum, with Hazel Heald\n\u00b7 The Horror at Martin\u2019s Beach, with Sonia H. Greene\n\u00b7 Through of Gates of the Silver Key, with E. Hoffmann Price\n\u00b7 Till A\u2019 the Seas, with R. H. Barlow\n\u00b7 The Green Meadow, with Winifred V. Jackson\nAlso, another chapbook will be made available on a description of the ecosystem of Lovecraft\u2019s Venus in the tale \u201cIn the Walls of Eryx,\u201d co-written with Kenneth Sterling.  In addition, if the total amount of raised funds exceed $5,500.00, another chapter will be included in the Journal for \u201cThe Curse of Yig,\u201d co-written with Zealia Bishop. \nA draft illustration of the cover of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3\nSO WHAT WILL THE REQUESTED MONEY BE USED FOR?\nThe money raised through this Kickstarter will be used to conduct detailed, scientific investigations on a series of Lovecraft's revision tales. The articles developed for this periodical will not be available on the blog site. The Kickstarter will also cover costs for Steve Maschuck to produce at least 8 original pieces of artwork exclusively for this Volume. Finally, the Kickstarter will also cover professional editing and formatting of the periodical into digital formats. Additional material, either as new articles and/or new artwork, will be included, if higher pledge amounts are submitted (see rewards). Also, if the total amount of raised funds exceed $5,500.00, then an additional chapter will be included on the tale \"The Curse of Yig,\" which will include another illustration.\nWHEN DO I GET MY REWARD?\nThe digital and hard copies of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3 and the chapbook The Ecosystem of Lovecraft\u2019s Venus (In the Walls of Eryx) will be forwarded to all backers in March 2019.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe main obstacle associated with the project is putting the text together for the proposed periodical. Fortunately, a portion of the text is already complete; this proposed project will increase the level of detail associated with each article. If funded, the project will be completed and digital copies will be submitted to all backers. While there may be some slight delay in completing the periodical, the disciplined experience I have acquired over the course of almost three years in putting articles up on the blog site on a weekly basis will guarantee the successful completion of the project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital copy of Journal, Volume 3", "descp": "For $10.00 you will receive a digital copy the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3 and listed / thanked as a contributor", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital copy of Journal and Chapbook", "descp": "For $15.00 you will receive a digital copy the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3, a digital copy of the In the Wall of Eryx chapbook and listed / thanked as a contributor", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}], "stat": ["46 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 22 or more", "title": "Hard copy of Journal, Volume 3", "descp": "For $22.00 you will receive a digital copy and a hard copy of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3 as well as listed / thanked as a contributor.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Hard copy of Journal, Vol. 3 + Chapbook", "descp": "For $28.00 you will receive a digital copy and a hard copy of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3, a digital copy and hard copy of the In the Walls of Eryx chapbook as well as listed / thanked as a contributor", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["111 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Journal, Chapbook and Pose a Question", "descp": "For $50.00 you will receive a digital copy and a hard copy of the Journal of Lovecraftian Science, Volume 3, a digital copy and hard copy of the In the Walls of Eryx chapbook as well as listed / thanked as a contributor.

Campbell published the novella Who Goes There?, about a team of scientists in Antarctica who discover and are terrorized by a monstrous, shape-shifting alien entity.

The published novella was actually an abridged version of Campbell's original story, called Frozen Hell, which had to be shortened for publication. The Frozen Hell manuscript remained unknown and unpublished for decades, and it was only recently rediscovered. Frozen Hell expands the Thing story dramatically, giving vital backstory and context to an already incredible tale.

The specially designed cutter together with four minutely adjustable modules offers precise control on angle and depth of cutting to save time and increase stability. It adopts conventional 9mm snap-off blades and Perfect Cut customized blades.\nSimple, Fast, Precise\nParents can make unique costumes for kids' Halloween party; modelers could do jobs quicker; designers would be able to make sketch models easier and accelerate the design process.\nVari-Angle Cutting\nThe Vari-Angle module could be adjusted for various cuts. It controls the angle of cutting down to a 5-degree interval. With the snap-off cutter, the cutting depth can also be controlled.\nCircle Cutting\nCompass cutter, which could be operated with a single hand, is capable of radius between 6 and 25 cm.\n45\u00b0 Cutting\nThe 45\u00b0 module helps users to keep their blade 45\u00b0 inclined to the surface of the material while cutting a spline free-handed or cutting along a ruler.\n90\u00b0 Cutting\nThe 90\u00b0 module helps users to keep their blade perpendicular to the surface of the material while cutting along a ruler or cutting a spline free-handed.\nSnap-Off Cutter\nSpecial designed snap-off blade cutter uses both Perfect Cut customized blades and conventional 9mm blades. It could be used for both left or right-handed and holds the blade firmly.\nDifferent from the previous model, we created the 45-degree blade so that the tip won't break easily and at the same time allows you to make precise cuts.\n30cm Ruler\nThere will be four models of the 30cm/12\" ruler:\nAcrylic ruler in the metric system\nAluminum ruler in the metric system\nAcrylic ruler in Imperial units\nAluminum ruler in Imperial units\nYou'll choose one among them in a survey after the project ends. Don't worry about it at this moment.\nThe 60cm ruler is compatible with the 45\u00b0, 90\u00b0, and vari-angle module. It can\u2019t be use with the compass module.\nThere will be two models of the 60cm/24\" ruler:\nAcrylic ruler in the metric system  \nAcrylic ruler in Imperial units\nYou'll choose one among them in a survey after the project ends.\n\u203b Artworks are work in progress, minor change will apply.\nCutting Materials\nTimeline\nAt this moment the injection molds are almost ready (minor modification will apply.) We are working on the ruler and the customized blade.\nRewards\n\nYou can add extra rulers by selecting a reward, adding $29 to your pledge for one additional 30cm ruler ($58 for two, $145 for six,) or $39 for an additional 60cm ruler. (If you\u2019ve already pledged, click the \"Manage my pledge\" button to change the amount.)\n\nThis deal is exclusively for Kickstarter, and no extra shipping fee will be charged. We will send you a survey to collect your choices of material and measurement unit of the rulers after the campaign.\nPerfect Cut Specs\nMore Examples\nThank You for Your Support\nTo everyone who backed and feedbacked the project \u2013 thank you. Your support and constructive feedback make Perfect Cut and Polarlab a reality, has changed my life, and now changing others\u2019. The project started in Dec 2014 when I was a design student and was one of my degree projects. Moreover, now Perfect Cut got a chance to be real after years of developing and refining.\nThis campaign is about more than designing and backing a project. It\u2019s a business model and a good way for designers or anyone who has an idea to be evaluated and realized as a product. In term of business, crowdfunding allows us not to compromise the functionality and creativity of the product, and in this case, we could treat our communities, backers, partners and our team (of 2 people) as peers.\nOnce again, thank you for your occupation, and we will continuously look to you, our community, for feedback and direction. Enjoy cutting :)\nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 500+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $235MM raised between them.\n     About PolarLab  \nWe are makers, designers, and engineers.

Dark water suddenly rose from the land, invading our homes and lives. They say it came from the depths inside the Loop. Whatever it was the Flood changed everything. Nothing would ever be the same again.\nWelcome back to the Loop. Things are different now. \nIn 2017, we released Tales from the Loop the tabletop roleplaying game based on St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s first art book. That game was an instant hit, selling out its two initial print runs and winning no less than five ENnies (including Best Game and Product of the Year) as well as three Golden Geek Awards (including Best RPG).\nNow, it\u2019s time to return to the Loop and continue the story. In Things from the Flood you play Teens in the 1990s \u2013 a decade of change and disaster. You're still balancing day to day life with solving exciting mysteries with your friends. But this is a darker time, and the stakes are higher.\nWe are the Free League, creators and publishers of roleplaying games such as Mutant: Year Zero, Coriolis - The Third Horizon, Tales from the Loop and Forbidden Lands. As well as the original publishers of Simon St\u00e5lenhag\u2019s art books. The lead writer of this book is the seasoned Swedish game writer Nils Hintze, backed up by the entire Free League team who handle project management, editing, and graphic design. \nThe vast majority of the art in the game is done by Simon St\u00e5lenhag himself. Most of the art will be drawn from the pages of the Things from the Flood artbook - many scenarios in the game are based directly on illustrations in the artbook - but the RPG will contain some new original art as well, including the cover image.\nThe book will have approximately 200 pages, in the US Letter format.\nTales from the Loop Backer? If you backed the original Tales from the Loop RPG back in late 2016, you will get a PDF of the Things from the Flood core book, including the digital stretch goals in this Kickstarter, at no extra cost. You can still join this Kickstarter to get the printed book.\nThings are different now. \nThe world does not seem so innocent anymore. \nIts the \u201890s and the once mighty Loop has been shut down, the experiment abandonded and the land bought by Krafta, a powerful corporation. You are no Kids anymore, but Teens trying to find your way in a decade of change \u2013 both within and around you. \nThe Flood has transformed the once pastoral islands into a dark marshland. Some say that the dark water pouring out of the ground comes from within the Loop itself. Machines are afflicted by a strange virus turning them unreliable and dangerous. \nStill, your lives go on as before. You go to school, fall miserably in love, try to do everything possible to fend off boredom. When you hear about other teens going missing, and even turning up dead, you realize its time to gather the group again.\nOne way or another you fill find out what these Things from the Flood really are. \nYou play Teens growing up in the 1990s, trying to balance everyday life while at the same time solving dark mysteries together with your friends. \nThe core of the game is the same as in Tales from the Loop, but the themes are different. Gone are the childlike tales of wonder and discovery, in their place are dark threats to the Teens and their world. Everything is changing, everything is falling apart. Figuring out how to deal with this is a big part of the game. \nYou are no kid anymore, the world is both more exciting and more dangerous. Teenagers can get hurt \u2013 and even die. The stakes are higher than ever.\nBoth! Things from the Flood expands the scope of Tales from the Loop to the 1990s. You can continue your campaign with the Kids from the original game or create brand new player characters. We call it a \"standalone expansion\" because everything that is needed to play the game is included in the book. That\u2019s right, no previous experience is needed at all, just get the book and start playing right away.\nIf you\u2019ve read and played the Tales from the Loop RPG, you will find yourself right at home, this book expands the setting and introduces new exciting mysteries and threats to explore. \nThe game engine of Things from the Flood is the same as the one for Tales from the Loop RPG and is based on our previous game Mutant: Year Zero, that was awarded with a Silver ENnie for Best Rules at Gencon 2015.\nThe core mechanic is the same: To make a skill roll, you simply grab a number of dice for your attribute score, skill level and gear, and roll them all together. You need at least one six to succeed, and extra sixes can give you stunts and other bonus effects.\nThings from the Flood will be available in two languages: English and Swedish. The Swedish title of the game will be Flodsk\u00f6rden and you will be able to choose your preferred language in the pledge manager once the Kickstarter has concluded.\nWith your help, we can make Things from the Flood even more amazing.

Whether you are a casual fan or a rabid one, we've got you covered. \nI loved Lovecraft even before I knew his name. His lore permeated every inch of my childhood. I didn't know, for instance, that H. P. Lovecraft was the mind behind the Necronomicon when I watched Evil Dead. I didn't know he was the grandfather of psychological horror as I binged In the Mouth of Madness, Jacob's Ladder, Aliens, and dozens of other terrifying movies in my youth. \nI didn't even know Lovecraft created Cthulhu until well after I called the Great Old One's name. However, the older I got, the more I grew to appreciate the warped mind behind some of my all-time favorite things, and I wanted to create something that could show that love, with people who loved Lovecraft as much as I did, for people who loved Lovecraft as much as me.\nAnd Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is the result of that process.\nAfter the success of my first anthology, Monsters and Other Scary S^&t, I asked my fans, and fans of the book, what we should cover next, and they told me Lovecraft. \nImmediately, I was like \"YESSSSS!!!!\" \nMonsters and Other Scary S^&t was all about how monsters can represent anything from cute to scary and everything in between, and Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is just like that, but with Lovecraft. It's 35 stories that show just how deeply Lovecraft has permeated the  essence of our culture. \nWhen I create a book, the first thing I sit down to figure out is how my book can be different from everything else on the market. After all, there are HUNDREDS of Lovecraft anthologies out there, both from Lovecraft himself and from loads of authors who have carried the torch for him in the last century. \nAdditionally, there are tons of stories told from a Lovecraftian horror point of view, dealing with the creepy, unsettling nature of humanity. I didn't think we could compete with those, nor did I want to, either. \nThere is one thing I love, though, that I haven't seen a lot previously...a book devoted to the mythology of Lovecraft's universe. \nYou see, I've always been fascinated by the gods and monsters of Lovecraft, and I never seemed to get enough of them in the stories I read. Most Lovecraft stories are filled with the horror aspect of Lovecraft, but low on the mythology. \nBut my favorite part of Lovecraft is the mythology he crafted, the gods he made, and the way that mythology differed from the myths of every other mythology out there. So that's what I set out to create.\nCthulhu is Hard to Spell is a book steeped in the mythology and gods of Lovecraft. The stories inside it's pages follow the spirit of Lovecraft, but often strays from the tone of Lovecraftian horror. \nSure, some of the stories in this book are Lovecraftian in nature down to their very core, but there are also funny stories, cute stories, fantasy stories, sci-fi stories, and much, much more which build on the Lovecraftian mythos. \nIf you love the gods and monsters of Lovecraft, then Cthulhu is Hard to Spell is going to be your jam. \nBest of all, this anthology is ALL AGES APPROPRIATE. These aren't stories made for children necessarily, at least not all of them, but we toned down the cursing (there is none), the violence (there is no blood), and there was never any sex, to make sure you could show it to your child, even if they won't understand it all. \nI've had conversations with many people at shows asking for a book to indoctrinate their children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, cousins, etc, into loving creepy things, and I think this book is a great primer for that, while being enjoyable to people who already love the creepy, too. \nWe listened to you from the last anthology, and made sure this was: \n-Appropriate for all ages (even though we deal with some very dark topics) \n-Full color\n-Shorter stories (2, 4, 6, or 8 pages) \n-All stories are even numbers, so they begin and end on the same page throughout. \nWe used your feedback to make this anthology even better! You opinions are very important to us, and we appreciate them very much. \nBackers really loved our first anthology\nThe real reason we're doing a second anthology is because Kickstarter backers and fans loved our first anthology so much. I was hesitant to do a second anthology before the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t campaign launched. \nHowever, the response from backers was so positive that I gladly decided to go into the fray a second time. There is nothing like geeking out about something with creators and fans, and that is what our anthologies allow us to do.\nCheck out the reaction to our last anthology. We hope this anthology has an even better reaction! \nWe brought back a bunch of creators from the first book and added a ton of new faces so we can make this book even more amazing! \nWhy do the other creators love Lovecraft so much? \nWe all have our reasons for loving Lovecraft, so listen to some of our creators talk about why they got involved in the project. \nWho am I? \n My name is Russell Nohelty, publisher of Wannabe Press, a small press that creates weird books for weird people, creator of Katrina Hates Dead S%&t, Ichabod Jones: Monster Hunter, and Pixie Dust, along with the editor of both the Monsters and other Scary S^&t, and this anthology.  \nI have raised over $70,000 on Kickstarter from 7 different projects, and have gotten exceedingly good at crafting amazing books which audiences love. My previous two projects, Monsters and Other Scary S^&t and Pixie Dust, both raised north of $25,000 from over 600 backers each. \nI have a simple motto when it comes to Kickstarter. I outlay all the money to get the book print ready, and then I bring it to my audience and ask if they would rather have a cheaply made paperback edition, or a beautiful hard cover edition. \nSee, I can go hit enable distribution on a soft cover edition right now, but luckily Kickstarter backers have again and again wanted the hardcover edition, printed in the most beautiful way possible.\nWhat are some of the stories in this book? \nNora (art and words by Angela Oddling) -- a dejected teenager living in an ice village sets out to find Aphoom-Zhah and thaw his cold heart. \nThe Dunwich Boys (art by Esther Pimentel, words by Eddy Hedington, letters by Nikki Powers) -- Yog-Sothoth has materialized in a house in Dunwich, and the Dunwich boys have to banish it from their neighborhood. \nThe Eternal War (art and words by Eric Young) -- A retelling of the origin story of Lovecraft's universe, translated from the Voynich manuscript. \nCat is Cryptic (art and words by Megan Hutchison) -- a retelling of the Cats of Ulthar, one of Lovecraft's most beloved stories. \nTsathoggua's Triumph (art by John Edingfield II, words by Clay Adams) -- Tsathoggua dreams of his eventual conquest of the universe. \nCleaning the Mess (story and art by Brandon Perlow, words by Paul J. Mendoza, Letters by Wilson Ramos, Jr.) -- Cthulhu has conquered another world, but all he really wants is his master to come find him. \nSong for the Harbinger (art by Brianna Gilmartin, words by Heather Kenealy) -- Ghroth doesn't understand why nobody likes his singing, all he wants to do is harmonize with planets, and they keep blowing up. \nThe Yag-Kosha Mystery (art and words by Kelly Dochy) -- Yag-Kosha, the pacifist alien, has a mysterious koan for you. \nMons (art and words by Matthew Childers) --Explorers on Mars find an ancient tome that could unlock the secrets of the universe, or unleash a Lovecraftian horror. \nThe Summoning of Brkthruslpk (art by Robin Dassen, words by Don Perkins) -- A group of kids works to summon the ancient god Brkthruslpk onto the world. \nNo DQ (art and words by Ryan Fisher) -- A weak, sickly wrestling fan gets to live out his fantasy of being a star after a mysterious stranger endowing him with an enchanted garment. \nSlumber (art by Lloyd Ladera, words by Sarah Anderson) -- After being woken up on a spaceship, a man has to escape the Lovecraftian horror chasing him. \nThat's Cthulhu to You (art by Zac Skellington, words by Leo Baxter Kiker) -- An oddities store gets a new pet: Cthulhu. \nHow to Summon the Dark Lord Hastur (Art by Cara Stemo, words by Johnny C, letters by Travis Duda, logo design by Nathan Burns) -- A card game, a tragic birth, a goverment experiment, and a violent crime all converge to release a deadly horror on the world. \nChurch of Mormo (art by Claire Leslie, words by N.S. Kane) -- Greek spirit Mormo goes door to door trying to recruit Cthulhu worshipers to her cause. \nShe Came Upon a Great Tree (art by Nick Kremenek, words by Mike Speakman, edited by Greg Smith) -- A delivery driver and part-time cultist must find a great tree to unleash Cthulhu and Hastur onto the world. \nFlycatcher (art by Dan Scalisi, words by Frank Martin) -- Even though they have been warned for years, the fly people of Dipterra are not prepared for the wrath of Yba'sokug. \nThe Rally (art and words by Mary Bellamy) -- Lucifer needs new generals, and has decided to recruit Lovecraftian gods to his cause. \nWhy is this book going to be so awesome? \n1. It's 176 pages of glorious comics! - That's a massive amount of awesome comics about monsters! Over 150 pages and 35 stories!\n2. It's gonna be in hardcover! - There are lots of comics, but how many are printed in hardcover? Not many! \n3. All the UV spotting! There's gonna be spot UV all over the cover. I love spot UV and I've gotten exceedingly good at using it over the years. There might even be a little surprise if we can blow past our regular goal on that front. \n4. Glossy art paper - Most books are printed in gloss lamination, trapping all the glorious line work under an ugly, gross, yellow film. This anthology is different. It's printed on glossy art paper, which means the ink shines on top of the paper and looks like it's simmering, just like the any other art book on the market today. After all, we believe that comics are beautiful works of art and should be printed as such. \n5. Our creators have credits from all your favorites companies. Our creators have worked with Marvel, DC, Oni, Tokyopop, Heavy Metal, Fantagraphics, Upper Deck, Sony, and more along with brands like Teen Titans, My Little Pony, Invader Zim, Ghostbusters, Horizon Zero Dawn, and more. We have creators who have been nominated for Eisners, won Glyphs, Silver Eagles, WGA awards, and more! \n6. There are just so many many Lovecraftian gods and monsters. There was only one rule in this anthology; all of the stories needed to contain at least one Lovecraftian god or monster. This book is full of different types gods you know like Cthulhu and Azathoth, and ones you've never heard of as well! \nAnd you can get the whole book, including shipping, plus a pdf copy AND audio commentary for just $40, INCLUDING SHIPPING (in the US, at least)! \nWho drew that dope cover? \n It was drawn by Aaron Alexovich, creator of my favorite indie comic of all time, Serenity Rose, a 500+ page graphic novel about a previously famous witch trying to come to terms with her powers in a very weird town. Read it. Buy it. Love it.   \nIf you've never read that book, you probably know him from his work on Invader Zim, both the television show and more recently on the comic book. \nAaron is a powerhouse in the world of indie books, and Zim is one of my favorite animated shows of all time. He also drew the cover for the Monsters and Other Scary S^&t anthology. I really wanted him to come back for this anthology too, and I was so stoked when he said yes!  \nOn top of it all, Aaron might be one of the few people on earth that loves Lovecraft, especially Cthulhu, even more than me, which I once didn't think possible.\nDid Dirk Manning really write the foreword? \nYes, Dirk Manning, an icon of Lovecraftian horror comics on Kickstarter, wrote the foreword for Cthulhu is Hard to Spell. He didn't have time to contribute, but he asked me if he could do the foreword, and I of course said yes. \nDirk has raised a ton of money for Nightmare World, Tales of Mr. Rhee, and more on Kickstarter, and that he wanted to contribute to this book means the world to me. \nHere is a snippet of what he wrote, which made me smile. \nFor now, take the time to enjoy this book.\nWhile it\u2019s (another) unspoken truth that anthologies are often a hit-and-miss prospect, I can honestly say that there wasn\u2019t a story in this collection that I didn\u2019t enjoy... which shouldn\u2019t be surprising since it\u2019s a reminder that just like you\u2019re not alone in what you know and feel, these stories reminded me I\u2019m not alone either.\nI was honored when I read those words. So yes, file under: Dirk Approved. \nWhat are some other stories in the book? \nAshes to Ashes (art by Laura Neubert, words by Virginia Drohan) --  Quachil Uttaus learns what it means to be human.     \nOne Last Chance (art by Ben Herrera, words by K.J. Kaminski, colors by Emmanuel Torres) -- Humanity has one last chance to save the universe as they fight against the forces of Zathog on the planet Zarr. \nA 10,000 Year Curse (art by Dave Lentz, words by Dave Lentz and Ryan Kroboth, Inks by Rob Simmons, Colors by Ryan Kroboth) -- Even the old gods needs a night off, but it's often impossible to find a reliable babysitter, even for them. \nThe Call of Stone (art and words by Shannon Kirkwood) -- After a woman dies, she finds her true purpose in protecting the Star Mother. \nLove Story (art and words by Christie Shinn) -- A love story about Mnomquah and Oorn's eternal love. \nBasatan vs. Satan (art by Lady Beaver, Words by Steve Waldinger, letters by T. Perran Mitchell) -- Basatan returns to the surface to take his rightful place as ruler of Earth, but Satan has other plans.\nThe Art of Losing (art and words by Nathan Leuth) -- After her family dies and the Apocalypse comes, a young woman finds strength in music. \nSunset at Sarnath (art by Wesley Wong, words by Wesley Sun) -- An old man, a young girl, and a pig discuss who was responsible for the end of the world. \nThe Marriage Counselor (art by Melissa J Massey, words by Madeleine Holly-Rosing) -- Mnomquah and Oorn go to marriage counseling, because even the best marriages fall apart sometimes. \nWhere is the money going? \nGreat question. Here is a pie chart of the distribution of the funds. This is subject to fluctuation based on pledges, but should be a good guide. \nBook production and printing - $9,000 (41.5%)\nShipping - $6,000 (27.7%)\nPins - $334 (1.5%)\nKickstarter fees - $2,166 (10%)\nCreator residuals - $2,166 (10%)\nEmergency - $2,000 (9.3%)\nYou may ask why I have such a high emergency fund, and I would respond that it is why I have been able to successfully deliver 7 campaigns, because stuff always goes wrong, and sometimes in a big way. \nWhat can you get for your pledge? \nI am not the kind of creator who offers a ton of different rewards, but I do want to offer some awesome ones. Here's what you can get for your money. \nBefore I move on, I want to point out a couple of our coolest rewards. First, I want to thank Andrew Pawley for making this awesome paper doll, which EVERYBODY who pledges even for $1 will receive! \nYou have to build it yourself, but it looks just so awesome when it's set up.\nSecond, for the first time ever, I am doing an exclusive PIN designed by Aaron Alexovich specifically for this campaign. I have this pin in hand already, and it is AMAZING. \nAlso, we'll be offering our variant white eye addition of the Monster anthology, instead of the normal yellow eye edition. I only had a couple hundred of these white eye variant Soulless eye editions made, and they are almost gone! \nThe Crush it on Kickstarter course is my introductory course about how to run a Kickstarter campaign. It will show new creators (or ones who want to up their game), how to create, launch, fund, and distribute their campaigns. As a person who has run eight campaigns and successfully filled all but this one (only because it's currently running) without going over budget, and having raised almost $100,000 on Kickstarter, I know a thing or two about this stuff. \nMore importantly, I am a seasoned course creator through my website, The Complete Creative. If you would like to see the course, you can do so by clicking here. \nMy How to Make an Awesome Comics Anthology course is one I made specifically for this Kickstarter. After my previous anthology campaign, people asked me a ton of questions about how to make a comics anthology, but I was too overwhelmed to answer them. This time, I wanted to be prepared, so I laid out my exact strategy for making an awesome comics anthology. \nI'm very proud of this course and think that whether you are a seasoned pro at anthologies or just starting out, you can learn a ton from this course.

I feel as though I have fixed all of those issues at this point with my supply chain, but there are always some more that pop up. \n\nFor instance, with the monster anthology, we had to wait an additional 3 months for the glow-in-the-dark eyes to be applied correctly, and fix errors in the covers. \n\nWith Katrina, we had to wait 8 more weeks in port due to customs than we wanted, delaying our release from July until September. \n\nThese things can and do happen, and I can't say they won't happen again. However, I have done everything possible to ensure that we will have a smooth operation and these books will be in your hand as soon as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Paper toy!", "descp": "Get a downloadable Cthulhu paper toy designed by Andrew Pawley from Galaxafreaks and Cthulhu Kids!\nINCLUDES:\nPaper toy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["51 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Lovecraft", "descp": "Get a digital copy of the anthology in .pdf and .cbz form!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["348 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Audio Commentary", "descp": "Get audio commentary of my thought process about each story, why I placed it in the book, and fun stories about the book's creation.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy\nAudio Commentary", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2018"}], "stat": ["22 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more", "title": "Hardcover edition of the book!", "descp": "**NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES!**\nGet a physical copy of the book in all its hardcover glory!\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Lovecraft\nPaper toy\nHardcover copy of the book\nAudio Commentary", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["358 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Special Thanks", "descp": "**NO ADDITIONAL DOMESTIC SHIPPING CHARGES!**\nSpecial thanks in the book!

Sammons for Chaosium Inc's 7th edition Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game. It has a dark tone, like most Stygian Fox titles, more akin to True Detective and American Horror Story and is written for Mature Gamers Only. The scenarios look into the dark heart of humanity and the mythos... but this book has a twist.\nOne of the problems long term Keepers can face when running Call of Cthulhu is their players becoming too jaded or blas\u00e9 regarding the Cthulhu mythos. \n\"Oh, Deep Ones? Yeah, we've killed these before. Open fire.\"\nRather than; \"Oh my God! They're real! Run!\"\nIt's difficult to maintain that suspension of belief when you have been facing the same creatures year after year. This is where Occam's Razor comes in, being a collection of scenarios where initially they seem to be linked to the mythos but they have mundane causes and outcomes.\nI have run these type of scenarios for twenty years and every time they sucker players in and help them see how paranoid their characters have become and, more importantly, when it comes time to face the actual mythos again, many players believe the adventure will have a mundane cause. When interspersed with mythos adventures this leads to some serious panic when the players realise that this is real. Used sparingly, these adventures lull players into a false sense of security and make the next real mythos encounter all the more vivid.\n\nOne of my players had his character just stand and watch as a colleague was eaten by a dark shadow in a toy store because the player refused to believe it was a mythos entity. This was a ten year veteran of the game.\n\nOf course, a separate sidebar is provided for each adventure if you wish to have actual mythos elements in your game. \nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\n Brian M. Sammons has created 6 scenarios which tease at mythos causes but will ultimately lead to a mundane resolution. A murder is just a murder, a cult site is just kids with spray paints, etc. Here is a summary of the scenarios contained within the book.\n\nDeep and Dark \u2013 the investigators find a snuff film on the dark web, but one of a pretty girl getting mauled by a Fishman monster. Did the deep ones mess up and accidentally get filmed in this modern world where everyone has a camera phone or is it something else?  \nEye of the Beholder \u2013 an art student goes missing while doing late night research in a museum with ties to the local university. Maybe it\u2019s a coincidence that the museum just got in a huge statue from South America of a little-known death god called Thul\u2019Cathul. Yep, total coincidence.  \nThe Watchers \u2013 a woman living alone in an apartment in the big city notices that people are watching her. Following her. They even broke into her home. But why? What do they want and how far will they go?  \nA Whole Pack of Trouble \u2013 a group of film school students go to an isolated, abandoned, and reportedly haunted asylum to make a found-footage horror movie and make a fortune? Whatever could go wrong with that? Well, when the filmmakers go missing the investigators will have to find out.  \nA Cleansing Flame \u2013 People are dying by fire. No one knows why and no one knows how. When the latest victim is a friend to one of the investigators and an astronomer who reportedly made a recent discovery of note, it\u2019s up to the investigators to put out these flames.  \nVisions From Beyond - Tommy is a friend who makes some new friends. That\u2019s nice. Unfortunately those friends have a strange reputation, they get up to some bizarre practices, and then one night Tommy calls one of the investigators in terror, begging for help, then the line goes dead. What\u2019s a friend and an investigator of the Mythos to do?\nThe book will be in PDF, ePub, Softcover, and hardcover formats and will be full colour.\nBrian M. Sammons - Writer\n\nBrian is a fiction editor for Dark Regions Press and the Chief Editor for Golden Goblin Press, a film and literature critic for over twenty years and has penned stories that have appeared in such anthologies as Arkham Tales, Horrors Beyond, and many more. He has edited the books; Cthulhu Unbound 3, Undead & Unbound, Eldritch Chrome, and Dread Shadows in Paradise, among others. His game work is mostly for the Call of Cthulhu game and includes scenarios for Secrets, The San Francisco Guidebook, Doors to Darkness, The Things We Leave Behind, and more.

She has been writing for Alarums & Excursions since 1991, and has written material for Unknown Armies and reviews for The Familiar, The Unspeakable Oath, and RPG.net. She has edited and proofread games and scenarios from Arc Dream Publishing, Golden Goblin Press, Modiphius Entertainment, Parenthesis Press, and Rogue Games. She has also playtested games for Evil Hat Productions and Pelgrane Press, and knows a playtest has been unusually successful when her players inform her that she is going to run the game again next week even though the playtest period is over.\nBadger McInnes - Book Designer\n\nBadger has been working as a book designer and layout artist for the Call of Cthulhu RPG since 2003, starting out under the tutelage of Charlie and Lynn at Chaosium. He has designed books for Chaosium over the years (Call of Cthulhu 7th edition, Cthulhu by Gaslight 3rd edition, Secrets of Kenya, among others), as well as other sinister purveyors of Call of Cthulhu material such as Pagan Publishing, Pelgrane Press, and Golden Goblin Press.

Corey\u2019s award-winning series of science fiction novels to the tabletop. Using the Adventure Game Engine (AGE) rules found in Fantasy AGE, Blue Rose, and Modern AGE, The Expanse takes players to a far-future solar system where humanity is divided: Martians, Belters, and the people of old Earth struggle for political power and resources, but even older, alien, forces are stirring in the universe, and human history is about to take an unexpected new turn. The Expanse applies the fast-playing and action-based AGE rules to spaceships, solar colonies, and adventure and intrigue in the far-future, where the actions of the characters may change the course of history!\nAs long time fans know, The Expanse was a roleplaying game campaign long before it was a series of novels or a TV show. We are delighted to bring it full circle with this game! And here's the best thing about The Expanse RPG: we've been working on this for well over a year and rules are done! They've been through multiple iterations and playtesting, and we've worked closely with Ty Franck and Daniel Abraham (together, James S.A. Corey) throughout to ensure we are getting The Expanse right. Now let's hear from Daniel and Ty themselves!\nPLAY\n\nWant to check the game out RIGHT NOW? Download The Expanse RPG Quickstart today! This is a 40-page PDF that includes stripped down rules, pre-generated characters, and an adventure you can play right away. The download is free. \nThe Expanse RPG Features \nThe Expanse is based on the exciting new Modern AGE rules-set, and includes many of its features, such as customized character building using Backgrounds and Professions, Drives for character engagement, and an abstract resources system. It also makes use of the Modern AGE approach to action, exploration, and social encounters, complete with stunts and systems for all of them. To get a closer look at Modern AGE, you can download the Quickstart here.   \nThe following are some of the unique features of The Expanse in comparison to other AGE games:  \nFortune: Rather than Health, characters have a Fortune score that measures lucky near-misses, close scrapes, and trivial hits before the character takes serious harm. Fortune is also useful for modifying die rolls and offering players some narrative control but, watch out! Spend too much of it and your luck could run out when you get caught in a crossfire!\nConditions: In addition to a running Fortune total, characters use various conditions to measure things like injuries and fatigue as well as tactical challenges like hindered movement or sensory abilities.  \nInterludes: The interludes in between encounters are given their own treatment, allowing players to make use of their \u201cdown-time\u201d (including long hauls between destinations in the System) to recover, do maintenance, build their connections with others, or pursue their own projects.  \nSpaceships: The Expanse RPG features a system to model and create spaceships and its own system for space combat, including the assault on Thoth Station as an example of the system in action!  \nThe Churn: The Expanse also offers something for the Game Master with the Churn: A ticking counter that measures the crew\u2019s progress through a story and just when things are going to suddenly go sideways and become even more complicated!\nTwo Editions to Choose From!\nWe are offering the core rulebook of the Expanse RPG in two formats:\nThe Standard Edition is now (thanks to unlocked stretch goals) a 224 page full color hardback with a poster map of the solar system. This is the version that will stay in print after the Kickstarter has been fulfilled. \nThe Special Edition is a deluxe version of The Expanse RPG. It features the same beautiful full color interior of the Standard Edition with a black leatherette hardcover and a ribbon bookmark. This version is a Kickstarter exclusive, so it will not be available after the close of this campaign. Thanks to an unlocked stretch goal, the Special Edition now includes a dust jacket featuring the game's gorgeous cover art!\nThe Expanse Game Master's Kit\nThis Kickstarter also includes The Expanse Game Master's Kit, which will ship alongside the book. It currently includes the following, but may expand with the unlocking of stretch goals:\nA three-panel landscape format GM Screen with vital game system reference tables on one side and three panels of Expanse art on the player-facing side.  \nA set of game reference cards, including an initiative tracker, stunt references, and action references useful for players at the table.\nNow includes pre-generated characters after a stretch goal unlock!\nNow includes an adventure after a stretch goal unlock!\nAbzu's Bounty\nAbzu's Bounty is the first campaign for The Expanse  Roleplaying Game. This series of six linked scenarios will let you kick off your adventures in The Expanse in style. All six parts were unlocked as stretch goals so the full campaign is a go! Best of all, if you back the Kickstarter for $30 or more, you get a PDF of Abzu's Bounty for free! \n\nDesign Team\nWe assembled a great team to design The Expanse Roleplaying Game. Steve Kenson is the lead designer. You may know Steve from our Blue Rose and Mutants & Masterminds RPGs, or from any of the dozens of RPG books he's worked on over the last two decades. He had the able assistance of Seth Johnson, Ian Lemke, Rich Lescouflair, Rob McCreary, Jason Mical, Neall Raemonn Price, Zack Walters, Nicole Winchester, and of course James S.A. Corey!\n\nImportant Note: Shipping!  \nWe are going to be charging shipping separately later this year when the books are almost ready, and it will be EU-, Canada-, and Australia-friendly. In our previous Kickstarters, we tried to keep it simple with just a few standard shipping costs but this has proved a poor way to handle it. International shipping can be brutal and in too many cases we were paying more to ship than we collected for it. Shipping rates can also rise after a campaign ends but before the games are ready to ship. So about a month from shipping, we will assess and collect actual shipping costs using a pledge manager. The upside is that you don\u2019t need to pay the full cost now. We also want to point out that The Expanse RPG Standard Edition will be sold through distribution and into game and book stores after backers get their books. If you are concerned that shipping is going to be too expensive, be aware that the Kickstarter will not be the only way you can get the game. If you can get it from your local game store and save yourself a lot on shipping, that\u2019s a totally reasonable decision to make. There are also special tiers of the Kickstarter for retailers, so you can also talk to your local store and find out if they'll be bringing in books that way.\nGamers and retailers may also be interested in our Pre-Order Plus Program. Basically, this lets gamers pre-order our games through their local stores and get the same special we offer on our website. You can find out more about Pre-Order Plus here. \nStretch Goals\nOur initial batch of stretch goals are focused on enhancing the core rulebook and GM's Kit, make them bigger and better. \nUnlocked!

It\u2019s not a book with adventures, spells, creatures, or magic items. It\u2019s not a book for characters at all, but a book for players! If you play or run roleplaying games, this book is for you. Inside this gorgeous hardcover book, suitable for your coffee table or your gaming table, you will find advice and suggestions for enhancing your RPG experience at the table and away from it. This is an insider\u2019s look at everything that goes into the hobby\u2014finding a group, making a character, running a game, creating adventures, finding all the right ideas, hosting a game\u2026and that\u2019s just for starters.         \nIf You\u2019re an Experienced Gamer\nYou\u2019ve been gaming for a while now. Maybe even years. You get the concepts, and you understand the rules. No one needs to explain the dice to you. Your Best Game Ever embraces the hobby you love, and provides real tips, immediately usable advice, and hands-on pointers you can use at your game table. You\u2019ll find everything here from enhancing immersion, tips for running games online, creating characters with depth, worldbuilding, designing rules, dealing with personality conflicts that arise at the table, and more!\nIf You\u2019re Fairly New to Gaming\nYour friends play RPGs. You\u2019ve maybe watched some streaming games, or given it a try a few times. You get the general idea, but where do you go from there? How do you really get into this hobby the way so many others have? This book will give you everything you need to learn how to choose the right game, how to fit into your game group or start your own group, and get you going on the fast track to being a great gamer.\nNot a Rule Book, But a Tool Book\nYour Best Game Ever is divided into three major sections: general game topics, being a player, and being a game master. There\u2019s even a section on designing your own game, and getting it published. And this isn\u2019t just a stuffy book on theory, either. You\u2019ll find actual suggestions you can use to create better characters with character arcs, real recipes you can make for game night (and even spruce them up for your genre of choice), specific suggestions for music and ambiance depending on genre, plot ideas, character ideas, and other ready-to-use material.         \nThis 240-page book will enable you to become a better gamer. You\u2019ll find ways to create and manage a great game group, tricks for game prep (and what to do if you haven\u2019t prepared!), understanding and managing game balance, and taking everything around you and incorporating it as inspiration for your game.\nMonte Cook, the principal author, has been playing RPGs for 40 years, and working on them professionally for 30 years. The MCG team, all of whom will be contributing, are an extremely seasoned group with a combined total of over 250 years of RPG experience. But we wanted to get an even wider and diverse set of experiences and points of view in this book, so we\u2019ve recruited a team of folks that will provide feedback as well as their own contributions for the book. This dream team of consulting experts includes:\nEric Campbell\nMatt Colville\nLuke Crane\nStacy Dellorfano\nTanya DePass\nAjit George\nJennell Jaquays\nEloy Lasanta\nTom Lommel\nMatthew Mercer\nSusan J. Morris\nAlina Pete\nJohn Rogers\nMonica Valentinelli\n\nThe book will also feature comics and cartoons from: \nJohn Kovalic (Dork Tower)\nVickie Lee (Dungeons and Doggos)\nAviv Or (Up to Four Players)\nBrian Patterson (d20 Monkey)\nLen Peralta (Geek-a-Week)\nAlina Pete (Weregeek)\nStan! (10x10Toon)\n\n(Scroll down for more details on Your Best Game Ever)\nIn 2011, Monte created Numenera, and with it, a game system called the Cypher System. This game system has won awards and has been lauded by gamers everywhere as a wonderfully different way to play games of any genre. In 2015, we created the Cypher System Rulebook (CSR) to help gamers use the system for any type of game they wanted to play\u2014fantasy, science fiction, horror, superheroes, and so on. You can get a copy of that book in this Kickstarter campaign, but we\u2019re also Kickstarting a new version that will come out in 2019. The new version will incorporate lots of new options for players, but perhaps best of all it will take the concepts from Your Best Game Ever and apply them directly to the Cypher System. These two books will work hand-in-hand to create the best Cypher game ever!         \n(Scroll down for more details on the new Cypher System Rulebook)\nIf you're new to the Cypher System and are curious about how it works, you can download the free Cypher System Rules Primer for an idea of how the game plays.    \nNow that the Kickstarter has funded, our stretch goals will focus on the development of various genre-focused books that will take the concepts found in the new CSR and take them one step further, with specific examples. Each of these additional books will include an entirely new and original campaign setting as well as lots of material and advice for making your own in the realms of science fiction, fantasy, and more. \nYou\u2019ve read the effusive descriptions above. Is Your Best Game Ever really for everyone? More importantly, is it for you? Maybe it would be better to just show you what\u2019s in the book. Here\u2019s a brief listing of some of the topics we'll cover:         \n                                      Click here for a closer look!  \n\nOur goal with this book is to make every game your best game ever. But we know\u2013as GMs, players, and designers ourselves\u2013that every game and every experience is unique. What\u2019s the hardest struggle you have with creating great games, either as a player or as a GM? Looking for some GM or player advice? Let us know at this link. (Once the KS is complete and we\u2019ve started working on the book, we\u2019ll look through your comments to make sure the book covers players\u2019 biggest issues and concerns.)         \nWhen we were finishing the new Numenera books, Discovery and Destiny, one of the first things that playtesters asked us was, are you going to incorporate some of the cool new material in these books into the Cypher System?         \nA valid question. And it got me (Monte) really thinking about the Cypher System Rulebook as a whole. I didn\u2019t want to change the rules\u2014I love the Cypher System, and wouldn\u2019t touch the mechanics. But developing Numenera Discovery and Destiny showed me that there was a lot we could add in terms of player abilities and flexibility, and what the CSR really needs is flexibility. The idea that you can create any campaign in any genre is fundamental to the whole idea. And I realized we could take some steps to push that idea a lot further.\nSo we\u2019re Kickstarting a brand new, revised 416-page Cypher System Rulebook. Before I go any further, though, let me say right now, if you\u2019ve got the existing Cypher System Rulebook and you\u2019re happy with it, great! These new ideas don\u2019t change the way the rules work. You still roll a d20, you\u2019ve still got difficulties 1\u23bc10, you\u2019ve still got characters with descriptors, types, and foci. NPCs have levels. PCs use effort to decrease the difficulty. Everything is still fully compatible with everything Cypher-related that we\u2019ve ever published. You\u2019ll be able to play a game with half the characters from the original CSR and half from the new CSR all at the table at the same time. The difference isn\u2019t in how the game is played, but in the choices players get to create and run their characters.         \nWhat I\u2019m most excited about are the ways I\u2019ve thought about over the last few years to make things more customizable so that you could even more easily use these rules in any setting. To that end, in this book we\u2019re dramatically streamlining the chapter on character focus, so that you can customize your character\u2019s focus to perfectly match the setting and your character concept. So if you\u2019re making a starship pilot, a superhero, or an occult investigator, you don\u2019t choose the one that fits best from a list of foci\u2014you take your character concept and tailor your focus so that it really fits what you want to do.\nBased on player feedback, we\u2019re also making what we call subtle cyphers\u2014cyphers that aren\u2019t tied to a specific object\u2014the default for all genres, and we\u2019ll be including way more of them. (You\u2019ll still be able to have cyphers as objects too.) This will make applying the concept of cyphers, which is obviously core to the system, easy no matter what kind of game you\u2019re playing.         \nAnd of course, there\u2019s all those new additions from Numenera Discovery and Destiny that add a lot of new options that just make the game better. They\u2019re not really changes, they\u2019re additions\u2014new character abilities, more choices, player intrusions in addition to GM intrusions, and more. These will all be incorporated into the new CSR. And let me say again, it\u2019s still all entirely compatible with existing Cypher System material, whether it be from the CSR or one of our settings like Gods of the Fall, Predation, or Unmasked (and of course, Numenera and The Strange).\nFurther, we\u2019ll also be incorporating suggestions from Your Best Game Ever directly into this book. So, for example, Your Best Game Ever will talk about creating character arcs to enhance play, while the specific material for creating Cypher System character arcs as a mechanic will be included in this book.\nLastly, we\u2019ll include even more genres you can use, in addition to fantasy, horror, and so on. We\u2019re going to break science fiction into hard sci-fi and space opera/science fantasy, and we\u2019ll add coverage for romance, historical gaming, and more!

Your pledge is a down payment for an order to be placed, at a retail-friendly discount, when Your Best Game Ever and the revised Cypher System Rulebook are ready to ship. You can choose as many copies as you like of the books individually. You\u2019ll pay for your order (less your $80 deposit) at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. In addition to those books, you get a free deluxe Your Best Game Ever PoP kit. MCG covers domestic US shipping.\nYou might be wondering, \u201cHow do I select an add-on?\u201d It\u2019s easy. Select the Manage Your Pledge button on the right-hand side of the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge for the amount listed for the add-on. For example, if you want Early Playtest Access, add $100 to your pledge. It\u2019s that easy. After the campaign closes, we\u2019ll be using a service called Backerkit to collect your information, and at that time you can specify the add-on that you\u2019ve already paid for.  \nWhy does Monte Cook Games use Kickstarter to fund so many of its projects? In a word, you. You're reading this right now on Kickstarter because you're an invested game fan interested in what's new and innovative in gaming\u2014and thus you're exactly who we write our products for. If MCG were a company that made its way by publishing just another adventure or just another sourcebook every few months, we would have a hard time justifying Kickstarter. But that isn't our passion. Our passion is innovation and creation, but that requires up-front capital and\u2014probably even more importantly\u2014a test of the audience to determine if our ideas meet people's needs and wants. Kickstarter provides us with that. In turn, it puts us in a position to reward those early adopters with great deals, early access, and transparency. We think it's a win-win for everyone. But we use traditional sales channels as well, so if you'd like to check out some of our other products, like Numenera, The Strange, or Invisible Sun, you can go to our online store or visit your favorite local game retailer.         \nSoon after the Your Best Game Ever Kickstarter campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add anything that you might have missed.         \nWhile we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience.\nHere\u2019s how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email to check your MCG Shop account, which will be updated with coupons that let you redeem your rewards for free through our online store. You decide when to use the coupon, at which time we'll ask you to provide or update your shipping address. If you have multiple rewards coming, you may delay redemption of your rewards to bundle them together into one shipment to save on shipping costs. We guarantee a product will be in stock for you as one of your rewards for at least one year after the product's release date. This applies to all methods of shipping described below.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING We offer USPS basic shipping within the United States for free. If you\u2019re super-eager to get your rewards, you can upgrade to a higher shipping class, but you\u2019ll be charged accordingly at the time of fulfillment.\nSHIPPING WITHIN THE UNITED KINGDOM, EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, AND NEW ZEALAND Your reward will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. The cost of shipping is not included in your pledge\u2014it will be an additional charge for you. However, it will be much less expensive than paying for shipping from the US to you.\nThe UK shipping center ships to the following countries: Austria, Australia, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is not included in your pledge. (Backers in the UK, Europe, Australia, or New Zealand: please refer to the previous section, above.)\nInternational shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. If you\u2019re an international backer and have questions about shipping rates, we recommend you visit the USPS website to get an estimate. Please also be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you have multiple items coming as rewards, you can mitigate shipping costs by waiting to have several of them shipped together. We guarantee that each reward will be available for a minimum period of one year from its official release date.\nTo ease the burden of international shipping costs, we subsidize all non-UK/Europe international customer orders and backer reward fulfillment orders with a $10 discount. You\u2019ll pay the shipping costs at the time of fulfillment, minus the $10 discount, which is automagically (and invisibly) applied through the inner workings of the MCG Shop (you won\u2019t see the discount reflected on your order, but it is applied to all international orders outside of the UK/Europe). In other words, if the cost to ship the parcel to you is $62 USD, you\u2019ll pay $52 USD. The $10 shipping discount is applied once per parcel, not per item.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the twelfth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

Her first and most prominent work, Color Problems: A Practical Manual for the Lay Student of Color, first published in 1901, provides a comprehensive overview of the main ideas of color theory at the time, as well as her wildly original and artistic approaches to color analysis and interaction. Through a 21st century lens, she appears to stumble upon midcentury design and minimalism decades prior to those movements. \nShe was a visionary color theorist whose methods were later adopted by men and became ubiquitous in design curriculums around the world. She was an incredible artist and creative champion whose pioneering work is conspicuously absent in nearly all history books. We aim to change that with this new presentation of her seminal work. In addition to presenting the original book in an accessible softcover, we are offering a beautifully bound hardcover edition exclusive to this Kickstarter campaign. This deluxe facsimile version will not be made available again.\nEmily Noyes Vanderpoel at home (courtesy Litchfield Historical Society)\nHer remarkable inventiveness shines in a series of gridded squares, each 10 x 10, that analyze the proportions of color derived from actual objects, many of which were in Vanderpoel's vast collection of ceramics and antiques. She leaves her process relatively mysterious but what is clear, as historian and science blogger John Ptak\u202fnotes, is that Vanderpoel \u201csought not so much to analyze the components of color itself, but rather to quantify the overall interpretative effect of color on the imagination\u201d. Her square format predates Josef Albers\u2019\u202ficonic Homage to the Square\u202fby some fifty years.\nA Selection of Color Analysis Plates\nThis incredible book has long languished in antiquarian book markets.  Original copies trade hands for more than $500 and it has never received its proper audience. \u202fWe aim to change that, and with this new edition have taken meticulous measures to reproduce the original artifact at an affordable price. Largely disserved by the public domain, this vast 400 page book has been reproduced in recent years by shoddy print-on-demand services, from academically held PDFs and most tragically, only in black and white. Working with the Historical Society that Emily Noyes Vanderpoel helped establish, we are the first to invest the time, money, and love it takes to replicate this brilliant collection of color studies accurately. Using the most current digital methods and archival printing production, we aim to finally do justice to Vanderpoel\u2019s forgotten legacy as visionary and pioneer.\nWe will also be contributing an introduction written by design scholar Alan P. Bruton, who has been researching Vanderpoel and her work for decades. This introduction will serve to reflect on her incredible body of work from the vantage point of 21st century art history and women's movements, helping to illustrate that Vanderpoel remains one of the most important, underrated, and contemporarily relevant artists of her time and of the last century.\n\"Thoroughly conversant with the best scientific research of her day, Emily Noyes Vanderpoel brings an artist\u2019s eye and designer\u2019s sensibility to her prescient study of color. From embroidery and Persian rugs to ceramics and painting, her perceptive analysis reveals what was long hiding in plain sight. The remarkable illustrations are actually works of art that not only anticipate but actually compete with the best work of some of the most important twentieth-century artists.\"\nMark C. Taylor\nColumbia University\n\"Vanderpoel\u2019s delightfully inscrutable work is an artifact from out of time: abstract modernism born of the Victorian need to classify everything\u2014even the mundane. This book inspired me, and deserves this beautiful new treatment in print.\"\nLiza Daly  Author and creator of the Vanderbot \n\"This re-edition of Emily Noyes Vanderpoel's 1901 Color Problems is a fantastic addition to the library of literature that celebrates the wonders of visual experience. The writing is elegant, the information profound. How can we resist a book that opens with an exegesis on various elements of color in nature and on bird songs and Beethoven and declares \"We may aptly term color the music of light\"? The book is both a celebration and a lucid guide: to issues of luminosity and color temperature, and of harmony as well as contrast. And it is a compact dynamo of the history of color theory up to the time of Vanderpoel's writing. The many color plates are magnificent, both in the pleasures they provide and the magic they demonstrate; I feel safe in saying that Josef Albers would have been gobsmacked by this glorious volume.\"\nNicholas Fox Weber\nThe Josef and Anni Albers Foundation\nIn order to produce the beautiful objects you will receive as a backer at such an accessible price we need funds for printing and binding a large run. We aim to print at least 1000 copies, and our goal reflects the production costs for this amount, but the more pledges we get here the more we can print! As an established (although relatively young) publishing company we already have storage and distribution methods streamlined which will make for a seamless experience for our backers. \nWe also plan to spread the word of Vanderpoel's forgotten work as far and wide as we can. We need your help in righting this historical wrong. Tell your friends about Emily Noyes Vanderpoel! They will no doubt be as happy to discover her and her work as we have been. \nPDF - Each backer will receive a download of our high resolution color corrected PDF of the book.

Like the original, the text portion of our edition is printed on a soft uncoated natural stock. The 116 color plates are printed on a bright white coated paper stock to best display colors. The interiors will be offset printed with close attention to color reproduction. The book includes sewn signatures for long term durability and lay flat binding for ease of viewing.

It has never been published and almost disappeared from history after the war, but we are now restoring the pages of one of the most important documents of WW2. \nThe original 112 pages contained thorough information about everything from tidal forces to typical battle tactics and had the absolute highest security stamp during WW2: Top Secret Bigot - above Top Secret.\nIt described the German defenses and typical strongpoints, the risk of chemical attacks and was so thorough it even had an analysis of the soil type on Utah and Omaha Beach.\nThe book will contain a one-to-one copy of the original Monograph, new historical context and rare photos to explore. \nin total app 250 pages in hardcover including the original Monograph, added historical context and rare photos.\nWe will restore every single page from 1944 to its original look as it was presented in the Neptune Monograph. \nThe original Monograph will run on the right page throughout the book. Here you get a rare insight into the depth of the incredible intelligence work and literally cast your eyes on the same pages, that the allied command got in their hand for the first time six weeks before D-Day.\nOriginally the left pages were blank. Here commanders could add their notes and latest updates. We have decided to use this space to give a deeper understanding of the Monograph and add historical context and rare photos on the left pages of the book to explore and get the full picture of how the information was collected.\nThe Neptune Monograph was split into nine sections giving a deep and rare insight into the situation in Normandy six weeks before D-Day. All nine chapters will be in the book. \nThe Monograph has more than 14 pages of charts, maps, and graphics showing predicted German troop movements, tidal charts, and graphics of the layout of typical German strongpoints in Normandy as well as charts of the naval threat from warships and mines. The maps, charts, and folios will be restored and be in the book in full color.\nStretch goals are set up to allow us to expand the book into a package complete with full-size maps and a very rare addendum. This is quite expensive, but we would love to add it to the Neptune Monograph (see below for more information about our stretch goals, and how you can help expand the scope of the project).\nHenrik Elling has worked for more than 15 years teaching history and as an Editor in Chief at Scandinavia's best selling history- and science magazines.

In her spare time, she is a talented artist with a special love for painting collages and creating posters.\nThis document is a unique testimonial and insight into the risks, challenges, and fears the allied force faced before the invasion as well as a testimonial to the incredible work by allied intelligence units before D-Day. \nIt was compiled - with extreme risk - by commandos, naval intelligence, French resistance groups, air surveillance and weather and astronomical experts. \nToday only a few full copies exist worldwide and by reproducing this book we preserve one of World War 2s most important historical documents and make it available for a broader audience for the first time since it was finished in April 1944 and in time for the 75th anniversary in 2019. \nLean back and enjoy your copy of one of the most unique World War 2 books ever made delivered in time for Christmas.

We got the helicopter away from CENTRAL with a dozen or so survivors, our Chief Scientist included - although naturally he spent the entire flight complaining that we'd rescued his lab assistants instead of his research notes.\nThat's where the good news ends, I'm afraid. The political situation is continuing to worsen - NORAD is reporting something with Soviet transponder codes buzzing the Eastern Seaboard, but I know for a fact the Soviets don't have any jets in the area. If we let the aliens run around unopposed for much longer we're going start seeing mushroom clouds on the horizon...\nWe'll have ATLAS Base online by the end of the day. In the meantime, you need to figure out a strategy for rebuilding our organisation, bringing the political situation under control and defeating a vastly superior foe that we know almost nothing about. Best get started, eh? There's coffee in the pot.\nXENONAUTS-2 is a turn-based \"strategic planetary defense simulator\" that puts you in charge of a clandestine military force attempting to protect the planet from extraterrestrial invasion. It is the sequel to the acclaimed Xenonauts, successfully Kickstarted way back in 2012!\nWe are building a hugely complex strategy / tactics game that gives you total control of your organisation all the way from the command staff in your base down to the troops on the battlefield. The formula will be familiar to anyone who has played the classic X-Com games from the 90's (or the modern reboots), but Xenonauts-2 expands those foundations to create something deeper and more distinctive!\nThe action takes place in the modern day - but in an alternative timeline where decades of alien interference has prevented the end of the Cold War, leaving NATO and the Soviet Union teetering on the brink of a catastrophic nuclear war. Can you hold humanity together long enough to end the alien threat forever?\nXenonauts-2 is not a chronological sequel to the first Xenonauts but rather an updated portrayal of similar events. The game is in development on Windows PC and is expected to launch on Steam & GOG in late 2018; we will hopefully natively support Linux and Mac on release but cannot yet offer a firm promise of this (please see the FAQ for further details).\nWe've been developing Xenonauts-2 for three years now and the game is in an advanced state. If you want to check out how things are progressing, you can download a free demo of a single tactical combat mission at the link below. Bear in mind this is still an alpha; expect it to improve a lot before release!\nAh, Commander - so good of you to finally make an appearance. I will refrain from commenting on the (pathetic) attempts of Military Division to defend my laboratory, as I was still able to collect sufficient data during the extraterrestrial attack to validate my theories.\nThe aliens are indeed using a form of matter translocation to deploy their forces. Although I hardly expect you to understand the science, I have now devised a method of tracking the quantum waveform deformation caused by this process to within a ten mile radius.\nOne would hope that providing this organisation with the exact time and location of these alien incursions would be sufficient to allow our soldiers to finally begin collecting the samples and specimens I need to proceed with my work on ENDGAME ... but my experience thus far has taught me to expect otherwise.\nThe Geoscape is where you control the Xenonaut campaign against the extraterrestrial invaders. Alien UFOs and ground teams will conduct hostile operations all across the globe, threatening your funding regions and bringing the world ever closer to nuclear war - that is, unless you stop them!\nYour interceptor squadrons can challenge UFOs in the skies and the soldiers stationed at your base can respond to ground missions, but they cannot be everywhere at once. You will need to choose your missions carefully, maintaining control of the strategic situation whilst also ensuring you recover enough of the alien technology and materials to advance the cause.\nThe alien forces will grow steadily stronger as the invasion progresses, but so too will you. You will gradually learn more about your opponents and develop exotic new weapons, equipment and aircraft to aid you in the fight ... but can you hold out long enough to complete ENDGAME? Or will the Xenonauts see Earth consumed by nuclear flame?\nThe soldiers at your command on the Geoscape are persistent staff who gain combat experience and skills in battle - assuming they live long enough! As well as being deployed to deal with ground missions as part of your strike team, your soldiers can now also be deployed into funding regions as Field Agents.\nField Agents give you a way to influence regions directly - increasing your Relations, rooting out alien infiltrators, covering your organisations' tracks, etc. This is vital work, but it is a highly dangerous occupation in a world riven by paranoia - even before the aliens start getting involved!\nThe Geoscape has been significantly expanded since the first game with the intention of giving the player more choices to make and offering them more freedom. Field Agents are just one example of this - if you're interested, there is more detail on the other changes here!\nThe US built ATLAS back in the sixties as part of Project Iceworm. They didn't bother telling the pesky locals - after all, they might have objected to housing American nukes on their soil. Needless to say, ATLAS was abandoned in a hurry less than a decade later and its existence remains classified at the highest level.\nThat's all rather convenient for us - it's much easier to borrow something if nobody knows it exists. I had a backup command room and a cache of emergency supplies installed a while back, but unfortunately there's no getting around the fact that our new home is a derelict missile silo full of 60s-era junk. Expect fixing her up to take some time.\nIn the meantime, I hope you're fine with cold showers, cold food and... well, cold everything.\nThe loss of CENTRAL Base leaves the Xenonauts operating out of an abandoned missile silo in a remote area of Iceland - but you will need to reclaim and rebuild ATLAS if you are to create a global organisation capable of defeating the alien menace!\nATLAS is where you house the soldiers, scientists and engineers that serve your organisation. Each of your staff can serve in a variety of roles dependent on what structure they are assigned to - e.g. a scientist becomes a researcher in a Lab, and a doctor in a Medical Room.\nThe simulation of your base is deeper than the first game - not only are you juggling living space and working space for your staff, but power capacity, storage space, food consumption and much more. Fresh supplies and new staff are flown to ATLAS by your helicopter, but this prevents it from deploying combat troops - so time your supply runs carefully!\nATLAS is also where your research and development efforts occur. Your scientists study recovered alien technology and draw up designs for all kinds of battlefield equipment for your engineers to build - assuming you've built the facilities and recovered the alien materials they need to do so!\nThe tech tree is much wider and more varied than in the original game. We're adding new types of \"development\" research that improve and upgrade existing equipment (keeping it relevant for longer), working hard to make the different tiers of gear more distinct from one another, and generally trying to add more \"game-changing\" items that keep the combat feeling fresh and novel throughout the campaign!\nIf you're interested, you can read more details about the changes to ATLAS Base and the new Research mechanics on our forums.\nIf our resident brainboxes really do have a way to track the ETs ... well, we might just be able to turn this war around. The tiltrotor can land our troops almost anywhere they want, but we've never had enough intel to locate the aliens before they vanish back to wherever they came from.\nI don't much rate our chances against the assault team that hit CENTRAL this morning, so we should keep a relatively low profile until we've figured out a way to even the odds ... or at least until we've built some defenses that that might help us survive an attack on ATLAS.\nThe aliens must have some soft targets we can take advantage of - I suggest we lay an ambush and try to bring something back for Research Division. At least then we might find out what we're dealing with...\nDeploying a team of soldiers against the aliens on the Geoscape begins a turn-based tactical battle where you are given direct control of your soldiers and tasked with achieving the mission objectives - which could be anything from capturing a downed UFO to capturing (or eliminating) a troublesome VIP!\nThese missions are a deep and challenging tactical experience. We have retained the Time Unit system from the first game that gives you a huge amount of freedom in how you choose to interact with the battlefield (virtually all of which is destructible). We're giving the player even more tactical possibilities this time around - for instance, even the hulls of crashed UFOs can now be breached using the right equipment!\nThe effectiveness of your soldiers depends heavily on what you equip them with - and there is an expanded variety of different weapons and equipment to pick from. You will need to choose your loadout to suit the mission at hand - clearing the confined spaces of an alien base may call for heavy armor and shotguns, but you may find sniper rifles more valuable if a crashed UFO has come down in an open desert!\nAll of these battles are dynamically generated based on the strategic situation - e.g. if you shoot down a Scout UFO in an Arctic region, you'll be presented with a ground mission where you can attempt to capture a downed Scout UFO in a polar environment!\nThere are a wide variety of missions and environments for you to experience as you wage your global war against the aliens, all rendered in a high-fidelity 3D recreation of the classic isometric visual style. We are focused on minimizing map and mission repetition in order to maximise replayability - we want this to be a game you can pick up and play for years to come!\nThe alien species you face on the battlefield are deadly foes that each pose a different set of tactical challenges. We are working to imbue them with more character for the sequel, giving the returning faces a visual upgrade and updating their combat mechanics to ensure they feel unique!\nIf you are interested in reading more about the changes we have planned for the ground combat, you can do so here.\n We can't risk dealing with funding regions directly, Commander - too many infiltrators. We rely on a network of individuals willing to 'misplace' things in the name of the cause ... a few crates of supplies, the odd helicopter, maybe a few million dollars here and there.\nThere's risks, of course - mostly revolving around getting murdered by aliens - but someone has to do it. Each individual person plays only a small role, but everything we do relies on their collective support. Our backers are just as much a part of this war as we are.\nWe're a small team working on a really big idea - and we need your help! \nSo far we have been able to fund the development of Xenonauts-2 from the sales of the first Xenonauts, but we simply don't have enough money to include everything we want in the game. Instead of trying to raise money from publishers, we're turning to the people who have always supported us when we needed it most - our fans!\nRaising additional funds would allow us the breathing space we need to properly polish the game up before release. Some of this will be spent on adding cool new features and neat little touches to the game, but we'll also use it to ensure there is an extended period of community playtesting that will allow us to iron out countless balance issues, bugs and usability problems.\nThe \u00a335+ tiers allow you to put a custom soldier in the game with your name, nationality and a unique face generated from our portrait editor!\nYou can see all the cool rewards available to backers to the right of this page. As well as getting access to the game on Steam or DRM-free on GOG, higher tiers give players digital copies of the soundtrack and access to our closed beta.\nThose willing to back at \u00a335 or above can put a custom soldier in the game with their own name, nationality and a unique portrait created from our free Portrait Generator tool (see FAQ for full details). This soldier will appear in your starting squad every game!\nBacking our highest tiers gets you a custom portrait hand-painted from a photo by our portrait artist!\nThose willing to back at the highest tiers can have a custom portrait painted from a photo by our portrait artist. You can see an example of the results above, painted from a still in our Kickstarter video!\nAs we're asking for your help to add extra features to the game, we thought we should let you choose the order of the stretch goals! \nFor the first week of this Kickstarter, we will be running a vote to set the order of the stretch goals, with the most popular features becoming the first stretch goals!\n\u00a350,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #1 (unlocked by hitting our funding goal!)\n\u00a375,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #2\n\u00a3100,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #3\n\u00a3150,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #4\n\u00a3200,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #5\n\u00a3250,000 - Stretch Goal Choice #6\nThese are the features that you'll be able to vote for - click the link if you're interested in more detail on what each one involves!\nMARS Weapon Platform & Sentry Guns\nModular Weapons\nLocational Injuries\nOrchestral Soundtrack Recording\nAdditional Xenonauts-2: Community Edition / Modding Support\nReaper Hives\nWeather Conditions\nGeoscape Situations\nThese are all features we'd like to experiment with, so we may implement some of them even if they don't make it as a stretch goals - this vote is just to let us know the ideas you think are most exciting!\n\"We had a bad day at the office today, folks. Let's all take a moment to thank the big man up in the sky for watching over us. You know who I'm talking about ... SKYRANGER's got your back!\" \n- Removed from ATLAS noticeboard\nThanks for taking the time to check out our Kickstarter!

This is a turbulent time, with bandits lurking in the wilds of the countryside, and pirates roaming the high seas. Evil taints the hearts of men, and many give in to temptation. Many, but not all. Against this tide of corruption stands Solomon Kane. This mortal hero fights his lone crusade, aided by the silent might of the immortal Virtues. Together they fight against the implacable Darkness. This is the fearless opponent who tries to thwart our hero at every turn, and who must be overcome by the players if Solomon Kane is to emerge victorious.\nDarkness has emissaries too, and these Shadows are also attracted by Solomon Kane\u2019s faith. Shadows are not physical beings \u2013 they are the essence of the nameless horror that hides just out of sight, the lurking danger you think you glimpse from the corner of your eye, or the secret dread that sends shivers down your spine. This can drive lesser men to madness, and even Solomon Kane could be overwhelmed, for whilst his faith is strong, Darkness is powerful too. Solomon Kane can see neither Virtue nor Shadow, yet he can feel both, and he has his faith. This tells him that Good must triumph over Evil. It is up to the Virtues to ensure that he is right.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\u201cSolomon Kane\u2026 considered himself the fulfiller of God\u2019s judgment, a vessel of wrath to be emptied upon the souls of the unrighteous.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe central figure in the game is Solomon Kane himself. He is a dour English Puritan and redresser of wrongs who roams the world, fighting against the ungodly and evil works of men and foul magic alike. He follows no master save his conscience, though that alone drives him to the ends of the Earth to fulfil his quest. All his life he has travelled, aiding the weak and fighting oppression. From the bleak moors of England, through the damp forests of Germany, to the sweltering jungles and savannahs of Africa \u2013 even to the shores of the distant New World of America.\nSpace Marine (Warhammer 40K), Warrior (Rising Sun), Vampire (Solomon Kane), Conan (Conan), Solomon Kane (Solomon Kane), Leonidas (Mythic Battles), Bandit (Solomon Kane), Khorne Warrior and Stormcast Eternals (Shadespire)\nHe neither knows nor questions why he is driven to do this. It simply must be done. To Solomon Kane, he is doing God\u2019s work. To his enemies he is a relentless fury, armed with flintlock and rapier, and armoured in unshakeable faith. The knowledge of the rightness of his cause makes him unstoppable, and gives him the ability to overcome any fiend or demon. At least, it does when the Virtues are on his side.\n\u201cHow I overcame it, I know not, for the battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell.\u201d\n- Robert E. Howard\nThe Solomon Kane core box comes with 4 complete Adventures: one each in 1 Act, two in 2 Acts, and one in 3 Acts. These stories are the Rattle of Bones, Skulls in the Stars, Death's Black Riders, and the Blue Flame of Vengeance - all based on original tales from Robert E Howard. We unlocked three 1 Act original stories, the Witchfinder General, L'Ogre and Beast of Bordeaux. With 10 Chapters per Act, this gives you 110 Chapters to explore, about 60 hours to play these stories once, and many, many hours of replay value.\nWe have many stretch goals planned for this Kickstarter campaign, adding new miniatures, Adventures, and other surprises. All stretch goals that we unlock during this campaign will be added FREE to every Puritan pledge, and every additional copy of the core box you pledge for.\nSOCIAL STRETCH GOALS\nThe Puritan Pledge contains many, many hours of game play, and stretch goals add even more. However, if you\u2019re enjoying Solomon Kane we will be revealing some additional content during the campaign that you may want to add to your pledge. If you\u2019re interested in purchasing any add-on, just click the Manage your Pledge button at the top of this page, and increase your current pledge amount by the amount of the extra items that you\u2019d like to add. Kickstarter doesn\u2019t let you specify what you want at this stage, so we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed. The system we use for this is called a Pledge Manager, and all backers will be sent a link to this after the Kickstarter campaign closes.\n(To find more about All-in bundles, click here)\nRED SHADOWS\nTHE ART BOOK OF SOLOMON\nThe Right Hand of Doom\n(To find more about this expansion, click here)\nHEART OF AFRICA\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAGAINST THE VAMPIRES\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nAMERICA - THE NEW WORLD\n(To find more about this add-on, click here)\n (To find more about this add-on, click here)\nEach player takes the part of one of the four Cardinal Virtues: Courage, Prudence, Temperance, and Justice, each with a special combination of abilities that reflect their unique role. Together they must help Solomon Kane achieve his mission.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nCourage\nCourage is bold and sometimes reckless. She cannot sit idly by, and encourages Solomon to resolve everything with action! Her specialities are Moving and Fighting.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nPrudence\nPrudence tries to keep an eye on everything. She helps the other Virtues as well as Solomon, providing vital support to both.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nJustice\nJustice is willing to listen to both sides. She is fair and balanced, and is expert at finding a solution that benefits everyone. Her areas of skill are Talking and Influencing a situation for the better.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nTemperance\nTemperance keeps a sharp eye and a clear head. She encourages Solomon to keep his wits about him, and be aware of what is going on around him. Her speciality is exploring the environment, and avoiding nasty surprises.\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n\"The battle was hard and long, but the powers of good and light were on my side, which are mightier than the powers of Hell. \"\n Allied Mortals\nSolomon Kane is a loner, and only begrudgingly accepts the aid of others in his quest. However, when others need his aid he is quick to come to their assistance, and this means that his Adventures against the Darkness sometimes include companions. \nN'Longa is not included in the Core Box. But you will see him soon!\nN'Longa and Solomon Kane, blood brothers\n Solomon Kane\u2019s only regular companion is N\u2019longa \u2013 a self-styled \u201cmighty worker of nameless magic\u201d. Despite their significant differences in outlook, they get along perfectly, saving each other from death on more than one occasion. It is hard to say which one of them relies more on the other. \nJack is a hot-headed, somewhat naive, but well-meaning young man, whose main goal is to protect Mary and her honour. He falls in with Solomon Kane when the Puritan comes to his rescue.\nMary is the archetypical damsel in distress. If Jack can't save her, then Solomon Kane will always be ready to protect any innocent in peril.  \nThe wrong place at the wrong time, that\u2019s the best way to describe the unfortunate traveller. He really should have waited for daylight to cross that moor\u2026\nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\n Darkness is the natural opponent of Light. It is a combination of all the secret, unsavoury feelings and deeds which men are capable of. It lurks in the blackness, moulding the essence of the night into its minions, and sending them to plague the mortal world.\nShadows  \nMiniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted\nThe main servants of Darkness are the mist-like Shadows. They are not really creatures at all, more embodiments of a terrifying idea. One that can drive mortals to insanity and death.\nMortals  \nThrough his many Adventures, Solomon Kane encounters a wide variety of misguided, malevolent, or just plain evil individuals who all do Darkness\u2019 bidding \u2013 whether they realise it or not. These range from simple thugs, through cannibal tribesmen, to otherworldly and magical creatures. Solomon Kane must overcome them all.    \nSolomon Kane and Jack Hollinster ready to confront Fishhawk and his pirates\n Latest Rules Playthrough - The Blue Flame of Vengeance - 3rd July\nPlease note that components and rules used in this video are not final and are subject to change.\nSolomon Kane\u2019s lifelong fight against Darkness is told in a series of Adventures, based on the stories and characters created by Robert E. Howard. Adventures are broken down into 1-5 Acts, depending on their length. Each Act is itself broken down into 8-10 Chapters. A gaming session will typically be a single Act, or part of one. Depending on the time you have available, you may play through a whole Act, or be able to complete only a few of its Chapters. If this is the case, you simply use the game\u2019s save function to remember where you have got to, and you can return to complete the rest of the Adventure another day.\nChapter 1 - \"Skulls in the stars\"\nWhen you play through an Act, you naturally start with the first Chapter. One player reads the narrative text aloud and follows the instructions on the card. The players then do their best to help Solomon Kane overcome whatever challenges the Chapter throws his way, and then they move onto the next one.\nEach Virtue Turn, the controlling player rolls their Fate dice to see what resources they have available to pay for actions. These dice can be donated to other players, or saved for later Turns, as well as buying actions immediately, and deciding how to coordinate these actions and share these resources between the players is a big part of the game. Solomon Kane takes the concept of cooperation very much to heart, and the players need to be discussing and working together throughout the game. Even when it is not your Turn you are involved in vital decisions.\nAllocating dice during your turn\nAfter each player\u2019s Virtue Turn comes a Darkness Turn. This is where the AI deck acts to thwart the players and destroy Solomon Kane. It can move its minions on the board, trigger unpleasant events, or simply sap the will of the mortals to carry on.\nThe Act continues with the players resolving one Chapter card after another, with their Adventure unfolding as they do. After many trials and obstacles, a final Chapter card will tell the players whether their actions have been enough to achieve victory, and whether they have won or lost. Solomon Kane is a pure co-op game, and players either all win together, or all lose together.\nCARDS\nSolomon Kane uses a number of different card types to tell the stories. These are:  \nChapter Cards  \nThese tell the steps in the story. Each Chapter number has a number of different options represented by different cards, some easier to complete, some near-impossible. This is a little bit like going through a choose-your-own adventure book, but instead of simply picking what you want to do, the players have to achieve a particular effect with their actions to decide what happens next. \n(To find more about Chapters, click here)\nChapter cards come in two main types: Story and Scene. A Story Chapter contains the next piece of the tale to read aloud. A Scene Chapter contains the map layout, miniatures, and objectives to play it out on the board.\nDarkness Cards \nThe Darkness deck is what drives the player\u2019s opponent. Each card is divided into several sections, each applying in a different circumstance. This allows the AI to be flexible and to react differently to each situation. Using them is simple: just flip the top card of the deck at the start of each Darkness Turn and do what it says.    \nEvent Cards  \nWhen a Shadow triggers an Event, the next card in this deck is revealed. This is usually bad, though not always. Occasionally the Light shines through the Darkness and a brief reprieve is granted to Solomon Kane and his companions.   \nVirtue Cards\nEach Virtue has their own unique 10-card deck of Virtue cards. These cards list the possible actions for that Virtue, together with the cost in Fate dice to perform each one. In principle, any Virtue can do any action, though only some of the actions will be available at any one time. During the game, players must carefully manage their decks, ensuring that their active cards give them the most useful range of options for the task at hand, and work well alongside those of their companions.\nDiscovery Cards  \nThere are many secrets in Solomon Kane, and whilst the Adventures are based on Robert E. Howard\u2019s tales, they have been greatly expanded. Where Solomon chose one path in the original works he now has a choice. That is, the players collectively have a choice to decide, by their actions, which path to take. Discovery cards hide many of the possible outcomes from the players, and keep the elements of tension and surprise: you must decide before you know for sure what will happen next. This means that even if you have played the Adventure before, there will be fresh elements each time. \n(To find more about Discovery cards, click here)\nMAP TILES\n Each Scene Chapter has a map, made up of 1 or more of the many double-sided tiles from the box. Maps vary in size and shape, each offering a unique puzzle for the players to unpick. \nFATE DICE\n Each Turn, a player rolls 3 Fate Dice to see what energies are available. The fate dice show Bravery, Determination, Fear, Pain, and (of course) Faith.\nEach of the Virtue cards has a number of slots for these resources, and the action on that card can be bought by filling those slots with matching results on the Fate dice. The ability to save some rolled dice for future Turns, and donate much-needed resources to other players makes for a lively discussion. What is the best thing to do?  \nDASHBOARDS\nVirtues\nEach player has a dashboard for the Virtue they are playing. These are all different. They include unique actions, effects of the Virtue\u2019s aura, and spaces for reserved and donated dice.  \nCourage Virtue dashboard with attached Virtue cards\nAdventure track\nThere are four game values that are tracked throughout the game. Three of these are measures of Solomon Kane\u2019s abilities: Strength, Clarity, and Compassion. Each of these is linked to a specific type of test: Strength to Fighting, Clarity to Exploring, and Compassion to Talking. As the game progresses, these tracks may rise and fall. In addition, there is a fourth track: Danger. This monitors the overall Danger of the situation. The more it rises, the more perilous the situation gets.\nEach of the Virtues is linked to one of these tracks. Their actions will often draw upon it, and in the process can lower or increase its value. However, these tracks apply to every Virtue. Even if it is Courage who is most tied to the Strength track, all Fight tests triggered by any Virtue will apply its modifier to them. So, whilst each Virtue looks after its own track, their management of it will impact every player, requiring them to work together.\nMINIATURES\nSame scale, different sizes!\nSolomon Kane includes a huge selection of beautiful 35mm scale miniatures, ranging from the man himself, through dastardly foes and innocent bystanders, to the towering Virtues who aid him. Although nominally 35mm (the height of an average man), the miniatures are all different sizes depending on the individual they represent. This gives us a range from 27mm tall children to the 90mm tall Virtues. Each miniature is a carefully-sculpted masterpiece, full of character. To further enhance this, and to give the painters among our backers even more to enjoy, each sculpt also has its own unique scenic base.\nEach model has its own unique scenic base!\n KANE'S CRUSADE\nThe Mythic Games Ambassador Programme has over 30 Ambassadors across six countries who tirelessly share out games with board game communities. We have already hosted over 60 events and demonstrations while also attending major conventions such as Cannes and UKGE. We have over 50 more events planned already which you can find listed on our Facebook page including attending Paris est Ludique, Origins, Gen Con and Essen SPIEL.\nSeveral hundred public demos organised for Kane's Crusade\nSolomon Kane is a simple fellow, and to reflect this we have only a single core pledge level: the Puritan.\nHowever, we also believe in rewarding our most loyal fans, and those who believe in us the most. For this reason, backers who pledge for Solomon Kane in the first 24 hours have the option of a Puritan pledge with an extra Early Bird bonus!   \nIf you are a board game retailer and are interested in Solomon Kane, please click here. \nPour d\u00e9couvrir cette page en fran\u00e7ais, cliquez ici\nAll pledge levels are available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language you prefer in the pledge manager, after the campaign. This campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations.

Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect your address information via our pledge manager, after the campaign ends. The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard core pledge of Solomon Kane. This is based on the costs for our last campaign and the assumption that the final weight will be comparable. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose. If the game is significantly lighter than Joan of Arc, then some of the higher end costs may drop.  \n\nUSA: $32\nCANADA: $35\nEUROPE (EU): $32-$40\nEUROPE (non-EU): $40-$65\nLATIN AMERICA: $100-$150\nOCEANIA: $40 to Australia. $80 to New-Zealand\nASIA: $40-$70\nREST OF THE WORLD (including French overseas territories - DOM TOM): $100-$150\nOur fulfilment process aims to be as fair as possible. For this reason, rewards are sent to all backers (including any retail backers) at the same time. Due to the unpredictability of the postal services we cannot guarantee the order in which they arrive.  \n\n\nThis is the latest Mythic Games team photo we could find.

Producing thousands of complex products and coordinating their delivery to homes across the planet is a complex business, and there are many things which could go wrong. This is why we build in as much time for the unforeseen as possible. We want to ensure that we have the space to deal with any unexpected setbacks and still get your game to you before the estimated delivery date. \n\nTo give you a frame of reference for exactly when you will get your game, Mythic Battles: Pantheon began delivery earlier than originally planned, and Time of Legends: Joan of Arc is currently on schedule to hit its planned date. We are confident that Solomon Kane will deliver on time too. \n\nThat brings us to communications: we think they are very important. During this campaign we will post at least one update every day. Afterwards, we will continue to keep you regularly updated with all the latest info in our famous weekly \u201cWhat\u2019s up Wednesday\u201d updates. This means that you\u2019ll always know what\u2019s going on in the adventurous world of Solomon Kane!\n\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe have a no-questions-asked refund policy. \n\nAll pledges can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign. In addition, if any part of your order cannot be delivered, then we will reimburse you the full cost of this component regardless of the date. \n\nIf you apply for a refund more that 14 days after the end of the Kickstarter then we will only be able to refund 85% of it. The difference is the amount of the unrecoverable fees paid to process your order.\n\nOnce we have started to process and pack your order, refunds will no longer be available. \n\nRefunds within the first 14 days are reversed via Stripe to the credit card you used to pledge originally. Any refunds requested after the 14 day period may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe or your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will also be in USD.\n\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented in this Kickstarter project.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and that outside countries specifically listed as being \u201cfriendly\u201d (above) you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Road, MTB, CX, Gravel, E-bikes. One universal, we all suffer flats. A dependable and user-friendly pump is the most critical piece of equipment a cyclist can carry.\nIntroducing The Stompump, foot pump.\nFlat tires happen. The Stompump is the first compact, foot actuated inflator. The Stompump stows neatly on your bike, your car, motorcycle, or backpack. This is why we've created the Stompump, so you can easily and safely inflate a flat tire. No need to fiddle with Co2 inflators or unreliable and clumsy frame pumps.\nThe Stompump mounted to bottle-cage bosses using the Frame Dock\nThe Stompump will come complete will all accessories pictured\nStompump has a maximum pressure of 90 PSI\nStompump Weights & Dimensions\nDo you Need a Stompump?\nEvery cyclist will experience a flat tire. Traditional hand pumps, CO2 inflators, and mini pumps are cumbersome, require a lot of strength and energy to use, and most importantly do not work well. The Stompump can inflate a tire 3 times faster than a hand-pump, using far less energy. It\u2019s also not as risky as a Co2 inflator, or as challenging as a mini pump. Do you want to struggle with 'the get-it-perfect or you\u2019re stuck' scenario with a Co2 cartridge?\nThe Stompump will inflate a 29er MTB tire 3 times faster than a hand pump\nThe Stompump was born 2 years ago after a miserable experience on the side of the road in a freezing rainstorm fighting a mini-pump for 20 minutes to fix a flat. We needed a solution. Since that time, we have spent countless hours perfecting a pump for all types of cyclists.\nMany cyclists are using higher volume tires, from mountain bikes and fat bikes to gravel-road bikes and even traditional road bikes. The higher volume/larger tires means better ride quality, traction and efficiency. With these larger tires comes the need for a pump that is optimized for pumping more air per compression. This is where The Stompump excels! The Stompump also works with many other inflation applications.\nStompump Mounted with the Frame Dock on a Gravel Grinder bike.\nThe Stompump is a great tool for all areas of your life.\nInflating a Fat-Bike tire 3 times faster than a handpump.\nThe Stompump includes some features that most portable pumps do not. We've incorporated a cylindrical storage compartment, 22.2mm x 53mm. very handy for a patch kit or any thing else of similar size. We've also engineered an air filter for the intake. This keeps The Stompump's internals clean of dirt and debris and working smoothly.\nThe integrated Storage Compartment: you can put anything you want in here. Pictured with tubeless repair Plugs.\nThe integrated Air Filter, keeps the incoming air clean and your Stompump working smoothly\nThe Stompump is completely serviceable as well as rebuildable and repairable. We've built this pump to never need any significant service, but should you need to it's simple to disassemble and clean.\nEasy to disassemble for servicing should you ever need to\nThe Stompump is Compatible with both Presta and Schrader valve stems.\nIf we reach our funding goal early we'll open up a Reward that enables your choice of colored hoses!\nThe Creators of The Stompump have been the brains behind bringing hundreds of products to market over the last 30 years. Most recently we launched the Bar Fly brand of products. We've designed and manufactured OEM Products for companies like Cycliq, Cervelo, Specialized, Sigma and more. Not to mention the work we do with other companies like the Longnow Foundation, and Universal Sonar Mount. We\u2019ve spent our lives innovating and creating things that make our lives easier! We've compiled much of the IP that's gone into The Stompump through our hobby as Battlebots competitors, winning 7 championship \"nuts\" over several weight classes.\nBronco, the latest in a long line of our Battlebots, winning against Stinger\nMedia Coverage\nReason Bradley & Woody Tate", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Stompump Patron", "descp": "Pledge anywhere from $5 to $5000, you'll get updates, our eternal gratitude, AND a Stompump sticker!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Colored Hose", "descp": "1 Hose for Stompump.

We aim to create a highly unique collection of board games for an international audience using high-quality design and production standards.\nGamebook is not like most books\u2014it\u2019s interactive. People have been playing games for all of recorded history, and there is evidence to indicate we played them before recorded history, too. We believe that games have always been an important tool for human social interaction, and Gamebook is designed to encourage this. Each game included in the Gamebook has multiple variations requiring different strategies and approaches, making each game yours to play and explore in your own unique way.\nGamebook is a collection of ancient abstract strategy board games: Surakarta, Tablut, Pachisi, Alquerque, Mu Torere, Senet, Nine Men\u2019s Morris and Stern-halma.\nWe have searched the rich history of board games for untold stories. Gamebook contains eight abstract strategy board games, carefully selected from the rich world gaming heritage. Gamebook encompasses history, theory and practice of selected board games.\nAssemble four boards of the Gamebook to create a new board game specially designed and developed for this edition!\nWho is Gamebook for?\nGamebook contains board games ranging from two to six players. The board games were chosen based on their difficulty, from basic board games to ones requiring more complex strategies. Gamebook is appropriate for many different ages, so don't worry about who you invite to game night! :)\nOn the left side Hana and on the right side Ema Jesih are playing board game Alquerque.\nAesthetics and Design\nAll selected games are re-designed to a unified graphic language, built of basic geometrical forms by a limited range of colours. Each game has been refined to include only the essential elements necessary for gameplay, and each game board is treated as abstract art based on the textures of different drawing materials.\nMagic Binding\nGamebook features two innovative designs - the box for game pieces is also the book's backbone that holds the pages together with simple and very effective magnetic binding. Every page is simply plucked out when you want to play, and put back in; you can arrange the book as you like.\nFigures, sticks and a dice\nGamebook includes everything you need to start playing any of the board games. The backbone of the book contains a concealed department for all small figures, six two-sided sticks and a dice. Before the invention of dice, most board games were played with sticks, stones or cowrie shells. The flat side of the stick is the \u201cheads up\u201d side. Different combinations give different scores, giving a totally different dynamic to certain games.\nBooklet of History and Rules\nWhere did board games come from? How did our ancestors play board games? Which abstract strategy board games concepts have spread around the world? The answers to these questions can be found in the booklet of History & Rules. The booklet is included on the back page of the book. You can pluck it out and read it separately so it won\u2019t disturb the game flow of the game you're playing.\nRewards\nStretch goals\nGamebook trilogy\nResearch about board games has revealed a whole new world. The history of board games is full of mysteries, myths and secrets. We have created a collection of forgotten board game classics. These games are the foundation of so many modern board games. We have chosen eight board games for the first edition of Gamebook, but we would love to continue our investigation and search for lost board games around the world. There are so many more games to find, explore, study and publish. We want to make a Gamebook collection \u2014 possibly a Gamebook trilogy.\nHibird Books\nOur goal is to establish our own publish company called Hibird Books. Our vision is to publish extraordinary books and to connect unseen combinations of media and materials. Hibird Books main interests are special editions, interactive books, book-objects and artist\u2019s books. Help us bring our Gamebook project to life and many more unusual books will follow. Only time will tell where the path will end. Join us! Back us up. :)\nBook Specification\nBook dimensions: 32 x 28 x 2,2 cm (12.6\"x11\"x0.86\") \nGame boards dimensions: 28 x 28 cm (11\"x11\") \nWeight: 1,2 kg (2.64 Ibs)\nMaking Gamebook prototypes\nPLAY\n\nGamebook is mostly handcrafted. We have made several prototypes to find the best materials and a suitable shape for the book. Almost the entire book is made using recycled materials. The core of the pages and box are cardboard, and we used recycled paper for the pages and for the History & Rules booklet. The figures and dice are made of wood. The rest is a secret! If you are interested in the story of Gamebook\u2019s creation, especially the making of Gamebook prototypes you can follow us (Hibird Books) on Instagram or Facebook.\nPeople behind the project \n Founders:\nHana Jesih (founder of Gamebook) is a book designer & illustrator who loves to make mind-maps, travel and is taller than Peter. You can see her other book design projects on her website or you can take a look at her gallery space on her Instagram page.\nPeter Plantan (cofounder of Gamebook) is an architect who hates and loves everything at the same time and is a fan of Anthony Bourdain. You can get to know his world view on his Instagram page.\nVideo Credits:\nNejc Gazvoda is a film director and writer. He was in charge of the script and directing the video. He wanted to use slider in the video, we made his wish come true.\nMarko Pirc takes credit for photography and shooting the presentation video. His favourite sandwich is chips with sausage and chips on the top.\nVoice over: Michael Manske\nSong: \"Jadranje\", from the original soundtrack for the film \"Pot v raj\" composed by Andi Koglot and Laren Polic Zdravi\u010d.\nSpecial thanks to NEJC GAZVODA, friend no.1. Big thanks to STA\u0160 STANKOVI\u010c and MARKO PIRC from LUMULABS for all advices. They also let us work on the presentation in their office and lent us their equipment and gadgets. MARU\u0160A HREN for all her tips and help with bookbinding, MILENA JAKOVLJEVI\u010c from MEDIODROM for tips in mediamarketing, JURE TURK for IT support, NIKO KLAN\u0160EK for business support, GREGA PLANTAN for legal advice, SAMO KRALJ for producing wooden playing sticks, IVO VESELI\u010c for his own versions of texts and our FAMILY for moral support and food. Thanks also to all other friends who helped us in any kind of way. ;)\nTimetable\nWe have spent the last year researching board game history and designing and testing our Gamebook. All aspects of our designs have been thoroughly considered at each stage of the product creation process, from concept design, materials and technical aspects to numerous prototypes. It\u2019s been a wonderful journey, and now we\u2019re almost ready for the manufacturing stage. Only with the help of Kickstarter and, most importantly, our backers will we finally be able to bring our Gamebook project to life. If you know any friends, family, colleagues or random strangers who may be interested in our project, please help us spread the word! You can expect to receive your order by November 2018.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDuring the process of making the Gamebook prototypes, we collaborated with different print shops and book manufacturers. On a technical level, the pages and binding, even though they are innovative, shouldn't present any major manufacturing difficulties. The final look and materials may change a little bit in the production process, but only to improve the durability and sustainability of the product. The main task will be to manufacture a box for figures and dice that satisfies the level of craftsmanship we stand for. Considering all the facts, we believe that everything is possible if you stand by your goals and believe in your product. We believe in ours. We will try to keep the process as simple as possible.

Lost in thought, you remember the first time you came across a Spanish Galleon. Few of you managed to escape that mess with your lives, but that marked the moment when you began forging your destiny as a pirate. Now, your reputation precedes you wherever you go, instilling fear among your enemies. Nothing will get in your way of becoming the most infamous pirate to ever sail the high seas\u2026\nMake your own destiny and become the terror of the seas in Skull Tales: Full Sail!\nSkull Tales: Full Sail! is a pirate adventures board game with miniatures. Set sail on the Southern Lady and explore the beautiful Caribbean sea, ripe with fearsome enemies and amazing treasures. Fame and fortune await you!\nChoose among twelve starting characters, each one with its own unique miniature, to be used on the different boards as you play through the game. Find all the information you need to start playing on their character sheets.\nIn Skull Tales: Full Sail! You\u2019ll be able to play individual scenarios or embark upon an immersive campaign that threads several different scenarios together into one captivating storyline.\nSkull Tales, created by David Illescas, is a semi-cooperative game for 1-5 players aged 14 and up. The approximate playing time in Campaign Mode is between 60-90 minutes for one scenario and about 150 minutes for a complete chapter (Voyage, Adventure and Port). The game also includes 52 miniatures - not counting stretch goals!\nDuring the Voyage Phase, which simulates being on a pirate ship, we\u2019ll be managing the crew that makes up our ship while we explore the map on the way towards our objective...or objectives! But, the Captain might have a hidden agenda that he/she is keeping from the rest of the crew\u2026\nThroughout this phase, characters will take on different jobs: steering the ship, managing boarding actions, cleaning up, or even fighting sea creatures. The idea is to gain the confidence of the crew, which will depend on where you place your character and how good he/she is at dealing with all the dangerous events you\u2019ll be facing together. The Captain will be able to assign different tasks to the crewmembers, but watch out - the other pirates can conspire against him/her!\nUnfortunately, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of things that can negatively affect crew's morale: hunger, losing battles, unexpected events, etc. If morale suffers too much, another pirate can organize a mutiny to take over the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges\u2026\nCharacters will earn Trust Points as they carry out duties on the ship, and these points will turn into Prestige Points once the Voyage phase comes to an end. This way, your pirate will start to gain a fearsome reputation!\nIn the Adventure Phase you\u2019ll explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, and abandoned temples. You\u2019ll also have the chance to pillage colonial villas and find legendary objects. However, there are frightening creatures and challenging enemies to face along the way.\nThe Adventure map develops as terrain tiles appear randomly according to the specifications of the scenario, making each game different!\nOn the Adventure board you\u2019ll be able to see how much time you have left to carry out the mission, as well as the current danger level\u2026\nEnemies have cards that outline their characteristics and a corresponding miniature. Also, every opponent you face will have a behavior or AI that generates reactions at unpredictable times, making each adventure a challenge.\nIn the Port Phase your character can acquire new abilities and equipment by interacting with the residents of Tortuga Island and visiting its different locations. But be careful, this place hides secrets that can make a pirate\u2019s fate take a turn for the worst.\nEach player will have time units they\u2019ll use to carry out actions, while making sure they are ready to go when the ship sets sail: heal wounds, learn abilities, make bets, listen out for rumors, equip and improve the ship, etc. Each location has an Event Deck, and there are also independent decks for Rumors and Captain Assignments.\nThe following list has everything initially included in the base game, not counting components that may have been unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe base game box also comes with a quick-start 10 chapter campaign (Campaign I) and a couple of special scenarios.\nThe new Skull Tales miniatures have been completely remodeled and will be made with a high quality plastic that is flexible, easy to paint, and allows for more clearly detailed figures. We have already started testing and the results are spectacular.\nThe scale of the miniatures is approximately 30-32mm up to the eye-line and not including the base.\n (Images courtesy from Icue)\nPIRATE contest! (Unlocked): Share videos, photos or audio files of your family and friends with a pirate theme. If we get 200 interactions, between Twitter & Facebook, we will include a sliding chest box to store our booty (80x80x50mm) for all the backers of the game.

They were strong, muscular women with a height that surpassed our tallest men. They seemed taken by some strange trance, as their rage was supernatural\u2026 The true Amazonians arrive, whose legend gave name to one of the most famous rivers in the world. These warrior princesses are willing to fight to the last woman, and woe the man who stands in their way! 6 Amazonian miniatures with enemy card.\n$438000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New cards for the incident deck, adding 4 new dangers to our adventures.\n$445000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): We are changing four small tile designs into two large tile designs to give scenarios more variety. This double-sided tile is like the Village tiles in that it is 4 times bigger than the smaller ones.\n$460000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): New Enemy: Stranglers (4 miniatures). We came ashore in the midst of a frightful fog \u2013 you could barely see your hand in front of your face. The vast mounds of seaweed were beyond anything natural, suggesting that the tide in this area was stronger and pulled any marine life from the depths of the sea onto the beaches. When the seaweed began to move, I felt as though someone was strangling me to death. Fear overcame me, especially when I saw our pistols did little damage against the shapes covered in seaweed. Another enemy comes to join the rest of the abominations. On this occasion, we\u2019re releasing 4 Strangler miniatures and their enemy card.\n$467000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards (2 models). You won\u2019t believe the beauty that I found on the last galley captured by the Brotherhood\u2026 Our market keeps on receiving new merchandise to equip your pirates with the best against their enemies. 2 x Light Blunderbuss: able to fire at adjacent enemies, but with a shorter range than pistols. 2 x Poison Vials: choose a melee weapon at the beginning of the adventure. That weapon inflicts an additional wound.\n$487000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Tarantula Anansi (Giant miniature). And Anansi came from the shadows, wrapping that pirate up in a cocoon of silk, making quick work of the poor lad\u2026 The powerful tarantula Anansi has arrived to Skull Tales: Full Sail! the Caribbean will never be safe with the presence of this supernatural beast. This time, we\u2019re adding an enemy that brings new game mechanics with enemies that take up four spaces. The Tarantula Anansi is represented by a miniature the size of 4 spaces, and comes with her corresponding enemy card.\n$494000 (Unlocked, Base Game): 5 Port Events. The chapel was quieter than usual, the silence falling over the silhouettes as they brought their offerings. This didn\u2019t feel right\u2026 Five new events to add variety to the Port Phase.\n$509000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Campaign V complete. The Brotherhood has received what at first was thought to be a Royal order. After the initial refusal to carry it out, it has become an ultimatum. They have been accused of being behind a series of supernatural events that is reducing the free labor population in the colonies and negatively affecting profits from the slave trade. Either the Brotherhood takes charge of solving this mystery, or the British Empire will bring down all its might upon Tortuga Isle. The only clue that we have involves the appearance, however strange, of huge amounts of spider webs after each event\u2026\n$516000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): 4 Equipment Cards. You have asked us on many occasions and our armorer has listened\u2026we\u2019re adding one more copy of the Net, Hook, Bandoleer, and Shovel cards.\n$530000 (Unlocked, Free Expansion): Character: Swordsman.  \"He spent years searching for his mother\u2019s assassin. But, although he is a master fencer, his sanity is fading away, and he now spends most of his day accusing anyone who crosses his path: \u201cYou killed my mother... prepare to die!\"\nWe\u2019re going to add 6 Final Boss designs to the enemy cards. Each boss will have its own personalized characteristics with different behaviors and abilities. Tlanchana, the queen of the mermaids; Oggum, herald of Yemay\u00e1; Charles Vane, Captain of the Black Sails; and Anansi, the avatar tarantula. We kept rummaging through our last treasure chest and we\u2019ve found a pack of more than 5 cards that are being added to the ones already unlocked.

Doing this day in and day out causes serious damage. \nSuperStraps is a beautifully engineered, minimalist gadget you can retrofit on your favorite everyday backpack to\u2026\nInstantly relieve shoulder, back and neck tension when your bag gets heavy \nMake your backpack actually feel lighter \nConvert it to an ergonomic carry so you can walk with great posture\nIt\u2019s important because 80% of us have or will have back and neck pain in our lives, and when you\u2019re in pain it stops you from doing what you love.

This is great for you and maybe bad for our significant others. We sweat every detail and are obsessed with delivering you something that will make you wanna break into a slow clap. We run a tight ship and run conservative on what we promise. We've delivered over 35,000 crowdfunded products on time and love bringing our backers along for every part of the journey. Expect updates with pics and manufacturing challenges we are overcoming over the next few months before SuperStraps hits your favorite backpack. \n\nWhere we are now:\nWe have spent the last year and a half engineering SuperStraps and extensively testing over 6 rounds of machined prototypes. We've been working days and nights with manufacturers over the past 4 months and have fully set up our supply chain.\n\nWhere we are heading:\nThe biggest challenge we face in this project is tooling. It takes about 6 weeks to make the molds we need and then we begin the process of refinement. We won't stop until it's perfect and we've padded our timeline to account for multiple rounds of tweaking. We just can't know for sure how long it will take to reach perfection. We will have Josh, our lead Industrial Designer and modern-day MacGyevor, to thank when we've cleared this hurdle. \n\nWe've had over 900 SuperStraps Ambassadors help us refine various designs on SuperStraps, but we want to get your input too. Throughout the campaign, we will be sending surveys (totally optional to participate in) to collect your feedback and bright ideas during the manufacturing process.\n\nWe are so excited to embark on this epic journey with you, building the world's first backpack booster.
