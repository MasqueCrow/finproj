I've been traveling and photographing some of the best restaurants around this amazing country for the past 10+ years.

I have a publisher in place and my goal is to get as many copies of the book out as I can, to inspire people to always support the American Restaurant. \nThe book will be approximately 180 pages and 12.2 x 10.2 inches in landscape format, hardcover and ready to ship next summer. It's going to be a gorgeous collection of color and black & white photographs that you'll be proud to have in your home.\nCheck out https://americanrestaurantbook.com/ for more information and images, also my instagram page http://instagram.com/danielkrieger for more of my photography. \nAll the reward options that include a print, would be a print of your choice.\nThank you!\nBrennan & Carr - Brooklyn, NY\nLe Bernardin - New York City\nKrekel's Custard - Springfield, IL\nThe Varsity - Atlanta, GA\nStroud's Oak Ridge Manor - Kansas City, MO\nLanger's Deli - Los Angeles, CA\nPeter Luger Steakhouse - Brooklyn, NY\nTeo's Hot Dogs - Pittsfield, MA\nTasty Dip - Heflin, AL\nMatt's Bar & Grill - Minneapolis, MN\nDefonte's - Brooklyn, NY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith my publisher in place and the book layout almost complete, my main challenge will be getting this project to go a bit viral so we can get the Kickstarter funded.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Daniel Krieger\nFirst created \u00b7 6 backed\nDaniel Krieger is a professional photographer who has been freelancing for the New York Times for the past 10 years.

Ashley Connor (who is one of the best cinematographers in the biz) shot Ada on s16mm film!  The footage looks beautiful and the cut is something I'm really proud of!  I can't stop using exclamation points because I'm that excited.  I just picture locked, which means I finished the edit.  But there's still a lot left to do.  And we need some good old-fashioned money to get it done!  The money raised on this project will go directly to help finish this film.  \nBecause Ada is basically a silent film, I'm working with Brian Mcomber who will compose a score for the film.  And we'll work with a sound engineer to interweave the music and the audio from what we shot to bring this film to completion.  \nWe are also working with Goldcrest in NYC to color grade the final edit.  This means they are matching all the clips of the film to make sure the color from shot to shot is equal in saturation so the film feels cohesive and looks STELLAR.  \nOnce we have the color correction done and the music is composed and placed, we can start submitting Ada to film festivals both nationally and internationally.  \nMuch love, \nEleanore\nPREVIOUS WORK\n   GRACIAS\n   SCREEN\n   1+1 = COCOON\nAWARDS\nAs an actor, Eleanore has garnered many awards in the independent film world.\n2013 - Indie Memphis - Special Jury Award for Outstanding Performance, See You Next Tuesday  \n2015 - Sidewalk Film Festival - Clint Howard Character Actor Award, 7 CHINESE BROTHERS\n2017 - SXSW - Special Jury Prize for Best Ensemble Acting, A Bad Idea Gone Wrong\nREVIEWS and INTERVIEWS\n10 UNDERRATED FEMALE PERFORMANCES OF 2014 - ROGEREBERT.COM\nON CREATING WITH SUNITA MANI AND TALLIE MEDEL AS COCOON CENTRAL DANCE TEAM - HUFFINGTON POST\nALL THE WORLD'S A STAGE - FRANK 151\nBIOS\nASHLEY CONNOR (cinematographer) is a New York based director of photography. Her work on Josephine Decker's BUTTER ON THE LATCH and THOU WAST MILD AND LOVELY, which both premiered at the 2014 Berlin Film Festival, prompted New Yorker film critic Richard Brody to name her alongside Darius Khonji and Fabrice Aragno, as one of the year's best cinematographers. Her breadth of style can be seen in work as diverse as Dustin Guy Defa's PERSON TO PERSON (Sundance '17) and Adam Leon's TRAMPS (TIFF '16), as well as in popular music videos for artists including Jenny Lewis, Angel Olsen and Mykki Blanco. Most recently Connor lensed Desiree Akhavan's second feature THE MISEDUCATION OF CAMERON POST starring Chloe Moretz.\nBRIAN McOMBER (composer) is a drummer and composer based on the east coast of the United States. His formal education and laboratory research work in the biological sciences deeply influenced his approach towards music composition, which emphasizes experimentation, improvisation and collaboration. In the past, he has worked with an array of artists and acts including Alarm Will Sound, Bjork, David Byrne, Dirty Projectors (whom he toured with extensively from 2006-2012), Doudou N'Diaye Rose, Juana Molina, Mira Calix, The Roots, and St. Vincent. Since shifting his main focus to film scoring in 2013 McOmber has gone on to write music for narrative and documentary films that have premiered at festivals such as Cannes, Sundance, Berlin, Rotterdam, Venice, Tribeca, New Directors/New Films and SXSW.\nRACHEL WOLTHER (producer/guardian angel) is a director and producer.  She became the go-to producer in the New York independent film scene back in 2012, producing films such as Josephine Decker's Thou Wast Mild and Lovely, Nathan Silver's Stinking Heaven, Drew Tobia's See You Next Tuesday, and most recently, Sarah Salovaara's TV series Let Me Die a Nun which is nominated for a Gotham Award this year.  She has seamlessly moved into directing, collaborating as a team of two with Alex H. Fischer.  They have been touring the film festival circuit with their film Snowy Bing Bongs.  The duo was named 25 New Faces Of Independent Cinema by Filmmaker magazine.  Wolther and Fischer are currently writing a feature film. \nELEANORE PIENTA (director/writer/editor) is an actor, video-artist, dancer and director.

Melt, freeze or bake your favorite food or candy to create some yummy, spinny fun!\n    After you make a Lickety Spin with your favorite hard candy, use your imagination and give other food and candy a try. Here are some of our favorites: Jolly Ranchers, Life Savers, Werther's Original, Hershey Kisses, Starbursts, and string cheese...yes cheese. We've also baked a chocolate chip cookie and froze Fruit Punch Gatorade in the mold. The possibilities are endless!\nSubscribe to our YouTube channel for weekly episodes of \"Will it Spin?\" as we explore other fun ideas throughout the campaign. \n    Lickety Spin is the brainchild of Lexi and her Uncle Timmy. It was just a regular day at Lexi\u2019s house hanging out with her Uncle Timmy when she showed him how she made her own candy fidget spinner by making a spinner-shaped impression in molding compound, filling it with candy and following it up with a quick trip to the microwave.\nLexi held up her super sweet spinner and Uncle Timmy was, understandably, impressed. And kinda hungry.\nTogether, they started talking about how to bring this kind of yummy fun to kids (and grownups with a sweet tooth) everywhere. Now Lickety Spin is here!\n    Lexi is a 4th grader living in Denver, CO. She loves her stuffed animals, playing piano and skiing with her parents. Lexi is a dinosaur enthusiast and hopes to work with animals someday. When not making candy fidget spinners, she\u2019s usually chasing her three dogs around the house or playing Minecraft.\nHer uncle Tim Swindle is a creator of the smash hit, Utter Nonsense, a board game that launched right here on Kickstarter and now has two editions sold at every Target in America. Tim lives in Chicago with his fianc\u00e9e Puja. He believes in good ideas and the power of having fun to bring people together.\n    Once we reach our funding goals and Kickstarter ends, Lickety Spin will be available in 3 different exciting colors \u2013 red, green and blue!\nIn order to make the candy spin, we had our engineers create our own, custom finger pads with an integrated axle to ensure optimum spinning!\n             ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBringing a product from the drawing board to reality is not an easy task.

Problems like a cursed dating app or industrial espionage conducted by ghosts. As often is the case with consultants, he does unpleasant work for unpleasant people.\nHardboiled Magic is a genre bender, blending contemporary fantasy, horror and hardboiled detective fiction. Think The Night Stalker by way of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Art Buchwald.  \nThe first sequence of these stories was Kickstarted 6 months ago under the title \u201cLegal Termination of a Warlock\u2026 and Other Tales.\u201d (You can get a print compilation of the first 8 stories in the series as a reward.) It\u2019s time for a new round and it\u2019s slightly different this time.  \nIn order to open up Hardboiled Magic to a wider audience, I\u2019d like to start making the stories available at MagicDetective.com two months AFTER crowdfunding backers get the stories. Go over there and read a few stories.  \nThe idea here is to produce a monthly short form contemporary fantasy/horror series. Long short stories or short novelettes, depending on your definition and the individual piece. It\u2019s like getting your issue of Batman or Amazing Spider-Man each month, except it's prose and a complete story (as opposed to being a chapter in a larger serial).  \nThe theme for the next cycle of stories is \u201cMemes From Hell.\u201d Each story will be inspired by or satire of a well-known Internet meme. Here\u2019s the story lineup. (Subject to change if a better idea pops up)  \n Red Hair Instead of a Soul\nIt seemed like the only people in Miller\u2019s Glen not dying were the redheads. Why was hair color part of a killing profile and who had blood on their hands? Mister Lewis must crack a riddle of demographic proportions if he wants to get out of town alive.  \nThe Ghost of Joseph Ducreux\nThis time, the painting captured the subject\u2019s spirit \u2013 literally. Now that he\u2019s finally free of captivity, the Ghost of Joseph Ducreux is offering unsolicited advice to all comers. Can Mister Lewis help Ducreux move on to eternal rest\u2026 or at least get him to shut up?  \n 2 Succubi 1 Cup \nThe CEO of a pharmaceutical company is having vivid dreams of strange women competing for his affections, requiring building of a very special cup. Mister Lewis must stop the dreams from becoming a living nightmare as a demonic feud threatens to create an unholy Grail  \nShit Necromancers Say \nThe Slang Slinger website has a problem. Their user generated scheme to get free content worked too well and they unwittingly published the trade jargon of a particular dark sect of magicians. Can Mister Lewis soothe ruffled feather if the feathers have been reanimated and thirst for living flesh?  \nDelete Your Karma\nWhat if you could clear out your Karma like deleting a social media account? An executive tried and it didn\u2019t go well. Mister Lewis has been contracted to balance the wheel before too many things are crushed underneath as karma, like nature, abhors a vacuum.  \nTransmigrate And Chill\nWhen a curse is placed on a dating app, love connections are still being made, but matches trigger a body swap. Mister Lewis must fix the bug in the system before the divorce courts need to sort out who was inhabiting the groom at the time of the marriage and legal liability is assigned.  \n  Stuff Dead People Like\nThe museum\u2019s new exhibit was getting a lot of new visitors. Unfortunately, they were paying visitors. The new exhibit was attracting ghosts. Mister Lewis must figure out what dead people like or the museum will be stuck with a secondary instillation of a mass haunting.  \n  Leave Cthulhu Alone\nA video has gone viral of deranged man begging the world to leave Cthulhu alone. Could the social media spotlight wake a sleeping god? Mister Lewis must stop Internet trolls from bringing about the apocalypse. \nHow would I be receiving these stories?\nWith a download code for a .PDF or .ePub file. You\u2019ll get them 2 months ahead of them going on the website and a month ahead of major eBook sites like Amazon, Barnes & Noble and Kobo. \nWhat's the timing on this?\nThe stories should start shortly after Kickstarter gives me the all-clear in late November.  I'd like to have the book shipped in December, but sometimes the holiday printing queue gets backed up, so it's possible that will be January.\nWhat are the Rewards?\n$16 \u2013 I Prefer Print A copy of Hardboiled Magic: The Children of Loki, the trade paperback book collecting the first 8 Hardboiled Magic Stories, including the initial 2 stories that weren't part of the first Kickstarter package. No digital here, just good old fashioned paper. \n$24 \u2013 Pure Digital: 8 Months of Stories\nEach month, you get a download code for a new story. \n$40 \u2013 The Combo: Print _and_ Digital\n8 months of new stories in digital and a print copy of Hardboiled Magic: The Children of Loki \n$50 \u2013 The Combo, Signed\n8 months of new stories in digital and a signed print copy of Hardboiled Magic: The Children of Loki\n$75 \u2013 Dignitary Signatory\nYou're a person of distinction and a patron of the arts.

Plus 8 months of new stories in digital and a signed print copy of Hardboiled Magic: The Children of Loki \n$2000 - Make It So\nNo mess, no fuss, I'll get back to writing and you'll get 8 months of new stories in digital and a signed print copy of Hardboiled Magic: The Children of Loki, and each month your name will appear on each story\u2019s dedication/patron page\nHave I done this writing thing before?\nI haven\u2019t missed a deadline on the first Kickstarter. I'm also a member of Mystery Writers of America, best known on the fiction side of things for writing a webcomic for the Chicago Tribune Media Group. Over on the journalism side, I was a contributing editor to one TIME's Top 25 Blogs of 2012 and written for Chicago Tribune, New York Resident, Publishers Weekly, Startup Grind, The Next Web, The Beat and Comic Book Resources. I get around a little. \nHow did you arrive at that number for the goal?\nI need to redirect time from other projects to adhere to a monthly schedule. It's not that big a deal to reallocate my time, but those student loan people want their money! So I'm essentially calculating that minimum as a percentage of my grad school loans. (Education being the gift that keeps on giving... you a bill each month.) ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nYou've seen the topics. You've seen the covers.

There you are, in a family gathering, and suddenly someone reveals a story about a cousin that you've never heard of before, and suddenly the table gets real quiet?\nSit, Eat and Chew \u4e94\u5473\u6742\u9648 is a dance performance about those kinds of amazing, conversation-stopping stories that were never intended to be public.\nMy Story\nI lived in Chinatown for ten years before I was priced out of the neighborhood. For me, Chinatown was, is, and will always be a mystical place. Years ago, when renovating my apartment, I found an urn of ashes, possible bullet holes, and hand painted wallpaper hidden behind layers of sheetrock. Across from my apartment, an ancient older man kept watch on a hallway lined with envelopes, and he would never tell me how all of this mail came to be there.\nThese kinds of unspoken narratives led me to create this project. Even though I am Chinese, and speak both Cantonese and Mandarin, Chinatown residents don\u2019t share private stories easily. To begin the work, I ran story-sharing workshops at several Chinatown Senior and Youth Centers, and also found other funny, outrageous, adventurous, and traumatic stories from talking to local residents, going through Chinatown archives, and eavesdropping on conversations in tea houses and local bakeries.\nThere is a Chinese proverb - W\u01d4 W\u00e8i Z\u00e1 Ch\u00e9n \u4e94\u5473\u6742\u9648 - that uses the five tastes of cooking (sour, sweet, bitter, spicy and salty) to describe the complex emotions in life\u2019s ups and downs. In Sit, Eat and Chew, this proverb connects to personal stories that have become the creative and emotional inspiration for dance theater performances in unusual local spots.  Small groups are guided in their explorations of the works as they\u2019re performed in five public and private locations throughout Chinatown.\n What are the next steps What have you done already for this project, and what still needs to be done? Where are you in the process? When/where will it premiere? \nThe story telling workshops are completed, and I\u2019ve started rehearsing with company dancers. I will also be incorporating local amateur dancers into the final project as we work towards its 2017 premiere: Oct 14 & 15, 21 & 22 (two weekends) at various locations in Chinatown including: a local hair salon, private apartment, public park, restaurant, and the Museum of Chinese in America.\nWhy is this important? What is the point of entry to this project for a global audience? What\u2019s the most important or exciting thing for them to connect with? \nStories featuring local experiences of Chinatown residents and performances incorporating professional and locals offer insights into a mix of public and private sites. By bringing together Chinese residents and engaging with non-Chinese spectators, this project aims to dissolve stereotypes, create bridges, and celebrate Chinese culture and histories. A creative archive of stories, social practice, and performance, I was moved to create Sit, Eat and Chew to re-connect with and support the community that so beautifully embraced me when I first arrived in NYC.\nPlus enjoy an \u201cinsider's\u201d perspective into Chinatown from a guided introduction to performances in unique, local sites.\nWe need your help! \nThere are 32 local seniors from Chinatown who will be participating in the performances as local community dancers in the project.\nThese seniors shared many stories of their life experiences with me, and they are very, very serious about their dance practice. Most of them never had opportunities to perform when they were younger, due to work or other difficulties, and they bring powerful gusto to their dancing. It\u2019s their way of celebrating life.\nI do not have the budget to pay them. Your contribution offers them a stipend for their time and energy.\nYour contribution will also help support lower cost tickets to local Chinatown residents, seniors, and students so they are fully incorporated into the project that is happening in their neighborhoods.\nSeveral local businesses and residents opened their doors to allow us to use their space for these unconventional experiences. Your contribution will help us pay them something in acknowledgement of their welcoming of this project and audiences into their spaces.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSit, Eat and Chew \u4e94\u5473\u6742\u9648 is an unconventional performance that is not possible to replicate in a theater, and for this reason, I am self-producing the work to be able to realize its unique potential to transform the Chinatown we think we know. The site and stories are equally important in bringing the project to life, and I have already overcome the challenges of connecting the work to private and public sites in Chinatown plus the involvement of the local community. This took an amazing amount of legwork and time spent getting to know people and explaining the work. Trust developed over time, and residents began to share their stories with me. Now the locals I've met are opening up their own spaces as sites for these \"pop-up\" performances with local stories. \n\nThis is a special opportunity to connect with the \"real\" Chinatown though the eyes of the people who live there. \n\nWhile a conventional performance space has large capacities for audiences. Sit, Eat and Chew \u4e94\u5473\u6742\u9648 aims to provide a more intimate experience for smaller groups of audience. To accommodate audiences, we will perform 12-16 times during the course of two weekends (3-4 performances each day) to be able to share the performances with the same amount of audience as in a regular theater setting. Having these additional performances also makes the production more costly. At the same time, we want to keep the price reasonable for general audiences, and also very affordable to local residents. Having locals there is also an important aspect to the work.\n\nEven with all this research and advance planning accomplished, there are always extra costs that can pop up (transportation, emergency purchases, etc). We know we have a good network of people interested in helping to support this unique project in Chinatown. We hope you will join us and help back this project to make it as successful as possible.\n\nThank you! \u8c22\u8c22\uff01\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Personal Tale or Recipe", "descp": "Receive a personal story or food recipe from the community participants.

Designed from the ground up, ELF is a new way to build affordable large-scale telescopes for exoplanetary research. Highly specialized to see exoplanets up to 120 trillion miles (24 light years) away from Earth, ELF is designed for detecting the energy signature of life or life\u2019s likely chemical fingerprints in the atmosphere from water (H\u2082O), oxygen (O), methane (CH\u2084), and ozone (O\u2083), or on the surface from photosynthetic biopigments. \nThe first target will be Proxima b. In only a few months after ELF is completed, we will know if there is life on this nearest exoplanet! We will also learn whether there are Earth-like planets around Alpha Centauri A and B and all other nearby stars within a few dozen light years from the Sun. We will learn if we have neighbors, small or big.\nAchieving this requires an innovative design that allows us to both reduce the cost and increase the targeted sensitivity by a factor of 10x, making ELF the most realistic plan to find and characterize life on nearby exoplanets. For an in-depth overview of the ExoLife Finder, scroll down to the section below titled, \"ExoLife Finder Telescope\".\nWhat will the $35k bw used for?\nThe $35,000 will be used to build a fully working prototype of our advanced metamaterial mirror that combines slumped telescope glass and 3D printed electroactive polymers. This is a crucial step in helping us build large mirrors that have an overall thickness of 2cm. For more information scroll down to the section titled \"NEW METAMATERIAL\".\nELF Proposed Location: Atacama Desert, Chile\nThe PLANETS Telescope\nCurrently being built atop Haleakala on Maui, the PLANETS Telescope is an essential step in the development of the ambitious ExoLife Finder Telescope. Earlier this year we launched a Kickstarter for the PLANETS Telescope and were met with incredible support from backers from all over the world who helped fund the polishing of the PLANETS Telescope secondary mirror. Now that the PLANETS Telescope is underway, it's time to start on the next evolution of our thin mirror technology with ELF.\nDr. Svetlana Berdyugina at the Maui HNu staging, testing, and polishing facility for precision optics.\n    Exclusively on Kickstarter September 5th, 2017 - October 8th, 2017\nCosmic Lights\nCreated by the PLANETS Foundation, Cosmic Lights are beautiful limited-edition LED science gifts featuring images of our ELF telescope, and some of the extreme examples of life found on Earth - lifeforms that might even exist under extreme exoplanetary conditions. They make the perfect addition to a nightstand, desk, office cubicle, or bookshelf. Each Cosmic Light comes with a remote control and can cycle between a variety of colors and modes.\nAll pledges come with a guaranteed delivery by December 25, 2017.\n  Voyager Message\nThe Voyager Golden Records are phonograph records that were included aboard both Voyager spacecraft launched in 1977. The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form, or for future humans, who may find them. Those records are considered as a sort of a time capsule.\n  Pioneer Plaque\nThe Pioneer plaques are a pair of gold-anodized aluminium plaques which were placed on board the 1972 Pioneer 10 and 1973 Pioneer 11 spacecraft, featuring a pictorial message, in case either Pioneer 10 or 11 is intercepted by extraterrestrial life. The plaques show the nude figures of a human male and female along with several symbols that are designed to provide information about the origin of the spacecraft.\n  Tardigrade\nTardigrades are adorable water-dwelling, eight-legged, segmented micro-animals also known as water bears, space bears, and moss piglets.  First discovered by the German zoologist Johann August Ephraim Goeze in 1773 they have been found everywhere: from mountain tops to the deep sea and mud volcanoes; from tropical rain forests to the Antarctic. They can literally survive the conditions of space.\n    Polychaete \nA Polychaete, also known as a bristle worm is a handsome water creature and class of annelid worms. Each body segment of a polychaete has a pair of fleshy protrusions called parapodia that bear many bristles, which is why they are sometimes referred to as bristle worms. Astonishingly, there are more than 10,000 species of bristle worms on Earth. They can also survive \u201cotherworldly\u201d environmental conditions.\n  Prototype Design\nVoyager Cosmic Clock\nDesigned specifically to commemorate the 40th Anniversary of the Voyager space mission, Voyager Cosmic Clock is a one-of-a-kind 24-hour clock which displays the Voyager 1 Space Probe and the distances of potentially habitable exoplanets within 24 light years of Earth.\n  ExoLife Finder \nThe ExoLife Finder Telescope is the world's first dedicated telescope capable of imaging, oceans, continents, and life on nearby exoplanets. Show your support by getting a limited edition scale model of the ExoLife Finder Telescope.\n  Both shirts were created specifically for this Kickstarter.\nT-Shirts      \nThese high-quality t-shirts are printed with dye sublimation, a  full color, full-coverage printing technique that creates a beautiful result. With dye sublimation, dye particles convert into gas \u2014 known as sublimation \u2014 where they bond to the polyester fibers.

With a total diameter of about 25meters (82 feet), ELF is large enough to begin a dedicated program of imaging dozens of exoplanets within 25 light years of Earth and will enable a new field of exoplanetary and exolife research.\n  Tensegrity Design\nThe overall design of ELF is very unique compared to other large-scale telescopes. To reduce the mass and weight of the telescope, we use a structural principle called tensegrity. This is the same reason bicycle wheels can support a huge amount of weight but are incredibly light and strong. Tensegrity utilizes tension and compression and is often used in bridge designs.\n  Independent Off-Axis Mirrors\nEach ELF mirror will have its own dedicated secondary mirror and will be \u201coff-axis\u201d. Off-Axis telescopes are often used in radio dish receivers but now, with modern fabrication technology, we can use them for optics. They are much better for our needs because they reduce the amount of scattered light that might interfere with the photons we get from the exoplanets. Exoplanets can be 1 million or even 1 billion times fainter than their host Star so it\u2019s important that we have a sensitive system.\n  Slumped Telescope Glass\nTypical telescope mirrors are many centimeters thick and take a long time to polish. We have been developing a new way to make very large telescope mirrors by taking thin, inexpensive, fire-polished window glass and slumping it in a specialized kiln that allows us to make very accurately shaped paraboloids. Surprisingly, the fire-polishing process to create typical window glass makes it incredibly smooth. When we combine this with electronic \"muscle\" Electroactive Polymers, we can create mirrors that are never abrasively polished that are orders of magnitude smoother and lighter-weight than traditional large scale telescope mirrors.\n\n3D Printed Electroactive Polymers\nWe are miniaturizing the actuators that perfect the paraboloidal mirror shape needed to separate the light of an exoplanet from its star. Electroactive Polymers, or EAP for short, are incredibly strong synthetic muscles. By 3D printing 1,000\u2019s of polymers on the back of the mirror we will be able to make incredibly small and accurate adjustments to the mirror to yield optical-quality off-axis paraboloids and to maintain their shape as the telescope environment changes. EAP's will be a great improvement over typical mirror actuators that are now sometimes used, because they will be much smaller and cheaper.\n  Algorithms/Software\nOur team lead by Dr. Svetlana Berdyugina and Dr. Jeff Kuhn have created a unique algorithm that will be able to image these exoplanets and see things like continents, oceans, and life. Assuming we are looking at exoplanets similar to Earth, we will see in their atmospheres molecules like water (H\u2082O), oxygen (O), methane (CH\u2084), carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), and ozone (O\u2083), and on the surfaces - colonies of photosynthetic organisms or even thermal waste from civilizations not much more advanced than humans.\n  $40,000 - Locked\nFunding goal will be unlocked once we reach $35,000.\n$35,000 - Live Mirror Actuator Prototype\nHelp us reach this goal we will be able to build a fully working prototype of our advanced polymer actuator system. This is a crucial step in helping us build mirrors that have an overall thickness of 2cm including the electronics.   \n    Voyager Missions \nLaunched in 1977, the Voyager Space Mission was designed to take advantage of a favorable alignment of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and are now exploring the outer boundary of the heliosphere in interstellar space. The Voyager program is a continuing American scientific program that employs two robotic probes, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, to study the outer Solar System. \nAlthough their original mission was to study only the planetary systems of Jupiter and Saturn, Voyager 2 continued on to Uranus and Neptune, and both Voyagers are now tasked with exploring interstellar space. Their mission has been extended three times, and both probes continue to collect and relay useful scientific data. Neither Uranus nor Neptune has been visited by any probe other than Voyager 2.\nThe Voyager Golden Records are phonograph records aboard both Voyager spacecrafts. The records contain sounds and images selected to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth, and are intended for any intelligent extraterrestrial life form, or for future humans, who may find them. The Voyager Golden Records records are considered as a time capsule for humanity.\n       The PLANETS Foundation\nThe PLANETS Foundation is 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization of professors, astrophysicists, engineers, entrepreneurs and scientists from around the globe.

Email us at info@kohlhaussen.com\nVideo track ID: Eden - Ben Khan \nA year ago I made the first prototype of an analog medium format panoramic camera. I 3D printed the parts, painted it mustard yellow and added it to my design portfolio. It worked much better than expected and garnered attention from the likes of DPREVIEW, PetaPixel, The Phoblographer and Designboom (press links at the end).\nTogether, with your help, I\u2019d like to take this project to the next step by making it available to other photographers as a kit. This campaign will fund a small production run of cameras, mostly in kit-form but also as 10 limited edition pre-finished units. If successful, the business will be properly launched and production will be further developed. \nThe K-Pan is a precision tool for photographers who appreciate versatility, reliability, utterly gigantic negatives and the craft of shooting on film. Most importantly, it is a camera that you can truly make your own. The K-Pan, designed to be as small and light as possible, is perfect for the traveling photographer. Your 4x5 lens + this kit can result in cinematic images like this:\nThis includes more than just the camera itself - our vision is to use this modular system as a foundation on which to build an open-source platform for expansion parts and accessories. These will be designed by and for end users, including myself. 3D printing is more accessible now than ever and offers nearly limitless possibilities for augmenting, improving and customizing this camera. Don't believe me? Check out 3D Hubs. \nNeed spare parts? Download and print them. Want a grip for it? Print it. Want to attach your phone to it? Print a mount. Alternatively, order the parts from our website and have them printed for you. These are just some of the things in the works - seeing that I\u2019ve gotten plenty of use out of this camera so far, I invite you to join me in further developing this system.\nA gallery of photographs taken on the K-Pan can be viewed here.\nFeldsee, Southern Germany, shot on Kodak Ektar\n  Oslo, Norway, shot on Kodak Ektar\n  CAMERA DETAILS\nThe idea is that you combine the kit with your own 4x5 lens. The camera you see in the video and pictures is a prototype developed around a Schneider Super Angulon 90mm f8 that has since seen several upgrades. These include a revised film winding system, a future-proofed design with higher tolerances and compatibility for more lens types. \nAfter publishing the initial project, we received many requests for the CAD files, the raw printed components and also for fully completed cameras. As much as we admire the notion of localized 3D printing, we realized that it will be necessary to manufacture the core hardware ourselves in order to ensure consistently high quality and functionality. Therefor we are presenting a flexible solution - the components work out of the box, however they can also be further finished to the end user's preference. \nHow it works:\nIt shoots five 6x14cm frames per roll of 120 film\nThe kit comes in two main parts; the lens cone and the camera body\nThe body contains a removable pressure plate, dark slide and lid. The lid plate is outfitted with the film winding knobs, fastening screws and two universal cold shoe mounts. \nLoading the film is done by removing said lid plate, similar to removing the bottom plate on a Leica M. \nFocus is set to infinity by default; it can be drawn closer by inserting dedicated spacer brackets between the lens cone and body (10mm bracket included in the kit). Hyperfocal distance is your friend. \nFrank in Hyde Park, shot with a 10mm focus bracket on Kodak Portra 800\nThe hardware: \nComponents are made of lightproof, highly robust grey SLS nylon (see picture below). Yes, the raw components are white in the video and other pictures. We've stopped using that material because it is too translucent. \nTotals to only ~350 grams without a lens\nThe body is 22cm wide and 9cm tall\nEmbedded steel screw threads \nStandard \u00bc-20 UNC tripod mount \nLens mount (the \u201clens board\u201d) is 2mm thick with a 33mm diameter hole (fits a wide variety of Copal 0 shutter lenses)\nFirst generation production prototype of Fujinon lens cone\nWhat\u2019s left for you to do? \nYou receive the grey nylon components with the metal threads and light seals pre-installed. The camera can be assembled with your lens and used right away, however we recommend making it your own by finishing the outer surfaces. We strongly believe in the DIY ethic and are excited to see how people put their own twist on it. If you would rather just leave it in its natural finish, that's fine too. The unfinished nylon material has a rather unique, almost stone-like texture to it. \nWe understand that most people will like to figure out their own special setup for the K-Pan, choosing combinations that best fit their creative style. Seeing that we want to make this camera system expandable in the future, we're currently designing multi-purpose mounts for all sorts of attachments, both internally and externally. Side projects we're working on include frame masks for smaller formats and a mount enabling you to use your phone as a viewfinder and light meter. Please check out the FAQ section for further information.\nThe prototype finished with yellow automotive primer\nTHE REWARDS\nBy backing the K-Pan you will ensure further innovation and development of this project.

Includes everything from the Tier 7 Bonus Bundle and Tier 1. \nWHAT'S NEXT?\nOctober: Whilst this campaign is running we will do one final round of prototyping to ensure that all of our upgrades work smoothly. Some goals we have for this include finalizing the designs for a new cone-body coupling mechanism, a dark slide that inserts from underneath and grippier knobs. We will also be preparing the designs for the tote bags and stickers.\nNovember: Prototyping and testing will continue until the final production components work just as we want them to. This could take less time than expected, however we're leaving some leeway because we know there can be minor hickups along the way. In this time we will also take care of the tote bags and stickers.\nDecember: Time to get things made. This includes the K-Pan kit bodies, standard lens cones and packaging. During this time we will also design the custom lens cones.\nJanuary 2018: Printing of the standard components will be completed and the custom cones will be manufactured. Whilst this is happening, in-house assembly will be going strong. Tote bags and stickers will be shipped whilst the limited edition photographs are printed.\nFebruary 2018: Limited edition K-Pans will be painted and finished. Manufacturing and assembly will wrap up and orders will be prepared for shipping. Website will be prepared for launch.\nMarch 2018: Shipping. In an ideal world we would have the rewards shipped by mid-February, however we realize that the logistics of everything will most likely push back the shipping dates to this time frame. We will also launch the K-Pan website for downloading/ordering replacement and expansion parts.\nMarch/April 2018: A photographic adventure! I'm tentatively scheduling a trip across several countries to really put the K-Pan through its paces. The intent is to then have prints made and possibly also a book. \n  WHO ARE YOU?!\nPaul Kohlhaussen (me!) is a German photographer and designer based in London. I have a long history with photographic equipment, having bought, sold and tinkered with more cameras than I can keep track of. Being an absolute 3D printing nut as well it was only a matter of time until I found a way to combine these two obsessions. A couple months ago I graduated with a degree in economics and am now studying architecture. You can check out my work on my website and instagrams @paulhausen & @pelsnaps. To get this show on the road I have sought out the help of many friends, designers, photographers and business consultants to help me along the way.\nDESIGN PROCESS\nFrom the beginning the system was designed to be a simple, reliable and long-lasting solution to medium format photography, qualities that are often lacking in many modern cameras on the market. Overall, one could say that this camera is pretty low-tech. It doesn't have a lot of moving components and is completely analog - but that's just how we wanted it to be.\nEarly prototypes\nThe components are all modeled in CAD with respect to the dimensions of the fixed input variables - the lens and the film. The flange distance and image circle of the specific lens are modeled as a three-dimensional volume around which the parts are then constructed. Details are prototyped on FDM printers and tested, allowing for the final components to be printed perfectly out of nylon powder via selective laser sintering. The resulting precision and quality in relation to the tools used and time invested is unique to such additive manufacturing. \nThis process is streamlined to minimize wasted resources and environmental impact. The parts are only physically made upon ordering and don't rely on mass production and warehouse storage. Replacement and expansion parts are stocked digitally for anyone to print locally, thereby eliminating the need for long-haul shipping. \nLens Sourcing Guide\nThe K-Pan doesn't come with a lens so you will need to find your own. Large format lenses are plentiful and many photographers already own them, so finding them second hand is often the way to go. Sites such as eBay, MrCad, KEH and Second Hand Dark Room work great for sourcing 4x5 lenses, it's also worth checking the various film photography Facebook groups. These lenses don't have to cost much, however there are several things to look out for.\nMake sure the shutter mechanism doesn't stick and has accurate speeds.\nEnsure that the glass is clean with no fungus or haze. \nCheck that the components aren't dented and fit together snugly on a lens board with a 34.6mm hole (Copal #0). \nA list of newer lenses can be found here, however older lenses work just as well (e.g. the excellent Schneider Angulon 90mm f6.8).\nLens Compatibility\nThe main important specifications are that the lens uses a Copal #0 size shutter and has a rear element that fits within the parameters for the lens cone. This usually means that anything with a rear element diameter of more than 65mm is out of the question because it won't fit through the cone mount opening. Lenses with larger rear elements (e.g. the Schneider SA 90mm f5.6 with a 77mm \u00d8 rear barrel) will require a two-part lens cone or an XL body, both of which are in further research and development. Not all large format lenses will work with this camera and we reserve the right to reject custom cone requests if we find them to be incompatible. \nPress\nPetaPixel, The Phoblographer, DPREVIEW, designboom, Core77, GQ Portugal, 3D Printing Industry, Australian Photography, Yanko Design, 3D Hubs, 3D Druck, DIY Photography, Konbini Cheese, Hypeness, Albedomedia, 3D Focus, DesignTAXI, Popular Mechanics\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA certain level of risk is unavoidable with any project like this, however for the K-Pan it's quite minimal. The camera has already been made, tested, refined and will go through another round of final testing before production begins. I've established a solid support network and have sufficient experience in design and business operations to know what I'm doing (we're going on an adventure!). \n\nThe main issue we could encounter is delays in manufacturing, however the nature of 3D printing means we can be flexible and responsive to such a situation. Minor design details may change (knobs, markings, etc.) but the camera kit will nevertheless remain a beautiful tool that stays true to our vision and commitment.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Paul Kohlhaussen\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\n\"That guy with the 3D printed camera.\" Designer and photographer based in London.

In a simulated drive-in setting, cars and audience surround a group of dancers who remix and reinterpret iconic female characters from the last four decades of Hollywood and cult films.\nBuilding off a style developed in our signature dance-party-show ONTHEFLOOR, we\u2019re bringing the Cartel spirit to a brand-new setting, obliterating the wall between viewer and participant with a high-energy performance style that communicates as much to the body as to the brain. The show culminates with a live DJ set by our long-time collaborator DJ Average Jo - by the end of a Cartel show, everyone is dancing.\nONTHEFLOOR (photo by Maddy Talias)\n  PLAY\n\nWHY WET CLUTCH \nThe Cartel\u2019s radically diverse dancers explore a variety of Hollywood role models (ranging from badass to idiotic) in order to break apart traditional ideas of leading women and reach a layered, multiple expression of what a heroine can be. Pulling from both cult favorites like Pam Anderson\u2019s \u201cBarb Wire\u201d to Angela Bassett in \u201cStrange Days,\u201d to more mainstream staples like Ripley in \u201cAlien,\u201d choreographic reinterpretations of movie tropes are designed to open up a dialogue about the cultural mythology Hollywood provides. Original video content inspired by these icons will complement, surround and offset choreography, recontextualizing those images for a modern audience.\nUPCOMING WIDE RELEASE\nAfter the Seaport premiere on September 8th, the Cartel will adapt WET CLUTCH to a host of venues, indoor and outdoor, inviting audience vehicles wherever possible. Whether on foot or in cars, audiences will automatically become part of the architecture of the live choreography, collectively rendering and reimagining a cinematic world through dance.\nGOING PLACES - WET CLUTCH TOUR (photo by Maddy Talias)\nHELP BRING WET CLUTCH TO STAGE AND SCREEN \nGiven the massive scope of the project, even with terrific institutional support we\u2019ve only secured about \u00bc of our budget. We\u2019re looking to our beloved audience to bring this great labor of love life at the high production value it deserves.\nDonations will help support: * modular and adaptable projection design + screens and tech at our range of venues * artist fees for intensive workshops and high-endurance, sweaty rehearsals * the genesis of complex original video content * new technology to keep that video running * designing quality costumes that conjure the cinematic world of the show * the moving set pieces (TDC vehicles) that bring the drive-in to life * the tourability and future of this show across America\nThe Cartel is ready to launch WET CLUTCH and bring it to a drive-in near you.

Without sacrificing technical rigor or artistic ambition as a dance company, we endeavor to employ the social nature of dance, the charge of a party, and the sharpness of a music video to a fresh dance vocabulary that any Joe can get down with.\nSince launching in 2012, the Cartel has performed at a radically diverse array of spaces - select highlights include: Ace Hotel NY, MoMA / PS 1, BAM, The High Line, OBERON/ART, The Brooklyn Museum, Summer on the Hudson, Le Poisson Rouge, Velocity Dance Center (Seattle, WA), Philadelphia Museum of Art, Bootleg Theater (Los Angeles, CA), Edward Sharpe\u2019s Big Top, Espaco Xisto (Salvador da Bahia, Brazil), IAC Building, La MaMa Moves!, Red Hook Festival, Space Gallery (Portland, ME). The Cartel has been featured in music videos for Yoko Ono, Vic Mensa, Reggie Watts, and The Sway Machinery.

Each season will have six episodes, with each episode featuring one friend on a shenanigan-filled adventure in a city that gives \u201cno fucks\u201d about an earnest heart or a living wage.

Her life gets more complicated when she loses her job and her college crush, Gil, rejoins her circle of friends.\nA no-nonsense, career-driven, former valedictorian, who works at an investment-banking firm while studying for her GMATs. A beacon of style and taste -- she's only willing to date women and men who are socialites. She's got her whole life figured out -- but with her high standards, can she find someone to share it with?\nHis natural charisma, humor and deep spirituality make everyone \u2013 even strangers \u2013 want to be his best friend. Travis has found a successful, church-going, God-loving man. He has the perfect life...or does he?\nA free-spirit who's been taking random jobs and turning couch-surfing into an art form, with the hopes of one day becoming a restaurateur. And although he won\u2019t say \u201cno\u201d to a crazy night out or a one-night stand, he\u2019s a romantic at heart and is looking for the right woman to settle down with. But will his wild ways get in the way of love?\nA weed-smoking middle school guidance counselor who's a peacemaker among her friends. With her easy-going demeanor, Jess is everyone\u2019s confidante. Although the ladies love her, she has a problem letting women in \u2014 afraid that they might mess with her Zen-like way of life.\nA geek-chic, sci-fi fantasy connoisseur who's not afraid to let his Blerd flag fly.

Join us as we become the first artist-museum team to launch a sculptural satellite into space.\nA couple of years ago, contemporary artist Trevor Paglen approached the Nevada Museum of Art with a bold idea: launch the first satellite into space that would exist purely as an artistic gesture. The Museum knew that his radical vision -- Orbital Reflector -- could help to change the way we see our place in the world. Orbital Reflector is a satellite that will have no commercial, military, or scientific purpose. Instead, it will be a public sculpture, visible from the ground without a telescope -- a satellite that belongs to everyone.\nDesign concept rendering for Trevor Paglen: Orbital Reflector, co-produced and presented by the Nevada Museum of Art, 2017\nWhy does it matter?\nArt gives us a reason -- gives us permission -- to look at something deeply. An artwork that pushes the boundaries of what we traditionally think of as \"art\" challenges the way we engage with the world. Orbital Reflector encourages all of us to look up at the night sky with a renewed sense of wonder, to consider our place in the universe, and to re-imagine how we live together on this planet. It prompts us to ask the big questions. Who are we? Where did we come from? Where are we going? What are we doing to the shared world in which we live? \nTrevor Paglen, LACROSSE/ONYX V near Cepheus (Synthetic Aperture Radar Reconnaissance Satellite; USA 182), 2008\nHow will it work?\nOrbital Reflector is packed inside of a small (3U) satellite called a CubeSat that will be launched into space aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, anticipated for early 2018. Once in low Earth orbit, at approximately 350 miles (575 km) from Earth's surface, a 100-foot-long diamond-shaped balloon will deploy from the CubeSat. The balloon will reflect sunlight back to Earth, making the satellite visible to the naked eye. It will remain in space for approximately two months.\nHow can I find it?\nWe are partnering with the sky-watching app Star Walk 2 to ping you when Orbital Reflector passes your location (it will orbit the planet several times a day). You can also see the satellite's flight data from our website, orbitalreflector.com.\nWhy a diamond shape?\nOrbital Reflector is a neo-minimalist sculpture, inspired by an alternative history of spaceflight that includes early Russian avant-gardists and forgotten NASA experiments. It is a work of aerospace engineering for aerospace engineering's sake.\nThe design has shifted from a sphere to a diamond throughout the course of development. Once we started working with aerospace engineers to build a flight-worthy spacecraft, physics played a pivotal role. The diamond shape Paglen created will be bigger, brighter, and better in flight than a sphere. \nAbout Trevor Paglen\nTrevor Paglen is an American artist whose work deliberately blurs lines between science, contemporary art, journalism, geography, and other disciplines to construct unfamiliar yet meticulously researched ways to see and interpret the world. Best known for his documentation and critique of surveillance in the twenty-\ufb01rst century, his current work with artificial intelligence and machine vision -- and his push into outer space -- is redefining the future of art practice.\nTrevor Paglen, Five Classified Aircraft, 2007, 5 fabric patches, framed\nThe artist has long contemplated and engaged with the history and geography of satellites -- and the politics surrounding them. He has spent significant time photographing classified satellites and other objects in orbit. \nTrevor Paglen, Nine Reconnaissance Satellites over the Sonora Pass, 2008\n  Trevor Paglen, KEYHOLE IMPROVED CRYSTAL from Glacier Point (Optical Reconnaissance Satellite; USA 224), 2011\nIn 2012, Paglen launched The Last Pictures, an ultra-archival disc of human history told through one-hundred images the artist curated. The disc is mounted to a communications satellite that is in geosynchronous orbit as we speak. While working on The Last Pictures with MIT scientists, Paglen imagined building his own satellite, one with no other function or purpose beyond being the art object itself.\nTrevor Paglen, The Last Pictures, 2012, commissioned and presented by Creative Time\nTrevor Paglen\u2019s work is included in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; the Smithsonian American Art Museum; the Whitney Museum of American Art; Berkeley Art Museum; the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; Victoria and Albert Museum, London; and the Nevada Museum of Art. \nAbout the Nevada Museum of Art\nThe Nevada Museum of Art is not your typical art museum. While we organize exhibitions and have a permanent collection like many museums, we also work directly with living artists to push contemporary art in new directions. Remember Ugo Rondinone's Seven Magic Mountains? That was us, in partnership with our friends at Art Production Fund.\nNevada Museum of Art in Reno, Nevada.\nThe Nevada Museum of Art is the only art museum in Nevada accredited by the American Alliance of Museums (AAM). It is a private, non-profit institution founded in 1931. \nThe Museum's Center for Art + Environment is an internationally-recognized research center dedicated to supporting the practice, study, and awareness of creative interactions between people and their environments. The Center houses unique archive materials from more than 1,000 artists working on all seven continents, including Cape Farewell, Michael Heizer, Walter de Maria, Lita Albuquerque, Burning Man, Center for Land Interpretation, and Ugo Rondinone\u2019s Seven Magic Mountains. The Center will also house the official project archive for Orbital Reflector. A portion of that archive will be on display as an interpretive-center style exhibition when the satellite launches into space.\nHow can I help?\nAerospace is kind of pricey. Rocket rides aren't cheap, and neither is high-tech precision engineering. This art project requires both. The overall project budget is $1.3 million. We have already raised approximately 60% of the funds, and you can help us close the gap. \nThe goal we have set on Kickstarter is the minimum amount of money we need to pay this year to ensure we have a ticket to launch. The more we raise on Kickstarter, the easier time we will have putting the finishing touches on satellite construction, shipping the spacecraft to the launch site, and lifting off into space. \nThere are many steps involved in constructing the satellite, and over the course of this campaign, we will share \"behind-the-scenes\" photos and videos detailing the process.\nThe Rewards\nDigital Rendering of Orbital Reflector\n  Official (unlimited) Diamond Mission Sticker\n  Official (unlimited) Diamond Mission Patch\n  Mission Pin with Chrome Finish\n  Trevor Paglen, Orbital Reflector Structural Drawing, 2017\nAs we progress through the campaign, we will update you with photos of the official patches - they are in production now!\n  Limited Edition Collector's Patch Set of 5, Custom-designed by Trevor Paglen\n As of September 18, four of the five patches are complete.

So it comes as no surprise that artist Trevor Paglen approached the Center for Art + Environment at the Nevada Museum of Art to imagine the unimaginable. Together we embark upon an exploration of the most extreme environment of them all: outer space.\n\nThis is the first time any artist or museum has attempted to launch a sculpture into space. As we have learned from the aerospace engineers with whom we are engaged, space is inherently risky and challenging. We have taken all available precautions to mitigate those risks, but certain things are beyond our control. The launch date is a moving target and the rocket may fail on the first attempt. However, thanks to launch insurance, we can fly a second time. And, as far as the satellite construction goes, we've planned ahead. We have a backup satellite unit being built as a precaution.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Orbital Reports", "descp": "As a friend in flight, you will receive mission updates as we inch closer to the rocket launch.

Created in collaboration with local high schoolers, East of the River highlights the experiences of young students of color as they navigate Washington, D.C.'s overburdened public school system.\nWe launched under the Projects of Earth campaign, a group of projects that offer unique perspectives on humanity, culture, and life on Earth. East of the River reveals a day in the life of youth pushed out of the very institutions that we expect to help them flourish, and shows how, despite a disproportionate amount of obstacles placed on these young people\u2019s paths, they still find ways to educate themselves and grow amidst a glaring absence of social and economic opportunities to pursue the lives they want to lead.\nWe couldn\u2019t be more excited to make this film and need your support in bringing it to life. We made the decision to go all or nothing on a Kickstarter campaign because we believe East of the River features untold stories that deserve to be heard.

Peter Sollett (short) \nThe Florida Project (2017) dir. Sean Baker (feature) \nHeaven Knows What (2014) dir. Josh and Benny Sadie (feature)\n WHY TELL THIS STORY, NOW\nThis is a story we have not heard: East of the River takes place in parts of the nation's capital that rarely receive coverage in media, yet we believe if heard, would resonate deeply with a wide audience. We are choosing to highlight the experiences of young, black female and gender non-conforming students and to cast actual DC youth attending public schools.\nTo expand the school-to-prison pipeline dialogue: In Monique Morris' book \u201cPushout,\u201d she explains that \u201cblack girls are 16% of the student population, but nearly one-third of all girls referred to law enforcement and more than one-third of all female school-based arrests.\" East of the River offers a nuanced view of zero-tolerance school discipline practices that too often funnel students into the delinquency/criminal systems.\nFilm Should Be Inclusive: Movies belong to everyone, but not everyone\u2019s story gets featured. Low-income neighborhoods and the people who live in them are not often portrayed with dignity and instead are often represented through violence and two-dimensional characters. We wanted to make this a narrative fiction film because we believe that gives audiences a chance to share in the experience of young people pushed out of schools rather than to see them as stark statistics. \nTo make is to take action: If you\u2019ve read this far, there is a good chance we are on the same page in saying that the current political situation is really scary. Action can come in all forms, including the way we represent people, places, and circumstances in media. By contributing to this film, we entirely count you as collaborators in this effort.\nOTHER WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE\nFollow our Kickstarter | Like us on Facebook | Follow us on Twitter | Follow us on Instagram \nOne of the best ways to help us is by posting a link to this Kickstarter page [https://tinyurl.com/Eastoftheriverfilm] on Facebook, Twitter, or any of your favorite social networks and even by emailing someone you think might be interested in backing East of the River.

We decided to hit the streets of DC to find real youth to collaborate with. East of the River is about individuals whose opportunities have been taken away from them, and it was important to us to give opportunities back to DC teens. That means providing paid opportunities, giving in-depth acting workshops, and hands on experience on a professional set.\n  PLAY\n\nAyiana T. Davis will be playing Teonna.

Approximately 900 bottles will be produced in advance of the exhibition, with an additional 300 bottles reserved for on-site bottling performances during the opening and throughout the run of the show.\nWhy is this project important?\nWhen Pope.L was asked by What Pipeline to do a commission for Detroit, he felt that whatever he did it should not re-victimize the city as had been done too often in the past. What if Detroit could be the hero and come to the rescue of another midwest city in need?\nIn 2014, the city of Flint, Michigan, changed its water supply in order to save money. That decision and a host of subsequent and related decisions on local, state and federal levels created a crisis. Water quality was mismanaged, citizens were poisoned, and in the fallout of criminal charges and lawsuits many Flint residents still do not have access to reliable, safe water.\nFlint Water Project will call attention to the city\u2019s continued plight while raising funds to support Flint citizens in their struggle. Proceeds from the sales of the Flint Water art edition sold at What Pipeline will benefit the United Way of Genessee County, who will use the funds entirely for mitigating issues directly related to the water crisis.\nA portion of the proceeds will also be donated to Hydrate Detroit, a volunteer-lead non-profit group assisting in combating water shutoffs and advocating for affordable water laws in Detroit.\nAbout the Artist\nPope.L is a visual artist and educator whose multidisciplinary practice uses binaries, contraries and preconceived notions embedded within contemporary culture to create art works in various formats, for example, writing, painting, performance, installation, video and sculpture. Building upon his long history of enacting arduous, provocative, absurdist performances and interventions in public spaces, Pope.L applies some of the same social, formal and performative strategies to his interests in language, system, gender, race and community. The goals for his work are several: joy, money and uncertainty\u2014 not necessarily in that order.\nWhat related projects has he created?\nPope.L has a long history of public intervention and community interaction in his artworks.\nBlack Factory\nBetween 2004-2006, The Black Factory toured the USA stirring up discussions about class, gender, race, and democracy. Visitors to the Black Factory were asked to bring objects that represent blackness to them. These objects were added to the Black Factory through performance, pulverization and documentation. Proceeds from the Black Factory Gift Shop Twice Sold products benefitted local organizations like food pantries and shelters; when Black Factory was at the Wexner Center proceeds benefited Big Brothers Big Sisters of Central Ohio.\nBlink, 2011\nFor the mobile and interactive artwork Blink, 2011, Pope.L invited residents of New Orleans to share photos of what they dreamt about or what they were thinking about when they woke up. The hundreds of photos he received became a slide show representing the hopes and dreams of a city slowly rising after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. He created a film from these photographs and on the night of October 22, the film was projected on the back of an old ice cream truck as it was pulled through the streets of the city by volunteers.\nPull!, 2013\nIn 2013, Pope.L presented Pull! a durational city-wide community performance piece in which rotating teams of Cleveland locals assisted in pulling a truck by hand for 25 miles, through the neighborhoods of North Collinwood, Glenville, University Circle, Hough, AsiaTown and downtown; to West Park, Clark-Fulton and Ohio City. This act was a way to connect an otherwise divided city and a chance to stir up a city-wide conversation about work.\nThese performances show Pope.L working in a space between community organization and an artistic practice\u2014mobilizing individuals while attempting to address societal concerns through an abstraction of imposing themes such as labor, identity politics, and basic civil and fundamental rights.\nWhat will your contributions support?\nRendering of Flint Water at What Pipeline\nMuch of the work for this exhibition is already underway. Your contributions will support the purchase of materials directly related to the exhibition such as bottling and packaging materials (1200 bottles and caps, custom fitted boxes, foam insets and mailing labels) along with construction materials (shelving, brackets, paint, wall paper) and labor costs.\nAdditional Support\nFlint Water Project is supported by a matching grant from the John L. and James S. Knight Foundation as part of the Knight Arts Challenge. Donated dollars may be matched by this grant, doubling your contribution. Additional support comes from Mitchell-Innes & Nash in New York City and Susanne Vielmetter Projects Los Angeles.\nRewards\nTwo-Ply Flint Water Sticker ($15 or more), Flint Water Postcard, Signed by Pope.L ($50 or more)\nTwo-Ply Flint Water Sticker and Button Combo Pak ($25 or more)\nInside the Studio: Wonderful Studio Assistant David wearing a Flint Water Button\nHand Assembled Flint Water Prototype Water Bottle, Signed by Pope.L ($100 or more)\nVery Limited Editioned Print, Signed by Pope.L ($225 or more)\nFramed Original Sketches and Work Notes from Flint Water Project, Signed by Pope.L ($299 or more)\n Failed Wallpaper Test Print ($499 or more)\nFramed original Pope.L concept sketches and work notes ($550 or more)\nBlack Factory Pro-Pak ($799 or more)\nAll You Can Eat Taco Bash with Pope.L and Team ($999 or more)\nDinner with Pope.L in Flint ($2,500)\nDinner on Pope.L's lap in Flint ($9,999)\nWhy Kickstarter?\nEven though the physical form of the project takes place in a gallery, with the collaboration of Kickstarter, its conceptual and activist outreach can be far wider, stirring discussions about the availability and sustainability of clean water and the necessity for connectedness and community. Kickstarter can extend this project's reach, spread the word about the exhibition, and raise awareness about ongoing issues relating to water and struggle.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFlint Water Project is scheduled to take place in September. We need to reach our Kickstarter goal to create the Flint Water installation. We then face the additional task of bottling and selling 1200 bottles of Flint Water.

What Pipeline will take on additional staff for the first time to ensure production can be maintained. Shipping will take place directly after the end of the exhibition, rather than throughout, to reduce the labor involved and maintain the installation on view.\n\nWith the cooperation of three galleries located in New York, Los Angeles and Detroit, and an experienced team who have worked on many art exhibitions at major museums and events throughout the world, we are confident all goals will be exceeded, and that Flint Water Project is an important artwork to support.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Invitation", "descp": "Your name on our glorious thank you list and a personalized digital invitation to the gala What Pipeline opening on September 7.

Some are more privileged than others, but with that privilege comes a responsibility to do more.\u201d    \nWorld-renowned artist and activist, Ai Weiwei, and New York City's premier presenter of contemporary outdoor art, Public Art Fund, are working together to bring an important new art exhibition to the streets of NYC from October to February.  \nIn response to the worldwide plight of migrants and refugees, divisive immigration and border control policies, and the global rise in nationalism, the exhibition, Good Fences Make Good Neighbors, will be installed at 300 + sites spanning dozens of New York City neighborhoods in all five boroughs. \nDrawing on the artist\u2019s personal experience being detained by the Chinese government and as well as his visits with some of the world\u2019s most vulnerable populations at refugee camps and borders worldwide, the show will make a powerful statement about division and separation at a global, national, local, and personal level.\nAbout the Artworks\n\"Fences can be used to regulate and detain people, to segregate and to train people to accept the given conditions.\"\nInstallation concept rendering, Doris C. Freedman Plaza\nAdapting security fencing in a variety of unexpected ways, Ai Weiwei's artworks will appear at street level, rise from rooftops, emerge between buildings, be affixed to lampposts, frame bus shelters, and seemingly grow out of the urban infrastructure. \nMajor site-specific sculptures will be installed at iconic locations including Central Park, Washington Square Park, and the Unisphere, while more discrete 2-D and 3-D interventions \u2014 including posters with images collected from the artist\u2019s visits to refugee camps around the world \u2014 will be installed across New York's five boroughs.\nThis is your chance to be a part of Ai Weiwei\u2019s revolutionary work by joining a community of artists, activists, and citizens standing up against the forces that separate us.\nInstallation concept rendering, Washington Square Park\nAbout Ai Weiwei\n\"The issue with the migration crisis has been a longtime focus of my practice. And the fence has always been a tool in the vocabulary of political landscaping.\u201d\nAi Weiwei at Idomeni Refugee Camp, Greece, 2016\nGiven his remarkable life and work, Ai Weiwei stands as a unique international figure. He is both one of the most celebrated contemporary artists and one of the world\u2019s most prominent and respected human rights and social justice activists.\nThe artist has been in conversation with Public Art Fund about doing a project in New York for more than seven years, but from 2011 to 2015 his passport was confiscated, and he was arrested and detained by the Chinese authorities for his vocal political activism and criticism. We are proud to be working with him at long last to present this work, this year, in this city \u2014 a beacon for free expression and democratic ideals. \n\"When I left New York in the 80s as a student, I had nothing \u2013 I could have never dreamed of this project. All these years later, the show is like a love letter to the city and its people.\u201d\nAbout Public Art Fund\nThis year, Public Art Fund is celebrating its 40th anniversary of free access to the most important art of our time, championing the role of artistic expression in an open society by bringing dynamic contemporary art to the broadest possible audiences across New York City. \nPublic Art Fund has redefined what public art is and can be. Our more than 450 projects have demonstrated the power and potential of public art to transform the urban environment, engage audiences of all ages and backgrounds, and capture the imaginations of millions.\nWhy should I support this project?\n\u201cWhen the Berlin Wall fell, there were 11 countries with border fences and walls. By 2016, that number had increased to 70. We are witnessing a rise in nationalism, an increase in the closure of borders, and an exclusionary attitude towards migrants and refugees, the victims of war and the casualties of globalization.\u201d\nAi Weiwei and Public Art Fund share a vision that art should be freely accessible to everyone and leave a lasting impact on those who experience it. Good Fences Make Good Neighbors, which will be experienced by millions of New Yorkers and visitors from across the globe, is the embodiment of that vision. \nThis is a moment when it is crucial to stand up for projects that reflect our values.

You can read more about how Patrick created the image, here.\nIn-camera double exposure \u00a9 Patrick Hall\n New Stretch Goal and Reward announced\nIf we reach our new stretch goal of $15,000, we'll be sending everyone who has pledged $20 or more a commemorative sticker based on Andrew Studer's eclipse image.\nUPDATE 8/25: We're thrilled to announce that Andrew Studer's stunning image of a rock climber framed by the solar eclipse is now part of our project and will be featured in our book, Chasing the Great American Eclipse: Images and Essays from Totality. \nAndrew is also signing and numbering a limited number of 16 x 24 prints of his photo that will be included as rewards in our $500 reward tier, \"The Total Eclipse Package.\" (The image won't be included in any of the other reward tiers). \nIf there is any image that will be looked back upon years from now when people think of the Great American Eclipse of 2017, it may very well be Andrew's. You can read more about how he and his team created this image on FStoppers: http://bit.ly/2wGiKNI\n\u00a9 Andrew Studer in Smith Rock State Park, Oregon.\n---------\n\u00a9 2017 Dimitrios Manis in Madras, Oregon.\nOur book will document the spectrum of emotions, the crowds, the traffic jams, the street corner preachers, the revelers and the moments that will remind us what it was like the day the sun disappeared over America.\nThose who saw the total solar eclipse on Aug. 21 will tell you there's absolutely nothing that compares to watching the sun flicker to darkness in the middle of the day.\nAs the sky slowly went dark, the temperature dropped and people all around were gasping in amazement, screaming in delight or even becoming overcome with emotion. Psychologists say that watching a total solar eclipse can have an unsettling effect on people because, frankly, it's hard for our minds to cope with what is happening.\nChasing the Great American Eclipse captures the  spectacle of this total solar eclipse -- a once in a 100-year coast-to-coast event that was witnessed by tens of millions of people in the 70-mile wide swath of \"totality.\"\nIf you are a fan of documentary and street photography, we think you'll be enthralled by this study in human nature and what it reveals about our culture. The parties and festivals, the doomsayers, the curious and the entrepreneurial spirit that these types of hyped events bring out will be on display across America.\nThe book will be a mix of photojournalism, street photography, visual storytelling and stunning images of the eclipse over various landscapes and cityscapes. It's sure to be a conversation starter on your coffee table and will be an interesting piece of history that you'll be able to look back upon in the years to come. \nPhases of the eclipse \u00a9 Joseph Gruber in the Great Smoky Mountains.\nProjects of Earth\nWe're also proud to be part of Kickstarter's \"Projects of Earth\" campaign, which honors the 40th anniversary of the Voyager spacecraft, which carried the \"Golden Record\" -- a collection of images, sounds and greetings that created a snapshot of life on earth. \nThe Projects of Earth are things that might be placed on that Golden Record today as a record of our humanity in the 21st Century. We'd like to think that if an alien culture were to pick up a copy of Chasing the Great American Eclipse, they might learn a thing or two about man's fascination with the heavens.\n\u00a9 2017 Joe Newman in Jefferson City, Missouri\nHow We Are Doing It\nOur team of photographers was embedded in various locations on the day of the eclipse, including Oregon, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina. \nThe members of our team are all experienced photographers and were all contributors to our most recent photo book, UnPresidented, which documented the protests and celebration at the Trump inauguration and was successfully funded on Kickstarter.\nWe are also running a nationwide contest for people to submit photos for consideration. You can find the contest here.\nOur jury for the contest includes veteran, award-winning photojournalists Carl Juste of the Miami Herald and Andr\u00e9 Chung, formerly of the Baltimore Sun and Jarob Ortiz, a National Park Service photographer who was once referred to as the \"next Ansel Adams,\" Heather Goss, an editor at Air & Space magazine and Sarah Gordon, who teaches the history of photography at American University and who has curated photography exhibits at the National Gallery of Art. \nMoney raised during the Kickstarter campaign will finance design and printing of the book and help defray travel expenses incurred in journeying to various locations in the path of totality.\nThe Editors\nShamila Chaudhary is an avid photographer whose work has been featured in The Washington Post as well as local media outlets and galleries in the Washington, D.C. metro area.

In the glow of inspiration following that journey I spent a year conceiving and building my masterpiece. It is completely strange and lovely. I call it an Ant Space, a thin habitat for ants and plants, backlit by a glowing nebula and designed to hang on a wall. It is living, evolving art.\nMy goal with this KickStarter campaign is to launch the Ant Space as an art piece and a product. It is a beautiful, meditative, nuanced hobby. I want to start a community around it. Backers will receive an Ant Space built by me. They will be the seeds to reach a wider audience.\nArt\nThe backdrop of each Ant Space is a unique selection from the immaculate Hubble Space Telescope image The Carina Nebula: Star Birth In The Extreme. The composition spans fifty light years, capturing the brightest stars in the sky. It is the most beautiful of astronomical observations.\nLife\nAdd life to the Ant Space. Plants live passively, fitting themselves seamlessly into the environment. Ants are just the opposite. They sculpt the world to meet their needs.\nWatch plants above and below the soil. A reminder that roots growing down are as important as leaves growing up.\nImpermanence  \nIn every moment tunnels and hills morph across an endlessly evolving scene. What it will be can never be known and what it has been will never be repeated. It is an artwork that exists only in the present.\nColor  \nTake control of the lights using a smartphone or tablet. The Ant Space becomes an instrument for the eyes. Orchestrate a show with the touch of a finger. Find intensity in the brightness, evoke a mood with the colors.\nCare\nCare for the life within the Ant Space. A drop of water and a pinch of sugar will nourish the ants for a week. Expect the ants to live for several months at which time there are options regarding what to do next. \nMost simply, the Ant Space may be left to exist in that final form as an attractive art piece and useful light.\nMore ants may be added at any time to continue digging the soil.\nPlants may be given time to establish themselves before adding more ants.\nAdd to the scene with more layers of colored sand and soil.\nThe habitat can be easily taken apart then cleaned for a fresh start. \nDeepDream Background\nGoogle's DeepDream neural network was inspired by the visual cortex. Images it produces are artifacts of a copy of a human brain. \nThe Carina Nebula DeepDream background is an option for every Ant Space. From a distance it looks like a cloudy nebula, up close it is teeming with life.\nAnt-scaping  \nEach Ant Space is an ecosystem. Play with the life inside. The narrow habitat makes the game one of subtle manipulation. Sculpt the scene only from above. Drop in seeds and water, add more ants and colored sand. Intelligently design a complex balance of creatures and plants. The Ant Space will evolve over years as a co-creation between the life within and the hand that placed it there.\nMusings \nClick the image for more musings about ants.\n  Click the image to watch the full eight month time lapse.\n    Click the image to immerse yourself.\n ", "risks": "", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jacob Lemanski\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI am an explorer, an engineer and an artist.

Rakowitz and his mother collected and compiled recipes from the Baghdad area. These recipes are turned into dishes which are served by U.S. veterans of the Iraq War from a food truck designed by the artist.  \nThe Enemy Kitchen project began in 2003 in New York City as a way for food to spark dialogue around Iraq in new ways, ultimately taking form as a food truck.\nIn storage since its last food service in 2012, the food truck has been victim to theft, graffiti, and other damage. We want to restore and repair the truck, bring it up to code, and park it on the front plaza of the MCA Chicago, where it will serve free food for the local community during pop-up activations during the exhibition.\nEnemy Kitchen will be a key part of Michael Rakowitz: Backstroke of the West, a major exhibition and the artist\u2019s first U.S. museum survey, which will open at the MCA on September 16, 2017.\nWhy is this Important?\nSharing a meal or a recipe is something that everyone can experience, no matter where they are in the world. Likewise, art has the power to connect people across geography, language, and culture. Bringing these two elements together, Enemy Kitchen will allow people to support, access, and experience a Middle Eastern food culture that was (and is still) disrupted by the Iraq War.\nWhat will your contributions support? \nAs the MCA prepared for Michael Rakowitz: Backstroke of the West, it was clear that Enemy Kitchen was an important part of his art career and had to be a part of the exhibition. But there was a problem. After Enemy Kitchen\u2019s last food service in 2012 the truck was put into storage in the parking lot of Babylon, a restaurant in North Chicago. Despite being locked up, the truck was broken into, stolen from, and vandalized with messages of hate. Mechanically the vehicle would not start, aesthetically it was damaged, and wasn\u2019t up to preparing or serving food\u2014Enemy Kitchen\u2019s situation was dire. \nIf we work together, we can put Enemy Kitchen back on the road, bring it up to city code for working food trucks, and restore it as an artwork. This campaign will also support a full schedule of free community events where the truck will serve Iraqi cuisine to the public, for free.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nBy pairing with Kickstarter, the MCA hopes to reach a larger audience for Michael Rakowitz\u2019s art and ideas\u2014 even if you cannot visit the truck or taste the food created there, you can make a meal using the Enemy Kitchen recipe cards or while wearing the apron and support the dialogue created around some of the most pressing issues our world faces. In this way the MCA is creating a forum for the public to interact with the artwork itself, no matter where they are since preparing and eating the meals is essential to the artwork itself.\nKickstarter Rewards\nAs thanks for supporting the project, Kickstarter backers can receive a variety of rewards connected to Enemy Kitchen. Preview the rewards here; as some rewards are currently being created, not all rewards are shown but we will update as they are produced. \n Saddam Hussein Replica Paperware 5-pack: $15 or more\n Meal Ticket and Museum Admission for One: $25 or more\n \"Backstroke of the West\" Catalog: $35 or more\n \"Bless Your Hands\" Kubba Spoon: $35 or more\nSabreen: Live in Jerusalem LP: $60 or more\n Enemy Kitchen Apron and Recipes: $75 or more\n Chicago-Iraqi Flag: $2,500 or more\n Shopping Trip with Michael Rakowitz: $5,000 or more\nAbout Michael Rakowitz  \nBased in Chicago, Iraqi-American artist Michael Rakowitz (b. 1973) makes work that explores recent contested social, political, and cultural histories. Drawing on personal experiences and research on these subjects, as well as history and popular culture, Rakowitz creates illustrated objects, installations, and performances that invite viewers to contemplate their complicit relationship to the political world around them, recognizing that hospitality and hostility are interlinked.\nAbout the MCA Chicago\nThe Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago (MCA) is one of Chicago\u2019s major museums and one of the nation\u2019s largest facilities devoted to the art of our time. The MCA is an artist-activated and audience-engaged contemporary art museum. We generate art, ideas, and conversation around the creative process. We are a cultural leader of local necessity and international distinction.\nThis campaign is endorsed by an independent jury selected by Art Basel.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKickstarter community support will be essential in the complete restoration of Enemy Kitchen and a full schedule of free food service events for the community on the MCA Plaza. Without the support of the Kickstarter backers, we will have to pare back the free community events to a bare minimum. \n\nMany of the rewards have been produced already and are currently in Michael Rakowitz's collection, or they can be reproduced easily since they would take the form of a work created in the past.

I myself and the people around me have experienced living with that war in Aleppo first hand.\nWith the photobook \u201eYalla Habibi \u2013 Living with War in Aleppo\u201c I want to give recognition to people in Eastern Aleppo who have continued their everyday lives with resilience and inventiveness amidst perilous circumstances. The pictures from my hometown, taken between 2013 and 2015, capture moments of the conflicting and contrasting experiences and emotions of these people. Anger, joy, grieve, fear, adventurousness, desperation, determination, solidarity, defiance, fatigue, excitement \u2013 having to live with war all of these emotions can change in an instant. The book shows people balancing the horrors of war with a sense of normalcy and trying to retain their dignity.\nThrough your backing I intend to produce a high quality photobook that not only generates empathy but also provokes a reflection on justice, responsibility, and human dignity.\n\u201cYalla Habibi\u201d \u2013 \u201cCome on my dear\u201d as people would say in Arabic!\n    Who am I? And what is my motivation?\n \u201eThe truth is the first victim of war. Hosam Katan refused to believe this, he simply did not accept it \u2013 not for the people in his hometown.\u201c (Frank-Walter Steinmeier, former Foreign Minister of Germany)\n\"Yalla Habibi\" is also part of my own story. Growing up in Aleppo I could never have imagined that one day war would break out in my country. It was when I had just turned 17 in 2011 that I experienced the beginning of the protests against the Assad regime. I saw people with a genuine believe in a Syrian revolution to establish democracy and more freedom in their country. When the regime answered protests with brute force, I decided to pick up my camera. I felt the responsibility to document what was happening around me. I started to work at the newly founded Aleppo Media Center, a network of independent local media activists. As many international news organizations were pulling out of the country for security reasons, I realized the importance to not let the events and people in Aleppo go unseen. Security has also been an issue for my work and in May 2015 I almost ran out of luck. I was shot by a sniper of the regime. After treatment in Turkey, however, I returned to Aleppo and continued my life and work there until the end of 2015.\n  More than 1200 of my photographs have been distributed by the news agency Reuters from 2013. They have been published in the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Stern magazine, and numerous other media outlets. With this photobook I want to transcend the fleeting realm of daily news coverage and present a nuanced, multilayered and in-depth view on the conflict.\nI am currently studying photojournalism at Hannover University in Germany to develop my craft as a photographer. I am committed to continue my work as a photojournalist, and I hope I will be able to return to Syria in the future.\nHosam Katan. Aleppo\nWhy is this book important now?\nHasn\u2019t the fighting in Aleppo stopped since the end of 2016?\n\u201cWithout me in power you will have no safety and no life.\u201d The city of Aleppo has been divided between a Western part controlled by the regime and an Eastern part largely controlled by opposition forces between 2012 until the end of 2016. In the Eastern part of Aleppo the Assad regime made its message loud and clear by the means of snipers, incarcerations, torture, artillery shelling, bombings, as well as the deprivation of basic resources like food, medicine, electricity, or education.\nYet, men, women, and children in Eastern Aleppo refused to have their lives stripped away. That is what has impressed me the most. Most of them made the conscious decision to continue living in their home city no matter what the circumstances.\n  \u201cSo called \u201arebels\u2019\u201c, \u201cterrorists\u201c, \u201chuman shields\u201c, \u201cvictims\u201d or \u201ccivilians,\u201d many labels have been applied to people in Eastern Aleppo. But who are the human beings behind these labels? Let\u2019s put faces to these labels. Let\u2019s reveal the human beings behind it. It is true that most people who are portrayed in my photographs do not or rather cannot live in Eastern Aleppo anymore. They have not vanished from the Earth though. They have been displaced from their homes as have many other Syrians.\nThe civil war in Syria demonstrates how the line between what is just and what is unjust is too often determined by those in power. The book, therefore, aims to be a testimony for those who neither possess effective political nor military power but who nonetheless exert incredible strength and do possess agency.\nAlthough the news coverage of the conflict in Syria, and especially from Aleppo, has waned, it is important to keep up the dialogue because the conflict is far from being over. It cannot go unseen. People of Eastern Aleppo cannot go unseen.\n  The photobook & the current status\nWith 152 pages, this high quality photobook will include 85 carefully selected photographs with descriptions in English. For some photos background stories about the people portrayed or about specific living conditions and people\u2019s strategies of dealing with them will be provided. The photographs will be further contextualized by an essay of German war correspondent Carsten Stormer (author of \"Die Schatten des Morgenlandes: Die Gewalt im Nahen Osten und warum wir uns einmischen m\u00fcssen\") and an essay by myself about my life and work in Aleppo.\nMost of \u201cYalla Habibi\u201d has already been rendered into the final layout. I\u2019m happy that I could win the renowned German publishing house Kehrer for my project. If this project reaches its funding goal the book will be off to the printer for proofing, and Kehrer has agreed to publish the book in October 2017. You will, therefore, not have to wait for long to hold a copy of the book in your hands.\nYalla Habibi, book\n  I also feel lucky that the maquette of my photobook has recently been awarded the PX3 Prix de la Photographie Paris 2017 (category: Professional Book, Documentary - Silver).\nBook Details\nformat: 240 x 320 mm (9.5 x 12.6 inch)\nhardcover with printed cover\n152 pages\n85 color photographs\nlanguage: English\nretail price: 40 \u20ac\nessays: Carsten Stormer, Hosam Katan\nIf you have any questions don\u00b4t hesitate to send me a personal message to the following email-address: hosam.abo.fesal@gmail.com\nTo see more of my work you can also refer to my website: www.hosamkatan.com\nWhy crowdfunding?\nIn the last 8 months, I have spent all my energy and money to release this project. Funding the actual production of the photobook (printing, binding, distribution) unfortunately exceeded my budget. That\u00b4s why I need your backing. Your entire funding will go to the production of the photobook.

In order to also materialize my gratitude and appreciation I have crafted reward packages for you containing items and experiences of which some are pictured below. They are designed to, first of all, share the finished book that you have helped to realize as well as single prints of the photographs. Some rewards give you exclusive insights into the development of the project and into my work.\nBut most importantly, I also see this campaign as a way to engage with you. This project is about creating a dialogue about the ongoing conflict in Syria and how people are dealing with it. So let\u2019s keep up the dialogue together! \nDue to the size and the weight of the book and the size of the larger prints I had to add a contribution to the shipping costs for orders from outside of Germany. I have kept this contribution as low as possible while making sure that you will receive your copies and the prints in an impeccable condition. Shipping inside Germany will be free. \n      You need credentials?\nI am very grateful that a large number of photos that will be included in the book have been awarded several prizes, and that I had the opportunity to share and discuss my work at several exhibitions and presentations.\n        Awards\nIan Parry Special Award 2014 & the Ian Parry Award 2015 (category: highly commended)\nannual Andrei Stenin International Press Photo Contest 2015\ngrand price at the IAFOR Documentary Photography Award 2015\nNannen Preis for journalism 2016 (category: special award)\nphotography award at the University of Art and Design in Offenbach 2016\nPX3 Prix de la Photographie Paris 2017 (category: Professional Book, Documentary - Silver & Professional Press, War - Bronze)\nExhibitions (selection)\nIan Parry Exhibition, 2015 (London, England)\n\u201eGuerre en contraste\u201c, 2016 (Aix-en-Provence, France)\nMuseum of Modern Art, 2016 (Frankfurt, Germany)\n\u201eLes enfants d\u2019Alep\u201c, 2016 (Marseille, France)\n\u201eHumans of Syria: Stories of daily life and survival\u201c, 2016 (California, USA)\nOstrava Photo festival, 2017 (Ostrava, Czech Republic)\nPresentations & Workshops (selection)\nAix-Marseille University, 2016 (Aix-en-Provence, France)\nDeutsche B\u00f6rse Photography Foundation, 2016 (Frankfurt, Germany)\nInstitute for Interdisciplinary Research on Conflict and Violence, 2017 (Bielefeld, Germany)\nWorld Press Photo Exhibition, 2017 (Willy-Brandt-Haus Berlin, Germany)\nWorkshop on smartphone photography, organized by the German Association for Photography, 2016 (Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Photographie e.V., Mannheim, Germany)\nIn the press\n\u201egripping, vivid, personal\u201c (German Missions in the United States)\n\u201eWith his feeling for the right moment, Hosam Katan creates impressive images from the perspective of an immediate observer that go beyond the pure documentation of events.\u201c (Deutsche B\u00f6rse Photography Foundation)\n\u201eHis pictures are oppressive, full of sympathy and devoid of facile voyeurism.

This exhibition is a response to the need for engaging with the multiplicity of difference in order to highlight the fundamental fact that exclusion of ethnic difference is ignorant and a danger to all of us.\nWomen of colour often speak of feeling excluded from the discourse of feminism because western ideals of female emancipation are the ideals placed onto women around the world. The term feminism itself has become bound in these problematics when it should speak for all the varied expressions of female emancipation. The added \u201cs\u201d to feminism, accordingly, symbolises this importance of engaging with pluralities of expression akin to the practice of intersectional feminism. Women are the many, not a monolith and it is the objective of Feminisms to demonstrate this. The exhibition focuses on communication and collaboration. It is our intention to question and to open up ideas difference rather than providing absolute answers, which in the past, have only caused more issues by excluding the lived experience of actual people.\nWe have amazing female artists working in collaboration with us who through varying multidisciplinary ways, some more literal and others more abstractly explore identity formation and articulation, both as women of the 21st century and as women who identify with the Arab & Muslim diasporas.  \nFeminisms x The Arab and Muslim Diaspora will take place with your help between the 24th and 26th of August 2017 at Protein Studios in Shoreditch, London.\nThe exhibition will include a private view on Thursday evening, with free entry for all. Please note: registration is required to ensure we can fit you all in.\nProtein Studios, Shoreditch\nThe show will include film work, photography, sculpture, installation and projections. We will work to ensure all of our backers receive documentation of the event including the opening night and installation shots of the works so that those of you who are unable to attend still get a chance to see what you have supported!\nThe confirmed artists for the exhibition (with more in conversation):\nMa\u00efmouna Guerresi \nOur first confirmed artist for the show explores Islamic faith as a converted Muslim woman through multimedia works exploring the natural and the fantastic with spiritual connotations. \nMa\u00efmouna Guerressi - Montagne Nere\n Yumna Al-Arashi\nYumna, a photographer of Yemeni and Egyptian heritage, who grew up in the U.S explores identity and relationships to faith, displacement and belonging in varying ways, often with strong political undertones. We are extremely excited to have the opportunity to show her latest and first foray into film, Shedding Skin. \nYumna Al-Arashi, Northern Yemen\n  Lilian Nejatpour \nLilly Nejat, is a British Iranian artist who graduated from Goldsmiths last year. Working conceptually she is currently interested in exploring the ways in which the digital feeds into our identities. We have been in conversations about a potential installation that is a response to her own interaction with her faith and technology. \nLilian Nejatpour\nSanaa Hamid\nSanaa Hamid has in the past done a Kickstarter funded project named \"My Body is Not your Battleground\" where she explored the realities of growing up as a young woman in Pakistan. The specifics works we will be using are still being discussed, but all of her works confidently resonate with our intent to explore the personal and how it reflects in the communicative. \nSanaa Hamid, My Body is Not Your Battlefield\n  Maha Alasaker\nWith projects using the hashtag #ResistanceisFemale, Maha's work undoubtedly resonates with our insistence on the fact that resistance can come from women being stereotypically determined as passive. \nMaha Alasaker, Belonging\n                   Furthermore, we are both keen to explore art events away from the gallery circuit, given that this project underlying intentions are socially engaged, it needs to engage with wider audiences.\nIt is however costly to use such a space, and through working with artists from so many corners of the world, the shipping of art works and regular production costs from printing, to framing, and constructing items for installations, all add up very quickly.\n24th August -  Evening Private View including drinks reception\n25th August - A Panel talk which will hopefully be led by the wonderfully articulate Yumna Al-Arashi, along with other artists and thinkers within the field to further the critique we are trying to generate. \n26th August - (Not yet confirmed) Zine making workshop to promote collaborative and non-corporately structured creative processes\n27th August - Ticketed screening of 'Persepolis' at Moth Club's 'Deeper into Movies'. All proceeds will go to a charity related to our cause. \nThis project is very close to our hearts; we have been working on it to explore how we can work collaboratively in visual culture and art to diminish discrimination and stereotyping views of particular identities.\nAs aspirational curators and thinkers within the visual and academic fields, we feel the urgency to organise in a way that moves beyond party politics. \nThe visual realm can prove to be a powerful tool for activism, and we see this project as one that encourages an exploration of difference in dialogue. For us, dialogue is the essential tool for opening up the closed minds that still pervade our supposedly liberal society.\nThe space, Protein Studios in East London's Shoreditch, allows for us to engage with various audiences, from those who typically seek out art events and those who are interested in the cultures we are exploring, to those who usually attend Protein's various pop ups and culturally rich events.\nProtein has a rich history of working with great brands and hosting some incredible events including \"Signed For Syria\" and BBH's \"She Lights Up the Night\". Furthermore Protein's high profile as an innovative creative agency in the centre of London's creative hub make them a great space to be collaborating with, the location means we will gain a footfall that is outside of our projected audience but the space is also has an incredible in its size and scope, allowing us to place a large number of artists together in a group show. \nFurthermore, we are both keen to explore art events away from the gallery circuit, given that this project underlying intentions are socially engaged, it needs to engage with wider audiences.\nIt is however costly to use such a space, and through working with artists from so many corners of the world, the shipping of art works and regular production costs from printing, to framing, and constructing items for installations, all add up very quickly.\nFinancial breakdown:\n\u00a31000 agreed fee for hiring Protein Studios for the three days.\n\u00a3300 production costs for printing posters, exhibition booklets, stickers and leaflets to market the exhibition and to give back to our backers. \n\u00a3200 for organising a catering service which we're hoping is a particular chef focusing on palestinian food to essentuate the act of giving and inviting in.\n\u00a3100 for any installational material to put the exhibition up/electronic material for exhibtion \n\u00a3100 to build and create material for our reading corner to be held during the exhibition to include academia within the exhibition contex\n\u00a3300 to compensate artists for materials, production, as well as travel to the exhibition and panel talk for our London based artists.\nThis is a non-profit project, for the artists and us as curators and therefore all donations through this campaign will go to being able to actualise this and to paying for space and production costs. Because we will not sell any of the art works - to essentialise the importance of the message rather than any profit - our compensation to our amazing artists would come from you allowing us to pay for all production costs that they will encounter.\nGoing above our goal would result in being able to make the exhibition even stronger, compensating our artists more, as well as a potential starter for the next exhibition of the project.\nThey are all doing this for the importance of the cause but it's difficult being an artist and doing things for free and we want to make sure they are not left in a difficult situation.\nPlease feel free to email us any questions/ideas/critique - we are here to open up discussion and contestation and we want to make this the best it can possibly be!\nYour help would be eternally appreciated. We hope this message and the ideas that shaped this exhibition can allow us to move beyond the ways in which our society is moving away from inclusion and equality for all, which should be the fundamental values that determine humanity in our global society.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe actualisation of the exhibition is inevitably challenging in terms of organising the multidisciplinary approaches that this show is working with, for example, the careful way we need to consider the use of sound and images, in a way that invites the audience to think with and communicate with us rather than being passive spectators. This is something we are continuously working with and all the artists' work has been carefully selected to create an almost utopian landscape where all these works meet and despite differing in so many ways complement each other and produce a unique dialogue.\n\nAs with any exhibition or project with a physical event which here is the three-day exhibition, things can happen last minute that complicates things. However, we are surrounded with helpful loving people all passionate about this project and happy to jump in at any point to help us if needed. Additionally, with the support of Protein as a sponsor for the event and with both of us having gallery experience in the past we have a great network of support and individual strength and determination to take on any challenges that may arise.\n\nThe topic we are broaching with this exhibition is a complicated and sensitive one, thus we run the risk of excluding important additions to the dialogue we are trying to generate, however as aspirational curators and theorists we understand the importance of contingency and confliction, our zine which will be produced at the end of the show will be able to raise the concerns that we may find have been left out.\n\nAnother way of approaching the issue of what the exhibition actually communicates and might end up leaving out, is the focus on the continuous process of learning, seeing, communicating and collaborating. We will discuss these questions and many more in a panel talk with some of the artists and other thinkers in order to try and move beyond just the exhibition itself onto a wider context.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Thank you message", "descp": "Your \u00a35 donation will get you a personal thank you email from us, explaining why we think this project is so important and how thankful we are for your support.\nINCLUDES:\nThank you message", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2017"}], "stat": ["13 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "Mimosa flower seeds", "descp": "For backers donating \u00a310 to the project we will arrange to have Mimosa flower seeds sent to you.

I believe community should be at the core of every product.\nWhat I'm really excited about is our future vision to create a supportive social network through features like sending encouragement and positivity.\nCommunity features (Opt-in)\nSend virtual flowers\nTend to your friends gardens\nCommunity Support Gardens (Imagine doing self-care tasks to help a virtual garden grow, but with friends!)\nAlthough it is not on our launch roadmap, if our goals are exceeded it will become a top priority.\nHi buds, I\u2019m Amber and I build online communities people love.\nI\u2019m formerly the founder of Femsplain, creative strategist for Hillary Clinton, Tumblr, and was once the social media manager for Denny\u2019s Diner... but that's another story.\nThis was the happiest, and lowest emotional point of my life.\nWhile working on the campaign, time management took a back-seat to work, and things like remembering to brush my teeth or drink water became really difficult. My emotional and physical wellness hit an all-time-low.\nAfter it ended, I took a few months to find a healthier headspace and receive support from my communities. That\u2019s when I learned the importance of keeping self-care tasks at top of mind.\nI searched the marketplace and came up with nothing but overwhelming habit tools that I inevitably lost the motivation to fulfill. What I needed were tools to reliably \u201ccheck-in\u201d with myself - ones that wouldn\u2019t shame me if I forgot, but encourage me to stay accountable with gentle notifications.\nThe only thing that seemed to be good for me was following people on social media who advocated for self-care, creating a system for myself, and holding myself accountable with reminders.\nEventually I figured if I couldn\u2019t find the perfect tools for me, I would just build them.\nFor development, I've been working with the Lickability team. It's a small iOS software studio in New York. Their team has worked on apps for The New Yorker, Grouper, Meetup, and others.\nIs wellness at work something your company cares about? Aloe can be the perfect companion in many tech forward office environments. Teams can encourage one another to keep their emotional wellbeing at top-of-mind, creating a happier more productive environment to work in.

Here you'll find all the hit trans content you crave: the weird stuff, the stuff that goes to uncomfortable places, the stuff that highlights little-known kinks and contradictions in the trans experience, and most importantly, the stories about trans people having a good, maybe sad time. \nBig talk! But what does it mean in practice? Here's a sampling of the stories in We're Still Here:\nAn evening discussing the terrors of Donald Trump at a Japanese bar for trans men\nA trans woman uses MDMA (with complex results)\nA trans woman visits her grandmother for Christmas (with complex results)\nVisual essay on sex work, trans masculinity, and testosterone \nA practical guide to using paganism to navigate workplace terror \nTrans women pilot giant robots with impeccable synch ratios \nToxic masculinity haunts a friendship between a butch lesbian and trans man \nA devotional essay about angels beyond gender or understanding \nTwo trans women named Sweetness and Lightning blow up a car, watch Akira, and live happily ever after\nIf none of these appeal to you, that's okay: we\u2019ve assembled roughly 300 pages of stories from creators both emerging and established, all of them driven by effective narrative, gorgeous art, and sardonic whimsy.

In the mainstream comics world, one of us in an anthology can too easily stand in for all of us--assuming that there's an effort to include us at all. Our hope is that this book will showcase just how diverse the body of work trans creators are doing actually is (and that it'll make it easier for future books that propose alternate, maybe better takes on what's interesting in trans comics work to exist.) \nYour pledges also help to forward the conversations between artists and their work that we need. I mean really, you guys: being trans can get lonely! And we mine some of those lonely experiences in our work, sometimes in isolation from the cis creators and friends who're working right beside us. This is why having trans friends, for a trans person, is vital. Being connected to the work of fellow creators who're hacking away at the same problems is no less vital: makes life better and proposes new possibilities and solutions all at once.\nLet us get less high-minded, though! If you back this project, we can pay each of the creators involved in this book. This is not negligible! Additionally, for those emerging trans artists we feature here, you're helping to provide needed publication credits and credentials that make it easier to build careers in the editorial gatekeeper-rich comics world. \nAdditionally: once the book is successfully financed and we've made back our production and editorial costs, we intend to donate some of the proceeds from each copy of the book sold to Trans Assistance Project (https://www.transassistance.org/) and Sylvia Rivera Law Project (https://srlp.org/). By helping to finance this book, you make it easier for us to do that effectively. \nWe've got you covered! :D Most of the money we're raising will go to cover the costs of printing the book, and to pay the artists. \nOur base page rate for finished art from contributors, at the present moment, is $25/page. At roughly 300 pages of artwork, that's going to be around $7,500 in artist payments. Obviously this is not nothing! (But it\u2019s short of what we\u2019d like to be able to pay--see the section on stretch goals below.)\nBeyond that, the money will go to covering the costs of printing the book itself, as well as shipping copies of the book to contributors everywhere. Additionally, we\u2019re raising money to pay some of the incidental costs of production (including ISBNs, printers\u2019 proofs, and a book cover.)\nHere\u2019s a full breakdown:\n$7500: Artist fees\n$6000: Printing & drop shipping (~1000 copies, 6\" x 9\" and estimated 304 pages, full-color PB)\n$2000: Shipping + Miscellaneous fees\n$1500: Kickstarter + payment processing fees\nTotal: $17000.\nWe will have more information about this once we've launched--the first priority is to get to $17,000! But at present, the rough expectation is that stretch goals will happen roughly every $2,500 to $3,000 above the initial goal, and each stretch goal will result in the artists' pay rate being increased by about $5/page across the board. This means that most of the stretch goal money will, to the extent that it's possible, go directly to the artists. We'll have more information on this as soon as possible.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe began working on this anthology way back in summer of 2016. We spent most of that year and the early months of 2017 carefully assembling our list of contributors (both from solicitations and from an open call for submissions, to try to get as many creators as possible on board.) As we prepare this Kickstarter text, the bulk of the work on the anthology is underway, with several of the finished pieces already received and others in process, with delivery expected through July and August 2017 and a projected pub date of either very late 2017 or very early 2018. \n\nBoth editors have published professionally for some time, and it's a given--especially with fifty-six artists!--that delays will be inevitable! But we've built expected delays into our editorial and production timelines, and at present we\u2019re on track to meet all of our deadlines for finishing the editorial and production work by early Fall 2017.\n\nIn terms of the risks of the Kickstarter itself: both the editors of We're Still Here have previously published successfully Kickstarted anthologies (ALPHABET from Stacked Deck Press and Nerve Endings: The New Trans Erotic from Instar Books.) Believe me that we are both *very, very aware* of the potential challenges involved with running a successful Kickstarter and fulfilling rewards to all backers!

Pussy Riot, together with the award-winning, London-based theatre company Les Enfants Terribles, is working on a breakthrough immersive theatre project that will open in London this November.\nThis wild theatrical experience will allow the audience to become a participant, experiencing exactly what Pussy Riot went through during our imprisonment - from the original Church performance, to the court trial and prison cells. We're going to recreate Russian courtrooms, a real Russian labour colony, solitary confinement cells, priests who shout about banning abortions and many more absurd, but real-life things that exist in Russia today.\nThe audience will actually get the chance to re-live each one of these experiences themselves, learning what it means to be a political opponent in Russia today. We\u2019ll take you on a journey from the cathedral altar deep into the vaults of the Kremlin itself. Hopefully, this is a journey that you\u2019ll only have to make once in your life.\nWe're hoping that this production will be funded by regular people from around the world who are excited about the idea of political immersive theatre, and we need your help! In order to ensure its launch we need to pre-fund this high-tech production - and fast. All the money raised will be spent on renting the space, the set design, employing actors and staff for the show\u2019s 6-week run and making those rooms in London look exactly like solitary confinement cells in the Russian prison I did my time in.\nThis is an important project that has immense educational value, especially given the trying times in which we are living and an increasingly scary political world order. If we do it right, the production is set to be mind-blowing.\nWe only have four weeks, let\u2019s do this!\nPussy Riot stickers\nThe Connor Brothers print\nThe BEAUTIFUL T-shirt\nREVOLUTION series print by Amanita\nPussy Riot T-Shirt\nRussian Alphabet Colouring Book\n                              Pussy Riot print by Jonas Akerlund\nOriginal Pussy Riot print\nPrint by Amanita (click for more information)\nThe creators of the show from Les Enfants Terribles Theatre Company have this to say about the project:  \n\"Creating an immersive and detailed world is an inherently expensive proposition but something we believe is important in order to truly transport audiences into a realistic environment that fully serves the Pussy Riot story. Now is a perfect time to remind audiences what actually happened and how one\u2019s basic human rights and freedom of expression can be taken away at any point.\"\nLes Enfants Terribles Theatre company are an award-winning London based company known for their innovative productions that vividly bring exciting worlds to audiences all around the world. Their focus on immersive shows brought to us such successful shows as \"Alice's Adventures Underground\", \"Dinner at the Twits\" and \"The Games Afoot\".\nProducer of the show, Alexandrina Markvo, explains the inspiration behind the project as follows: \n\"Our goal is not just to create a breakthrough piece of theatre, but to develop something that can promote the cause of human rights protection, educate people about the problems in Russian legal and judicial processes and give audiences an idea of how fragile our seemingly safe society actually is.\" \nCreative director Alexandrina Markvo founded the London-based company Bird&Carrot, which specialises in theatre, music and visual arts. B&C works on a wide spectrum of artistic projects involving not only world-famous performers, but also those who are just starting out on their creative journeys. What the company values above all is freedom of creative expression. Markvo's previous production credits include Brodsky/Baryshnikov at the Apollo Theatre in 2017, Boris Grebenschikov concerts at the Royal Geographical Society, Zemfira at the V&A in 2008.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re going to be 100% honest. \n\nOur biggest risk is that the show will not happen if we fail to achieve our funding goal. This is a genuine possibility - it\u2019s hard to convince people that they should sponsor theatre - which is why we need as much help as we can get! So please, if you are not able to pledge money towards the project, share this page with your family, friends and instagram followers. \n\nPlease scroll down for a more detailed Q&A, answering questions about costs and the production itself.\n\n**********************************************************************************************\n\n\nQ: Why do you need this amount of money? What is it going to be spent on?\n\nA: In order to make an impact and to powerfully draw the spectator into the action, immersive theatre is usually a very high tech, high cost production. Just take a look at this trailer for Les Enfants Terribles' current show: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NC70wHBwuWA\n\nFunds will go towards the intricate set design, costumes, necessary licenses, lighting and special effects, virtual reality technology and other technologies used in immersive theatre.\n\nSo that more people get the chance to see and learn from our production we are aiming to secure the show at the venue for a 6-week run. This entails the longer employment of actors, technicians and other staff: employing people at proper rates is very important to us. On top of this, we are renting the space for a longer period of time. \n\nThe more money we can raise, the better and more exciting the production will be! \n\nQ: Why don't you just give the money raised to political NGOs working in Russia? Surely this is a better use of the money?\n\nA: We already run an NGO, Zona Prava http://zonaprava.com/en/ - an advocacy group which is entirely dedicated to raising awareness about the prison system and prisoners in Russian today. We also run our own media organisation, Media Zona, https://zona.media/ . I guess most of you reading this won't have heard of these organisations or the work that they do - and that's the point. We want to educate more people about the harsh realities facing Russians today (as well as other prisoners across the world), realities that given the current world political order could potentially spread to the West itself very soon. Freedom of speech is a luxury \u2014 we need to powerfully and tangibly remind people of that in a way that they are not used to.\n\nQ: What happens if you don't raise the money?\n\nA: If we don't reach our \u00a360,000 goal we won't see a single penny. Backers credit cards will never be charged - this only happens once a campaign is successful. This is why we need you to share this page and encourage your friends and family to pledge some money so that we can see this ambitious, exciting project become a reality. It would be such a great shame if this theatrical collaboration was not realised and we truly believe that people would miss out on a unique and groundbreaking experience. \n\nQ: Will Pussy Riot themselves be performing in the show?\n\nA: Yes, Nadya will be performing in a selection of shows.\n\nQ. Is the production suitable for children?\n\nYes, definitely - however, we would recommend that the production is suitable for children of 11-12 and older. We actively encourage kids to participate. We are hoping to organise school visits and to provide educational packs and brochures. The pack will include details about the most famous cases of prisoner abuse in different countries.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "BITCH!", "descp": "Become an Honorary Bitch!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["184 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "NO RIOT - NO PUSSY", "descp": "Become a part of our Facebook photo campaign.

We have been invited by Burning Man to install on the Playa our sculpture of Xochipilli to celebrate a deep cultural trip in the desert of Nevada this year.  \nWith support we will be able to take this installation for a week to Black Rock City, AUG 27\u2014SEPT 4, where it will become a temple of creativity, radical self expression, plastic arts, visual performances, music and dance. \n  PLAY\n\n 3D-scan and video by Dimensi\u00f3n N\nBased on the 3D-scanned model (by Dimensi\u00f3n N) of the real statue currently housed in the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City, it was designed and built at KanoShop.mx, LED lights programmed by OOSPP. \nGIF by KanoShop.mx \nBoth inside and outside, the sculpture is designed to give a new spiritual, physical and mental experience. It's our own contemporary interpretation of the cult that the sacred image of the original figure of Xochipilli carries within. \nThis piece has been conceived to become an interactive image of the God that embraces all the artistic expressions as sacred.\nAfter Burning Man we're hoping to present Xochipilli at various events and venues in Mexico and worldwide. Its elaborately processed polygonal white skin will become a canvas for new media artists. \n  mapping by Ze Effect   \nXOCHIPILLI STATUE \nphoto of the Statue of Xochipilli (National Museum of Anthropology, Mexico City) by @jeremycrandell\nThe original statue is of a single figure seated on a temple-like base, head tilted up, eyes open, jaw tensed, with his mouth half open and his arms opened to the heavens. Both the statue and the base upon which it sits are covered in carvings of sacred and psychoactive organisms including tobacco, mushrooms and various hallucinogenic, inebriating plants, commonly known as \u201cpower plants\u201d (plantas de poder). \ngraphic design by Rodrigo Kano \nXochipilli undoubtedly represents not simply the Prince of Flowers but more specifically the Prince of Inebriating Flowers, including the mushrooms that, in Nahuatl poetry, were called \"flowers that intoxicate\". Known as curative and sacred, these plants were used in shamanic rituals for \u201chealing the soul\u201d and making people \u201cconnect\u201d \u2014 which, we believe, is the main purpose of our artwork.  \nWHO WE ARE  \nlogo by Mocre \nCollaboration is a mode of radical self-expression. Be a part of Xochipeople crew, make your contribution today! \nAny kind of your support will:\n\u25cf Make makers make\u2026 \u25cf Provide more opportunities for interactive art and related events \u25cf Inspire new ideas and actions through art \u25cf Make the experience of Burning Man accessible to more people in Mexico \u25cf Make the experience of Mexican culture accessible to more people all over the world \u25cf Provide a nifty reward in return.\nOUR GIFTS\n\u2018The act of gift giving is one of Burning Man\u2019s ten core principles.

You may recall my previous neon installations: You Are Exactly Where You Need To Be, What You Seek is Seeking You, and Stay Present from the past three events. For 2017, I hope to return to the Playa, with a very important message for all of humanity: Everything You Need Is Inside You.\n Imagine: a massive handwritten neon, spanning 13 feet (4m) emitting a subtle turquoise hue across Burning Man\u2019s vast desert-scape. The truism reflects Burning Man\u2019s incredible communal spirit and represents the ancient teachings of the Sufi mystic Rumi - everything you need is inside you. It serves as a reminder to my fellow Burners, and to all human beings, that whilst we are often seeking external comforts, distraction and pleasure, we can harness our full potential by looking inwards: by drawing the strength and wisdom we need from our inner selves. Look no further - All the answers are inside you.\nWith your help, I can bring this installation into fruition. Our goal of $25,000 will support myself and my brilliant team to cover production, power, transportation, installation, and all material costs associated with a large scale structure of this kind in the extreme desert environment.\nHERE IS OUR BUDGET BREAKDOWN:\nIf we meet our goal of $25,000 then $6,600 will go to the the Kickstarter fees and rewards. That leaves us with $18,400 for the project.\n25K Budget\nNeon production and crating - $7,500\nGenerator $1,000\nMaterials $1,000\nmetal frame and fence - $2,000\nInstallers crew and labor - $3,000\nTemporary storage - $400\nTransportation - $3,500\nRewards - $4,500\nKickstarter fees - $2,100\nEach backer will receive a special thank you and exclusive Olivia Steele gift, so please take a moment to glance over the column on the right and decide on a pledge level!

The challenges of installing hand blown glass sections piece by piece with the guaranteed elements of heat, wind and sandstorms during the installation are many.

Working with glass and high voltage electrical components lends itself to highly skilled installers, and we\u2019ve got them!\n\nWe have successfully accomplished this twice before, and we've learned a lot from the many obstacles of previous desert installs.

At 40 feet tall and 20 feet long, she will be the largest flamingo sculpture in the world, and probably the most absurd lawn ornament ever constructed. For us, this project is a dream come true, and we're grateful for your help!\nWe're already working hard on construction in San Francisco, in preparation for her debut at Burning Man 2017. There she will act as the centerpiece for various events, including a barbecue, parade, and burlesque show, to name a few. Brave Burners can climb atop her back, a thrilling 28 feet above the Playa floor. Timider Burners can enjoy lawn games on the surrounding astroturf, including bocce, cornhole, croquet, and maybe lawn darts.\nFor updates on build progress with pretty pictures, see the Updates tab.\nFind us on The Web, Facebook, or Instagram.\nTo express our gratitude for your generous donation, we have rewards to offer:\n  P-Rex will have a skeleton of wood and steel, skin of fiberglass, and legs of steel. The body will consist of two major pieces, constructed in San Francisco and combined in Black Rock City. We're working with a professional structural engineer (and Burner) on the design, so she should be rock solid.\nWe plan to transport P-Rex (including lawn and fence) to Burning Man via two stake bed trucks. These are three-axel vehicles, and no special driver's license is needed, so our volunteers will drive.\nOur costs break down roughly like this:\nWe're lucky to get build space, some equipment, and lots of volunteer time for free.\n The party doesn't need to stop with a simple giant flamingo. With more funds, there is so much more we can do:\n$15,000: Tutu. Tutu Tuesday is a time-honored tradition on the Playa, and with some extra scratch, we can outfit our bird in a giant rainbow tutu.\n$20,000: Laser Eyes. With more money, Mingo can light up the night sky with wacky fluttering lasers shooting from both eyes.\n$25,000: Onesie. Wow! With this much scratch, we can also celebrate Onesie Wednesday. We'd love to hear your ideas for the onesie; so far giraffe is our favorite.\n$50,000: Pair of Flamingos. Holy Mother! Don Featherstone originally designed two different flamingo poses, and we can build both with this much money.\nP-Rex in Stretch Goal Tutu\n    Josh Zubkoff is the artist and mastermind behind Phoenicopterus Rex.

You can help us reach this goal, which began on the occasion of Lamar\u2019s first solo exhibition at PARTICIPANT INC, NY, and travelled to the San Francisco Art Institute, our publishing partner for this book. \nEncompassing the past ten years of work, the book includes Lamar's most recent project, Funeral Doom Spiritual, which opened in New York to acclaim. As The New York Times described it, \"this otherworldly, goth-tinged projection into the distant future of our violent, racially and sexually charged present offers a space of melancholic, alluring, ultimately stirring reflection.\"\nThe publication will feature artwork, librettos, and lyrics from Lamar\u2019s major works, alongside essays by Sarah Bay-Cheng, Sabin Calvert, T.L. Cowan, Tucker Culbertson, Lia Gangitano, Ron Gregg, Jane Ursula Harris, Brandon Peter Masterman, Hesse McGraw, and Nayelli Portillo; and interviews with Lamar\u2019s twin sister, transgender activist and actress Laverne Cox. Designed by Klaus Kempenaars of xSITE, the design is strongly influenced by pamphlets used for slave auctions and anti-slavery meetings during the Antebellum period. \nISBN 978-0-9802324-9-3. 144 pages, edition of 1500.\nYour support will enable us to complete this publication for launch this Fall 2017.\nIn a moment in which prevailing cinematic depictions offer only narrow historical accounts of subjugation, Lamar remembers well bell hooks' critique of \u201cimages of black men in popular culture that represent them as not only eager to \u2018do it for daddy\u2019 but, even more, as individuals tortured by [\u2026] \u2018unrequited longing for white male love.\u2019\u201d Lamar engages this fictive fantasy and turns it on it's head examining white historical and cultural violent, fetishistic, and cannibalistic acts against black persons as well as white imaginings of blackness via popular culture.\n\u201cFor every person who wants to be free,\u201d Lamar has noted, \u201can exorcism (or process of decolonization) is necessary.\u201d Longing is a part of this process. \nLamar\u2019s work mixes romanticism with horror \u2013 the horror is American white supremacy. At the center of NEGROGOTHICISM is the Negro Antichrist: rock star, blues man, like Screamin\u2019 Jay Hawkins, with a big, operatic voice, and a deep connection to the supernatural. Born in Mobile, Alabama, Lamar draws inspiration from Southern gothic traditions, as well as underground, goth, and post punk music. Lamar states, \u201cFrom the slave ship to the pillory\u2026 on plantations and lynching trees\u2026 within and beyond the prison and the grave\u2026 NEGROGOTHIC binds archive to myth, merging bodily properties with supernatural possession.\u201d\nFounded in 2001 as an educational corporation and not-for-profit alternative space, PARTICIPANT INC seeks to provide a venue in which artists, curators, and writers can develop, realize, and present ambitious projects within a context that recognizes the social and cultural value of artistic experimentation. By encouraging experimentation and project-based exhibitions for artists at many different stages of their careers, PARTICIPANT INC strives to address the changing context of alternative arts presenting and to respond responsibly to the diverse practices of artists.\n     Why Kickstarter?\nWhile PARTICIPANT receives annual funding for our exhibitions and public programs from government, foundation, and individual sources, our publishing initiatives require additional support, which is not a given.

We have a decades-long working relationship with Kempenaars, with whom we\u2019ve produced several publications, in addition to all organizational and exhibition-related graphics and our website. \n\nThe most common risk we have experienced in the past is time. Books can take a lot longer than expected to print, generally due to cost overages after the Kickstarter campaign is over. These can include increased printing, shipping, and distribution costs. Our diversified funding sources for this project guarantee that unforeseen expenses can be met.

We are a think tank, an arts collective, and we mix activism, urbanism and creativity. We want us all to be able to live together more equitably. \n\nAfter a year of research and a few performances, we are producing a two-week celebration of our neighborhood at Abrons Arts Center this fall, and we need your support. \nWHO IS PERFECT CITY?\nPerfect City Working Group, 2017\nPerfect City includes: Gisela Andras, Jamel Ayala, Mallory Catlett, Angela Choi, Grace Chung, Tyler Diaz, Jim Findlay Jay Koo, Jaime Maitin, Gabriella Marrero, Nola Sporn Smith, Jahmorei Snipes, Tiffany Zorrilla. \nWe are a intelligent, rowdy and discursive mix of idea-makers, art-makers and thinkers who care a lot about this place. We all have a history with this neighborhood. Some of our families have been here for generations, some of us moved here and changed the place when we arrived. \nThe project was started by playwright and Guggenheim Fellow Aaron Landsman, who saw a pattern in the cities and neighborhoods where he lived and worked. Public officials tout their metro areas' \"sustainability,\" pointing to things like farmers' markets, bike lanes and other conveniences that speak to progressive values, but the cities themselves become unaffordable to all but the wealthy. \nFrom our research with urban planners, we learned that city kids don't usually go into the planning fields, and most cities are planned by suburbanites.  So we set out to build a project, a movement and a sea change. Cities by city people. \nWHY US?\nPeople who grow up in cities are born urban planners. We have to be. We ride public transit from day one; we use creative strategies to navigate invisible and visible boundaries between neighborhoods; we know how to avoid and how to belong. Somehow, though, our needs and our narratives are not at the table when decisions are being made about zoning and planning.  So Perfect City is bringing our own chairs, making a new table, whatever it takes. \nZoned Out! Book Launch at Abrons Arts Center, sponsored by Perfect City, 2017\n WHAT YOU'RE SUPPORTING\nPerfect City's launch includes two weeks of programming  at Abrons, in their main gallery, and in the Experimental Theater. Our programming will include guided Urban Observer walking tours, live rock and roll, mapping exercises, and talks with activists, artists and more.\nHere's what your contribution funds:\nArtists' and speakers' fees for panels and shows\nAttendance at all events is pay-what-you-can \nUrban Observer Walks and Avoidance Mapping \nYou're Next printing and production \nThe Perfect City launch is about making room for views that are often cleaned up when the city is gentrified. \nOUR NEIGHBORHOOD\nWe\u2019re based on the Lower East Side and Chinatown. Even if you are not from here, a lot of families in the US have a history with this place. It\u2019s like a microcosm of America: diverse, vibrant, complicated, rich in history. And it\u2019s changing. Fast. Our neighborhood feels like it\u2019s disappearing before our eyes. \nLower East Side, Photo by Haruka Sakaguchi, 2017 all rights reserved\nAnd even if you\u2019ve never set foot on our sidewalks, you\u2019ll recognize what\u2019s happening here because it\u2019s probably happening in your city too, no matter where you live. \nWhen diverse neighborhoods are rebranded as luxury destinations and unique small businesses are replaced by cookie-cutter galleries and boutiques, it\u2019s time to come up with a new way to stay.\n20 YEARS\nYes. \nThere are a lot of great art projects that try to change the world in a month, in a year, or maybe two. Perfect City is saying that the problems are big, the solutions have to be, too, and it's going to take some time. \nWe have big goals - we want our working group members to run for public office, to become planners and architects themselves, and to change laws and culture. That isn't something we can do overnight. This is the beginning. \nWHAT WE DO\nWe meet every week - we learn about zoning, planning and displacement, and we create projects with what we find out. Here are a few things we're working on for the fall:\nFrom \"Original New Yorkers\" By Haruka Sakaguchi, (c) all rights reserved\nORIGINAL NEW YORKERS \u2013 Perfect City working group member's Haruka Sakaguchi\u2019s award-winning photography and text series of New Yorkers\u2019 experiences with displacemenet is beautiful, stark and challenging. It will be in the main Abrons Arts Center gallery for our fall launch. \nURBAN OBSERVER WALKS \u2013 working group member and Abrons Staffer Jaime Matlin has been watching the city evolve since he was a kid. He has a three-generation lineage on the Lower East Side. At our fall launch he\u2019ll be creating unique observational walks in the neighborhood, which will reveal hidden sites of safety, contemplation and creativity. You\u2019ll leave knowing how to be an urban observer, whether it\u2019s your first time here or you\u2019ve been here the whole time.\nWorking group member Jamel Ayala teaching Avoidance Mapping at Crossing The Line 2016\n AVOIDANCE MAPPING - this came out of a meeting this fall. It's a way to identify unconscious bias, unearth the sophisticated ways we know about where to go and who to steer clear of, and how there are many cities mapped onto one concrete location. Avoidance Mapping was recently the subject of a workshop with architects and planners at the Architectural League, and a forthcoming article on Urban Omnibus.\nRoundtable Performance, (c) Paula Court, all rights reserved.\nROUNDTABLE PERFORMANCES - Last fall, as part of the Crossing The Line Festival, presented by FIAF/The French Institute, we presented roundtable performances for audiences that included our neighbors, visitors from Berlin and other cities, planners and arts audiences. These roundtables included facts and figures about gentrification and zoning, provocations to become better activists, as well as songs, multilingual dialogues and conversations. This form will be part of our fall roll-out at Abrons. \nPerfect City Roundtable Performance, photo by Paula Court (c) all rights reserved\nYOU\u2019RE NEXT -  working group member Gabriella Marerro was walking down Grand Street one day, remarking on the businesses that had closed or were about to. She looked at her favorite Cuchifritos and thought, \"You're next.\" At the hipster coffee shop: \"You're next.\" At the pizza spot. At the florist, the gallery, the affordable housing. And so we came up with this campaign we'll be rolling out this fall at our launch. You're Next is a poster made by visual artist Daniel Bejar for store windows throughout the neigborhood, and a series of conversations among business owners so that we can all see ourselves in solidarity with each other, rather than in competition. Maybe you're next to join us!\n****\nABOUT HENRY ST SETTLEMENT/ABRONS ARTS CENTER\nFor over 124 years, Henry Street Settlement has served its community in the Lower East Side to create opportunity, unity, conversation, and a well-balanced life. Henry Street continues to explore effective and adventurous programming like Perfect City to fulfill this mission. By incorporating a variety of tactics, Perfect City continues to bring unity, voice, and strength to residents of the LES. As with Henry Street Settlement and Abrons Arts Center, Perfect City uses multi-disciplinary, layered, bold, and visionary programs as the vehicle to drive conversations among people who would not otherwise discuss their similar and different viewpoints. Together, HSS and Perfect City can create synchronization between housing, health, education, urban planning, and the arts to keep the LES neighborhood dynamic, welcoming, and empowered. Henry Street/Abrons Info:\nAs one of the nation\u2019s first settlement houses, Henry Street Settlement was established in 1893 with a mission to open doors of opportunity for Lower East Side residents and other New Yorkers through social services, arts, and health care programs. Each year, HSS continues to help over 60,000 New Yorkers reach their full potential through innovative, inclusive, integrated, and high-impact programs and services throughout our 17 sites on the LES. HSS serves this community through four program areas: Health & Wellness, Transitional & Supportive Housing, Education & Employment, and Visual & Performing Arts.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven if we don't reach our goal, the fall launch of Perfect City will happen as planned. We'll give our time generously, we'll raise money through more traditional means, and we will rely on Abrons Arts Center for more in-house production help; we already have a small fee in the bank from Abrons.\n\nThe whole budget for our fall launch is $36,000. Abrons is contributing $5,000 in cash and another $7,000 in in-kind support (free space, publicity, and production help). Aaron Landsman's Guggenheim Fellowship will pay for his time on the fall launch. \n\nPerfect City founder Aaron Landsman has a long history of getting large and small-scale performance and other works done. He's a current Guggenheim Fellow, a former Princeton Arts Fellow, and has received major awards and commissions in the US and abroad. Perfect City has received grants already from the Graham Foundation, LMCC, The Rubin Foundation and several individual contributors. We'll be going back to these and other funders this summer. \n\nThe $11,000 we are trying to raise here is both significant to our bottom line and an important signal that arts activism, and the voices of people in this neighborhood, are worth supporting.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you", "descp": "We give you deep gratitude from all of us, and put your name on our website wall of donors.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2017"}], "stat": ["11 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "The above PLUS a listen", "descp": "The Lower East Side is home to artistic talent like nowhere else.\nLink to working group member Tiffany Zorrilla's song \"Emerald Eyes\", created for our first Performance Roundtable last year.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["10 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "The above PLUS a roundtable script", "descp": "Curious about our process?

Help us print the first issue of BRUNCHCLUB! \nHello Mr. is a magazine about men who date men. We are a collective of artists and writers that reflect the diverse perspective of the LGBTQ community. When we launched in 2012, we sought to create a platform for emerging talent and unheard voices, and add to the momentum for more inclusive representation in media. With your help through our first Kickstarter, we brought Hello Mr. into the world.\nEight issues later, we are expanding that mission, and introducing an artist residency that propels the creators of tomorrow. We\u2019re calling it The Issues. \nUsing our global distribution experience and mentorship from industry leaders, we are providing the tools and resources to get new ideas from queer voices off the ground. We think of it as an academy for editors, art directors, and media-makers of the future. With your support, we will help launch our first magazine-in-residence, and distribute it inside the next issue of Hello Mr.\nMeet our first magazine-in-residence!\nBRUNCHCLUB is about the quest for truth, culture, and diversity within the LGBTQ community. The creators, Colby Anderson and Ernest Macias, are both 24-year olds and graduates of Texas State University. They are unapologetically \u201cqueer & hungry.\u201d\nOver the last few months, between shifts at McNally Jackson Bookstore in Soho, NYC, we have been working on their first issue which explores the lives of queer POC in unexpected corners of the country. You can expect poetry from the West Texan desert, a day-in-the-life account of a gender queer babe in Ohio, an exploration of the Latinx body in nature, a profile on Costa Rican model, activist, and artist Hazkel, and more.\nWe have a stellar team lined up for this collaboration\u2013\u2013apart from the Hello Mr. team, BRUNCHCLUB is also being mentored by TeenVogue\u2019s Phillip Picardi, Instagram's Jeffrey Gerson and Graphic Designer Nijel Taylor.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nReturning to Kickstarter to launch The Issues residency is the perfect way to remind us of our original mission. We are more than a magazine, we're a community that believes changes happens from the ground up. And coming back as a Kickstarter Gold project helps us raise awareness for the new stories we want to tell with The Issues.\nThe funds raised will support the production costs of BRUNCHCLUB and allow it to be distributed inside the next issue of Hello Mr. later this Summer. And, if we exceed our current goal, Colby and Ernest will also join us at the printing facility to watch their first issue come to life on press!\nWhat about future residents?\nApplications for our next \u201cIssue\u201d will open this Fall. Anyone around the world with a great idea for a magazine will be able to apply. The goal is to produce two zines a year, aligning to the Hello Mr. publishing calendar. However, excess funds from this Kickstarter will also allow us to package our insights resources and develop the curriculum into an online course so anyone can learn how to make a zine too!\nThe role of print is to inform readers of important issues and inspire them to take action. And we believe that our responsibility, as creators, is more important than ever. Don't believe the hype, print is not dead. In fact, its independent presses and zines that continue to stir up social change throughout history. Let\u2019s continue inspiring action together, one issue at a time.\nTimeline\nJune / July - Finishing touches on BRUNCHCLUB & Hello Mr. issue 09\nEarly August - Print and produce the issues!\nLate August - Open applications for our second residency\nEarly September - Shipping begins\nLate September - BRUNCHCLUB launch party in Brooklyn, NY\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Issues is a 12-week residency, designed to fit the publishing calendar of producing two new zines a year.

Additionally, we are keeping the residency open to anyone in the world, so residents will need to be comfortable with remote working styles and be able to communicate ideas effectively across time zones and geography. That said, we\u2019ve definitely learned a lot working through the kinks with BRUNCHCLUB, and feel confident in welcoming the next resident into the fold this Fall.\n\nWe have a lot of experience in the print world already, but should any conflicts occur, our backers will be the first to know!

In other stories, it also symbolizes a politically totalitarian state with a vast bureaucracy. We were inspired by this idea, but wanted to make something new and unique, so we wrote our own myth about a people, living in a harsh desert land, banding together to slay an oppressive murderous creature that lurked beneath the sand, the Nahtaivel. We then used this myth to inform the design of our sculpture, which represents the Nahtaivel in all aspects of its existence. It calls upon the viewer to be conscious of the struggles in their own realm, while recognizing the power of solidarity. You can read the full myth here!\nThe Sculpture\nThe Tomb will consist of three main components: the base, the tower, and the skeleton of the Nahtaivel. The base of the Tomb is an octagonal chamber, composed of faceted panels and gothic inspired archways, all supported by a modular steel structure. The walls of this chamber are decorated with a code, which tells the narrative of the tomb and leads the viewer through its interactive elements. A series of flying buttresses extend out and around this structure, creating the tower, around which the skeleton of the creature will rest. In the center of the tomb the skull of the beast, sits on an alter, and hidden its mouth is a decoder. Participant will use the decoder to translate a code and gain access to secret compartments, full of surprises. To add layer of interactivity, our friends from the House of Yes will be gracing the tomb with their talents during burn week.\n (from left to right, Eric Coolidge Hannah MacDonald & Eric Whitney)\nOur Vision \nBringing a large scale sculpture to Burning Man has been a goal of ours for a long time. As artists and fabricators we have always found inspiration at Burning Man (in the artwork and the incredible landscape) and as a part of the Burning Man community, we have always wanted to contribute and participate in this way. This year\u2019s theme, Radical Ritual, demand some kind of temple, or place of worship, so we put our heads together and brainstormed a list of what this inspired in us.\nWhat we have for you and where the money goes!\n                     Want more than 1 prize? No problem.\nAdd the highest priced item, donate the total for all the items you want. Then send us a message including the list OR wait til we send out survey's at the end of the campaign and select the other gifts you pledged for! If you live in NYC.!\nBudget Break down\nThe Tomb of Nahtaivel is an Honorarium Project, which has recieved partial funding from Burning Man, but we have a long ways to go. You can see what this 20k is going towards.\nBuild Materials- $3,500 \nHardware & Consumables - $1,000\nCNC Work - $3,000\nLighting & Electrical - $2,500 \nPower - $1,000\nHidden Compartment Components - $1,000 \nTransportation - $8,000 \nTotal - $20,000\n__________________________________\n Progress Update\n7/20\nPLAY\n\nAlmost all of the CNC plasma cutting and structural metal work it done! We have gothic arches assembled, and are working on putting the flying buttresses together today. Feels so good! Next week we'll start CNC milling the spine (vertabea by vertabrea) and painting!\n ______________________\n7/23\nGrateful to have Hannah, one of our project leads, back in the shop after two weeks of severe poison ivy! Also we started painting!!!!!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTransportation: This is actually our biggest challenge. We are based in Brooklyn and our goal is to get everything to BRC in one 26ft box truck. This means everything has to pack flat and the total weight of our sculpture and tools has to be as minimal as possible. Those mountains are going to be ROUGH!\n\nTime: We are racing the clock to fabricator all of the intricate peices of the sculpture in time to drive them to Black Rock City. We have an awesome crew of skilled artists and fabricators, but life happens. For example one of our designers got some serious poison oak exposure last week an hasn't been able to help build in a week. Luckily she is stil able to work digitally from home, but loosing a pair of hands at the shop hasn't helped our timeline.\n\nFunding: Erecting a 25 ft scupture in the desert isn't exactly easy, but we're honestly less worried about that than raising the money to do it!

After seven long years of exhaustive production, this 90 minute feature following the proud tradition of old Czech puppet masters is finally nearing completion.\nBut in order to finish its post-production and get Laika out there, we need your help. \n   \u201cLaika\u2019s plot may seem like a fairytale, but it\u2019s far from that. Even though it operates within the realms of the genre, I always need to frame the story with elements from the real world. And some of Laika\u2019s darker undercurrents will definitely speak more to an adult audience.\u201d (Aurel Klimt)\nLife is not easy for Laika, a stray dog living in the outskirts of a freezing Russian city. She spends her days relentlessly scouring the streets for food for her beloved and always hungry pups.\nWinter in Soviet Russia. Laika scavenging for food.\nOne day, she\u2019s captured and handed over to a research institute where she undergoes a drastic and rapid training that transforms her into a space explorer. And off she goes into the unknown, smuggling her pups in her spacecraft.\nSoviet engineers examining their new astronaut.\nOnce they land on a mysterious planet called Qem, they find an extraterrestrial version of paradise.\nMeanwhile, the tough fight of global powers over dominance has only begun. Russia sends its first envoy, astronaut and national hero Yuri Leftkin and another global superpower is soon to follow with their representative \u2013 a greedy specimen called Neil Knockout.\nNeil Knockout (on the left) and Yuri Leftkin.\nSoon, they arrive to Qem and the race to conquer space becomes a battle of rapacious humans and peace-loving inhabitants of the planet.\nYuri Leftkin isn't really a fan of anything extra-terrestrial.\nLaika is a tragic character in the history of space exploration \u2013 a sacrifice to science on a one-way mission to space. She doesn\u2019t die in this film though \u2013 she becomes a heroine in a completely different way.\n \u201cThe main theme of Laika is humankind\u2019s relationship to animals, nature and the entire universe. It\u2019s a topic that defies time and should be the absolute centre of discussion for our entire civilization.\u201d (Aurel Klimt)\n \u201cFor over ten years, I've had the opportunity of seeing Aurel sweat blood on a daily basis. The amount of work, persistence and patience needed to pull this off, to get this far is absolutely incomprehensible. After ten years, he's nearly there and there's just a small step remaining.\u201d (Prof. Ji\u0159\u00ed Kub\u00ed\u010dek, Prague's Film and TV School FAMU)\nAurel instructing Ham (the Chimp) how to move during the banana song.\nIt might escape the viewer at first, but making a stop-motion animated film with puppets, let alone one that spans the length of 90 minutes, is a truly painstaking ordeal. And since Klimt is a true follower of the proud and long-lasting tradition of Czech puppetry established by the likes of Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka and B\u0159etislav Pojar, he's not the one to take shortcuts.\nAnatomy of Ham.\nThe fact that Laika is Czech Republic\u2019s first properly stereoscopic animated film doesn\u2019t exactly make things easier either. And it\u2019s not just a gimmick.\nOlivie, one of the animators, setting up the cave shot.\n\"The technology for this work is a classic animation of puppets with mechanical frames, in environments that are digitally recorded in 3D. It's a fluid connection between the advantages of hand-made animation and the possibilities of state-of-the-art digital technology with immediate control of animation and 3D effects. I feel that using 3D is rather apt for what's basically a work of science-fiction, especially during the scenes in space.\" (Aurel Klimt)\nStephen Chiodo \nOne of the Chiodo Brothers, Stephen is responsible for special effects, clay modelling or animatronics for works like The Simpsons or Team America.\nGiannalberto Bendazzi \nGiannalberto is an animation historian, prolific author, and professor. He is best known for his book Cartoons \u2212 100 Years of Cinema Animation, a comprehensive guide through the history and development of animation worldwide.\n                                                        Laika started off as a puppet play in a small theatre in Prague, Czech Republic, all the way back in 2002. It was a play meant for both children and their parents, who were still able to remember the absurdity and oppressive nature of the previous regime, which Klimt\u2019s play has mocked relentlessly.\n\u201cIt was amazing to be able to receive an immediate feedback from the audience, be able to hone the material over the course of many many repeats. The play was a live organism and a lot of the improvements on the original material can be seen in the film, even though it\u2019s obviously a different format.\u201d (Aurel Klimt)\nNext year, Japanese TV station NHK produced a documentary on B\u0159etislav Pojar and Aurel Klimt and has provided resources for Klimt to film an animated sequence of one of the scenes from the play. That\u2019s now known as Laika\u2019s pilot.\nIn the following years, Klimt has started working on making Laika into a three-part film. Working on an animated film with limited resources is difficult and therefore the progress was rather slow. It was first necessary to acquire and master the various technologies required for this project, for instance, Klimt has spent the entirety of 2009 mastering the science of stereography in order to make his use of the technology as good as it can possibly be.\nThe filming has started in 2010 and hasn\u2019t stopped until now, when the last seconds of the material are being filmed. In terms of resources, that\u2019s taken care of. The post-production though, is a different story. One that needs your help in order to have a happy ending.\nIf all goes well, Laika is set to premiere 3rd November 2017, the 60th anniversary of Laika\u2019s flight into space.\n\u20ac75.000 \u2013 Official soundtrack from the film & Bluray gets a 3D boost\nEvery backer receives a download of the official soundtrack from Laika composed and arranged by Miroslav Wanek and Marek Doubrava. Also, all Blurays will now come in two versions \u2013 2D and 3D for all backers who bought any rewards featuring a Bluray of Laika.\n\u20ac80.000 \u2013 Making of Laika + deleted / bonus scenes\nWe'll automatically add an extensive 'Making of Laika' download to each and every backer. Get ready for an intense behind-the-scenes look into the extensive production of the film. Also, we'll include a download of deleted / extra scenes from the film. \n\u20ac85.000 \u2013 A Director's commentary version of Laika \nWe'll make an extra edition of Laika featuring Aurel Klimt's running commentary on all the parts of the film.\n\u20ac90.000 \u2013 Aurel Klimt's previous films \u2013 digitally restored \nOnce we get past this mark, we'll be able to fully digitize Aurel Klimt's Mashkin Kills Mashkin, The Fall and Bloody Hugo and make them available in HD to all backers who bought the 'Stream Laika in HD' reward and above.\n AUREL KLIMT (*1972) \u2013 screenwriter, director & producer \nLaika\u2019s all-in-one director, producer and scriptwriter Aurel Klimt is an accomplished filmmaker. His mentors include the famous B\u0159etislav Pojar (Lion and the Song, Balablok) or FAMU's Prof. Ji\u0159\u00ed Kub\u00ed\u010dek. His work transcends the label of a mere entertainment for children which is often attributed to animated films and it often includes scathing social commentary.\nHe is used to sitting on multiple chairs when it comes to his film or theatre work \u2013 in the past, he has taken the role of an executive producer, scriptwriter, editor, animator, director, scenographer or sometimes even a set designer. Since 1999, he has been teaching at Prague's Film and TV School FAMU where he also directed the Department of Animation between 2006 and 2015.

These poems address issues crucial to our contemporary and often difficult world. Here Grahn\u2019s steadfast and rhythmic verse directs our eyes to crucial yet often buried tribulations of our times by critiquing white supremacy, honoring battered women, exalting the powers of menstruation, and revealing lateral hostilities among potential allies\u2014all to arouse a meaningful social critique.  \nAs a backer, you will receive not only a copy of this incredible book, but also the knowledge that your support is introducing today\u2019s activists to the champion they never knew they had\u2014a fighter whose work has paved the way for all who followed.\nWho is Judy Grahn?   \n \u201cAnyone who reads Grahn will be changed for life. Repeat: for life.\u201d \n\u2014Alicia Ostriker\nJudy Grahn, copyright 1988 by Robert Giard\nPoet, writer, and cultural theorist, Judy Grahn has been at the forefront of gay and lesbian activism and women\u2019s spirituality movements since the 1960s. Grahn\u2019s works have been a rallying cry for women\u2019s movements since before she was ever published, going viral before the Internet even existed.   \nJudy Grahn set out to be a poet at the age of nine, studying the poetic forms while asking the crucial question, What is poetry for? How does a poem connect with people and add meaning or strength to lives? Along the way she developed a distinct perspective\u2014a fierce song\u2014that is evident in the countless collections, poetic plays, dance dramas, and collaborations with musicians and songwriters she has produced.  \nIn 1999, Judy Grahn\u2019s book Another Mother Tongue served as the major theme of the Seattle Gay Pride Parade. In 1996, the Publishing Triangle, an association of lesbians and gay men in publishing, established an award in her name: The Judy Grahn Award, recognizing the best nonfiction book of the year. In June 2017, she will receive the Fred Cody Award for Lifetime Achievement in Literature and Community Service.\nGrahn\u2019s work has won numerous other awards and honors, including an American Book Review Award, two American Book Awards, a Stonewall (American Library) Award, the Bill Whitehead Lifetime Achievement in Lesbian Letters Award, and two Lambda book awards. She is currently an Associated Distinguished Professor in Integral and Transpersonal Psychology at the California Institute of Integral Studies in San Francisco, where in the 1990s she earned her PhD in Integral Studies. She served as co-director for an MA program in Women\u2019s Spirituality for thirteen years, and for an MFA in Creative Inquiry for five years.\nAdvance Praise for Hanging On Our Own Bones\n\u201cSkin, jail, butterfly, hospital, street, mother, father, blood, war: such words come alive as survivor, witness, and guide. Judy Grahn uses the tried and true heart of the ballad to explore the socially unsaid and unsayable. Animated by the heroism and mythology of the everyday, and armed with attention and wisdom, she is a fierce warrior for the clarity of the human story.\u201d\n\u2014Ammiel Alcalay, author of neither wit nor gold\n\u201cAll the poets I know look upon Judy Grahn with admiration and awe, convinced that she\u2019s leagues ahead of us, superhuman in her power and insight. But the poet of these chants of grief and frustration\u2014and hope\u2014is human for sure, torn by the same powerlessness and disgust at prevalent social conditions as the rest of us\u2014it\u2019s only that she has lightning at her command\u2014a magic of writing that illuminates shreds darkness like confetti, and lets us see past the end of each page, past all our histories, a magic that lets us glimpse a previously unimagined future.\u201d\n\u2014Kevin Killian, author of Impossible Princess  \nAbout Arktoi Books  \nNamed after the girls impersonating she-bears in service of the goddess Artemis, Arktoi Books is an imprint of Red Hen Press publishing high-quality literary fiction and poetry by lesbian writers. It was established in 2006 to give lesbian writers more access to \u201cthe conversation\u201d that having a book in print affords. Eloise Klein Healy, Arktoi\u2019s founder and editor, is the 2016 recipient of the Publishing Triangle\u2019s Bill Whitehead Award for Lifetime Achievement.  \nFollowing the release of Hanging On Our Own Bones, Arktoi will go into hibernation indefinitely. It\u2019s especially fitting that Judy Grahn\u2019s collection of lamentations in nine parts wraps up the series, as it will be the imprint\u2019s ninth book. While not a direct replacement, Red Hen\u2019s new award series for queer writers, Quill, edited by Tobi Harper, will help carry the torch. The first book in the series, Scissors, Paper, Stone by lesbian writer Martha K. Davis, will be released in spring 2018. We aren\u2019t ruling out the possibility that Arktoi could return down the road, but for the foreseeable future, it will no longer acquire any new titles. All Arktoi books will remain in print and the imprint will otherwise remain active.\nAbout the Publisher \nRed Hen Press has served both local and national communities as Southern California\u2019s largest nonprofit literary publisher for 23 years. Our mission is to discover and publish works of literary excellence, support diversity, and promote literacy in our local schools. Dr. Kate Gale and Mark E.

All the poets I know look upon Judy Grahn with admiration and awe, convinced that she's leagues ahead of us, superhuman in her power and insight. But the poet of these chants of grief and frustration--and hope--is human for sure, torn by the same powerlessness and disgust at prevalent social conditions as the rest of us--it's only that she has lightning at her command--a magic of writing that illuminates, shreds darkness like confetti, and lets us see past the end of each page, past all our histories, a magic that lets us glimpse a previously unimagined future.\" --Kevin Killian\n\nJudy Grahn came to fame in the 1960s as a feminist poet and an activist--she picketed the White House in 1965 for Gay rights--and became an iconic figure fueling second wave feminism, gay and lesbian activism, and women's spirituality movements. Author of six collectiosn of poetry, from (1971) to (2008), with a seventh forthcoming in August 2017, , an ecotopian novel, short stories, articles, and four nonfiction books, including , and .

She is a performer; her work has been put to music by jazz groups, rock groups, chorale groups; her book-length poems and have been choreographed and staged, and two CDs have been released of her collaborations with singer-songwriter Ann Carol Mitchell.

We are raising funds to cover basic materials & fabrication costs.\nCurrent designs have this as a 4 tiered pyramid: \nOur budget only allowed us to fill the top 3 tiers with gummy bears, with the bottom tier being empty.\nThe additional funds we raise will go to: casting materials, metal, acrylic sheets, hardware, and lighting. \nWith your help, we can bring this Pyramid to fruition by filling the bottom tier with bears too to make this a fully encased glowing installation. \nBreakdown of costs: \nMaterial Costs add up really fast working on something this large scale and we still have a lot of work to do to bring this project to life. Total predicted breakdown of costs exceeds $20,000! We are starting with an initial goal of raising $10,000 (which helps to cover basic material costs) and stretching for $20,000 to build that bottom tier.

The artist, who has been inspired for years by various architectural line work, tibetan buddhist sand mandalas, stained glass, crop circles, and lite-brite turned to this unlikely medium for her then 2013 Art Series: Gummy Bear Mandalas in light boxes. By collaborating with an amazing crew, we are able to extend that art series to a more all-encompassing, experiential, geometric (3d) structure of the pyramid shape.\nWill they melt?\nWe are working very hard with SCIENCE and MAGIC to make sure that doesn't happen.\nCan I lick the pyramid?\nIf you'd like..the bears might be dusty, but sure! \nExactly how many bears will it take?\nYou tell us!

We're offering reboots of older 2012 designs as well as all new rewards made with new Computational Textile fabrics.\nComputational Textiles are a form of materializing and reconnecting with the history and possibility of our digital past, present and future. As a medium, they enable us to physically and visually experience our digital materiality. Through structure and from, my desire is to bring to common places, the uncommon beauty of the invisible side of our digital world.\nComputational Textiles Fabric Examples\nOur new fabrics are high quality material realizations of digital processes and material. We work with weavers in North Carolina and the Netherlands, harnessing the rich tradition and craftsmanship from two of the most historically important textile producing regions on either side of the Atlantic in the 20th century.\nHere are some examples of the fabrics we've created for this project:\nComputational Textiles\nClouds of Icarus (Row 1): A medium weight double weave fabric made from 100% organic cotton.

Designed using custom software written with Processing.\nBinary Noise (Row 4): Single (Left) and Double (Right) Weave Constructions. Available in a range of colors. Single weave fabrics are tone on white. Double weave fabrics are two-color. Compositions available in cotton and merino wool blend.\nLiving Code (Row 5): A medium to light weight single weave fabric made from 100% organic cotton.

Now he must decide whether it's safer to keep it a secret or if the truth will set him free \nWe launched BLACK on Kickstarter in February 2016, campaigning for funds to complete the project \u2013 backers helped us achieve that goal in four days. The outpouring of support for BLACK has been phenomenal and has opened up amazing opportunities. The campaign ended at nearly 300% above the funding goal. Since then, the project has grown: we were approached by Black Mask Studios to print BLACK as a periodical series, we\u2019re working on subsequent stories, and BLACK was nominated for seven Glyph Awards \u2013 winning for best cover of 2017.\nEven after our campaign ended, people still ask how they can contribute \u2013 so we were bringing BLACK back to give people the last chance to get the exclusive limited edition.\nFor this campaign, we\u2019re seeking funds to have our amazing toner, Derwin Roberson remaster the entire book for all backers. \nNot only will this give the book a seamless look from start to finish, but also offer one last chance to get this limited-edition of the Kickstarter-exclusive collected edition of BLACK \u2013 plus a few extras.\nWe\u2019re including new swag in rewards, and adding a special sneak peek into the next core book \u2013 backers will get a chance to see it first! Funds will go to re-tones, the teaser for book two, plus packing and shipping rewards.\nThere would be no BLACK if not for the support of our backers and we wanted to take this opportunity to allow anyone who missed the original campaign to get access to the limited edition of the book. It\u2019s been a wild ride, and we hope you\u2019ll join us as we continue our journey.\nStretch Goals\nIf we reach this goal, we\u2019ll have BLACK professionally translated into French.

We're increasing our goal...\nFull project details are still below, but we have some incredible news that impacts our fundraising. We can't yet fully share the specifics, BUT the basic gist is that we were just awarded a camera package grant by an amazing company and we'll be filming this on an outrageously beautiful camera. This is great news, but along with the nicer camera comes the need for additional accessories, insurance, and crew. We priced this out and we'll need to raise $1,700 more than we originally thought (we didn't want to ask for more than we needed) in order to accommodate, so we're implementing a stretch goal of $13,699 in these final hours. We've met our original goal thanks to our beautiful backers, so if you're just checking us out and see our published goal is almost met, please consider helping us with our stretch goal (Kickstarter doesn't allow projects to increase their published goal once the campaign has launched). Thank you!!!\nProducer Gracie, Dog Riley, Director John, Cinematographer Adriana & Writer Youthana\nWell, hello there!\nWe couldn't be more excited to make this movie, and we hope you'll join us in bringing it to life. Movies are expensive, even short ones, and this particular movie is going to cost about $15,000 (which is probably less than George Clooney spends on spa water in any given year). We've already raised some funds independently, but we still have a good ways to go. It's likely that your money is hard-earned, though maybe hard-borrowed (or easily handed down?), so we'll appreciate anything you can spare. That said, we have some really cool (and unique) rewards to offer for those who can contribute, including some limited bonus rewards from members of our talented crew. These include original drawings, tarot readings (not kidding), headshots, custom framing, and even illustrated portraits (of you!).\nWe're all volunteering our time (and roping our friends into doing the same) and calling in favors, but there are plenty of costs that are unavoidable. It's always good to understand how your contribution is helping, so here are some examples:\n- $10 will buy a ceramic cat (the movie's hero prop... MEOW)\n- $25 will purchase a student film permit for one day (a necessary evil)\n- $50 will pay for a first aid kit (we're very safe, but boo-boos happen)\n- $100 will cover drinking water (we're not cute when we're dehydrated)\n- $250 will feed our cast & crew for one day (so many mouths to feed!)\n- $500 will pay for Hannah's wardrobe & makeup (we need to transform a healthy actor into a cancer patient)\n- $1000 will cover the location fees for Hannah & Elwood's house (please don't make us kick them to the curb)\n- $2500 will cover the cost of production design (PJ's house is a doozy)\nWe've included lots of info about the project and our team below, in case you like to read and have nothing better to do.\nxo,\nThe Elwood Takes a Lover Team\n  SYNOPSIS: A dying, cantankerous woman wants to ensure her quasi-helpless-but-loveable husband has someone to care for him when she's gone. Suspecting he's a closeted homosexual, she tries (with a little help from her hospice nurse) to reunite him with the man she thinks was his first, unrequited love.\nCHARACTERS:\n- Hannah (60s, ornery, selfless, married to Elwood)\n- Elwood (60s, quiet but loving, closeted, a bit clueless)\n- PJ (60s, reclusive, ceramic cat aficionado, Elwood's first love)\n- Dennis (30s, wears Crocs, loves people, Hannah's nurse)\nGENRE: Drama/Comedy  \nEXPECTED RUNNING TIME : Approx. 15 minutes\nPRODUCTION DATES: July 27 \u2013 31, 2017\nFILMING LOCATION: Los Angeles, CA & surrounding areas\nTONE: Drama when it needs to be.

He was recently invited to the Film Society of Lincoln Center\u2019s Artist Academy for emerging filmmakers at the 2016 New York Film Festival, and was a member of the VFX production team on Marvel\u2019s DOCTOR STRANGE.\nJohn received the LGBT Awareness Award at the 2016 Don Thompson LGBT Film Festival for his short film \u201cPitbull.\u201d He was also honored with a faculty award nomination for his work as a producer on the USC-funded documentary \u201cal imam,\u201d about one of the world's only female Muslim religious leaders. The film recently inked a distribution deal with 7th Art Releasing.\nJohn\u2019s experimental 16mm and super-8 short films have screened at venues such as REDCAT and Pacific Film Archive.

Her focuses of study are writing, producing, and cinematography, spanning both documentary and fiction. She previously earned her B.A. in Dance and Media Arts from American University in Washington, D.C., where she filmed micro-documentaries for local dance artists and was a member of the contemporary dance company, Christopher K. Morgan & Artists.\n  Youthana Yuos, Writer (more brevity... take a hint, John)\nYouthana Yuos is a writer and director from Harrisburg, PA. He graduated from Penn State in 2007 with a degree in Information Sciences and Technology before earning his Masters in 2011 for Information Systems. Now having switched gears from IT to film, he is currently studying cinematic arts at the University of Southern California where he was recently awarded the Jack Nicholson Scholarship for Directing in 2016.\n  Adriana Serrato, Cinematographer (seriously, why is John's bio longer than these three combined?!)\nAdriana Serrato, born in San Francisco and raised in Geneva, Switzerland, returned to the United States to pursue a career in the arts. She attended the Corcoran College of Art and Design in Washington D.C., studying Visual Arts and discovering a passion for photography, which eventually led to her interest in filmmaking. She is currently pursuing her M.F.A at USC with a focus in cinematography.\n  Nicholas Manting Brewer, Post Production Supervisor (funny but true: Nick was *not* forced to include the last two sentences here)\nNicholas Manting Brewer is an award winning editor with an interest in creating immersive and experimental films, animation, and VR content. He graduated from New College of Florida in 2012 with a BA in Cultural & Visual Anthropology. Nicholas believes in bridging public service with filmmaking.

He is pursuing his MFA in Production from University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts. Throughout his career, he hopes to explore diversity through interfacing with directors from around the world to share a broader spectrum of the human experience. In this Nicholas's humble opinion, John Palmer is a hero of Batman-level proportions, and he would follow him to the end of the earth. He's also incredibly excited to be a part of the talented team bringing Elwood Takes a Lover to the screen.\n  (some thoughts from our director John on why this fun story with heart is worth telling, and how he plans to go about doing it)\nI was mostly raised by my grandma, and like Hannah she was quite a cantankerous person, but under that was a heart of gold which wanted the people in her life to be taken care of. She passed away during my first year of graduate school, and even though my friend Youthana created the story and characters, I know this person well.\nElwood\u2019s sort of a combination of my grandfather, who\u2019s 88 and struggling to take care of himself in a small town after my grandma died, and another close family member who passed away many years ago. I always knew this person as straight, but I found suggestions after they died that they\u2019d carried on a clandestine affair with a same-sex friend. I\u2019ve always wondered what their life would have been like if they\u2019d been able to live openly as I\u2019m so lucky to do.\nSo I connected in a very real and personal way to Elwood and Hannah. Telling LGBT stories is also important to me as a filmmaker, and I love that this is a portrayal of queerness that doesn\u2019t fall prey to stereotypes but instead thrives on nuance and complexity. There is a quiet hopefulness at play in Elwood\u2019s affirmation, in PJ\u2019s patience, and in Hannah\u2019s journey being fulfilled in an unexpected way.\nThe film will be full of warm colors, and quiet, controlled images\u2014taking a cue from filmmakers like Ozu and Conrad Hall\u2014that mirror the lives of its characters. We\u2019ll shoot largely on sticks and dollies, with plenty of wides and two shots to emphasize world and relationships, and we\u2019ll move in close on longer lenses for the big emotional moments.\nThe simplicity of this story is a big reason I\u2019m so excited to direct it. It will allow us to focus on craft, to build this world and these characters, and to take time to get it right. I think my strengths as a director are working with actors to craft honest performances and leading a team collaboratively. I\u2019m excited to expand my skills in terms of directing the camera and blocking actors, and I\u2019m looking forward to taking those things to the next level in my work and making cinematic magic with my collaborators.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFilms are big, constantly evolving beasts.

In 2015, I created a Kickstarter campaign for the first-ever album of music that was composed just for cats. After the album was released there was a flood of heartwarming feedback from cat owners - and a number of requests for a second album. Although all of the songs on that first album contained music that was designed to make the song palatable for humans, one of the songs, Lolo\u2019s Air, was designed to be music that could be shared by both the cats and their human companions. \nThis second album will contain eight songs that will all be intended for feline-human sharing. It is a bit tricky to create, but I enjoy the extra effort because I love the idea that music can enhance the connections between cat and companion. This second album will consist entirely of the next generation of this shared music. Although I have been working on music for dogs and horses, the letters and reviews from the first album were so encouraging that I decided to make the creation of a second album my first priority. \nAll of our digital downloads will be available in three formats, mp3 (compressed), 44kHz (CD quality), and 96kHz (highest quality). In the studio, we use special microphones and audio equipment that record very high frequencies. We do this because, when it comes to high hearing, dogs get the PR but cats can actually hear higher than dogs. All of the instruments that I use are acoustic-based to appeal to the high-resolution hearing of cats since natural sounds are much more complex and varied than electronic music.\n  PLAY\n\nThe video above outlines how I came up with the idea and a thumbnail sketch of how it works. The scientific foundation of this music is strong and getting stronger. Please check out the attached journal articles and news reports (below) on music for cats for more information. The music for monkeys and music for cats that I created were both tested and shown to be effective in studies conducted by the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nI am eager to spread the word about animal sentience and their capacities for appreciating beauty - as long as it is designed for them - so please have a listen to a talk that I gave recently at the National Academy of Sciences \"Beauty is in the Eye of the Species\" by visiting the MIT Press site: http://arteca.mit.edu/video/david-e.-teie-beauty-eye-species\nRead the study on music for monkeys...\nAffective responses in tamarins elicited by species-specific music http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/1/30.short\n...and the study on music for cats.\nCats prefer species-appropriate music http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(15)00060-X/abstract http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2015.02.012\nCheck out the news reports on music for cats in....

With the generous donations we received from our initial Kickstarter campaign, we have collected over 1600 books that are currently in the final process of being shipped to Baghdad. \nThe students are thrilled to get these treasured books in their hands. However, the university is not equipped to receive the large amount of books, nor is there a suitable space where the students can read and study. \nWe are reaching out for your support to help renovate the College of Fine Arts' library. Our volunteer architect Wei Cai has developed a practical yet affordable design from locally accessible building materials that will both house the books and provide a communal reading space for the students. \nRender by Wei Cai.\n  Render by Wei Cai.\n  Render by Wei Cai.\nWHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL SUPPORT\nLumber \nTables  \nChairs\nFixtures\nHardware\nPaint\n  Photo courtesy of the Esker Foundation. Photo by John Dean\nIn \u201c168:01\u201d, visitors encounter an austere library containing empty white books. The project positions viewers as potential participants whose contributions fund educational texts from a wish list compiled by students and faculty. As the installation accrues donations, volunteers replace the blank books with new texts during weekly performances, and the library\u2019s shelves become saturated with knowledge and vibrancy. At the end of the exhibition, all donated texts are shipped to Baghdad. \nIn 2016, we ran the first Kickstarter campaign to raise money for the first wave of art books and related shipping expenses. The books collected were initially used as part of the \"168:01\" museum installations at the Art Gallery of Windsor & The Esker Foundation, and are now scheduled to be shipped to the University of Baghdad.\nCheck out our first Kickstarter page here\nMore about the \"168:01 exhibition at the Art Gallery of Windsor\nMore about the \"168:01\" exhibition at The Esker Foundation\n\u201c168:01\u201d has the potential to replace all of the 70,000 books lost. After two exhibitions in Canada in 2016, world-wide press coverage, and the participation of hundreds of donors and volunteers, \u201c168:01\u201d is already making an impact on the students and faculty at the University of Baghdad by making a connection between Baghdad and the rest of the art world while putting a spotlight on Iraq\u2019s artistic production.\n\"168:01\" will continue in its efforts to replenish the library in the coming years. Beginning with an exhibition that opened at the Dunlop Art Gallery on May 5th, 2017, the project is now on a four-venue tour in the US and Canada through 2018.

We were over 650% funded and the outpour of support we received was incredible. That having been said, we could have been better prepared to deal with all of the responsibilities that come along with running a popular campaign and mounting such a large-scale project. The \"168:01\" team was small in the beginning, so we have added a few new volunteer team members to ensure we are not stretching ourselves thin with the tasks we need to accomplish. It has been an excellent learning experience, and we are taking what we have learned to make adjustments to the way we will be running this new campaign:\n\n1. Updates - Our new volunteer Outreach Coordinator, Christine Donley, will ensure the campaign page is updated more regularly with developments on the campaign, more detailed reports of what we have already accomplished between the beginning of \"168:01\" and now, and future developments with the project on whole. \n\n2. Rewards - Based on experience and backer feedback received during our last campaign, we have developed a new system that will guarantee a timelier delivery of all rewards. \n\n3. Challenges - In general, the implementation of \"168:01\"'s original goal went very well. We created the installation, successfully created our system of exchange with viewers, and collected over 1600 books to date for the College of Fine Arts. \n\nThe main challenge we face is with getting the books delivered to the school and finding a place in the library to house them. Shipping to Iraq is not as simple as shipping to other countries and we will be working on the remodel remotely. We may face some delays, but we are fully confident that the books will be delivered and the library will be updated.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Postcard", "descp": "(1) The Ashes Series: Al-Mutanabbi Street Postcard - I will send you a handwritten thank you note on a custom-made postcard.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["56 backers", "Limited (194 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "168:01 White Book", "descp": "(1) Limited Edition Artist Book, signed and numbered, from the original installation of 168:01", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["26 backers", "Limited (24 left of 50)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "The Ashes Series: Dark Palace", "descp": "THE ASHES SERIES: DARK PALACE - Unframed, 8 x 10 inches, archival inkjet photograph, 2003-2013.

I'm Karyn Parsons. I played Hilary Banks on the TV show The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I am the founder of Sweet Blackberry, an award-winning organization whose mission is to bring little-known stories of African-American achievement to kids. \nSweet Blackberry's mission is to share stories that empower and instill a sense of pride in children. Previous films by Sweet Blackberry have received the prestigious Parent\u2019s Choice Award and Learning Magazine\u2019s Teacher\u2019s Choice Awards, among others. They were narrated by noted actors Chris Rock, Alfre Woodard and Queen Latifah. All films are currently available to stream on Netflix and have been distributed to libraries and schools all over the world and have made a difference!\n Sweet Blackberry is currently developing its fourth animated short sharing the inspiring story of Bessie Coleman, the first African-American female pilot. \nBessie grew up during a time where aviation schools in the United States would not let her learn to fly because she was a woman and she was Black. Without letting this prevent her from accomplishing her dream, Bessie taught herself, French, moved to France and earned her license from the renowned Caudron Brothers School of Aviation. \nBessie Coleman's story shows children that despite what odds may be stacked against them, they can be anything. Bessie broke a glass ceiling in the United States that limited individuals wanting to be a pilot to one race and gender. It is our duty at Sweet Blackberry to share her story with the world.\nBessie's story belongs to all of us. We need collaborators to create a 20-minute, animated film bringing Bessie's inspiring story to screens everywhere. Together, we will make a 20-minute, animated film, to be narrated by award-winning actor Laurence Fishburne.  This inspiring story will be distributed to libraries and schools, broadcast to a wide audience, and enjoyed in homes across the country. \nCelebrated children's book illustrator R. Gregory Christie (who has worked with the New Yorker and New York Times, as well as in over 50 books) has signed on to create the look of the film (including the great illustrations above).\nIn addition, there are the important touches: title design; sound, mixing and music clearances; an actor, extras, equipment and all the other things needed to shoot a live action sequence; post production and an editor; as well as digital mastery so the project is ready to land in a classroom, on TV or in a home.\nSweet Blackberry is a 501c3, non-profit organization, and all donations are tax deductible. We hope you, too, will become a part of the Sweet Blackberry family, and help get these stories out!\nThanks so much for taking the time, and thanks in advance for your support.            \nSpend the afternoon with Hilary and Ashley Banks! Pledge items include the opportunity to spend an afternoon shopping and having lunch with Karyn and Tatyana! \nhttp://www.sweetblackberry.org", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only real risk is NOT making our goal. In that event, we will be unable to produce this important story and get it in schools, libraries, and homes across the country. We really need to harness all the enthusiasm and support for Sweet Blackberry and its mission that we\u2019ve received over the years, and channel it into funding to make this film!\n\nThere really are no foreseeable risks once we have attained funding, except perhaps, our narrator\u2019s schedule changing on us, but as we are not a studio with loads of other productions lined up, we have a lot of flexibility.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Social Supporter (Pledge $5+)", "descp": "Be Featured On Our Thank You Wall!

I am a photographer and photo educator. I have been photographing space exploration-related programs, facilities, and people for over 25 years. Included in this photography is a project I entitled Abandoned In Place. This project is a photographic exploration of the American space launch and research facilities that played a crucial role in the early period of space exploration. The goals of this project are to preserve and portray these abandoned, deactivated, and repurposed sites through photography that surpasses the official government approach to documentation and to lend historical and artistic insight to the subject.\nThanks to the great support of the backers of the original Abandoned in Place Kickstarter campaign, I succeeded in reaching and surpassing the pledge goal. The book, Abandoned in Place: Preserving America's Space History, was published by the University of New Mexico. The book received wide critical praise and media coverage, including by the New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Popular Mechanics, Slate, Vantage, and Business Insider.\nAbandoned in Place: Preserving America's Space History\nAbandoned In Place: Preserving America's Space History is an 11 by 13\" book with over 100 color photographs from the Abandoned in Place series. The introduction is provided by Bob Thall, photography professor at Columbia College in Chicago. Dr. Roger Launius, former Associate Director of Collections and Curatorial Affairs at the National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian Institution, authored the foreword.\nRoland signing Kickstarter reward copies of Abandoned in Place at the University of New Mexico Press warehouse in Albuquerque.\nWhen Kickstarter contacted me and offered the opportunity to participate in their Kickstarter Gold series, I knew it would allow me to finally offer the book as a stand-alone reward (see the PUBLIC AFFAIRS OFFICER reward level). In the original Abandoned in Place Kickstarter campaign, I was actually raising money for the University of New Mexico Press to publish the book. This meant I had to buy books to fulfill rewards. If I had offered the book alone, I would have had to ask for a pledge amount that was more than the book was going to cost once it was published. To solve that issue, I bundled the book with prints from the Abandoned in Place series.\nWith this Kickstater Gold project, the money I raise is going to support my continuing efforts to document, interpret, and preserve the history of space exploration and research. Because the money raised will not be going to the UNM Press, I can offer the book as a stand-alone reward.\nAlong with offering the Abandoned in Place book as a stand-alone reward, I have also bundled it as a package with prints of images which were not available in the original Kickstarter. Other reward levels bundle the book as a package with new sizes of prints of images which were available in the original Kickstater. There are also prints available without the book for those who already own a copy of it.\nEven with the book available as a stand-alone reward, I would encourage backers to look at the book/print bundle options, as this is a very inexpensive way to own an original, signed print from the Abandoned in Place series.\nThe project ends at 4:18 PM EDT, on July 20, 2017, exactly 48 years to the minute after Apollo 11 landed on the Moon in 1969.\nAbandoned in Place patch by Tim Gagnon\nAlong with the book and photographic prints that are available, I am working with noted space mission patch artist, Tim Gagnon, to create a limited edition patch which will be included in every pledge of $15 or more.\nLaunch Pad and Gantry with Hermes A-1 Rocket, V2 Launch Complex 33, White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico (LAUNCH PAD TECHNICIAN Reward Level)\nThe project serves not only as a documentary body of work, but also as an artistic interpretation of these historic sites. The blockhouses, launch towers, tunnels, test stands, and control rooms featured in Abandoned In Place are rapidly giving way to the elements and demolition. By my estimates, fully half of the facilities I have photographed no longer exist. The costs involved in restoring, maintaining, and securing these sites are enormous. Most of these historic facilities are located on secure military or NASA facilities, therefore drastically limiting access by the public. Photography is the only practical method to preserve and portray these historic locations.\nBolts, Atlas Launch Complex 13, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida (CLOSE OUT CREW MEMBER Reward Level)\nMISSILE FUEL, Atlas Launch Complex 13, Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida (FUEL TECHNICIAN Reward Level)\nFour authors contributed essays for Abandoned in Place.

Mr. Covault's essay details the progression of space launch and exploration programs at Cape Canaveral's Complexes 40 and 41 and how the launch complexes evolved through various projects and phases over time.\nColonel Pamela Melroy is a retired NASA astronaut and the second woman to command a Space Shuttle mission.

Photographs available through the Kickstarter campaign normally sell for much more than the reward level costs listed.\nI have been printing on Hahnem\u00fchle paper exclusively for the past four years. I have been working with digital imaging since 1989, and I have not found another paper brand with the reliability, accuracy, and consistency of the Hahnem\u00fchle family of papers. I am a stickler for color and print quality. (See my website, http://www.abandonedinplace.com/the-tone-system.) I have also selected Hahnem\u00fchle papers for their superior surface qualities. Beyond print quality, it is critical to me to make prints that are color-stable, archival, and that will last as long as possible. Hahnem\u00fchle papers exceed my expectations in all of these criteria.\nThe Goal of $5,000 \nI set the goal at $5,000 to meet the current needs of my continued documentation and interpretation of the space program and its history. The more support the project receives, the more work I can do to preserve America's space history.\nI hope you will see this project as worthy of your support. I greatly appreciate your interest and I hope you will choose to back Abandoned in Place.\nThank you,\nRoland Miller\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter Questions about this project?

Watch this video to learn about the importance of preserving diaries, the focus of the Museum\u2019s first-ever Kickstarter campaign. \nWe\u2019re thrilled by the response to this Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for cataloging and digitizing over 200 Holocaust diaries and translating and transcribing three of them. \nAfter reaching our $250,000 goal we\u2019re excited to announce a new stretch goal: An additional $50,000 to translate and transcribe 10 more diaries. Back this project today to help Save Their Stories!\nPLAY\n\nThis is no ordinary map.\nUS Holocaust Memorial Collection, gift of the family of Joseph Strip\nIt\u2019s a deeply personal illustration of one family\u2019s harrowing escape and survival during the Holocaust. It\u2019s included in a diary\u2014one of over 200 diaries the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has in its collections waiting to be cataloged, translated and published online.  \nWe\u2019re in a race against time to do this specialized, expensive and time-consuming work, and we urgently need your help.  \nWe know first-person accounts are powerful. Most people are familiar with the diary of Anne Frank, and her personal account is often the first introduction that many have to the devastating history of the Holocaust. But it\u2019s not the only diary of its kind.  \nEach of the diaries in our collection has an important story to tell, of suffering and strength, persecution and perseverance. Written by people young and old, from diverse backgrounds and countries, they bring to life a broad spectrum of individuals\u2019 experiences during the Holocaust. Now, in the face of growing Holocaust denial, we must bring more stories to light before we lose the firsthand memories of survivors and witnesses who can shed light on the context of these diaries and other priceless artifacts in the Museum\u2019s collection.  \nAs the survivor generation passes, it is our responsibility to make sure their voices live on so that their experiences will not be forgotten. You can be a part of preserving history: Back this project and Save Their Stories.\nFor this project, we'll catalog, preserve, and make available online over 200 Holocaust diaries in the Museum\u2019s collection -- for the first time ever. The handwritten pages and notes are in 17 different languages and will need to be transcribed and translated into English. While we would love to raise enough funds to complete the translation of every diary, reaching our project goal will enable us to translate into English three diaries written by Jewish refugees who fled their homes to escape the Holocaust:  \nThe diary of Joseph Strip, a young boy who wrote about his family\u2019s harrowing experience over the grid-lined pages of his math notebook. \nThe papers of Lucien Dreyfus, a journalist and schoolteacher from Strasbourg, France, who was deported to Auschwitz in 1943. His collection includes letters to his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter who escaped to the United States in 1942.\nThe diary of Hans Vogel, who fled Paris with his family while his father was interned, which contains hand-drawn and colored maps of their journey. \nEach of these three diaries will be published in its entirety online so that people everywhere can view the original pages and read the translations. Like Anne Frank\u2019s personal record, these stories expose the truth of Holocaust history -- so that ever more researchers, authors, teachers, students can learn from them and help fulfill the promise of Never Again. \nHere is our estimated timeline for this project:  \nSummer/Fall 2018: Cataloging complete for all 200+ diaries \nWinter 2018: Digitization complete for all 200+ diaries \nSpring 2019: Collections for all 200+ diaries published online at ushmm.org  \nSummer 2019: Translations and transcriptions for 3 feature diaries added to ushmm.org collections listings\nThe Museum has collected millions of pages of historic documents containing details on the individual experiences of Holocaust victims and survivors. Although we are committed to making our entire collection available online, the sheer size of it makes this a lengthy, expensive project. \nEach additional first-person account or piece of evidence made available on the Museum\u2019s website--which is visited by millions of people every year--has the potential to reveal a new aspect of Holocaust history or highlight its relevance to the world today.\nThese three are just some of the many accounts we hope to bring to the public:  \nJoseph Strip (formerly \u201cStripounsky\u201d)\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum Collection, gift of the family of Joseph Strip\nJoseph Stripounsky awoke early on the morning of May 10, 1940, to the sounds of aircraft and gunfire. The Germans had invaded his town of Antwerp, Belgium. He was just 17.  \nJoseph fled with his parents and younger brother, leaving almost everything they owned behind. He carried with him a math textbook and two math notebooks, one of which became his diary.  \nThey joined thousands of others heading south through France, making a slow and arduous journey with very little food or money. In France, they spent a year trying to get farther away from the ever-encroaching Nazis. They managed to secure American visas through Joseph\u2019s father\u2019s employer and finally landed in New York in May 1941\u2014just six weeks before Joseph\u2019s 18th birthday, when he would have been legally required to stay in France.  \nJoseph tells the story of his family\u2019s harrowing exodus through everyday details and extraordinary sketches.\nLucien Dreyfus\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum, Gift of Monique Allen\nLucien Dreyfus was a dedicated journalist and professor of modern languages in Strasbourg, France. In 1940, anti-Jewish legislation was passed in France, and he was dismissed from his teaching position because of his faith. \nAs persecution against Jews intensified, he fled his town and sought safety in southern France. Refuge did not last long. In October 1943, he and his wife were arrested and just one month later, they were deported to Auschwitz and murdered. \nLucien had kept a diary since 1925, but his writing became more frequent during World War II, recording the realities of day-to-day life, the experiences of his students, and what he knew about Jewish persecution in other parts of Europe. \nHis diaries also contain deeply personal messages he wrote to his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter who were able to escape France in 1942 and eventually made it to the United States. Lucien knew he might never see them again, but continued to write with the hope that they would receive his diaries. Miraculously, they did years later. \nHans Vogel\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum Collection, gift of Eva Vogel\nAt the age of seven, Hans Yakov Vogel fled Germany with his parents and elder brother in 1936, settling in Paris where they remained until the outbreak of war. His father was separated from the family and interned by the French as an enemy alien at Lisieux, and later at Gurs in the south of France. In May 1940, just 24 hours before the invading German forces reached Paris, the rest of the Vogel family fled south. They traveled among a stream of other refugees, mostly by foot, as the Luftwaffe shot machine guns at them.  \nThrough the help of friends, the Vogels were reunited and settled in Oloron-Sainte-Marie in the unoccupied zone near the Spanish border. They remained there from June 1940 until April 1941, when they received papers from the United States Consulate allowing them to immigrate. They arrived in New York via Lisbon on the steamer Nyassa in August 1941. Two years later, Hans Vogel died at the age of 16 from an illness.  \nHans kept an extraordinary diary of their flight, including photos and hand-drawn and colored maps tracing the family's journey from Germany through France and eventual immigration to the United States.\nYour pledge doesn\u2019t just get you access to behind-the-scenes updates on the work (and often the discoveries made) during the process of cataloging, translating, and publishing these stories.

Without Kickstarter funding, there is no immediate date for being able to do this work and bring these first-person testimonies to light for students, teachers, scholars, and those wanting to learn more about the Holocaust and preserve the memory of its victims and survivors.\n\nRisks concerning rewards: As always with manufacturing a product, it\u2019s possible to come across production delays. We are confident that with successful funding, the Museum will be able to deliver our tangible and experiential rewards within the times stated for each. However, our rewards that feature live events are subject to change, given availability and circumstances outside of our control.\n\nShould any changes be made to availability of rewards and events, the Museum will communicate these to backers as soon as possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Thank You Starter Pack", "descp": "Every gift helps!

This is the largest platform we have had for our work. We have gotten here through the trust of organizations and institutions but, most of all, because of audiences who have come together again and again to witness and participate in our making.\nOur ask for this campaign\u2014$20,000\u2014is big for a small arts organization. But fitting for the exciting challenge we have ahead of us\u2026 to bring you three works, in three weeks, with 23 artists, in New York.\nWe are asking for you, our audience, community, friends, family and people new to our work to join us.\nCAST, STAGE, AUTHOR is a trilogy of new works to premiere September 7-23, 2017 at three commissioning New York City venues: The Chocolate Factory Theater, Abrons Art Center and The Invisible Dog Art Center.\nThe project began with a series of recorded discussions (over 100 hours) with 15 performers about power dynamics in the act of performing and casting, and the complexities of representation. The subject of casting\u2014how different bodies are represented and given power to represent\u2014is ripe in our current culture as we question who gets to stand before us and represent us. The trilogy provides a poetic/fraught/political/intimate insight into the thoughts of performers about their representation and their relationship to the audience, you.\nCAST brings together a different cast of four performers each night to devise a performance in front of an audience. The high stakes and the pressure of negotiation shape the cast in the presence of an audience.\nSTAGE is a visual and aural fantasia that through an orchestration of theatrical devices asks how our vision is engorged/manipulated/seduced.\nAUTHOR is a participatory installation that invites audiences to share their memories as spectators by interacting with the recordings of the performers through a computer game.\n$20,000 means we can move forward with our vision. It means that each collaborator receives a fair wage for their collaborative brilliance. It means we can bring what has been percolating in the studio, in our heads, and on our laptop screens, to life. It means that the extent of this request is large, but we are thinking and creating big, and we are asking you to dream (and give!) big with us.\nThe trilogy furthers a canary torsi\u2019s longstanding examination of the relationship between artists and audiences in the performance-making process. It persists in the idea that live performance is communal action. Join us.\n* THE TEAM *\na canary torsi is a performance group of dancers and designers formed by choreographer Yanira Castro that develop site-adaptable, installation-based performance projects. Our work stems from a commitment to making dances that are not predetermined but radically impacted by the audience.\nArtist & Choreographer: Yanira Castro \nCollaborators & Performers: Kyle Bukhari, Simon Courchel, Leslie Cuyjet, devynn emory, Ir\u00e9ne Hultman, Shayla-Vie Jenkins, Luke Miller, Sai Somboon, David Thomson, Jeremy Toussaint-Baptiste, Pamela Vail, Tara Aisha Willis, Darrin Wright\nContributing Artists: John Hoobyar, Heather Olson\nInstallation/Lighting: Kathy Couch \nDramaturg: Susan Mar Landau \nComposer/Programmer: Stephan Moore \nMusicians: Scott Smallwood, Suzanne Thorpe \nVideo Artist: Peter Richards \nTranscribers: Stormy Budwig, Emie Hughes \nMarketing Assistant: Tara Sheena \nStage Managers: Lillie De, Reilly Horan\nPAST KICKSTARTER PROJECTS\nThe People to Come (2012)\nPhoto of Simon Courchel by David Bivins\nPhoto of Luke Miller by Julieta Cervantes\nCourt/Garden (2014)\nPhoto of Simon Courchel by Jose Espaillat\nPhoto of audience and performers by Maria Baranova\n * CREDITS *\nThe creation of CAST, STAGE, AUTHOR is being made possible, in part, by generous commissions from the three presenting organizations: The Chocolate Factory, Abrons Art Center and The Invisible Dog Art Center.

Growing up as a queer Nigerian person, I felt that my existence was an inherent contradiction because of my sexuality. I experienced considerable homophobia in African spaces, and was told that being gay was \"un-African\" - a disease from the West and white people.\nHearing one-sided messages like that from a young age is incredibly damaging to one\u2019s sense of self. Everyone should have the right to be who they are, without hiding key parts of themselves. I saw a lack of stories like mine being told, and knew that something had to change.\nPhotographs from Limit(less)\nI started Limit(less) 3 and a half years ago to create a space where LGBTQ African immigrants could be seen as whole individuals - proud, complicated and celebrated - and share our multifaceted stories with the world. I focus specifically on the LGBTQ African diaspora because we can be visible in ways that many LGBTQ people currently living on the African continent cannot be.\nI have shot 34 LGBTQ African immigrants for the project to-date - primarily in North America. These stories can be found online where they are currently archived. Limit(less) has evolved into an online converging space for LGBTQ Africans from around the world. It is a space where we share stories, communicate with one another, and feel validated in our identities.\nIt wasn\u2019t until it came to fruition that I saw how important curating a space like this is. I do this work in part for future young queer and trans Africans who I imagine stumbling across an entire community of LGBTQ people with stories like theirs. Who are met with acceptance and an embracing of their identities in the midst of a world that tells them that who they are is wrong.\nLimit(less) is making this possible.\nEniola: Queer Nigerian Woman (USA)\n With Your Support\nI am creating the largest digital archive of LGBTQ African immigrant narratives; thus far, it has been shot extensively in North America. But in order to finish the project and capture the full range of diasporic LGBTQ African experiences, I need to bring the project to Europe for a final sprint of shoots this fall.\nThis is made especially important due to several factors:\nSize of European African Community: There are ~4x as many African Immigrants in Europe as in the United States (7-8 million in Europe versus 2 million in the US).\nRefugee Crisis in Europe: Over 1 million refugees entered Europe in 2015 alone, with tens of thousands being African some of whom are LGBTQ. I would like to answer- Who are some of these LGBTQ African refugees and what are their stories?\nAnti-Immigrant Sentiments in Europe: Brexit, Marine Le Pen in the 2nd round of the French Presidential Election and Far Right Parties gaining ground with incredibly xenophobic rhetoric across Europe. This gravely affects the lives of LGBTQ African immigrants and creates unique experiences for them that I would like to document.\nThe groundwork has already been laid; there are 20 people already confirmed to shoot in Belgium, France, Portugal, the UK, and Sweden. All I need is your support to get there.\nAll proceeds from this Kickstarter will go toward travel, lodging, and living expenses in these 5 countries during my 4 months of shooting in Europe.\nThe final archive will be publicly available online on the Limit(less) website and will exhibit in gallery spaces globally. \nRewards\n\"Thank You\" Handwritten Postcard from Europe!\n  \"4 Queer African Women\" Limit(less) Postcard; Signed Back\n  \"Brian: Queer Rwandan\" Limit(less) Print: 14x11 inch Signed, Color Matte with White Trim\n  36x24 inch (pictured) / 21x14 inch Signed + Framed \"4 Queer African Women\" Limit(less) Print\n  Mikael discusses Limit(less) at the Never Apart Gallery in Montr\u00e9al\nPress\nLimit(less) has generated significant press and media attention over the past 3 and a half years, including:\n                                \n          ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge with this project is finding people to photograph and setting up relationships ahead of time. At the beginning of Limit(less), my first international shoots were in Canada and Trinidad & Tobago. I had some initial leads but nothing finalized until I arrived. With only a few days in each country, the time lost at the beginning of each trip to finalize participants made me hustle more to get the project done in time. I succeeded in finishing the portraits and interviews and I learned that nailing people down as early as possible is the most important part of planning. So, I spent the past 6 months prior to launching this Kickstarter doing extensive outreach to LGBTQ organizations and groups in all 5 of my target countries (Belgium, France, Portugal, the UK and Sweden). 20 people are now confirmed to participate, so I will hit the ground running without the snags I encountered in my earlier shoots.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thanks!", "descp": "A big thank you for supporting the project!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Website Supporter", "descp": "Have your name (or pseudonym, if you would like to remain anonymous) listed as a \"Supporter\" on the Limit(less) Website!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["15 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "Postcard from Europe", "descp": "\u2022 \"Thank You\" Handwritten Postcard from Europe\n\u2022 Name/Pseudonym Listed as a \"Supporter\" on Limit(less) Website", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["70 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 35 or more", "title": "Limit(less) Postcard", "descp": "\u2022 \"4 Queer African Women\" Limit(less) Postcard; Signed Back\n\u2022 Name/Pseudonym Listed as a \"Supporter\" on Limit(less) Website\n++\n\u2022 \"Thank You\" Handwritten Postcard from Europe", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["72 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Limit(less) Signed Print", "descp": "\u2022 \"Brian: Queer Rwandan\" Limit(less) Print: 14x11 inch Signed, Color Matte with White Trim\n\u2022 Name/Pseudonym Listed as a \"Supporter\" on Limit(less) Website\n++\n\u2022 \"Thank You\" Handwritten Postcard from Europe\n\u2022 \"4 Queer African Women\" Limit(less) Postcard; Signed Back", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["23 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 250 or more", "title": "Limit(less) Signed & Framed Print", "descp": "\u2022 \"4 Queer African Women\" Limit(less) Framed Print: 21x14 inch Signed + Framed\n\u2022 Name/Pseudonym Listed as a \"Sponsor\" on Limit(less) Website\n++\n\u2022 \"Thank You\" Handwritten Postcard from Europe\n\u2022 \"4 Queer African Women\" Limit(less) Postcard; Signed Back", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Feb 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 500 or more", "title": "Photoshoot with Mikael", "descp": "\u2022 2 Hour Personal Photoshoot with Mikael (travel + lodging not included)\n\u2022 Name/Pseudonym Listed as a \"Patron\" on Limit(less) Website\n++\n\u2022 \"Thank You\" Handwritten Postcard from Europe\n\u2022 \"4 Queer African Women\" Limit(less) Postcard; Signed Back", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Limited (5 left of 6)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "Deluxe Package", "descp": "\u2022 Deluxe: 36x24 inch Signed + Framed \"4 Queer African Women\" Limit(less) Print\n\u2022 \"Brian: Queer Rwandan\" Limit(less) Print: 14x11 inch Signed, Color Matte with White Trim\n\u2022 30 minute Skype ask-me-anything with Mikael (optional)\n\u2022 2 Hour Personal Photoshoot with Mikael (travel + lodging not included)\n\u2022 Name/Pseudonym Listed as an \"Advocate\" on Limit(less) Website\n++\n\u2022 \"Thank You\" Handwritten Postcard from Europe\n\u2022 \"4 Queer African Women\" Limit(less) Postcard; Signed Back", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["1 backer", "Limited (2 left of 3)"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Final Reminder For Kickstarter Prizes - Jan 5, 2018", "update_content": "PLAY"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #13", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Rewards Coming !", "update_content": "Breathless.

After I finished fulfilling rewards for the successful The Turtle Hat campaign, I began work planning the sea turtle hat. After multiple iterations working with manufacturers to get the ratios just right, the prototype is ready to move into production! I am looking for backing to place the first order of Sea Turtle Hats. You can share in the fun. Lighten up, have a laugh, wear a funny hat.\nThis hat is similar to the original turtle hat, a \"flat cap,\" but it has a velcro closure in the back. The sides are a nice mesh for easier air (or water) flow. The hats are lined and have the same little pocket behind the front so you can put in an ID and credit card.\nWearing this headgear will certainly change your day. Time off and travel will never be the same. This hat is way out there weird but it will be loads of fun, especially at the beach. It's also a great way to spark a conversation about turtle conservancy.\nThis round's rewards go along with the Sea Turtle and beach theme.\nThe \"Beach Kit\" is a \"turtle egg\" lip balm and a pair of UV protection sunglasses with a floating key ring. Support friendlier beaches without your keys sinking to the bottom of the ocean, disarm pirates on the high seas without getting a sunburn, renest an endangered species without chapped lips!\nYou can also choose a Sand Dollar Hat as a reward. Without a head or appendages, this more affordable chappeau has gone straight into production, and is a more reserved option. If you're not quite ready to don The Turtle, if you need a more subdued every day hat, or if you seek the perfect cap for a seaside golf course, the Sand Dollar Hat fits the bill. It features flat cap construction with a snap closure and is lined with an inner pocket. It will be made in a bone color - like the dried sand dollars we are most familiar with.\nHere is a good close up view of Sea Turtle Hat.\nPLAY\n\n  Beach Kit prototype\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have the contacts and have visited the hat maker in China.

Because I have done fulfillment previously on another Kickstarter project I understand the timing issues and the shipping. I expect to be using Backerkit to help with this and that will streamline fulfillment. Rewards other than the hats should pose no issues and should be ready before the hats.

Providing not only a safe and comfortable environment to relax and enjoy one\u2019s stay, but to also bring individuals closer to nature and understanding what one can do in maximizing their yards\u2019 potential. We believe that providing a center for self-stainable habitat could change people\u2019s perceptions on what issues we have today with honey bees, organic food cultivation, as well as giving back not taking from nature.\nAir Bee & B-Line Farm located in Luray, SC is the first of a 2 phase facilities project to take place in the Carolinas. Our idea is to not only provide food for honey bees, but also encourage our guests to interact closely with honey bees, discuss smart yard farming ideas, and enjoy the time in a small southern town. \nWe hope to engage people to observe honey bees and their behavior, to learn what to plant and grow, and to join the introductory workshop on Bee Queening and Bee Venom Apitherapy. This is a place that we want to give back to nature in giving honey bees a place to feed, pollinate, and to safely breed. Educating the public helps as to pay for reworking the land and supplying natural bee food as well as other costs of this facility.\nSome Facts in SC\nA Deforestation State \nLive Science: \"A new global map of deforestation reveals 888,000 square miles (2.3 million square kilometers) lost between 2000 and 2012.\"\nDue to the mass deforestation of precious wooded & wetlands throughout several generations of negative farming habits in the southern state of South Carolina; Natural woodlands has been cut down to make way for cheap land tax GMO farming of cotton, pine trees for the large corporate paper mills in the area. Poor nutrition from lack of natural regional vegetation/habitat, viruses through cross contamination or crops on top of stress are causing bee sustainability to be at its worst.\nA Great Decline in The Number of Wild & Honey Bees\nIn most crops (about 70 percent) that are used today require multiple pollination engagements to develop fruits, nuts, and seeds. However, due to but poor nutrition, viruses, parasite varroa mite, and stress, we see a worldwide decline in the number of wild and honey Bees which also results in the decline of the proper production rate of vegetable and fruit. Bumble-bees are now on the endangered species list.\nCheck out our local program of \"rescue-honey-bees\"\nDisconnected From Nature\nMore people plug into Facebook, WeChat with their iPhone, more cars filling more parking lots, more factories and more long ques at the supermarkets. Fewer people spend time walking in the woods, gardening, or otherwise interacting with nature the less they understand that pollinators like bees have long been taking for granted. Vegetables and fruits are not as abundant as they used to be. Habitats for wild creature are being destroyed at an alarming rate in the increasingly human-dominant consumption world in which a Government creates.\nSolution: Why Air BEE& B-Line Farm?\nWhen people hear that we are keeping honey bees, they usually ask if we could provide honey. Honey is the reward that shouldn\u2019t be given away so lightly, it\u2019s only when the food for bees are abundant, and their production rate is good; only then can one take the honey away from bees. Sadly, people do not put forth the effort they should, so the reward is not so likely. We like to share our reward with something a bit more fruitful with venom apitherapy, queen breeding, and basic understanding and relaxation.\nOur Air Bee & B-Line Farm is young and in its experimental stage. It could not get into the scope of a Professional/Commercial apiary until a few years. The living conditions of bees in SC cannot change quickly, but it could raise the concern about how we could connect to nature and live together in harmony with our most important food pollinators: the wild bees and honey bees. Our solutions are the following:\nTo Provide more natural food for bees to feed, by planet a verity of vegetation.\nTo increase the awareness of our individual rolls up on this planet and what could we do individually and collectively to help our nature return to its true respectful beauty.\nOur main focus is food. Food not only for the bees but for individual guest who visits the farm. We have decided to do away with the \u201cgreen grass\u201d yard and utilize the land to grow a verity of honey and pollen producing fruits, vegetables, shrubs.\nAir Bee & B-Line Farm is to be a destination point. We want to make the stay not only a comfortable one but a one of interest with educational means to provide information in how to protect the future environment; Inspired by Jacque Fresco of The Venus Project. There are also activities that revolve around the outdoors. Gardening, bee-watching, tightrope, freebie, fire pit, and more.\nBy opening an inviting space, providing an interactive and fun experience, and working with us on protecting the bees for everybody's future, we believe it can change people's perceptions on the health care of the honey bees and planet today, and push ones to resonate back to nature the best they can.\nStay With Us\n\u201cA human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.\u201d \u2015 Albert Einstein\nAir Bee & B- Line Farm is a place where individuals can interact with Honey Bees. Conquering their fears of bee stings, watching Honey Bee behavior, and understand a bit about what it takes to live with bees. Enjoy fine food, private comfortable safe environment. We are one of the few and hope for many in looking for a more mature, more primitive lifestyle while keeping our environment and ourselves healthy.\nWe have Honey Bees, and farm animals on the property. Guest will be able to sleep in Air Bee & B-Line Farm custom built Shipping Container Home or in a tent in the spacious greenhouse.\nOur Location: We are located 1.5 hours (50 miles\u2019 drive) bus ride from 3 top SC beaches as well as Downtowns of Hilton Head, Savannah, Beaufort, and Charleston (1.5-hour drive).\nTo interact with Honey Bess, we mainly provide 3 education sessions:\nQueening (1 hour)\nApitherapy (1 hour), nerve and muscle relaxing ONLY \nGeneral Information about Container Home Design/Smart yard gardening and basic beekeeping\nWatch a demo video of our Apitherapy 101 session\nThis is not a turn & burn. A 5 year to lifetime goal!\nOur goal for the SC development is not necessarily for the production of honey and other products. It\u2019s for the procreation of bees, colonies. To help multiply a healthy strain of Italians and mason bees that have been in the families care for over 12 years. To be able to provide a healthy quality bees to the folks across America to those who are interesting in beekeeping as a hobby or as a career.\nSC is a fantastic area to bee farm due to the warm zone 8 temperatures which keep the bees active for a longer duration during the fall, winter, & spring time. Providing us time to keep, maintain, and prepare for early spring/summer expansion.\nWhat will this Kickstarter achieve?\nGoal 1: $2,000 for Grand Opening of Air Bee & B-Line Farm\n4 sets of tools, bee suits and safety equipment for participants join the workshop session: Queening and Apitherapy\nBee Venom Demo Allergy prevention: 5 EpiPen (All guests MUST confirm that they are not allergic to bee stings. \nMedical papers within 10 years preferred.) With your help, we could recycle old barn wood and glass windows to build a greenhouse for plants and bees during unbearable hot summer Grow trees, plants, and flower to provide a natural food substance to maintain a proper healthy growth of the hive throughout the year. \nGuests accommodation materials.\nGoal 2: $5,000 for Adding an Extra Container Space for Accommodation and Bee & Herb Products Experiments.\nWe will recycle a 12 years old 20-foot container, which offers us 144 square foot space, which will be spaced into two sections: accommodation and Lab area.\nAn extra Container Home for long-term (intern) accommodation.\n Space out to add a Lab area for more bees & herb products experiments, storage material, etc.\nGoal 3: $10,000 for a secondary location of B-Line Farm in NC.\nOur non-stop travel leads us to many unique locations, with Statesville, North Carolina being one of them. We have found a secondary location where the land is abundant with natural habitat. Mostly woods, a few fields which can home selected herbs, and spices. With proper land maintenance, Air Bee& B-Line Farms can begin on phase 2 in the following year (2018), where we will expand some 20 honey bee boxes on the new location. The new location can provide a better facility for further education once it has been approved and reconstruction begins.\nThe Rewards\nPledge $10 or More.

Authorities mentions the impact of the Crowd Funding success! Thank you backers!\nNew revolutionary tool launching\nFor the first time beekeepers around the world can collaborate combating Varro destructor thanks to Kickstarter fundings.\nBeeScanning with BeeTagTool: is building the largest database of visually tagged photographs of bees. You can help in the following ways: \u2022 Upload photographs of your bees \u2022 Inspect and visually tag features: varroa mites, deformed wings, or where the queen is. \u2022 Or help tag someone elses photos! It is easy, fun and important.\nOnce we have several thousands of samples of varroa mite infested bees, deformed wings, queen bees, etc, we will train an neural network to learn to identify these features automatically. The result is an app - BeeScanning - that you or anyone else can use to automatically and immediately detect these features among bees, by just taking a photograph with your mobile phone. http://beetool.beescanning.com/\nBeeTagTool\nSo to be very clear this is not the app! This is not the neural network software! This is the tool to collect the data for training the software. And this has become possible through the pledges you have made. It is really awesome and a true Kickstart! Thank you all so much.

This means whether or not we are granted the EIP (EuropeanInnovationProgram) funding or not, the project is happening.\nThe Threat\nMillions of honeybee colonies will die each year! In the US about 44%! That's terrible - almost half of the colonies - each year! The main cause is the parasite mite - named Varroa Destructor. The name is very appropriate, it destroys the bees. In Europe almost 20% are lost yearly. My neighbour and collegue had 800 colonies and lost 500! Following winter he lost another 250, so now he keeps 50 hives. \nThe bees really suffer. Imagine having big brown crabs crawling your body sucking your blood!\nSeveral varroa feeding\nVarroa on bees thorax\nBeekeepers around the world are struggling to save their bees.  But they fail to detect the infestation in time - and so their bees dies in the winter. \nBees dead from Varroa\nIts a shame!\nWe can change that. Use the camera in your phone. Monitor the mite. \nPresentation\nMy name is Bj\u00f6rn Lagerman. I have about 100 beehives in the middle of Sweden. \nI have been taking pictures of my bees for years. Trying to learn more. For example visit www.fribi.se/yngelramar/ \nBrood frames\nLast summer I discovered Varroa mites examining close up still images. It then struck me that if I could compare the images with results from conventional chemical monitoring we would have a new tool. And indeed there was correlation! \nHow\nThe idea is to let an app reveal the mites in the images. Then you decide to treat or not. The app will also provide basis for finding bees that show resistance against Varroa. This is very important! We can not depend on chemicals, we must find resistant bees. Beekeepers gets a tool and researchers gets knowledge to find varroa resistant strains of bees.\nThis is a concept image:\nApp functions\nIn our database we will store images and data from the beekeepers. Our image analyzing technology is based on cutting edge neural networks and deep learning. \nFor training our neuron nets we need lots of data and therefor we are collecting pictures and survey data from 10 000 colonies taken by beekeepers worldwide. \nThe correlation between images, how the bees perform, what crop they bring and how they survive is used for the software development.\nWe then will compare received data with our own controlled extended survey -where we use alcohol washing as benchmark to measure the infestation. \nVarroa floating in alcohol\nHow does the neural network learn?\nThe neural network is actively taught by a deep learning professional who has access to a good amount of training data. In short, an image of a varroa infested bee is shown to the neural network and we let the network guess. If the network guesses wrong, we let it know. It will then adjust itself very slightly to make a more educated guess next time. By doing this several thousand times the neural network will learn very abstract features and eventually become better than a human at visually detecting mites.\nThat's a very simplified way of looking at it. In reality, an artificla neural network is a very complex beast that is difficult to tame and comes in many different forms and shapes. One of the first milestones is for the development team to find the way of training that is optimal for this particular task.\nWhat if you don't find enough training images for the neural network?\nLess images means the precision of the system is not optimal. We can still launch the product and use the data gathered from the app as a tool for further ongoing training of the neural network.\nIs the image development team actually capable of solving this task?\nYes! The team members have over 15 years of experience with developing complex systems. The team is lead by mobile and tech industry veteran Emil Romanus. Romanus has previously been involved in mobile world-wide successes, among others the complex 3D and physics simulation game \"Apparatus\" in 2011. Romanus and his team has been focusing on deep learning for the past few years and have made several large investments in the hardware required for the training of neural networks.\nDoes the development team have experience with similar solutions?\nRomanus' team has worked with several other companies and solved similar issues. Most importantly the team has worked with a british company that identifies and reports the occurence of company logos and brand marks within photos, a task much more complex than detecting varroa mites on bees.\nBuilding the app, backend and other software that is required for the project is a trivial task for the team.\nWhy hasn't this been done before?\nThe hardware wasn't available and the idea was probably too far-fetched to be taken seriously. We have the hardware and the team has solved similar tasks. Also Bj\u00f6rn, the creator of this project, has a record of finding new solutions. Please visit his beekeeping site. Though in swedish, if you are a Beekeeper you will be blown away and get the idea of extracting honey from frameless supers. \nHow beescanning analyzes images\nIn the initial phase the training of the neuron net is as descibed in the image above, the only difference is that a human has to cut bees with varroa on, and for that we are building a superfast tool. The image just describes how the neuron net works but then again there is a layer above with statistical calculations concluding and considering the overall.\nTiming and team\nDuring coming season we will extend our own survey, collect images from around the world and use all this data to produce the software and the app. Initial data are already at hand from our pilotstudy in 2016 and the infrastructure and programmers is developing now.\nMany activities are parallell\nOur team represents leading experts and advisors from top Universities in Sweden and the U.S. The project has been presented to and collaborates with beekeeping researcher from all over the world.\nFunding\nFor the initial stage we ask for just 5 000 USD. Funds are needed for building the database stucture with an API that can handle lots of data from the worlds beekeepers and communicate with the users.\nThe major assets that are needed for the project, 350 000 USD, we think will be funded late May by the European Innovation Program. We also have investors contributing not to mention a huge nonprofit and volunteering effort from our innovation group and beekeeping friends.\nThe Kickstarter campaign is a Kickstarter. That is to say both a means for funds but also an important way to engage worlds beekeepers and market the concept.\nThe more funds we can raise from you, the backers, the faster we can develop and the less we depend on public financing. With proper funding we will be able to push the project ahead this coming season. We are already planning for analyzing video footage and using augmented reality. The technology will enable enhanced accuracy and studying other aspects of bees health and behavior. Our research and development also has the potential to expand in to other fields of monitoring biological systems.\nRewards\nBeescan T-shirt\nDepending on your contribution we wish to offer:\nBeekeepers:\nPersonal analysis of colonies.  \nT-shirts with the app icon \u201cBEES CAN - BEE SCAN\u201d. \nYour name on our \"Wall of Fame\".\nCompanies: \nCan advertise in the app and on the support page. -\nUse our logo in your own marketing.\nBackers:\nYour name as supporter on our site.\nT-shirts. \nMedium donors will get invitations to visit apiaries and meet our research team.\nMajor donors: Follow our research on site.

Drinks sponsored by Pip\u00e8 Cuidamo!\nAnother Fucking Warhol Production by Kate Enman\nABOUT ANOTHER FUCKING WARHOL PRODUCTION \nAnother Fucking Warhol Production or Who\u2019s Afraid of Andy Warhol is a 2017 American docu-fiction performance set to premiere at The Kitchen June 22-24. Presented by LUMBERYARD (formerly ADI).\nTICKETS ARE ALREADY ON SALE - CHECK IT OUT HERE! \nAnother Fucking Warhol Production by Peter Raper\nIn this show, the company attempts to re-create the unrecorded, deleted, and lost footage from Saturday Night Live\u2019s 2015 episode on Love and War, featuring Ballet Dancers and musical guest Kanye West a The performance is in three parts: a one-hundred day visual campaign [check it out!] , a live reality-theatre performance at The Kitchen in NYC, and (of course) the screening of the episode itself. The live show will recreate the experience of an SNL dress rehearsal. From this we\u2019ll make the never-before-seen Episode that will be live-streamed through the feath3r theory website 2 hours after the show ends and is only available to the audience that was present for the recording and you, our backers!\nThe purpose of this is to reveal how pop-culture is created; to literally realize our relationship to it. You participate, you collaborate, you corroborate, YOU make ME. \n\nWHY THIS SHOW \nAs an (involuntary) Millennial, as well as a gay black man, one of my closest relationships is the one I have with pop-culture.  In a post-Warhol, post-modern, post-Obama, post-election culture, I find myself in constant crisis. The content of the episode can be summarized as LOVE and WAR \u2013 the war on love, in a time of war what is love and what\u2019s it\u2019s purpose? What is real and what is not? How did we come to this?  \nABOUT THE FEATH3R THEORY \nthe feath3r theory is a dance-theatre company with a reputation for theatrically restaging fiction historical and current events by abstracting these events into dance theatre. Our style of live-performance is like professional regional theatre meets a competition dance team at a sketch comedy club, and is participating in MTV\u2019s The Real World as Cartoon Characters. We are characterized by our use of color to thwart the design of the body. We regurgitate pop-culture. My movement-based performances combine fashion show, gallery exhibition, drag, stand-up comedy, minstrel show, and stage-play into a single, overwhelming, over-saturated Gesamtkunstwerk\u2014 in which artists and audience alike experience their shared humanity. We bend, but don\u2019t break, the specific formal rules of each genre we appropriate. We thus deconstruct each genre from within the genre\u2019s own internal rules and contradictions. We love to play with duration.

To help her deal with the pain of this loss, I encouraged her to write out a list of all the things she could never do while on the clock, and one by one, we ticked the items off her bucket list. Throughout these adventures, my mom really lived -- she took a hip hop class with a \"Hamilton\" dancer; she finally got to visit her sister's grave in the UK; she reunited with her daughter and the granddaughter she hadn't seen in a decade. But without an income, the realities of unemployment loomed.\nThe documentary tells the story of this growing tension between freedom and a lack of security; it highlights the universal, and inevitable, role reversal of parent and child. And it shows the reality of life today for middle-class senior citizens.\nOur Goal: \nOne day, every one of us will need to step up for our mothers, in some way. Whether the Mom in your life is your biological mother, adopted mother, father, grandmother, teacher, or neighbor, let's give all of them an experience that they'll never forget. With your support, millions of sons and daughters around the world will watch \"Duty Free\" and be inspired to make memories with their mothers that will further bond them together.\nMore broadly speaking, we are living in a society that is leaving older generations behind. As demand for established skills shift and social security and pension plans remain woefully underfunded, the future well-being of older generations is unclear. \nUpon successful completion of our Kickstarter campaign, we will partner with a recognized streaming service to maximize the film's reach and foster empathy for our mothers everywhere -- they are our gems!\nAbout the FIlmmaker:\n  I've made a career out of telling important stories both in front of, and behind, the camera. I've contributed on-camera pieces to CNN, HLN, MTV, CBS and more, around pop culture and social justice issues. I've written for outlets across the lifestyle space, and created my own publication, Swagger, which now has over 1.5MM fans. Though I've told longer-form stories professionally, this is my first documentary.  \nIn today's oft-divisive world, I know this is my opportunity to tell a powerfully true story about someone we can all get behind: our moms. Along with an experienced production team, I'm excited to create an impactful movie that we believe speaks to millions.\nAbout My Mom:\nMy mom has worked in hospitality her entire adult life. An immigrant from the outskirts of Liverpool, she arrived to the States in the late 60s as a cultural ambassador to from England; she taught Americans an English song, an English dance, and how to cook and typical English meal. She's gone on to spend decades at numerous Boston hotels in Housekeeping, and spent twelve at her most recent job.  My mom has one daughter who lives in England, and two sons, both on the East Coast.\nUse of Campaign Proceeds:\nYour money will go toward one thing: Production Costs -- which are outlined below.  \nOur Crew: I'm so grateful to be working with a wonderful, passionate, and talented group of videographers, audio professionals, and editors (shout outs below!). They all need to get paid fairly. But beyond capturing the footage, we'll need sound engineers, color correctors, and other post-production staff to make this as beautiful as anything you've seen on Netflix or another service.  \nOur Bucket List Items: The biggest-cost items are behind us. All seven of the future bucket list items will happen in the US (less cost!), but will require travel and associated fees to execute. Some upcoming bucket list items include skydiving, walking the Boston Marathon route, and returning to my mom's first home in Detroit.\nHow Many More Shoots: I estimate seven more bucket list shoots, with four shoots slotted for unplanned moments that require filming. Given my mom's shifting life, it's important to be ready to capture raw moments that no one could have expected. Most of these shoots will require a crew of four, around the country.  \nEstimated Delivery: We plan to wrap up the larger shoots by the end of 2017, and edit through much of 2018. Estimated delivery is Fall 2018. My mom and I will not be using ANY of the funds for personal use.  \n*Crew shoutout: Thank you to EVERYONE who has helped to make this happen -- Mom, Meredith Chin, Joey Dwyer, Barbaros Kaynak, Pierce Jackson, Ben Phelps, Miguel Rodriguez, The Sweet Family, Hope Easterbrook, The Carneys, The Mitchells, Cassandra Alcide, Joe Regis, Nimchy Regis, Jen Chadwick, The Nolans, The McCarthys, Nicole Ahern, Jen Gomo and everyone else I've called, emailed, asked for help, etc throughout this process!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest challenge we'll face is being there for the twists and turns that come with my mom's current life situation.

A portion of the performance is simply the presence of the community members who volunteered to care for the field, with no other motive than \u201cdeveloping\u201d a garden/park for everyone to enjoy. \nProject location\nThe Planting \nPlanting the seeds\nThe results from last year: After a long hot and dry couple of months, the first sunflower bloomed, and soon after others joined, like a slow fireworks display taking place in the coming weeks. It was now finally quite evident what we were up to all summer and the land became activated with a flurry of people inhabiting the space for a variety of unplanned intentions, including yoga, picnics, and music. The response was incredible. The simple joy that a simple flower could bring to people was the most consistent of comments I received, and one of my favorites, a young girl out with her mother on their evening stroll always insisted they go \u201cthe sunflower way.\u201d\nThe People\nThe people of 10,000 SUNS\nI found these responses rewarding, but perhaps even more so was the conversations I had through the summer as people approached me to ask about the project, and formed many new friendships I might of otherwise not of made. Simply seeing people take initiative to cultivate an idea seemed to evoke a new appreciation for what the urban landscape in Providence could be, raising the expectations for quality site-sensitive development that will inevitably one day be built on this land.\n The New Proposal\n10,000 SUNS 2017 Proposal Image\nBuilding upon the success of 10,000 Suns from the Summer and Fall of 2016, the project looks to add certain layers based on community feedback and lessons learned from last season to improve the growth and health of the sunflowers. \nWater\nHelp us put in temporary irrigation so we can sleep at night, rather than water. (Picture taken at 2:30am)\nWatering was an issue in 2016 and the hours spent keeping the project going will be reduced this year by implementing a necessary, temporary, and simple irrigation system. It was also evident that the soil quality of the parcel was not conducive to optimal growth so we are looking for considerable addition of compost.\nNew Features\nThe added layers mentioned previously aim to make the field not only aesthetically significant but a place for respite. We propose relocating the strange border of granite curbs and repurposing them for seating amongst the sunflowers (seating was the most common request from the community). For simple shade for these areas we propose using a series of scattered Lombardy Poplar trees, which are very fast growing, tolerable to tough urban conditions, and with wonderful gold fall color.\nWithin each of the center of the circles of sunflowers, this year we propose an added surprise in each, whether it be a painted red piano, a set dining or chess table, or other interesting curiosity.\nAlso new to this we year we are proposing to  expand the project to the adjacent parcel. The addition creates a \u201criver of meadow and sunflowers\u201d and constructs a 10\u2019 high landform with a winding grass path to the top, creating a unique perspective to the city and sunflower field. Two smaller landforms create more intimate seating spaces. This \u201cRiver of Flowers\u201d would be composed of both sunflowers and wildflower meadow mix. \nPlease help us in the creation of this unique crowdfunded park for Providence.\n2016 Proposal Drawing and Final Result\n Rewards\n10,000 SUNS LOGO T-SHIRT W/ $50 DONATION\n\nSave", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSome of the challenges we learned last year we are addressing with new additions to the project.

Wynne Darling, 15, is physically broken, socially displaced, and emotionally torn between her newly separated parents. \nWith nowhere to turn, Wynne hooks up with a new crowd led by bad boy skateboarder, Pete, and his riot grrrl sister, Belle. Surrounded by \"lost boys\u201d and with the help of found friendship, Wynne learns what it means to grow up of her own free will...\nPLAY\n\nThematically, PANS is a deeply personal story about sexual assault and the isolation and shame that keeps many young women and girls from sharing their stories and outing their assailants. It's also the story of unlikely sisterhood, solidarity, and the timeless and systemic complexities of growing up girl. \nIn this vert ramp meets surfer-bro Neverland, the \u201clost boys\u201d are the skateboarders and the \u201cpirates\u201d are the surfers and Wendy/Wynne and Tinker Bell/Belle are teenage girls who must break out of their archetypal \u201cmother\u201d and \u201cmean girl\u201d molds in order to redefine who they are to each other and themselves. \nI wrote PANS to empower and validate teenage girls and embolden young women to be unapologetic in their art, awareness, and necessary rebellion.\nWhy \"Peter Pan\"?\nI spent much of my childhood LOVING Peter and the lost boys while despising Wendy and Tinker Bell, who were depicted in the book and Disney adaptation as overly protective/maternal-to-a-fault/wet blanket (Wendy) and jealous/vindictive/mean spirited/mean girl (Tinker Bell).\nIn Peter\u2019s world, as well as in my learned experience, boys were curious adventure-seekers who slouched and got dirty and had all kinds of fun being irresponsible and boyish. They were curfew-less mischief-makers, digging their tools into trees and their heels onto gas pedals. They crashed into each other with their bodies and everyone applauded. They were allowed to be WILD. \nOver the years I drew parallels between the story of Peter Pan and my own adolescence. I grew up, in the way Wendys do, and in doing so realized there was much more to this story\u2014that in so many ways, Peter Pan represented what was lacking in fairy tales and bedtime stories and all works of art written, directed and conceived by men.\nI read Barrie's Peter Pan several times through the years, always looking for a Wendy I couldn\u2019t find. It became clear to me that while Wendy was intended to be the heroine all along\u2014the protagonist\u2014she remained practically invisible. Ubiquitous, yes, but also unnecessary\u2014a girl transported into a world of boys only to be used as a sort of tool for contrast. Wendy's practicality and realism gave Peter and the boys that much more appeal. As for Wendy, we never got a chance to see her magic. And I realized I had been living my story within the pages of other people's manuscripts --  appeasing the stories of others, at the risk of losing my own. \nI wrote PANS to change the story\u2014to change OUR story. \n The Future is Female\nOver the last decade, I have marveled at teenage destination sites like Teen Vogue, Rookie Mag, School of Doodle\u2014all fearless in their exploration of issues pertaining specifically to teenage girls. I have also worked personally as a blogger on the Internet, uniting with women and girls in my community to support, elevate and empower female-driven storytelling. If girls and women are successfully finding and embracing themselves and each other on the Internet, why aren\u2019t they seeing themselves on the big screen? Where are the films portraying the trials and triumphs of sisterhood, of girls fearlessly and shamelessly telling their truths? PANS is the movie I wished we had as teenaged girls. It's also the movie I wish we had now.\nMe @ Wynne's age\nSo much kismet happened while working on PANS -- reminders at every turn that making this movie is not only important for me and countless other women, but young girls who don\u2019t have the opportunity to watch their stories on the big screen -- specifically stories about what it means to rise up against rape and resist the culture that supports it.\nIn PANS, Wendy reclaims her power after being stripped of it by her assaulter and her female community who didn\u2019t believe her side of the story. This theme resonates now more than ever.\nIn the last few months, I have looked to myself and other women in my community to be the leaders. I have looked to my peers and a younger generation of outspoken young people who are unafraid and unapologetic in their dissent. I have repeated ad nauseam to my children, to my family, to myself, that maybe it was never about one woman leading the free world but MILLIONS OF US leading ourselves and each other. Maybe WE ARE THE ONES WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. \nSometimes it takes the rise of a villain for us all to become superheroes. And sometimes it takes writing fictional stories for us to realize our truths. If more women could tell the stories...if more women could cast more women, could hire more women, could explore more women\u2019s stories, maybe we wouldn't have to fight so hard to be heard. \nHollywood certainly prides itself on being a liberal mecca but pay attention and you'll see that toxic masculinity, whitewashing, racism, misogyny and chauvinism (showvanism?) are Hollywood institutions. Female directors STILL make up only 7% of the top 250 grossing films and the vast majority of films lack female representation behind the camera. \nED: In 2014, 85% of films had no female directors, 80% had no female writers, 33% had no female producers, 78% had no female editors and 92% had no female cinematographers, according to the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University. And while sexism is CLEARLY a problem behind the scenes, on-screen storytelling ripples WORLDWIDE. Consumers have always been in control. We don't have to eat what is put on our plate. We can (and I believe we should) demand better. \n  We're incredibly excited to be working with actors Sydney Park (Walking Dead, Instant Mom, Once Upon) and Avan Jogia (Victorious, Tut, Midsummer Night's Dream.)\nAs well as casting an inclusive and female led cast, we are currently crewing up with the goal to employ as many women on set as possible.\nAnd also to Danielle Hull for designing our T-shirts and pins! \n    You can snag your own by backing our campaign and strutting down the street in all of your unapologetic glory because YESSSSSSSSSS.\n         We love you. We need you.

My name is Rebecca Groom, and I am the person behind Palaeoplushies\u2122; a series of realistic soft sculpture dinosaurs that I design and sew myself. I have previously run a successful Kickstarter campaign to produce Velociraptor plushies and other Velociraptor-related goodies. My focus on scientific accuracy has been warmly received by palaeo-fans and those from the palaeontological community alike.\nThe experience of running the previous Kickstarter has taught me a lot about the plush manufacturing process what to be prepared for. This time I hope to put that knowledge to good use to produce a number of life-size, accurate Archaeopteryx soft toys! I aim to make the toys bigger, fluffier and more cuddly than the Velociraptors, whilst retaining their palaeontological accuracy.\nArchaeopteryx is an iconic bird-like dinosaur known from the Late Jurassic (150mya) of southern Germany. It was first named from a single feather in 1861, there are now 12 mostly complete fossils known. The largest species, Archaeopteryx lithographica, could grow to around 50cm in length.\nOften touted as the \"first bird\", or Urvogel, it is a small theropod dinosaur closely related to dromaeosaurids such as Velociraptor. Is often used as an example of a \"transitional fossil\" as it has features of both birds and extinct non-avian dinosaurs. It was discovered two years after Darwin's publication of On the Origin of Species and played a part in confirming Darwin's hypothesis.\nA lot is known about Archaeopteryx' life appearance as there are a number of complete fossils known, often showing beautifully preserved feathers. Archaeopteryx had multiple layers of stiff flight feathers, whilst the body may have been covered in more fluffy, fur-like feathers (1). It sported \"trousers\" of stiffer feathers around it's legs (2). The presence of preserved melanosomes found in the wing coverts indicates that they were likely to have been black (3). Black feathers are stronger than lighter coloured feathers in modern birds, so dark pigmentation in the flight feathers is very possible for Archaeopteryx.\nFor such a well-known and historically important species, it has surprisingly little representation in the way of educational toys. Those that do exist are often inaccurate and don't do a good job of showing our current knowledge of how this species would've really looked. I hope to change that by bringing a life-size (~50cm long) fluffy Archaeopteryx to life in the form of a soft toy, as well as pin badges, t-shirts and other Archaeopteryx themed products.\nReferences\n1) Christensen, P; Bonde, N.

BioEssays. 37 (6): 643\u2013656.\n  I produced the initial design (Fig. 1) to get an idea of the kind of product I wanted to see made. The first prototype was designed and sewn by me (Fig. 2 \"Originalopteryx\"), the pattern I created was then sent off to the company Shinedown plush who have worked with the factories on my behalf to produce a plush that matches my vision as best possible. We've been through a number of samples and prototypes (Fig. 2) to get to the finished design that I'm very happy with!\nThe Finished Archaeopteryx Prototype\nWhilst this was all going on I was busy designing pin badges, T-shirts and the like. I have companies lined up already to produce all these items, so all that is left to do is to raise the funds!\n   Plush Production - Over half of the cost is for the production of the plushies, including development costs and safety testing.\nFees and Taxes - The boring bit! This covers Kickstarter's fees, card payment fees and customs duty when importing the plushies to the UK.\nShipping - Another large chunk of the cost goes towards shipping. The plushies will be shipped to me, and then I will ship all the incentives out to my backers!\nIncentives - This is how much it will cost to produce all the rewards such as embroidered patches, badges and t-shirts!\nUnforeseen Circumstances - Most of the time, the unexpected happens. I've budgeted a little extra in case of surprise fees, price fluctuations or miscalculations. This gives me a little wriggle room!\n    Pin Badge- Your choice of one \"Natural\" or one \"Black and Gold\" 30 mm enamel pin badge of a heraldic Archaeopteryx design! The Natural pin will feature translucent enamel dark coloured wings to simulate iridescence that may have been present in life. The \"Black and Gold\" pin will be gold plated with black hard enamel fills. Add \u00a36 to pledge for one add-on pin badge of your choice\nEmbroidered Patch- a 70mm embroidered patch with an iron-on backing (can still be hand-sewn if you'd like!) featuring a heraldic Archaeopteryx on a shield. Add \u00a34 to pledge for add-on Embroidered Patch\nT-shirt- Heather-effect Grey t-shirt available in sizes XS to 2XL. The heraldic Archaeopteryx design will be discharge-ink printed. This process removes colour from the shirt rather than laying ink onto the surface, resulting in a more hard-wearing design with a much softer finish which should survive the life of the shirt! Add \u00a318 to pledge for add-on T-shirt\nLifesize Archaeopteryx Plush - The main event! These plush toys are 47cm long, which is around the upper limit of a large Archaeopteryx lithographica. They have printed details on the feet and beak, with two small soft claws poking out of each wing. Embroidered details on the wings and tail show feather patterns. They have blue-grey plastic safety eyes. These toys will be EN71 Safety Tested and should be suitable for children over 3 years of age.

I have completed a successful similar Kickstarter before I have already encountered a few of the things that can go wrong- luckily everything went smoothly in the end and I know what to expect this time! \n\nFor example, last time I was hit with unexpected customs charges, this time I have taken this into account in the budget. I'll also strive to improve the postage and packaging this time, as a few pin badges were damaged in the post by the postal franking machines, this time I will send them in protective card boxes.\n\nOne possible cause of delay would be due to the manufacturing process- as I've already approved the samples so we should be ready to go with manufature as soon as payment has cleared. There might be slight variations of the final product from the samples, which can be expected in larger runs of plushies.

Over the summer, with your help, we were able to raise $300 dollars to buy a microphone and several key costume components, rent a steadicam and a dance rehearsal space, and of course, satisfy all of Ben\u2019s fondue needs.\nMore than anything, our initial Kickstarter helped spread word of our project. The support we\u2019ve received from friends, both old and brand new, has been nothing short of amazing. Your kind words, your financial donations, but most importantly your belief in us, has helped us see this project through to its final stages.\nOur original goal was to release this past fall, but due to conflicts in scheduling, and ultimately our desire to deliver the highest quality product we were capable of, we decided to delay our release. For those of you who have not been following our progress, we have since been on a production-tear. We re-filmed scenes that were lacking, became more active in releasing weekly content, and we nailed down our technique for getting the most out of every scene.\nRecently we were stunned by the news that ABC is trying to rip us off by creating a Dirty Dancing remake of their own, premiering May 24th. We\u2019ve never been afraid of the bigger guy, and so we\u2019ve set a hard deadline to premier on May 23rd. It\u2019s a classic match-up, David vs. Goliath, Rocky vs. Apollo Creed, Johnny Castle vs. Robbie Gould - and we will not be beaten. We\u2019re confident with our progress, and our non-stop coordinating, filming, and editing has paid off in now having over an hour of complete, edited footage! With that being said, we have just over a month of filming - and a few very important scenes left (including one involving Baby and the world\u2019s smallest corner). When we set out to make this film, we did so with the intention of doing our due diligence to the original film - and as such we don\u2019t want to cut corners in the filming of some of the film\u2019s most iconic scenes (unlike ABC).\nWe are setting a goal for $2000 dollars to pay for the following:\n1. Renting locations for three huge shoot days. \n2. Paying additional camera personnel to help out on those shoot days.  \n3. Any excess funds we have will go towards renting a screening space for our premiere on May 23rd.\nWe want to thank you for taking part in this crazy journey with us, and regardless of whether you can donate or not- we\u2019re glad to have you with us. Please stay posted for information of our premiere on May 23rd. And follow us on instagram @boiz.club.fancy.pants for all of the Boiz Club Dirty Dancing content you could ever desire.\nYours in love, fashion, and the dirtiest dancing,\nBoiz Club Fancy Pants", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks: \nAs we mentioned the first time around, the main risk of donating to our project is that nobody will care! Are we just shouting in an empty room?\nWe don't particularly care. \nWe're going to see this project through to the end. Whether we make $2000 from this Kickstarter or $2, we're going to finish it before May 23rd. We're going to be the second best version of Dirty Dancing and the first best remake. We have loved, and are going to love, every second of the process. It's never been about money, publicity, or playing by the rules. It's always been, and always will be, about doing this because it's a great fucking time. And when we're finished with this project we'll move on to the next one. That's our promise to you.\n\n\nChallenges: \nThe main challenges we face at this point are the amount we have left to film, and financing the final locations. To address these challenges we have created an intricate production schedule, along with shot-lists to ensure we will be finished before our May 23rd deadline. We have also worked tirelessly to locate spaces in NYC for our final scenes, and we have put deposits down on the dates we are filming.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Wrap Party Invite!", "descp": "Come to our Boiz Club Dirty Dancing Wrap Party!

Our refugee weavers respond well to the challenge of learning this skill.\nFinishing: when a rug is finally cut from the loom after months of weaving, we triple wash the rug using cold water, then press it to ensure it retains its intended shape.\nOver one million knots in this rug have been individually inspected for quality prior to final shipment\nOur Story\nThe Anka Cooperative has already had an extraordinary impact on women\u2019s lives.\nOne of these women is Neriman from Damascus. Neriman is in her early 40s and has six children. Unlike many of her unfortunate relatives, she made it safely to the Adiyaman refugee camp in Southeastern Turkey. Neriman is college educated, and prior to the war she worked for many years as an accountant. But in the camps, of course, there are no accounting jobs, no freelancer websites to apply her trade. Idle time brings painful memories. She jumped at the chance to work at the carpet workshop. It\u2019s a new skill, but she is learning\u2013\u2013and just as important, she is earning.\nNeriman is paid the same as her Turkish counterparts. She is saving to buy gold earrings for her daughters, and hopes to save for a home for when they return to Syria. Neriman represents the 250 Anka weavers who have chosen to make the best of their difficult circumstances, and are the reason Anka exists.\nWhere We Work\nOur workshop in Sanliurfa empowers 25 women in a safe, clean environment\nSanliurfa: The Sanliurfa camp has a capacity 10,000 and a current population 14,000 living in containers. The camp has paved streets, lighting, water, sewer, A/C, and even a TV. It's a secure facility but residents can come and go as they please. The weaving workshop is in an activity center that also houses an art room, restrooms and laundry facilities. We employ 25-30 weavers in a well lit and ventilated hall with windows and A/C.\nNeriman weaves with her daughter after school in one of our six workshop tents in Adiyaman refugee camp\nAdiyaman: The Adiyaman camp has a capacity of 20,000 and a current population 29,000 living in tents. It has paved streets, lighting, water, sewer, A/C, and TV. It's also a secure facility but residents can come and go as they please. The weaving workshops are in six tents. We employ 225 weavers in a well lit and ventilated tents with windows and A/C.\nOur future site in the Gaziantep Refugee camp in S/E Turkey\nComing in 2017, Gaziantep: This campaign will allow us to expand. We have been approached by camp management to expand our training and empowerment model the refugee camp in Gaziantep, Turkey. This expansion will cost the Anka Cooperative over $100,000 for looms, supplies, training, transportation, instruction, etc.\nThe Three Pillars of The Anka Cooperative\nEmpowerment Through Employment: The weavers love their work, not only for the income, but also because it provides companionship and a place to share laughs and to stay active. As a skilled weaver can weave up to 10 sq feet per month, an 9'x12' rug will employ one weaver for nearly one year. Weavers are paid the exact same as Turkish weavers.\nThese women proudly display this rug they crafted for an Embassy in Turkey\nCultural Integration: The Anka Cooperative helps refugees learn traditional Turkish language, culture and customs by learning the craft of weaving and by interacting daily with Turkish teachers. We partner with other charities to expand our reach beyond the refugee camps.\nMany of our rugs will delight children of all ages\nEducation & Awareness: We use our proceeds to support charitable organizations that tell stories of refugees' lives and struggle for dignity. We further strive to share our fundamental belief that empowerment and dignity comes from work, not a handout. We teach women to fish, we don't give them fish.\nTeaching Her How to Fish\n  Rewards  \n$25: Rug Coasters\nReflect on your impact with every sip when you back us at this level\n  $50: Framed Rug Fragment\nShow your support for Anka by hanging this handmade carpet fragment in your home or office\n  $250: Carpet Christmas Stockings\nStunning and meaningful Christmas stockings are made from world class handwoven rug fragments.\n\u2013\u2013\u2013 \nWe have a variety of already woven rugs we are offering as rewards.

While we're thrilled about the possibility of helping so many more refugees, the cost of establishing a new operation is challenging. Kickstarter provides us a unique platform to raise awareness about our approach to sustainably helping refugees.\n\nOur Team \nFatima, Hind and all the refugees we work with\nFatima and Hind both arrived in the Sanliurfa refugee camps almost in 2012.  After a struggle of several months, Hind came to the camp from her hometown of Hama\u2013\u2013a city which dates back to Biblical times. Fatima arrived from Edlin\u2013\u2013this town was one of the first to rebel against the Assad regime. Since they began weaving in 2013 they have become the very best of friends. Both in their mid 30s, the ladies enjoy their work as they laugh and socialize. They represent the 250 Anka weavers that have chosen to make the best of their difficult circumstances. It\u2019s an honor to have them on our team, as they are our reason Anka exists.\nNeslihan, CoFounder and Volunteer CEO\nAs the founder of Woven Legends, Neslihan has been producing high quality, hand-crafted carpets for over 35 years and has won numerous international awards for her carpets which are considered to be among the finest in the world. Neslihan has often been credited with birthing the rug renaissance in 1980\u2019s by exclusive use of handspun wool and natural dyes.\nIn 2012, she approached local officials in Turkey in order to teach weaving skills to Syrian refugee women at the camps. As an American and a native Turk, Neslihan feels a personal and moral obligation to support the Syrian refugees in Turkey. Through Anka, she has pioneered the idea of sustaining their livelihoods by promoting the art of carpet weaving. Her personal rapport with the refugees convinced her that Anka can expand from serving 250 refugee women to empowering 20,000 refugees by 2020.\nNeslihan has one son, Kent, and considers the tens of thousands of women she has empowered over the decades as her many daughters.\nJosh, CoFounder and Volunteer Chief Strategy Officer \nJosh and friends in Sanliurfa camp - Oct, 2016\nHaving lived, worked and volunteered on four continents, Josh brings a global and practical approach to helping fulfill Anka\u2019s mission\u2013\u2013to provide dignity of work, transfer of skills and cultural integration through the creation of traditional crafts.\nDeeply affected by the refugee crisis he saw while working in Turkey, Josh identified ways for US businesses to lend their expertise to help address this humanitarian dilemma. \nJosh is especially grateful of all those who work to support refugee issues. He would also like to thank The University of Notre Dame's Fellow Irish Social Hub and the incredibly supportive ND family!\nThank you for visiting our Kickstarter!  \nActual sketch by Syrian Refugee and the inspiration for our name: \"Anka\" - a mythical bird that which obtains new life by arising from its ashes.\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur co-founder is Turkish-American and has been training women to weave rugs for 35+ years.

That's right, New Yorkers! Your city's own poetry festival, the largest gathering of its kind, returns this summer -- and with exciting news. After six years wrapped in the breezy embrace of Colonel's Row, The New York City Poetry Festival is migrating east across the island to picturesque Nolan Park. The move is designed to give our growing festival a little breathing room and some new possibilities. Nolan Park is more than twice the size of Colonel's Row, ringed with a collection of beautiful Victorian houses, and tucked beneath the wide, green canopies of dozens of century old trees. This summer we will transform our festival into a poetry village! In addition to our three main stages, along with The Ring of Daisies Open Mic and The Children's Poetry Festival, Governor's Island has invited us to occupy and program the trellised porches that circle the park. With all this new space to explore, we are working harder than ever to bring more poetry and poetry lovers to the island. \nNolan Park\nWith that in mind and with the help of our newest festival partner The Strand Bookstore, we are redoubling our outreach in order to make this the biggest and most culturally significant festival we have ever produced. We would love for you to take part: host a reading, become a vendor, volunteer for the festival, or get involved in some other creative way that we haven't even come up with yet!\nAriel Kleinberg performing \"Fish Tanks\" at the 2016 #NYCPOFEST\nThe goal of The New York City Poetry Festival is to be the most egalitarian and inclusive poetry gathering in the world. Since it's inception the festival has remained free and open to the public. Any group or organization involved in the creation or appreciation of poetry is invited to curate a thirty minute reading on one of the festival's three main stages, and all completed applications are accepted on a first come first served basis until the festival roster is full.  We also offer tables to any organization or vendor who wishes to participate in our Vendors' Village / Book Fair at a rate of $50 for the entire weekend.\nPoetry hanging from the trees!\nThis year we will welcome back more than 75 New York City poetry groups, including venerable institutions, upstarts, small presses, local reading series, literary journals, high school poetry teams, and more to The Festival\u2019s three stages. If year\u2019s past are any indication, over 300 poets will present, and we've already booked some incredible headliners including Aja Monet, Sapphire, Deborah Landau, and Patrick Phillips. \nOur 2017 Headliners!\nThis year also welcomes back our Vendors Village packed with local artisans, literary journals, and small presses, as well as The Festival\u2019s Ring of Daisies Open-Mic, which is often the hottest mic on Governor\u2019s Island. And The Children\u2019s Poetry Festival, sponsored by Writopia Lab, will give our youngest festival attendees a chance to encounter the magic that brought us all to poetry in the first place.\nNew work from the 2012 #NYCPOFEST!\nAs always, the purpose of the New York City Poetry Festival has been to liberate poets and their work from the dark corners of bars, bookstore, and coffee shops and their halogen-lit college campuses, and to bring together as many NYC poets as possible, in the bright light of day, to meet, mingle, and collaborate. Fostering an open, approachable, diverse, innovative, sharp, and culturally prominent literary community lies at the core of The Poetry Society of New York's mission. While there are still a few entrenched poetry establishments, for many writers and artists, and even the general public, they can seem remote and inaccessible; The Poetry Society of New York aims not only to bridge these gaps, but to unify this city's poetry community in ways never before thought possible.\nLucia Stacey reading at the 2015 #NYCPOFEST!\nThis year's festival planning is already going strong, and we will make announcements here over the next few weeks. So, donate today to stay up-to-date on the lineup and other featured activities! Oh, and Kickstarter supporters who donate $50 or more even get access to the historic Commanding Officer's House, our exclusive VIP area for members of The Poetry Society of New York and festival sponsors where free drinks and refreshments will be served all day!\nThe Commanding Officer's House\n Thank you so much for supporting The Poetry Society of New York in its production of the 7th Annual New York City Poetry Festival on Governors Island. Contributors can take great pride and deep pleasure in this gathering\u2014the largest, most participatory poetry festival in the world\u2014which belongs to New York City.

In the times of conflict, they procreate. A friend changes his shape and becomes an enemy \u2013 unfamiliar, ridiculous, potentially dangerous. He experiences severe morphological changes. \nMost of the images were taken from European illuminated manuscripts and bestiaries and reinterpreted in the medium of digital large-scale graphics. The murals are printed in photographic-quality print on wallpaper, then they are glued to the wall. This requires producing new murals for each exhibition because the material is not re-usable. Funds are needed for printing 6 murals to cover 1130 sq ft (105 sq m) in total. The exhibition I would like to fund will be open at the National Center of Arts in Mexico City, 4 May-28 May. Everyone is cordially invited. \n  The Morphology of War 3\n  The Morphology of War 4\nThe absurdity of history does not change with centuries. It has potential to emerge, or to be invoked, by particular political events, from international conflicts in Ukraine and Syria to terrorist threats in Europe, drug conflicts in Mexico, and the political tension in the U.S. In the context of global fear, the project is called to reflect the initial grotesqueness of any kind of armed conflict. Collective unconsciousness influenced by mass media propaganda produces \"monsters\" embodied by real people. This project seeks to explore how traditionalism provokes an escalation of violence and how deeply these destructive instincts are rooted in the visual culture. \nArtist with a mural\n   Exhibition view\n The continuous line of monsters is reminiscent of the symbolism of the dance of the dead by Ingmar Bergman that concludes his film \"The Seventh Seal\". The project \u201cThe Morphology of War\u201d is on view at the Museo Taller Erasto Cort\u00e9s in Puebla until 24 April. The expanded version of the project will form part of the exhibition programme of the Esmeralda School of Plastic Arts in the National Centre of Arts in Mexico City, with the exhibition on 04-28 May 2017.

The permanence of the art form is what drew me in first. Marble and glass do not fade. Mortar is mortar. An ancient mosaic looks exactly as intended by the artist who produced it over two millennia ago. What else can claim that kind of staying power? I find this idea simply amazing. Since my experience in Italy, I've devoted myself to changing people's perception of what a mosaic could be. Using the same materials, tools, and methods of the archaic craftsmen, I create mosaics that speak of modern things in an ancient voice. From junk food to coffee to breakfast cereal, my work permanently locks into mortar unexpected concepts drawn from the present.\nThe original pothole installation on May 20, 2013\nOn May 20, 2013, I began to apply this thinking to the numerous potholes filling the streets of Chicago. Temporarily fixed over and over again by city street crews, the potholes cried out for something more resilient, and far more aesthetically pleasing than a patch of asphalt. Early concepts of the artwork that I first installed branded the pothole as an authentic \"Chicago-style\" pothole. Other, early creations included serial numbers (to represent the vast number of city potholes), phone numbers of nearby auto repair shops (to offer convenient access to auto wheel repairs) and even flowers (as a pretty juxtaposition to the universally ugly pothole.) My ten-piece 2015 campaign called \"Treats in the Streets\" featured classic ice cream treats. That Kickstarter project even help partially fund installing 6 pieces in Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4, Finland. In addition to Chicago installs, last year I was able to piggyback on existing travel plans and install new work in Los Angeles, San Antonio, Detroit, and Philadelphia. I hope to put new work in the ground in a few more cities this year if possible.\n\"Strawberry Shortcake\" from the \"Treats in the Streets\" series.\n  \"Banana Peel\" from the \"Pretty Trashed\" series.\n  \"Cheetos\" from the \"Pretty Trashed\" series.\nThe project has been featured on news outlets from around the world including CBS Sunday Morning (click here), PBS, ABC News, the UK's Daily Mail, Oprah's magazine \"O\", Hyperallergic, and many others. A recent piece was even featured on the cover of the March 2017 issue of Chicago magazine.\nMarch 2017 issue of Chicago Magazine\nIt's early 2017 now and pothole season will soon be upon us. Since these works of art are permanently affixed to the ground, I can't sell them. What I'm looking for is a little funding for this year's new series of pieces. Any funds raised beyond my goal will finance further installations. I have a ton of new ideas for future pieces! Take a look at my website (http://www.bachor.com/4600-north-kenton---map) to see examples of the pieces I've installed so far and check out the interactive map.\nA $5 donation gets you a POTHOLE sticker while $7 gets you a patch!\n  A signed print, featuring one of the installations from the 2017 campaign, is your reward (along with a patch and sticker) for donations starting at $30!\n  A pothole T-shirt, featuring one of the installations from the 2017 campaign, is your reward (along with a patch and sticker) for a donation of $50!\n  The 2nd edition of the pothole art installation book is your reward (along with a patch and sticker) for a donation of $100! (Signed copies are $125.) The 2nd edition will look different than this, but you get the idea.\n  A quilted Pothole Art Project \"Groundskeeper\" jacket will keep you warm and stylish all winter and it can be your reward, along with a patch and sticker, for a contribution of $250.\nThank you for considering donating to the 2017 Pothole Project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter about the sixth installation I think I have the technique down pat. (I've now done around 45 pieces of pothole art.) Temperature plays a big part of the process and April is a good time for me to start, since it's usually warm enough for the mortar to set properly. Given that my canvas is a city street, the artwork occasionally gets paved over or patched with asphalt. But that comes with playing the street. For me the only risks/challenges are making sure not to get hit by a car during an installation. There is a limitless supply of pothole candidates and, when the weather cooperates, an installation takes about 2 days to complete.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "",

Especially the severely disabled persons who have to take cared by nursing attendant, but still having many difficulties is their daily life. Esiseat is designed to reduce those difficulties and the hard works of nursing attendants by providing ultimate mobility, toilet accessibility and wireless controlled.\nToilet accessible\nEasiseat is fully integrated with a set of mechanism, which assist the sitter to use toilet at their home easily. \n  Easibelt is an accessory of Easiseat, purposed for severely disabled persons who put no force on clamping the Body Holder that attached on the Backrest. With the Easibelt on, the sitter can be lifted in a total relaxed state.\nThe video shows how an interested customer was lifting up in total relaxed state.\nPLAY\n\n Manoeuverable \nEasiseat is highly manoeuverable, allows spin, lateral and diagonal movements. Particularly fits to the tiny flats in urban area.\n   Wireless control\nEasiseat is controlled wirelessly, that convenient to the nursing attendants who taking care of an elderly or disabled persons.   \n   Innovative Furniture\nEasiseat is not only about the technology that provides solution to those in needed, we also focus on Design, Craftsmanship and Durability. We choose wood is hopping the timeless and the natural beauty from the intricate surface of wood can bring an aesthetic pleasure and comfortable experience to users . And the joint we used for the way of wood-working is building up the durability of Easiseat.\n   Why crowd funding?\nEasiseat can actually improves home life for elderly and disabled persons at different levels. However the handcrafted wood-working process takes so much time and eventually makes the cost high. We hope that Easiseat can be affordable to those who need it, so doing a conversion from handcrafted process to digital fabrication is the best way to cost down the production. Despite we started Easiseat with 3D modeling, the joints and the way of constructing it are still on handcraft basis. So we need your support to fund us from the very beginning of revising the 3D model and re-do all the joints for suiting the fabrication way of CNC , till everything is tested and ready for automatic production.\nAnother reason is to improve the Easiseat in some points that we collected from testers.\n1. We are going to add the suspension system on the rear wheels of Easiseat, for those users who want Easiseat to go through rough terrain.\n2. The transmitter, we will re-shape the transmitter to a more dynamic form , it will be able to attach on the armrest if the sitters want to control by themselves.\n3. We will add a pair of battery indicators on the transmitter, show the battery levels of Easiseat and the transmitter itself.\n4. Make variation in size, let the users be able to find one that fits to their body and still can go through the doors\n5. Make few prototypes with digital fabrication for testing the limitation with every approach such as crush test, shock absorbing test, etc.\nTesters\nEasiseat has been tested by different testers. the feedback and comments from them will be incorporated into the revision\n1. Mrs SO, a patient with Multiple Sclerosis, also is the director of Hong Kong Neuro-Muscular Disease Association\n 2. Mrs Chun is attracted by the design and innovation of Easiseat. Would like to have a test for her parents.\n 3. Mrs Tsang suffer from knee Degeneration.\n Exhibitions \nEasiseat has and will be attending some exhibitions, to hear as more comment from visitors, from their view of points for improving Easiseat. Just one month we finished Easiseat, we have attended Opening Ceremony of  the Smart Living for Aging at Hong Kong Science and Technology Park and Maker Faire Hong Kong 2017. The upcoming exhibition will  be the International ICT Expo 2017 and Gerontech and Innovation Expo cum Summit 2017.

The solid wood gives warm and natural beauty to the key-ring while the stainless steel strengthens the logo.\n Specification \nTimeline\nWe were trying to made the timeline as detail as possible, because we want the backers to be part of us.

Cut from three different regions of Wyoming, each model contains a section of The Great Divide Mountain Bike Route which I'll be riding late this summer. The A-series represents the landscape to a true scale. The B-Series highlights the disproportionate voting power found in Wyoming by allowing the landscape to absorb the high vote worth resulting in an exaggerated elevation model. 'Power Absorbent Landscapes' helps visualize the abstract concept of voting power and becomes a reflection of the peaks and valleys of a divided nation. And yet, the series can also be appreciated simply for the power held by visually stunning landscapes cut out of the earth and brought into your home or office.\n*For a limited time you can get all three B-Series (1:3) Models for the price of 2! Separated, you can have museum quality pieces in 3 different spots, or combine them to have a piece that is 6\"x18\". When hung with the satellite image prints that are included, the mixed media art work is an eye-catching 12\"x18 which looks great as a centerpiece.\n01A&01B_Angle Mountain at True and Exaggerated Scale\n  01B_Angle Mountain Power Absorbent Model\nEach of the 6 models are cut from a 6mi.x6mi. area and are scaled down to measure 6\"x6\". They are made from USG Pottery Plaster No.1, a high quality plaster known for being more dense and break-resistant than a typical plaster of paris model. \nThe plaster models feature a minutely (0.1mm) contoured surface translated over from the 3D printed parts used in the fabrication process. These contours create a shadow catching textural quality. The sides of the model are made smooth for contrast. As these are handmade in individual batches in a small work space, there will be a very slight variation between each landscape.\nThe Full (6) Landscape Model Set\nThey range between 1 3/8\" to 3 3/8\" high and weigh between 1.75 lbs. and 3 lbs. The backs are also drilled so that they may be suitable for vertical display.\nWhere Your Funding Goes\nThese models are one component of the On the Great Divide is a 3,000 mile bike tour/multidisciplinary research project exploring the space & architecture of vastness, power, and populism along the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route. This project will leverage the process of a bicycle tour to study the relationships between sublime landscapes, the sparse architecture which nestles and dots these landscapes, the people who inhabit these spaces, and the way in which these environments shape and are shaped by their ideologies.\nThe proceeds go to furthering the quality and depth of research. Things like having additional time to study a town, or to interview architects become possible. Funding also goes towards shop equipment that will be used to increase capacity of the landscape sculptures. The end goal is to exhibit a field of these landscapes paired with the photography of the trip. Maybe hundreds of them, each one unique.\nFor more information please visit onthegreatdivide.com\nVoting Power Translated to Elevation Change\nAs seen from the map above, the white square of Wyoming is prominent for its voting power compared to every other state. Each state receives a minimum of three Electoral College votes allowing for large distortions of voting power to occur. By design, and for better or for worse, this feature makes sure the rural leanings have a big say in national priorities despite growing urban populations.\nDepending on how it is calculated, one vote in Wyoming is worth 3 to 4 times more than a vote in California. The B-series of the landscape models use that number to the change of elevation on the landscape. The A-Series of the landscapes are the exact scale as they sit on the earth, but its pair has peaks 3.5 times higher. In this way the two model sets make for a quick visual of what 1:1 voting power looks like compared to 1:3.5.\nThe Process\nSelecting which landscapes to represent was a careful process to curate the various conditions found in the state of Wyoming. A key component of the On the Great Divide project is fabricating the landscapes along the route. Mapmaking helped to locate the intersections between the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route and available USGS landscape data.\nWith those intersections found, the elevation data is digitally modeled to reveal the character of the potential sites. From 34 landscapes, 3 were selected for their visual presence and contrast of form, geology, and ecology.\n  Satellite Imagery Used in Prints\nModel 01 of Angle Mountain contains a portion of the high peaks of the Rocky Mountains in north western Wyoming full of deep valleys. Model 02 of Coal Mine Creek features the striated low ridges of the high altitude desert basin in a spot where wild horses run free. Model 03 of Grieve Reservoir features the mix of plains and buttes which continue on through Colorado.\nMaking 'Power Absorbent Landscapes'\n 1. Digital models are 3D Printed @ 1\u201d=1 Mile resulting in a 6\u201dx6\u201d final product. The edges are sanded and finished with an epoxy to ensure a smooth cross section.\n2. The prototype is then coated with a thin wax to provide a small level of smoothing necessary for better cast removal. Rubber latex is then poured over the prototype to create a reusable mold.\n3. Once the mold has dried, they are sprayed with a release agent and surfactant which breaks the surface tension of plaster to decrease the number of air bubbles in the final sculpture.\n4. Sculpture quality plaster is carefully measured and mixed by hand with filtered water. \n5. Plaster is carefully poured into the mold with a formwork to retain the rectangular form. Casts are vibrated to bring air bubbles to the surface.\n6. Casts are air dried for several days with the last remaining moisture removed through a short period of forced air heat drying with increased ventilation. They bottoms and sides are then hand sanded to ensure a smooth finish. The bottoms are then drilled, signed, titled, and numbered.\n  The Landscape Models\n1A_ANGLE MOUNTAIN TRUE LANDSCAPE MODEL - PROTOTYPE\n  1B_ANGLE MOUNTAIN ABSORBENT LANDSCAPE MODEL - FINAL PRODUCT\n  1A/1B_ANGLE MOUNTAIN TRUE/ABSORBENT LANDSCAPE MODELS\n  2A_COAL MINE RIDGE TRUE LANDSCAPE MODEL - PROTOTYPE\n  2B_COAL MINE RIDGE ABSORBENT LANDSCAPE MODEL - PROTOTYPE\n  2A/2B_COAL MINE RIDGE TRUE/ABSORBENT LANDSCAPE MODELS\n  3A_GREIVE RESERVOIR TRUE LANDSCAPE MODEL - PROTOTYPE\n  3B_GREIVE RESERVOIR ABSORBENT LANDSCAPE MODEL - PROTOTYPE\n   3A/3B_GREIVE RESERVOIR TRUE/ABSORBENT LANDSCAPE MODELS\n  About Me\nHi I'm Myles Pe\u00f1a and I\u2019m a designer, maker, and architectural thinker working in the Pacific Northwest. Very early in life I discovered my passions riding bikes on gravel roads in rural Texas when I was four and drawing and designing houses late at night under the covers in my Florida bedroom by the age of eight. I learned to appreciate cycling as a discipline as I worked as a bicycle mechanic and while racing Cyclocross and Road bikes. After studies in Urban & Regional Planning and Art History at Florida State University, I continued on to pursue Architecture at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago while fabricating furniture and studying economics in my spare time. At IIT I designed several award winning projects and learned to embrace a rigorous design process rooted in research and experimentation. After graduation I worked helping to design and construct a maker space before spending four months bike touring and camping on rural backroads from Chicago to San Francisco. Enamored with the landscape I took the long route riding up to Jasper, Alberta, down to Seattle, and finally down the Pacific coast to San Francisco while focusing on landscape photography. In 2016 I moved to Seattle where I now work as an architectural designer on educational institutions.\nYou can see more of my work, my resume, and other projects at zmpena.com\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith the most complex and largest landscape, 1B, developed to the form and materiality of the final product, I've successfully been able to begin producing these quickly.

Setting the bag to strobe mode bumps battery life to 16 hours.\nIf you love the environment as much as we do, we recommend using rechargeable batteries.\nIntegrated on the inside is a small zip-locked pocket at the bottom, which is intended for the inverter. An additional larger pocket near the top gives room for items such as wallets, keys, phones, etc.\nTwo more pockets on the opposite side keep everything tidy and in order.

Be warned, we're about to proceed with all due sarcasm.\nMister Lewis calls himself a \"physics consultant,\" but what he really consultants on are problems that defy the laws of physics.  Problems like whether there's a supernatural reason all those musicians are dying or how to build an ironclad legal case for firing a warlock from your company.  And like any consultant, he frequently finds himself doing unpleasant work for unpleasant people.\nIt's a genre bender filtering urban fantasy, horror and detective fiction through a sardonic worldview.  The influences are The Night Stalker by way of Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett and Art Buchwald.\nI've already written a couple stories about Mister Lewis and I'd like to try something a little different as I move forward with the series.  I'd like to write a story each month - a novelette or longish short story.  I'm calling it novelettes, but if you wanted to call a monthly e-zine, I wouldn't argue with you.  The idea is to have a new story show up each month like an issue of Batman... except without the serials and annoying crossover events.\nWhat will these read like?  Lucky you, I've already written two adventures and they're online for free, so you can make an informed decision:\nThe Samples\nRead on Medium\n     All the Dead Musicians: Why were so many musicians suddenly dying? Why was a certain aging rocker infamous for his overindulgence still standing and the younger musicians weren\u2019t? Something is very wrong in the music industry and this time it\u2019s not a publicity stunt.\nRead on Medium\n    The Curse of the Goat: The baseball team was poised to go all the way, but there was a problem: they played in a cursed ballpark. As the curse spills out of the ballpark and into the drunken throngs surrounding it, an alderman obsessed with redevelopment is drawn into conflict with a sinister and entitled group of NIMBYs bent on a sports-free neighborhood. Mister Lewis has been hired to clean up the mess, but the Curse of the Goat wants blood.\nThe Stories for This Project\nWhat I am looking to write?  Topics and titles are subject to change if inspiration strikes, but the current slate is:\n\nLegal Termination of a Warlock: The tech startup really needs to fire somebody before the sexual harassment suits start dropping, so why not that employee they're sure is a warlock?  After all, nobody wants an older employee at a tech company, but how do document cause for termination on a warlock?\n\nThe Gentrified Bodega: The building was sold.  The neighborhood was said to be improving and those condos were going to fetch a pretty penny.  There's just one problem - the bodega on the first floor wasn't always a bodega and there was something that didn't want to move out.\n\nThe Hipster From Hell: You expect hipsters to worship irony.  You don't expect prayers to irony to get answered, but then again, who makes a blood sacrifice to irony?\n\nSurveillance From Beyond the Veil: Wire taps?  Fine.  Computer viruses? Fine. Corporate spies that literally haunt the walls?  That's a different type of clean up.\n\n The Soul Tariff: A tax on departing souls causes a backup at the funeral parlor.\n\n Term Limits Don't Matter If You Have Enough Children: An old acquaintance resurfaces and takes nepotism to unheard of levels.\nHow would I be receiving these stories?  With a download code for a .PDF or .ePub file.  And you'll be getting it a month before anything goes up on the major bookstores sites like Amazon and Barnes & Noble.\nWhat are the Premium offerings? Three things: at the $50 level, your name will be included on a patron's page at the beginning of the ebook.  At the $100, a character in one of the stories will be named after you and said character will die a horrible death.  Be warned: your namesake might not be a pleasant person.  And if you really, really want some Lovecraft material... look to the bottom of the rewards list.\nHave I done this writing thing before? I'm a member of Mystery Writers of America, best known on the fiction side of things for writing a webcomic for the Chicago Tribune Media Group.  Over on the journalism side, I was a contributing editor to one TIME's Top 25 Blogs of 2012 and written for Chicago Tribune, New York Resident, Publishers Weekly, Startup Grind, The Next Web, The Beat and Comic Book Resources.  I get around a little.\nHow did you arrive at that number for the goal? I need to redirect time from other projects to adhere to a monthly schedule.  It's not that big a deal to reallocate my time, but those student loan people want their money!  So I'm essentially calculating that minimum as a percentage of my grad school loans.

Thanks to all of you who helped us reach our stretch goal of $100,000 to support the conservation of puppets in the Museum\u2019s Jim Henson Collection.  \nFor the remainder of our Kickstarter campaign, we invite you to help support the production of the two interactive experiences in The Jim Henson Exhibition as we strive for a second and final stretch goal of $125,000. These interactive experiences are key ingredients in the exhibition, and with additional funding, we can build them as imagined. They demonstrate two of Henson\u2019s most significant innovations: puppetry for the television screen and puppet character design.  \n\u201cPerform a Puppet on Screen\u201d gives visitors an opportunity to experience first-hand what it is like to watch themselves perform a puppet on a television monitor. When they\u2019re finished, they will be able to email a video of their performance to themselves. \nThe \u201cDesign an Anything Muppet Character\u201d experience begins with a short video featuring Henson puppet-builder Rollie Krewson demonstrating how she designs \u201cAnything Muppet\u201d characters for Sesame Street. Visitors will be able to select facial features and accessories for an \u201cAnything Muppet\u201d form, and see what their character looks like on screen.  \nThese two interactive experiences will allow visitors to get creative and discover their inner character designer and puppeteer!\nStretch Goal: $100,000 to restore more puppets!\nWe are so grateful for the outpouring of support from the community of Jim Henson fans! Your generosity has enabled us to meet our goal of $40,000 to preserve and install the puppets in The Jim Henson Exhibition in just two days!\nWe hope you will continue to support us and help us spread the word about this campaign, as we extend our efforts to preserve Jim\u2019s legacy: we are setting a new goal of $100,000, which will help us restore more puppets in the Museum\u2019s Jim Henson collection. The Jim Henson Exhibition at MoMI and its traveling version, The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited, will feature many of Jim\u2019s unique puppets, but there are many more \u201cwaiting in the wings\u201d for their turn! As The Jim Henson Exhibition is a permanent exhibition at the Museum, the puppets in the original installation will rotate off at times for routine conservation, and it is imperative that other puppets be ready to take their place!\nThe Museum\u2019s Jim Henson collection includes puppets from all of Jim\u2019s work for film and television. To name just a few: \nKermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Scooter, Dr. Bunsen Honeydew, Rowlf, Beaker, Gonzo, Zoot, the Swedish Chef, the Koozebanians, and Camilla from The Muppet Show; \nBig Bird, Elmo, Count von Count, Grover, Cookie Monster, Prairie Dawn, Ernie and Bert from Sesame Street; \nJunior Gorg, Doozers, and all the Fraggles from Fraggle Rock; \nJen, Kira, Aughra, Pod people and a Skeksis and Mystic from The Dark Crystal; \nRare puppets from Jim\u2019s television commercials and other early work in the 1950s and 1960s, including Yorick from Sam and Friends, the LaChoy Dragon, Wilkins and Wontkins, Sir Linit, Taminella Grinderfall, the \u201cJava\u201d puppets, and the Tastee Freeze Boss; \nPuppets from Emmet Otter\u2019s Jugband Christmas, The Muppet Musicians of Bremen, Faffner Hall, and much more! \nWe cannot thank you enough for your overwhelming support. We are thrilled to be working with you all to preserve this unique and important collection for generations to come.\nWith a generous gift of hundreds of puppets and artifacts from the Henson family, Museum of the Moving Image in New York City plans to open a brand new, permanent exhibition dedicated to the work of legendary puppeteer and director Jim Henson. Over the course of a singular career, Henson created stories and characters for television and film that have delighted and inspired generations of fans around the world \u2014 from the glamorous Miss Piggy and the gentle Grover, to the mystical creatures of The Dark Crystal. The Jim Henson Exhibition will share the full story of Henson\u2019s unique talent, and the deeply collaborative creative process behind his work.\nWhat will the exhibition include?\nThe exhibition will feature more than 40 original puppets \u2014 including Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Elmo, Cookie Monster, the Fraggles, and a Skeksis from The Dark Crystal \u2014 as well as puppet prototypes, original character sketches, rare behind-the-scenes footage and photographs, and interactive puppetry design and performance experiences.\nSections of the exhibition will be devoted to:\nHenson\u2019s early work for television and film in the 1950s and 60s, in which his unbridled imagination, wit, and capacity for creative innovation were clearly established \nSesame Street, where his remarkably expressive puppets have delighted children for generations \nThe Muppet Show and Muppet feature films, which have had an indelible impact on popular culture \nand the imaginary worlds of Fraggle Rock, The Dark Crystal, and Labyrinth\nPreserving the puppets for future generations\nThe Jim Henson Collection at Museum of the Moving Image includes approximately 175 historic puppets, such as Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Big Bird, Ernie, Bert, Elmo, the Fraggles, Jen and Kira from The Dark Crystal, and many, many more. The restoration of this important collection is an ongoing collaboration between the Museum and Jim Henson\u2019s Creature Shop, with input from fine art conservators. The Museum is honored to be working with the designers and builders at the legendary Creature Shop to restore and preserve the puppets for future generations.\nAbout the traveling exhibition\nThe Museum is excited to launch a traveling version of the exhibition, The Jim Henson Exhibition: Imagination Unlimited, which will tour around the country and the world! The tour kicks off at Seattle\u2019s Museum of Pop Culture on May 20, 2017. We are thrilled that the flagship and traveling versions of the exhibition will reach such a large, diverse audience.\nAbout the screenings and public programs \nThe Museum is already a busy hub of Henson-related activity and programming: we host monthly screenings of Henson\u2019s work that draw a large, enthusiastic audience, and we have piloted an engaging slate of education and family programs related to the exhibition, which will serve school groups and families all year long.\nWhy Kickstarter? \nThe lasting, universal appeal of Henson\u2019s work is unprecedented. People of all ages continue to be delighted and inspired by Jim Henson\u2019s stories and characters. We\u2019re excited to use Kickstarter to connect with Henson fans around the world, and bring this global community together to support a permanent exhibition honoring his creative legacy.\nWhat will your contributions support? \nThe City of New York awarded the Museum a generous grant that has enabled us to build the gallery in which this important and inspiring exhibition will be housed. Construction of the gallery space is complete and plans for the exhibition have been finalized.\n\nBut we need your support to bring the rest of this incredible exhibition to life, in time for the 2017 school year. Your pledges will help us complete the important work of restoring the puppets in the Museum\u2019s Henson Collection and fabricating and installing the display cases for the puppets and other artifacts. \nYour contributions will ensure that hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world will be inspired by the creative process behind Jim Henson\u2019s work, and be able to get up close and personal with such beloved puppet characters as Kermit the Frog, Miss Piggy, Elmo, Big Bird, the Fraggles, and many more.\nRewards\nVideo credits  \nVideo production by Slam!

We are the Dresdner Sinfoniker, a contemporary symphony orchestra from Germany.\nOn 3rd June 2017, we will stage a concert on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border. We have invited musicians from the United States and Mexico to play along with us at Friendship Park between Tijuana and San Diego.\nBecome part of a huge happening!\nWe want musicians, bands, artists, performers and basically everyone who wants to speak up for liberty and human rights to join us by initiating their own performances along the wall on 3rd June 2017.\nWith this happening we are not only protesting against President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall, but also against the isolation and nationalist policies around the world. Together, we will demonstrate that music knows no boundaries and art can help to build bridges across all barriers.\nFilm or photograph your own protest, concert, song, handstand or acrobatics (anything you want, really) everywhere alongside the 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexican border and post it on your Twitter account using the hashtag #teardownthiswall and we will share it on our site tear-down-this-wall.org.\nOur concert will be live-streamed online and the event will be professionally filmed. The repertoire will be a wide range of famous pop songs and new works composed especially for the occasion.\nAbout the location\nMexico and the United States meet the Pacific Ocean at Friendship Park. This is also where hundreds of families gather to catch a glimpse of their loved ones through the fence or hug one another during a brief two minute opening of the gates. With this concert we want to show that we are united, despite being divided by walls and borders.\nFriendship Park \u00a9 Maria Teresa Fernandez\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe are turning to Kickstarter because we need to raise \u20ac15,000 to make this project a reality. We will tour Mexico and the funds will only be used for domestic flights, accommodation, event support and professional video documentation. We are a non-profit organisation and rely on public funding, grants, and individual benefactors.\nWe want a community of like-minded people who are concerned about current policies of isolation and nationalist tendencies of our governments. Join our protest with #teardownthiswall and stage your own event anywhere along the 2000 mile border!\nWe have seen this before\nBeing from former East Germany we have witnessed the impact of isolation and political walls. It is a bad idea!\nTogether we will raise our voices like the citizens of East Germany did during their peaceful revolution.\n30 years ago Ronald Reagan told the world and Mr Gorbachev to 'Tear down this wall!'\nRewards\nEvery pledge level will receive a personalised thank you certificate signed by the Dresdner Sinfoniker.
