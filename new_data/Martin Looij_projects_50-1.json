Store the bone or add it to a dino display you're preparing in your lab!\n Each turn, you have three energy points to spend moving around the site, collecting plaster, digging through layers of terrain, and extracting fossils. \n As you remove Terrain tiles from the board, you claim the tile for the precious fragments (eggshells, footprints, and amber) found on them. They can be used to buy helpful Tools or Supplies. \n Sometimes you'll find lost rock hammers in the dirt... return them to the display to learn game-changing skills as a reward! \n You can claim a dinosaur to your lab as long as you have at least one of its required bones. Your lab can only hold one dinosaur at a time, so you must score your dinosaur before taking another.  \n The plaster pool works as a timer for the game. Each time it's exhausted, an Event takes place that may have positive or negative effects on the game. Once the last pool runs out, game end is trigged. You earn points for the Tools and Supplies you've claimed and the different sets of dinosaurs you've collected throughout the game.  \n Ready to dig in deep?

The Rook, never one to shy away from the precarious, has decided to take down a string of casinos. But this is no office job - tougher safes, tightened security - and perhaps worst of all, you'll be working during the day!  The team will have to dress-up (or dress-down) to go unnoticed in the casino crowds.  You'll need to avoid making a commotion or taking too much heat before cracking the safe and escaping through whatever insane plan the Rook has dreamed up. \nThe original Burgle Bros was Kickstarted back in 2015 and since has become a sleeper hit in the boardgame world, winning various awards and multiple glowing reviews.  It even snuck past the guards to make it to the top 200 games on BoardGameGeek! The game have even been converted to a top-rated app, available on iOS, Android and Steam.\n Burgle Bros 2 is a 1-4 player cooperative game that plays in 60 min.\n Burgle Bros 2: The Casino Capers is not an expansion - it's a whole new game with all new ways to run a successful heist. While you'll still need to work together to explore the building and avoid getting caught, nearly every aspect of Burgle Bros has been reinvented for an even more exciting caper.\n Gear - Each players now has their own unique kit of tools that can be used during ANY player's turn.  You're no longer forced to wait until your turn before you can jump in and save the day, adding a whole new level of coordinated plays.\n New Rooms - The Pool, Blackjack table, Buffet, Dance Floor - casino rooms are a new mix of crazy and challenging effects that will keep you on your toes.\n Hidden Perks & Pitfalls - Chips are placed on rooms throughout the casino for additional one-time effects - some of them reward bold moves, and others punish them!\n Doors - In addition to walls, locked doors block your path on the casino floor.  The team can crack doors easy - the real question is, should you leave them open? \n Hunt Mode - No more moving slowly and cautiously during the heist.  Take too long and the bouncers will start hunting you. \n Finales - Cracking the safe is only step one. Now each games concludes with a big twist ending. What will the team have to do to make it out with a grand piano slowing you down, or with the swat team on your tail?\n Unlock New Content - Each time you complete a Finale, open the next sealed scenario, filled with new challenges, and new tools to get the job done.\nThis list is just scratching the surface.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs.

We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date.

Everything you do will change the strange rhythm of the Etherfields dream world, where even the wildest fantasy is possible. \nGameplay created by the Board Game veteran Micha\u0142 Oracz (author of This War of Mine: TBG, Neuroshima Hex or The Edge: Dawnfall and many others), will test not only your logical skills but also your intuition, deduction, and emotional intelligence. Develop your character from scratch using advanced deck-building, travel through the dream-world map and delve deeper into chosen locations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blown away by my experience with this game so far (\u2026) It\u2019s an amazing well of creativity!\u201d \n  - Rahdo\n\u201cThis one is real puzzler, it\u2019s so vastly different that anything I have played (\u2026) Really excited about this one!\u201d\n  - Ant Lab Games\n\"Etherfields is as a surreal and meaningful journey into a dream world that begs to be discovered.\"\n - Man vs Meeple\n \u201cEtherfields is an immersive experience.

Its got intense narrative to it, it got amazing components and amazing artwork!\u201d \n- Crabbok\n\u201cFrom the beginning I liked this a little weird, mysterious, a bit twisted, abstract atmosphere that this game offers.\u201d \n\u2013 ON TABLE \nAmazing gameplay will be accompanied by one of the most striking miniatures and art we have ever made. Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

Mike DePasquale stepped up and answered a random Facebook post to produce a ton of player trayz, (and FAST!) with his buddy Oscar Valera when we needed for review. John Popson (of Effin Cool Minis) - made the best \"where did you get those??\" minis and made sure our models were spot on.\nLORE/PUZZLES/WEBSITE - Astrid Dalmady was a key force on our team during development, helping shape this game from the ground up, art finding (especially the Darkness!), rule breaking, lore writing!

It is not a dwarf, nor does it seem to be one of the ghosts who haunt the realm of Eldervale. It forms itself out of whatever earth and sticks and rocks lay about. When I try to strike it with my hammer, it simply collapses in a cloud of debris, and my hammer harmlessly strikes the ground. But my relief at dispersing it is short lived, for when I turn around, there it is again. It is always watching\u2026 so I will call it the Watcher.\nThe Watcher may not be a ghost, but it must be communicating with them. The spirits always know where to find us and how to block our actions. The Watcher only watches, but I fear it is the true source of danger.\nI have tried to dispel the Watcher with magic \u2013 burn it with fireballs, strike it with lightning, flee from it in liquid form \u2013 all to no avail.

To send us a message please click here or on this banner:\nIt's rare to be able to work on something you love.\nThis is what happened with On the Underground. Long out of print, it was a favourite in our gaming group and when we realized that the rights were available, we reached out to Sebastian Bleasdale and, well, here we are!\nThe massive network of London Underground stations makes up one of the most complex transportation systems in the world, and On the Underground challenges you to develop it. \nBuild the most successful lines, connect them to landmarks and attract passenger traffic! \nOn the Underground is a game for players who love to create.\nWhile seemingly a simple game, the strategic depth takes you beyond other network-building games such as Ticket to Ride, Thurn & Taxis and Through the Desert.\nBesides each game being different due to the on-board objectives, the Passenger introduces a singular challenge to each turn of the game, inviting you to participate (and earn points) even when it is not your turn.\nThis edition of On the Underground includes the all-new Berlin map, a challenging change of pace for those who have played the original London one, which has also been updated to match the real-life Underground and improve gameplay.\nBesides adding Berlin and improving the art and graphic design, we took the opportunity to perfect the contents of the game, and even more so for the Deluxe edition that we hope to create with your support!\nWe decided early on to include more than one Passenger shape options, and thus the five custom-shaped tokens were born. Three of them (wheelchair user, elderly and pregnant) were kindly provided by Ian O'Toole and Alban Viard.\nIn addition, we felt the need to do even more to thank you for your support, and with  something truly special. That is why we created the transparent acrylic token, and we gave it a shape that may be familiar to our previous backers...\nFinally, we decided to wrap the whole package up in something even more \"Deluxe\", a beautiful slip case that will have your box shining amongst others on your shelf - literally. The wraparound UV coating on the water-colour graphical elements gives it an elegant sheen that stands out.\nThe Deluxe edition will be available through this campaign (including any retail backers - see below) and through events where we participate.\nWe also wanted to make sure that we offer the basic edition of the game to those who do not want improved components. There are no other differences between the two editions.\nNote that the included rulebook for any basic edition copies fulfilled as part of this campaign may depict Deluxe components.\nIn On the Underground, players compete to build the most valuable and convenient transportation network in London or Berlin. Each player controls 2-4 different lines, depending on the number of players.\n At the beginning of each turn, 4 Destination cards are facing up, corresponding to stations on the map. A player\u2019s turn consists of taking four actions, followed by the Passenger\u2019s movement.\nAfter the player\u2019s turn, the Passenger token is moved along built lines and avoiding empty track spaces as much as possible, in order to reach 1 or 2 Destination stations.\n The Destination cards corresponding to the visited stations are then replaced by new ones, and then play passes to the next player in clockwise order.\nPlayers score points in two ways:\n\u2022 By building track and connecting their lines to various types of stations, by building a circular line in London, or by collecting Landmark tiles in Berlin.\n\u2022 By having the Passenger use their lines when moving.\nThe game is over after all Destination cards have been drawn and all players have taken the same number of turns.\nThe player that has earned the most points is the winner, having built the most valuable network On the Underground!\nYou can download the rules of the game here (5 MB, right click and Save as\u2026):\n On_the_Underground_rules_EN_016_compressed.pdf\nPlease download this file, as PDFs viewed in-browser may not be displayed properly.

EU backers do not have to worry about customs or VAT.\nShipments to backers outside of the EU and the USA will have 35 EUR declared as the value of the package. That's roughly equivalent to 39 USD / 52 CAD / 57 AUD / 39 CHF / 4288 JPY. Note that we can not be responsible for any customs fees.\nWe can also not be responsible for any re-shipping fees in case your package is returned as unclaimed, or if the address you provided is not valid. Should a package not arrive within a certain time frame that will be announced when it has been shipped, we will spend a period of time investigating its fate before any action is taken.\nCertain countries do not appear on the list of available shipping destinations. This is due to past experiences and potential cost overruns due to weight fluctuations. Click the pledge level and please contact us via KS message if your country does not appear on the list.\nWe expect to have tracking for the USA, but not for anywhere else. If tracking is important to you, please contact us via the KS messaging system before the campaign is over. We do not expect to be sending tracking codes when the games are shipped.\nRegrettably, we can not offer pickup at Spiel in Essen or at any other convention.\n We will be using Backerkit as our post-campaign fulfillment suite and pre-order management platform, through which additional copies may be obtained.\nCosts\nThe real cost of shipping is subsidized and is offered for the period of the campaign. It includes costs like ocean freight, import fees and/or VAT, packing materials, labor, replacements shipping; and the risk of shipping cost increases. Those can add anything from $3 to $10 to the price you would have to pay if we did not subsidize them.\nEU: 9 USD. Real cost: At least 12-22 USD\nUSA: 9 USD. Real cost: At least 12-22 USD\nWorldwide: 14 USD. Real cost: At least 18-28 USD\nIMPORTANT: Do not add these amounts to your pledge! We will collect the shipping cost after the campaign, via Backerkit.\nRetailers who wish to back this campaign must back at the $1 pledge level, and then contact us via the KS messaging system:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludicreations/on-the-underground-london-berlin/messages/new?message%5Bto%5D=ludicreations\nThis offer is available only to retailers which have a physical store in the countries allowed by the $1 pledge level. Stores with event space will be prioritized and all entities and locations will be verified.\nOnline-only retailers will be considered in territories where there no physical retailers have backed the campaign.\nFulfillment will be conducted in the following steps:\n1. Individual backers\n2. Physical stores\n3. Online-only stores (if any) - at least 2 weeks after the previous step\nThere will be a limit on how many copies of each edition that a retailer can order. A deposit will be taken during the campaign, with the rest of the funds payable via Backerkit.\nOnly retailers who back this campaign will be able to re-order the game, should there be any stock available, for at least 6 months after fulfillment has commenced.\nPlease contact us for more information.\nWhat You See Is What You Get - we like to run simple, straightforward campaigns. We are aware that stretch goals would increase the funding total. However, we have already thrown everything into this game - a lot of time, effort, and money. We are already going to print with the highest quality materials.\nWe also want to offer the game at the cheapest cost possible - and that is incompatible with stretch goals. We'd have to add \"hidden\" profit in the pledge levels that we can then \"spend\" to give you stretch goals - nothing is for free. Raising money beyond our goal does not give us extra money on hand to create stretch goals.\nRetail availability: We pledge that, along with the exception of a limited number of retail backer and convention copies, your games will arrive long before the game (the basic edition) is available through wide distribution.\nSPIEL availability: Should production be completed in time, we plan to airship a limited number of copies to Essen, where we will be selling them. As mentioned above, we can not offer pickup there or at any other convention, and we can not guarantee availability.\nGame Design: Sebastian Bleasdale\nIllustration: Viktor Csete\nGraphic Design: Viktor Csete\nRules Editing: Paul Grogan\nTrailer: Sonja Hatanp\u00e4\u00e4\nTabletopia Implementation: Viktor Csete\nSpecial Thanks: JKLM & Rio Grande Games, Teppo Saarinen, the JunaCon crew, Ian O'Toole, Alban Viard, Toni Heinonen, Kira Peavley, David Turczi, John Albertson, Adrian & Sandie Whipp, Brett Gilbert, Matthew Dunstan, Tom Vasel, Luke Hector, Matt Evans, Joel Wright, Martyn Poole, Derek & Lizzie Funhouser, Nick Welford, Antti Punavaara, and the many, many playtesters that helped  create (and re-create!)

Our thanks to all the Backers who supported us in this Quest!\nA link to the Pledge Manager for Late Pledges will be coming soon!\nIf you have any questions or comments please email kickstarter@alderac.com. \nThunderstone designed by Mike Elliott is a deckbuilding game of heroic adventure. \nWe successfully Kickstarted Thunderstone Quest in the spring of 2017 and delivered it in the spring of 2018. In the spring of 2018 we Kickstarted To The Barricades!, adding solo and CoOp play and two additional Quests, which were delivered in the spring of 2019.\nNew Horizons\nAfter the climactic battle in Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World, the Champions are dispersed by the forces of wild magic. One awakens in a far realm of endless sands. Another discovers himself in a strange new city where he may learn the fate of his people.\nThe world of Thunderstone Quest is even larger than we could ever imagine. It's time to explore these New Horizons.\nBack the campaign TODAY to begin or continue your Thunderstone Quest adventure!\nDue to the overwhelming support of the community, the $400,000 Stretch Goal has been Achieved! \nWe will add the 4th Level Heroes Add-on to all New Horizons Rewards (and Rewards that include New Horizons)! Congratulations to everyone who helped rally the community to reach this HUGE goal!\nBecause of Kickstarter's rules, we cannot change the description of the Rewards to note that the 4th Level Heroes have been added.\n(Backers who choose the \"Your Inventory is Full\" Reward will be issued a $25 credit in the Pledge Manager)\nThis Kickstarter features two new Quests: Quest 8: Vengeful Sands and Quest 9: Clockwork Destiny, both designed by Bryan Reese with story written by Brett Satkowiak. \nAll Quests including Vengeful Sands and Clockwork Destiny can be played in either Barricades Mode or Competitive Mode. \nThis campaign also includes a special promo pack for Barricades Mode: Ezuzrius' Lair (estimated MSRP $9.99) included in the New Horizons Reward (and all Rewards that contain the New Horizons reward)! Ezuzrius' Lair is a Kickstarter Early Access release, meaning that Kickstarter backers will get this promotional pack before it is available for sale. At this time we do not have a planned retail release for this item. \nYou have four options to back this Kickstarter - New Horizons which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter, Champion + Barricades + New Horizons which combines all three Kickstarter Rewards into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes everything we make for Thunderstone Quest.\nYour Inventory is Full!\n(If you have a Thunderstone Quest base game (Retail, Adventurer or Champion) and did not back To the Barricades, you will be able to add it as an Add-on in the Pledge Manager with your New Horizons pledge.)\nWe are also offering a limited quantity of Expedited Rewards. Because of the long lead time for production of the new content in this Kickstarter we will not be able to deliver the new content until next year. But we have set aside a limited quantity of Champion and Barricades components so that we can swiftly manufacture enough units for delivery this November! \nNew Horizons and Add-ons to Expedited orders will ship next year with the rest of the Rewards.\nNote for Expedited Backers: After the campaign ends, you can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Expedited components. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status.\nIf you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your shipment Expedited.\nThis campaign also includes a special Add-on: 4th Level Heroes! The 4th Level Heroes bring more power and abilities to the game.\nNote to all Backers:  The Champion/To the Barricades! boxes contain space to hold these two new Quests and they will be shipped without the individual boxes shown in the graphics for this campaign. If you would like to order the boxes for these Quests they'll be available for a small fee as Add-ons in the Pledge Manager.\nNote to Non-English Speakers: All the contents of this campaign are in English only. AEG is working with a team of international partners on future campaigns for non-English language support which we'll be announcing later in 2019.\n Benefits to this Campaign: \nYou will get the product at a discount to the suggested retail price ($39.99 x 2 Quests + an estimated $9.99 for Ezuzuris' Lair)\nYou'll get the New Horizons content before the normal retail release\nYou'll get the Ezuzrius' Lair Promo Pack\nYou'll get the 4th Level Heroes Add-on\nIf your order includes the Champion Reward you will receive Kickstarter Exclusive Content\nIf your order includes the Champion Reward and/or the To the Barricades Reward you'll get the large boxes & storage system with those Rewards\nQualified Brick & Mortar Retail Stores please see the Kick It Here section below for details on the Kick It Here Reward. \nVengeful Sands Previews\nWe are pleased to showcase some of the cards from Quest 8: Vengeful Sands here on the Kickstarter Campaign page.

In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.\nEach player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.\nOn each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!\nIn Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.\nDepending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!\nThe competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people (up to 6 people with To The Barricades content!) to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.  \nYou can add funds to your pledge as described in the graphic above which will be automatically credited to your account in the Pledge Manager. Or, you can wait until the Pledge Manager opens and purchase Add-ons directly, paying the balance due on your order in the Pledge Manager instead. There is no difference in price or availability. Altering your pledge on Kickstarter is convenient and it helps us grow the total amount pledged which has a positive effect for attracting more Backers.\nTo the Barricades (not shown)\nYou will be able to order To the Barricades in the Pledge Manager as an Add-on. It will be priced at $50 + Shipping & Handling (approximately $15 for US backers). It will be identical to the previous Kickstarter Reward and will have all stretch goals in that Reward. We won't be able to ship them Expedited unless they're included in an Expedited Reward.\nEpic Thunderstone Support for Champion: \nThis is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion Rewards. The Champion Reward does not include an extra copy of every card for Epic Thunderstone use.\nEpic Thunderstone is a popular way to play invented by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different.\nRules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook. You can read those rules in the Rulebook link above!\nThe purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward.\nAll the content in To The Barricades! and all new content for New Horizons in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included.\nThere are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread.\nYou'll need a base copy of Thunderstone Quest (Champion, Adventurer or Retail) to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the base game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone.\n4th Level Heroes\nNOTE: The campaign has achieved it's $400,000 Stretch Goal and this Add-on will automatically be included in every New Horizons Reward! You do not need to pay extra to get this Stretch Goal benefit!\nThis is a special deck of cards which adds a 4th experience level to every Hero in the game from Quests 1-9 as well as the extra Heroes released with the Champion box. There are over fifty 4th Level Heroes in this package!\nThere will be 2 copies of each 4th level hero, one for use in normal Competitive and Barricades Mode play, and a second for use in Epic Thunderstone mode.\nQuest 2: Total Eclipse of the Sun\nThis Add-on is for people who have purchased the Retail Base Set and did not back either of the previous Kickstarters. The Champion Reward contains a Quest which is Kickstarter Exclusive and is not available in retail stores as a stand-alone purchase. You can buy that Quest via this Add-on.\nUpdate: 17 June: Based on a suggestion from backer @Chris, we're upgrading this Add-on to include all the additional promo cards added to the Champion Reward during the 1st Kickstarter so that you will be able to get every card released for Thunderstone Quest in the Champion unit if you get this Add-on, the Retail Base and the retail release of Quest 4 and Quest 5!\nThis change will add about 50 more cards to this Add-on at no additional charge!\nPlease Note: If you have or are buying the Champion Reward, or if you bought the Adventurer Reward from the 1st Kickstarter, you already have this Quest.\nThe Quest will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the New Horizons pledge level to order this Add-on.\nNeoprene Playmat\nThis is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter!\nWe've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern. It is substantially smaller than the board included in the main game. \nThe Playmat is double-sided. One side is the \"day\" layout for competitive play. And the reverse is the \"night\" side with spaces for the Barricades board overlays, showing the Village partially destroyed. The \"night\" side is intentionally darker than the day side to reflect the perilous condition of the Village!\nThe Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within either the Champion or the To The Barricades box, box, rolled up. The length is 300 mm.\nPremium Sleeves\nThese are AEG Premium Sleeves, also used in Mystic Vale, Edge of Darkness, and Valley of the Kings Premium. They have an excellent reputation for durability!\nThe Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90\u00b5 (or \"microns\" = 3.54 \"mils\")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards.\nWe are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish.\nTo sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves).\nYou will need 2 more packs to sleeve the all the new content in To the Barricades! including randomizers, Epic support cards, the 5th and 6th player support and other cards provided for Barricades Mode.\nYou will need 2 packs total to sleeve all the content in New Horizons.\nTo sleeve everything you'll need 8 packs of sleeves.\nYou can store all 9 Quests, starting cards, Kickstarter exclusive cards, and Epic support cards, sleeved, in the Champion and To the Barricades boxes. Space is also available for the rolled up playmat and all other game components. \nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nIf you selected an Expedited reward you will receive your Champion and To The Barricades boxes in an expedited early shipment in November. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery.\nNext year when the rest of the Kickstarter Rewards for this campaign are delivered Expedited backers will get all the rest of their order including any Add-ons they have ordered in a 2nd shipment.\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nUnited States & Canadian Backers: As you may know the Administration is preparing to implement a 25% import tariff on goods shipped to the US from China. We have estimated the impact these tariffs will have on the importation of your Rewards and have adjusted the costs of the Rewards and the Shipping & Handling estimates accordingly. There will be no additional charge made for the tariffs if and when they are imposed.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA.\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! + New Horizons without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive.\nWe are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! + New Horizons at 33lbs/15kg. The following estimates are for both the regular and Expedited Rewards.\nThe following chart also provides estimates for shipping Your Inventory is Full without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive.\nWe are currently estimating the weight of Your Inventory Is Full at 47lbs/21kg\nUSA: Shipping & Handling included\nCANADA: $15\nEUROPE: Shipping & Handling included to Germany. $15 to EU + UK, Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $20 to Australia. $60 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $60\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping New Horizons without Add-Ons.

That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores. Our Kick It Here program is designed to let stores participate in the fun and excitement of a Kickstarter campaign. \nThe Kick It Here program is open to brick & mortar retail stores who generate a meaningful percentage of their sales from tabletop games. Kick It Here products may not be resold on the internet. AEG reserves the right to disqualify any backer from this promotion at its sole discretion.\nKick It Here orders are available to any brick & mortar store anywhere we ship the Kickstarter Rewards to with the same Shipping & Handling costs as regular Backers.\nYou have to back this project at the Kick It Here Reward level to get the Kick It Here pricing and delivery. \nIf you select the $66 Kick It Here Reward level you will be eligible to make the full $195 purchase for 6 units of New Horizons in the Pledge Manager. The $66 you pay on Kickstarter will automatically be credited to your account as a pre-payment.\nAccess to Champion & Barricades Rewards: You will be able to order the Champion and Barricades Rewards as Add-ons to your Kick It Here order. However, due to the high cost of manufacturing these items we cannot offer a discount to the Kickstarter price; your price for Champion will be $120 per unit, and your price for Barricades will be $60. Due to the extremely large size of these boxes and their substantial weight they are usually shipped individually which means there's no meaningful savings on shipping for bulk orders.\nAccess to the Neoprene Playmat, Epic Support, 4th Level Heroes, Quest 2, and AEG Premium Sleeves: All of these Add-ons will be available for purchase via the Kick It Here program with a small discount from the Add-on prices as listed. You will be able to view these prices in the Pledge Manager.\nPlease Note: If you do not qualify as a brick & mortar retail store, or you fail to complete your order in the Pledge Manager, AEG can only refund you 92% of the amount you pledge. The other 8% is lost to unrecoverable Kickstarter fees.\nGroup Buys: AEG does not do group buys or offer increased discounts on Reward prices or shipping for multiple orders.\nKick It Here orders will ship at the same time as the other Kickstarter Rewards.\nAEG would like to thank the following experts who helped make this campaign possible: \nMike Elliott, Original Design & Development of Thunderstone\nMike Elliott, Bryan Reese & Mark Wootton, Design & Development of Thunderstone Quest\nByan Reese & Satkowiak for design and writing for Quest 8 & 9\nMatt Paquette, Kickstarter Campaign Page graphics\nErick Santz, producer for animated game segment in the campaign video\nJohnny Stone, voice work for the main campaign video\nHonor at Last by Hector Posser; Production music courtesy of www.epidemicsound.com \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 650+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $300MM raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAt the end of the campaign we will cancel and refund any pledge of less than $50.

All card counts are approximate and are subject to change. All card and component names are subject to change. All packaging is subject to change and is not finalized. Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2020, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize these risks as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.

Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input.\n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address.\n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once.\n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

Then they'll begin picking & packing orders for pickup by the carriers. When the carrier picks up you may or may not receive an email telling you that an order is scheduled to ship. Orders will ship as the Depots process the orders, which may not all happen at the same time so some people may get orders while others are still unshipped.\n\n3: When all shipments from all Depots have finished, the logistics partner will receive tracking numbers for all packages, which are then transmitted to us. Until that step, we . When we receive the tracking information we will email all customers. We will also upload those tracking numbers into the pledge manager which MAY trigger an additional email notification to you that your order has \"shipped\".

Chinese factories close in January for the Lunar New Year, when many workers return home to their ancestral villages, celebrate with family & friends, and then travel back to their places of employment. This year, the Chinese Government has declared that the Lunar New Year holiday period will be extended, and movement inside of China has been restricted. All of the factories that we work with have been impacted.\n\nAs a result of these policies, work we expected to be underway at this time on your Kickstarter Rewards is on hold. When the factories re-open and travel is again permitted we expect that there will be a substantial backlog of work which will further impact the timing of the delivery of your Rewards.\n\nDue to the fluid and uncertain nature of the Chinese manufacturing infrastructure we cannot at this time provide firm estimates of when your Rewards will ship to you. We will continue to update you as we know more about the timing of production and fulfillment. Today, we believe that Rewards will be delayed at least one month from our original estimates.\n\nWe're sincerely sorry for these delays and the ripple effects they'll cause for other projects in the Thunderstone Quest and Edge of Darkness lines. We're working with our Chinese factories to ensure that when the restart happens we'll be able to communicate back to all our backers what our revised timelines will be.\n\nYou can always see the most current information we have about our Kickstarter projects by visiting our Kickstarter page:\n\n\n\nThis page will be updated as soon as we have new information on any project.\n\nIf after reading this message you have further questions please contact and we'll be happy to help!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "January Update", "update_content": "Champions of Thunderstone!\nThis Update will serve as notice of two developments. \nFirst, the Expedited portions of Expedited orders have been shipped to backers who processed their orders before the Expedited window was closed.

Instead of playing as only 1 civilization in 3 hours, each player could now play as 3 civilizations in 30 minutes!\nWith the help of the unique gaming mechanism, the set-up for every game is greatly different, providing a high replay-ability to players. During the game, players will rise civilization to collect resources, research technologies, build wonders, and prepare for war. Eventually, every civilization may become less powerful as the population may drop in different ways, or simply because the era is changing. (Not all civilization can adapt to a new era, as we know it from history.) It will be time for you to raise another kingdom! The new kingdom can inherit the advantages of the former civilization to continue the legend in the game. As the rise and fall of 3 empires, a unique set of the civilizations of yours will finally arise! \nPLAY\n\nAt the beginning of a game, 8 action cards are shuffled to form a time track in random order, then place the permanent action card at the upper left of the time track.\nIn each player turn, the player take actions by assigning worker tokens to the action slots. Only the 3 actions on the permanent action card AND the 3 actions right under the permanent action card are available to choose.\nWhen all players have finished their turn, the current round ends. Move the permanent action card to the right by 1 card slot when a round ends. As a result, 1 action card of the previous round will become unavailable, and 1 new action card will be available for the next round, creating a new era!\nBesides taking actions to develop empire, each player could rise civilization card to gain more powerful abilities and reset population(number of workers). Civilization cards you own are stacked to show your current civilization with its main ability, and the legacy ability of your previous civilizations.\nRising new civilization is very powerful, but the number of civil. card each player could own is limited to 3. So the timing of \"Rise and Fall\" is a critical decision to make.\nAfter 6 rounds, whoever has the most points wins! \nFor detail rules, please check out the following links:\nDownload / Game Trial\nRule Book v1.5 (English) PDF\nRegola v1.5 (Italian) PDF\n Regel v1.5 (German) PDF \n R\u00e8gle v1.5 (French) PDF \nTry it free on Tabletopia ! \nNote: All the above rule books are not the printed version. \n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign is completed through the pledge manager.

Exploriana is easy to learn but filled with strategy and perfect for all ages, 8 and older. \nLate in the 19th century steam has replaced sail and the once distant uncharted lands are within grasp! Faraway countries are brought ever closer to hand and explorers equipped with as many charts and maps as they can carry, set out determined to update them!\nTake your place in history! Send your team of explorers out into the world and guide them as they plunge deep into steamy jungles, trek across vast tracts of Savannah and ascend towering peaks, courting danger to discover great wonders!\nFacing peril at every turn, your brave explorers will search for fantastic animals, ancient cities, new varieties of orchids and treasures of extreme beauty! \nFame and fortune await the triumphant but many expeditions are foiled by unexpected hazards, some are lost, never to be seen again!\nExploriana is a tense and exciting game filled with complexity, that you will want to play again and again!\nStandard and deluxe edition stretch goals! With the initial funding goal achieved we will begin upgraded both editions of Exploriana with some awesome enhancements!  \nRemember that the deluxe edition will receive ALL stretch goals, standard & deluxe!\nA note on the deluxe version stretch goals .  \nThe deluxe stretch goals are only unlocked with the total number of deluxe level pledge backers.  \nThe stretch goals for the deluxe version of Kickstarter will not be available in the retail version of Exploriana. The only way to get the deluxe edition of Exploriana is by pledging at the 'First Class Traveller' reward level.  \nAs with the standard edition stretch goals, more stretch goals for the deluxe edition of Exploriana will be revealed once the last one has been unlocked. \nBoth the standard edition and deluxe edition stretch goals will be included in the deluxe edition.\nClick here to become a fan on BoardGameGeek of Exploriana! \n Retweet us here to unlock the twitter goal!\nShare our Facebook post here!\nExploriana packs a lot of game into its box! The standard edition includes the following:\nGameplay Summary\nIn Exploriana YOU decide the fate of a team of brave explorers!\nSetting off into far flung corners of the globe, the explorers throw themselves deep into the unknown, each time hoping to discover new contributions to science and history!\nThe discoveries your explorers make will provide you with victory points and the player with the most victory points at the end of the game will be the winner.\nExploriana incorporates several cool game mechanics:\n\u2022 Resource management (money is the major resource in the game)  \n\u2022 Variable turn order (getting to play first can be a major advantage)\n\u2022 Push your luck (the core mechanic, drawing cards to make discoveries and avoiding hazards)\n\u2022 Hand management (the players get to choose various explorer cards with special abilities that they can use during the game)\n\u2022 Set collecting (with the many card combinations available collecting certain cards could deliver more points)\n\u2022 Worker placement (where to send your explorers is a crucial decision) \nSetup\nExploriana is simple to set up. Each player is given some starting funds, two mission cards, to try and complete during the course of the game, and a guide token to help them on their way. \nExploriana is played over a variable number of rounds, further split into 4 phases. \nPhase 1 - Recruit explorers\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nEach round a number of explorers are laid out. Each explorer has their own special ability and each player gets to pick one to add to their team.\nExperienced players may choose to use the alternate recruitment rule that eliminates the need for the recruit explorers phase. The players start the game by drafting a full team of explorers to use throughout the game.\nPhase 2 - Send Explorers\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nThere are three regions to explore in Exploriana: South America, Africa and the Far East, each of the regions is more dangerous than the last. \nThe players now decide which of the three regions they will send their explorers too. \nIn renown order, players take turns placing one of their explorers until every player has placed two explorers.\nPhase 3 - Explore regions\nImage courtesy of Tabletopia Edition\nEach of the three region decks has its own unique deck of cards and the decks are packed with fabulously illustrated discoveries.\nEach deck contains five types of discovery cards! \nEvery card has a unique piece of art showing what type of discovery can be found.\nA region is explored by revealing cards one at a time, simulating an expedition pushing ever deeper into the wilderness. \nAs a player reveals a discovery card there is a chance a hazard is found on that discovery card! \nIf a player should reveal any three hazards of the same type, or all three different hazards while exploring, then the expedition is lost and the cards are shuffled back into the region deck to be found in furture expiditions. \nRevealing up to four discovery cards allows a player to make a single pick.\nA pick is taking a set of animals or a single treasure, orchid, map or location card.\nIf they are brave or lucky enough to have revealed five discoveries without becoming lost, they may make one extra pick!\nPhase 4 - End of round\nAt the end of each round the players check to see if any deck is empty, and replace any region deck that is with its respective reserve, which will then trigger the final round of the game.\nVictory\nThe aim of the game in Exploriana is to accumulate the most victory points.\nThe discoveries the players make award renown, wealth or victory points, and some even give the player a combination of awards!\nFOR A MORE DETAILED LOOK AT THE RULES PLEASE DOWNLOAD THEM FROM HERE.\nThe above is a brief overview of Exploriana.

It allows us to bring each company's unique skill set into the fold, ensuring we have the combined expertise and experience to make this campaign a resounding success.  \nThe team includes:\nRobin Elliott of Triple Ace Games Ltd. Triple Ace Games have been making games for 10 years and brings a wealth of knowledge to the team. Having successfully run 17 Kickstarter campaigns they have the know how to successfully deliver a KS project. Robin brings his knowledge of graphic design and manufacturing to the team.\nDicky Duerden of Counters Out Ltd. Counters out is the publishing arm of Chance & Counters, the Bristol-based board game cafe. Exploriana will be their first published game. Dicky is our community manager. Keeping our backers and potential backers up to date with all the news and information on our campaign as it develops.\nMiles Ratcliffe and David Inker of Chaos Publishing Ltd have brought Exploriana to the team. Miles is the game designer on this project. Having devised this amazing game he has play-tested Exploriana to exhaustion, honing its amazing game play. David  is in charge of the admin and creative content.\nRichard Dearing is our superb artist. He spent many hours creating the fabulous artwork for our game and we all think he did an awesome job!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll three companies involved in with the Exploriana Campaign are experienced with Kickstarter and the fulfilment process, each having run several Kickstarter campaigns in the past, Triple Ace Games alone has run 17 successful Kickstarter campaigns to date.\n\nThe game is complete, and we have already self-funded the artwork and design. There will be no delay in sending the game to the factory. The funding raised through this campaign is for manufacturing & bulk shipping the game.\n\nThe main risks faced with, when attempting to bring a board game to market, are usually problems associated with production, shipping and fulfilment. Delays in production can hopefully be avoided by using an experienced manufacturer. We intend to use Longpack, a well-known and well-established manufacturer and we also intend to have Longpack arrange delivery alongside our fulfilment company to ensure there are also no unforeseen problems with the shipping of the product.\n\nBrexit is a concern, of course. We are planning on using fulfilment centres within the EU to limit any impact that it may have on the campaign, in this way we don't envisage any major problems to overcome.\n\nDue to the combined experience and determination of the team involved with the Exploriana campaign, we are confident that any challenges we run into can be overcome and of course we will endeavour to keep our backers up to date with the progress of the project with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Benefactor", "descp": "A big thank you from us for showing your support for Exploriana.\nJoin us on our Kickstarter expedition and follow the progress of the Exploriana campaign.

By charging shipping after the campaign, we can properly assess the final weights and measures of our games, as well as group backers in such a way to maximize utility and ensure you get the lowest shipping cost. We will cover all customs and duties, but our low pledge tiers and small margins prevent us from providing free shipping.\nThe following table includes estimated shipping costs provided by stamps.com (for US backers) and Spiral Galaxy Games for our European and international backers. These are not final costs, but rather estimates.  The true and final shipping cost will be charged after the campaign.\nApproximate Shipping Rates\nCanadian backers. Starlit Citadel Games will ship orders that are larger than the retail game if we get sufficient Canadian orders.  Spiral Galaxy Games will currently handle delivery of the retail game.\nEU backers.  We are EU friendly.  Products ship to EU backers from within the EU and we handle all customs and administrative fees.\nTaxes\nEach backer is responsible for paying their share of the sales taxes for their pledge.  Since we are based out of Texas, we are required by law to collect sales tax from any Texas backers. Some European countries also require that we collect VAT. All taxes and shipping costs will be assessed and collected after the campaign via Pledge Manager.\nIt\u2019s our goal to be as transparent and fair as possible with regard to shipping. No one likes to pay shipping, and we are committed to doing our best to minimize its impact on everyone.\nWe'd like to thank the following people and organizations for all they've done to help bring Zoo-ography together.\nEric Jones, Marco Cervone, and Brian Edger for the hours of playtesting.\nMarc Hampson for his incredible artistic talents.\nPaul Olson for his superb work on our opening video.\nJennica Schwartzman for lending her beautiful voice to our video. \nStephen Selego with Panda Game Manufacturing for all the help and guidance preparing for manufacturing our games.\n Kristi Weyland with Peace, Love, & Games for the incredible preview video.\nFor the timely and inspirational reviews thank you, Dianne N. with Women Like Board Games, Eric Yurko with What's Eric Playing?, George Jaros with GJJ Games, and Steph Elizondo with Settler of the Boards \n Tabletop Artisan's Workshop, Dallas Games Marathon, DFW Nerd Night, and Dallas Designer Group got hosting us over these last few months while we demoed endlessly.\nDerek Funkhouser with The Board Game Spotlight for giving us a platform to promote our game. \n Gerald King III for the opportunity to be on your Kickstarter interview!\nMembers of the Zoo-ography Community Page for their contributions to the game's direction. \nOur Bridges to Nowhere backers for taking a chance on our little game.\nOur Families for their endless patience and support for our dream.\n...and Joshua Geimer whose efforts put us on the map and shaped our fledgling company.\nAnd of course, ALL OF YOU, our backers!!!!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nKickstarter is an ever evolving market, and what games may have been a sure fire win even last year, may not be on anyone's radar today. With larger and larger game companies taking up greater share of the market, small indie board game publishers like ourselves can often be left in the dust - especially if our campaigns lack the polish backers have come to expect. While the ever rising bar is good for Kickstarter, it presents new challenges. With more up front capital needed and a demand for near completed games prior to launching, the cost of failure can be significant.\n\nWe at Doomsday Robots recognize the risks involved in pursuing our passion of making board games and are ready to rise to the challenge. Market analysis is a huge part of what we do prior to deciding which game to create and bring to publication, We want to make sure that not only is our investment secure, but that we can meet the demands of this amazing Kickstarter market. As such we've done our homework to minimize costs and risks to our backers.\n\nWe aren't perfect, and we've made mistakes in the past, but we never let that prevent us from doing right by our backers - a commitment we will keep today. We welcome feedback for how we can improve, and indeed listening to our backers have helped us to be a better company.\n\nThe biggest risk we face is the same that most publishers face - ever changing shipping costs. We've taken definitive steps to minimize this risk with an unprecedented level of transparency with our backers so that we can support one another in not only the successful creation of this game, but ensuring the costs to deliver it aren't unbearable to either party. As such we've moved the shipping charges to be collected after the campaign so we can truly minimize the costs with the foreknowledge of how many games we need, and exactly where they are going.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Print and Play", "descp": "Receive a download link for the official print and play of Zoo-ography after the campaign and once all art assets are finalized.\nINCLUDES:\nZoo-ography Digital Print and Play Files", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}], "stat": ["201 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Zoo-ography", "descp": "*The Game*\nReceive one copy of Zoo-ography Retail Edition including the Kickstarter exclusive Panda meeple with all applicable stretch goals.

PLEASE NOTE MINIATURES COME UNPAINTED.\nMonumental is a massive board game for 1 to 4 players where you\u2019ll compete with your opponents to lead your prestigious civilization through the ages.\nThe game starts with the Classic era (antiquity), will cross the Medieval times to end up in the Modern industrial age. Through all these ages, you\u2019ll have to assemble your military forces to conquer new territories, focus on scientific research to enhance your civilization\u2019s abilities, build breathtaking wonders to harness their unique advantages, and develop your cultural policies to guide your people to victory. The fate of your civilization is upon you!\nEach civilization has its own deck of cards with cultural specificities, as well as an army to explore and conquer the provinces on the board. On each turn, you\u2019ll be able to draw and activate cards, combining their effects to develop your civilization and conquer the world. But you\u2019re not alone in this race, as your opponents will try and outrun you as soon as they can. A game of Monumental plays over different eras, each of them featuring new cards to acquire and use. At the very beginning of the game, you control a small town in some remote country that nobody has ever heard of. Yet by the end of the game, thanks to the many cards that you will acquire, all will admire your monumental city, the jewel of a glorious nation!\nAs war is inevitable, you\u2019ll need to lead your troops to combat when necessary. Fight the barbarians or protohistoric Free Cities to loot their resources, then wage war against your opponents! Each civilization comes with 14 army units - either nicely illustrated tokens (Classic edition) or finely sculpted unique miniatures (Deluxe edition) that you\u2019ll be able to deploy on a richly illustrated modular game board to take control of the world. On the other side of your army, send your explorers to crawl new provinces, exploit new resources or even obtain new ones from various marketplaces in order to reinforce your city production capacity and speed up your evolution. Not a warmonger? Then maybe focus on Knowledge to enhance your cards\u2019 abilities and gain more resources. Build Libraries, Laboratories, Colleges and other scientific buildings to educate your people. Then use this Knowledge to gain powerful cards that will allow you to do more actions in a single turn. Another solution would be to focus on Culture: various actions you take in the game will develop the culture of your empire, which in turn allows you to deploy special Cultural Policies with permanent advantages.\nAnd of course, what would be a civilization without its wonders? The Great Pyramid, Stonehenge, the Great Wall\u2026 all have powerful in-game effects that will allow your empire to rise to glory. Building wonders is another way to assert your dominance over your opponents in Monumental, and a great way to show your greatness to the world.\nThe path to glory will not be simple. You need to find the proper balance between all these possibilities to achieve victory\u2026 and this will take time. But after all, Rome wasn\u2019t built in one day!\nEach Civilization comes with a set of cards comprising common buildings along with a unique building and knowledge card. The basic buildings of your city will give you the basic resources: the fort will provide Military, the Library will provide Science and the Work Camp will provide Production.\nA unique Knowledge card as well as 5 Cultural Policies complete the cultural distinction between civilizations. A Warlord card, working along with the corresponding unit on the board, also gives a unique and special conquest power to their owner.\nKnowledge cards that will increase other card\u2019s capabilities when coupled with them.\nIn Monumental, the cards that you will buy and activate in your city are the key to victory. You must find the proper balance between the different types of cards, as each of them will give you special advantages. Managing your deck and anticipating the cards to come will also give you the upper hand over your opponents.\nAs the game progresses through its 3 ages (Classic \u2013 Medieval \u2013 Modern times), so does history allowing you to acquire several types of more and more powerful cards: Buildings to bring you more resources and some occasional special abilities, Knowledges that will increase other card\u2019s capabilities when coupled with them, Wonders which are very expensive but very powerful (and very rewarding as victory points) and, to finish with, Cultural Policies cards which can be activated thanks to culture points given by other type of cards and which will give you powerful passive permanent advantages.\nCITY AND CROSS-TAPING\nBefore the first turn, you randomly draw 9 cards from your deck (out of 14 at the beginning of the game) and place them on the table in a square of 3x3 cards: this is your city for the first turn. Over the course of the game, your city will evolve. You\u2019ll start with basic buildings with limited interaction, but by the end of the game, your city will be full of advanced buildings, breathtaking wonders, and top-notch Knowledge.\nHowever, even if there are 9 cards in your city, you can only activate 5 of them on each turn. This will lead to difficult choices, as all cards can be useful. Your citizens cannot work all the time though, and you need to allow them to rest.\nThis unique gaming mechanic is called CROSS-TAPPING. To activate your cards, you choose a line and a column in your city, and activate (tap) the cards from this line and column (5 cards out of 9). You can choose any line and any column; you simply cannot choose two lines or two columns.\nThis innovative mechanic introduces a whole new way of programing and using the cards of your deck turn after turn as optimization and combos are the heart of the game.\nEXPLORATION AND CONQUEST\nDeveloping your city and your empire will require you to gather resources and to conquer new territories.\nThe territories of Monumental are called Provinces. The modular game board gives the basic setup of each game. This setup will be different whether you use one of the pre-defined scenarios (made for a certain number of players) or one of the scenarios you create.\nAt the beginning of the game, the provinces are all to discover and are occupied by independent barbarian tribes or ancient Free Cities. You\u2019ll have to move your army (thanks to your military points) to conquer them. The conquest mechanism is very simple: one military point allow you to move one unit \u2013 you need to move at least the same number of military units as the defense value of the province (a number given by the terrain difficulty + the existing inhabitants resistance). Each conquered province gives you victory points at the end of the game but it also gives you more required space to build your wonders.\nThe Provinces also contains various resources depending on them. Sometimes you may recruit some workers (as a production token) and sometimes you may end up in a Maketplace (such as Babylon or Rome) where you will be able to grab new resources to bring to your city in order to enhance your future turns capacity of development. All these resources are only opened to your Explorers who moves thanks to military points too but who never take part in any battle.\nTurn after turns your realm will become bigger and bigger, your knowledge and culture stronger and your buildings and wonders more and more impressive.\nDesigned to be extremely modular, Monumental is implementing on one side the power and depth of a deckbuilding system which loads the game with hundreds of potential combos and on the other side the flexibility of a modular game board which allows the players to create an infinity of new scenarios, all of this to bring on the table a game that is super easy to learn but hard to master thanks to an important learning curve and which will grant dozens and dozens of hours of renewed playing pleasure!\nPlease note that we are currently working on the graphic layout of the rules. However, you may already access the prototype PDF file which is absolutely not what the final files layout will be ;). Please note also that, despite the fact that these rules have been thoroughly tested, they may still evolve during the campaign tweaking and fine tuning process.\nPlease click on the pic to download the PDF file.\nCliquez sur l'image pour t\u00e9l\u00e9charger le fichier PDF.\n                    My name is Matthew Dunstan, and I\u2019m a research scientist and game designer based in Cambridge, UK. I started designing games about 8 years ago, when I was still living in Australia, and to date I have had 11 published designs. Monumental is my second game with Funforge following the release of Professor Evil and The Citadel of Time last year. Monumental is a fitting title for the game, considering it is the most ambitious of my designs to date!\nWhile the origin of Monumental isn\u2019t as old as the Pyramids or Stonehenge, it is still one with many twists and turns, a journey that started over 4 years ago. At the heart of Monumental is a new mechanic I call \u2018cross-tapping\u2019, where you deal cards from your deck into a 3 x 3 grid, and you choose 1 row and 1 column of cards to use on your turn. In this very simple system, you already have all the tools for some very satisfying combos, and every turn you are presented with engaging and interesting decisions.\nI was intrigued by deck-building games, which are interesting by the fact of them offering a random selection of cards from your deck each turn, and then you have to make the most of what you have been dealt. But the interest is not really in the playing of the cards \u2013 once you have a hand your choice of actions is mostly automatic. I wanted this feeling of getting a new set of opportunities each turn, but with some juicy decisions as to how to use these opportunities. What do you need to do right now, and what can wait until later? Do you pull off a small combo now, or wait and hope for something even better? Hopefully this tension and excitement permeates through Monumental from its core mechanism.\nFunforge has done an amazing job bringing my design to life, immersing you in the world of mighty armies, feats of technological advancement and towering wonders. The choices you make in Monumental will ultimately tell the tale of your civilization...what will you be remembered for?\nWithin three weeks after the campaign\u2019s end, we will send a survey to the email associated with your Kickstarter account using the CrowdOx pledge manager system.\nYou\u2019ll be able to chose your language options, add any desired add-ons to your pledge and complete your shipping informations at that time. You\u2019ll also be able to add any new add-ons at this point or complete your pledge in any desired way.\nIf you change adresses before we ship your rewards, you\u2019ll be able to access your survey anytime after we\u2019ve send it at this link: https://app.crowdox.com/retrieve/funforge/monumental\nPledge levels will be available in English or French. You\u2019ll have to choose the language of your pledge in the Pledge Manager, after the campaign completion.\nWe will also deliver Digital only versions (pdf files) in the following languages: German, Polish and Spanish. Please note that these digital files are not yet available and will be provided somewhere between the end of the KS campaign and the delivery of the games.\nLes niveaux de pledge seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais ou en anglais. Vous devrez choisir la langue de votre pledge dans le Pledge Manager, \u00e0 l'issue de la campagne.\nNous fournirons \u00e9galement des fichiers uniquement digitaux (pdf) dans les langues suivantes : Allemand, Polonais et Espagnol. Notez que ces fichiers ne sont pas encore disponibles et seront fournis entre la fin de la campagne KS et la livraison des jeux.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter campaign completion.\nWe will collect all information through the Pledge Manager in order to dispatch your pledge to the most accurate of our international shipping hubs.\nHere are the initial estimates for the shipping costs depending on your area of living. Please, keep in mind that these costs may rise depending on the evolution of the campaign (unlocked stretch goals which will increase the weight of the parcel) and on the potential add-ons you would add to your initial pledge during the Pledge Manager phase.\nUSA: 12-15\u20ac to most states, 40\u20ac to Alaska, Hawaii, and all remote islands.\nEUROPE: 12\u20ac to France, Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. 15-20\u20ac to the rest of the UE countries. 20-25\u20ac to the non UE-countries.\nCANADA: 20\u20ac to most cities\nLATIN AMERICA: 45-80\u20ac to most countries.\nASIA: 15\u20ac to China and Hong Kong. 20-30\u20ac to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: 20-30\u20ac to Australia. 35\u20ac to New Zealand.\nFRENCH TERRITORIES: 40\u20ac to R\u00e9union, Martinique, Guadeloupe, Mayotte, Guyane.\nREST OF THE WORLD (all unlisted countries): 80-100\u20ac to most other countries.\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally.\nWe DO NOT SHIP to the following countries: Cuba, Iran, Burma (Myanmar), Sudan, North Korea, Kazakhstan, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Russia and Syria.\nPlease note that these prices are NOT including the possible brokerage and/or custom fees and/or local taxes that may apply to your country, these fees are at the customer's charge (i.e. you). As a reminder, if your country is listed into the Friendly shipping badges, you would have no import fees to pay.\nThe decision of making this project a Kickstarter exclusive is the result of a long and precise thinking.\nIn short, we had the choice of offering a \u00ab regular \u00bb game at a \u00ab regular \u00bb price or a fantastic game at a fair price.\nWe decided to go for the second option as we believe that this game deserves the best from our publishing efforts. Notably we have put a lot of hard work for months into the testing process but most and foremost into the production works, hiring dozens of stellar artists to turn each of the card artwork into a masterpiece. This is also true regarding the mini pre-production process for which we aimed to fantastic sculptures and unique (and expensive) design choices. These are just some examples of our commitment into making MONUMENTAL a unique experience for you.\nWe are used to publish games for ten years now and we know fairly well the distribution network and how it works. Should we choose to let this game go to the regular network, it would have been financially unsustainable for us because of the cascading margins of the classic distribution scheme.\nGame Designer: Matthew Dunstan\nPublisher: Funforge\nArt Direction: Philippe Nouhra\nArtworks: Paul Mafayon, Georges \"Gorg\" Bouchelaghem, Fajareka Setiawan, Agri Karuniawan, Asep Ariyanto, Maerel Hibadita, Tey Bartolome, Justine Cruz, Wyn Lacabra, Raph Lomotan, Brian Valeza, Chang-Wei Chen, Andreas Rocha, Marco Gorlei, Hendry Iwanaga, Philippe Nouhra, Charles-Victorien Kaing, Grafit Studio, Ivan Sevic, Roman Tishenin, Piotr Dura, Eugenia Firs, Jordan Albro, Orion Vang, Esmail Zalat, Uros Sljivic, Heng Tang, Tomislav Jagnjic, Alisher Mirzoev, Tuan Nguyen, Alexandre Mokhov, Martin Mottet\nLead sculptor: Charles-Victorien Kaing\nAdditional sculptors: Alfonso Gonso, Nicolas Pessina, Gregory Krasnoperov, Raul Garcia Latorre\nTranslator & rules editing: Antoine Prono, Gersende Cheylan, Claude Amardeil\nPublisher Testing: Philippe Nouhra, Antoine Prono, Claude Amardeil, Thomas Baggi-Sani, Charlotte Noailles, Gersende Cheylan\nLead Community Manager: Charlotte Noailles\nAdditional Community Managers: Claude, Brett, Valentin\nTabletopia integration: Thomas Baggi-Sani\nFunforge would like to express special thanks to David Preti and R\u00e9gis Bonness\u00e9e, you guys are the best! ;)\nFunforge social networks\nOfficial FB page: @MONUMENTALboardgame\nFunforge FB page: @Funforge\nTwitter: @funforge\nInstagram: @funforge\nTo spread the word!

Our thanks to all the Backers who supported us in this Quest!\n\nUse this link to access the Pledge Manager for Backer Rewards and Late Pledges! \nIf you have any questions or comments please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nThunderstone designed by Mike Elliott is a deckbuilding game of heroic adventure. We successfully Kickstarted Thunderstone Quest in the spring of 2017 and delivered it in the spring of 2018. This Kickstarter features Barricades Mode designed by Bryan Reese - rules and components for Solo & CoOp play, plus Quest 6: What Lies Beneath. \nYou have four options to back this Kickstarter - Champion which consists of the Champion Reward from the 1st Kickstarter (but no new content), To The Barricades! which consists of just the new content in this campaign, Champion + Barricades! which combines both into one Reward, and Your Inventory is Full! which includes the Champion Reward, To the Barricades, 6 packs of Premium Sleeves, the Epic Thunderstone Add-on for Champion, and the Neoprene Mat.\nNote for Expedited Backers: You can not drop your Expedited Pledge, switch to Your Inventory Is Full! and still get your Champion Expedited. If you have an Expedited Reward, don't change it. In the Pledge Manager there will be a special Add-on option just for you that will allow you to get all the contents of Your Inventory is Full! at the same price as the Reward listed in this Kickstarter, and keep your Expedited Status. We will ensure that every Expedited Backer who wants this Add-on will be able to get it regardless of the quantity ordered by other backers.\n\nIf you drop your Expedited Reward, we can't re-instate it. So don't drop it unless you really, really don't want your Champion Expedited.\n\nNote for All other Backers (including $1 Backers): You will be able to upgrade your Reward in the Pledge Manager to Your Inventory Is Full! at the same price listed in this Kickstarter. QUANTITIES MAY BE LIMITED, so to guarantee that you get this Reward, select it now!\nAll Quests, including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath, and the Stretch Goals from this campaign, can be played in either Barricades Mode or normal Competitive Mode.\nFollow the story of our Stretch Goals through Kickstarter Updates!\nThe Backers of this campaign successfully unlocked all the contents of Quest 7: Frostbite(*)! Quest 7 will join Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in the To The Barricades! portion of the Rewards for this Kickstarter.\nThe Premium To the Barricades Box!\n(This packaging is for illustration purposes only. Actual box will differ in graphics and dimensions.)\nWith the completion of this Kickstarter the Thunderstone Quest product line will be quite large. 7 Quests, support for 6 players, and all the components of Barricades Mode, 8 plastic figures, plus Epic Thunderstone support and the Neoprene Mat.\nPlayers who sleeve their cards will have filled the original Champions box. Therefore the To the Barricades box is being engineered to complement the Champion box.\nIn addition, we\u2019re designing a plastic vac-formed tray that you can use to organize the various tokens and chits as you play. You can store those things in the tray in the box, and when it\u2019s time to play you can remove the tray and put it on the table! The tray will be designed to accommodate all the various tokens & chits included in Champion + Barricades and a little bit of future proofing as well!\nCurrently we envision a box with the same dimensions as the Champion box. The two boxes will be graphically designed to compliment each other on your shelf.\nWe believe that when you sleeve all cards including Epic the two boxes together will have room for one or two additional Quests beyond Quest 7, although the storage of the Neoprene Playmat Add-on will affect how many cards can be stored in the boxes.\nWe expect to provide a suggested setup for managing all the cards and components across the two boxes when To the Barricades is delivered. Some people will prefer to organize their cards alphabetically by type. Others will organize them by Quest. We will have suggested setups for both.\nThe To the Barricades! Box will be Kickstarter Exclusive!\nAll unlocked Stretch Goals are included in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory Is Full!, but are not included in the Champion reward.\nThe Champion, Champion + Barricades! and Your Inventory is Full! rewards will include all the Kickstarter Exclusive Content from the 1st Kickstarter.\nKickstarter Exclusive content (\"KSE\") are game components and accessories that are available only to backers of AEG Kickstarters. Kickstarter Exclusive Content may be released in an alternate form more widely in the future (different art, different card titles, etc.).\nThunderstone is one of the most successful games AEG has ever published. The Kickstarter for Thunderstone Quest and delivery of those rewards to our backers has enabled us to continue to develop the game and expand its scope. \nThe major innovation for Thunderstone Quest is ... Quests! Each Quest consists of a selection of dungeon tiles and monster cards that create an engaging storyline. Each Quest includes rules for selecting Village and Dungeon cards to create a variety of Adventures. After you've mastered each Quest you use random setups of Quest cards to create new Dungeons and Villages - build your own Quests and Adventures!\nThe Champion Reward\nIncludes:\nReally Big Box that holds all Champion content (even sleeved!)\n5 Quests (each Quest includes approximately 245 cards and 6 Dungeon Tiles [except Ripples in Time which includes 4])\nOver 130 base game cards (starting cards, quest cards, treasure cards, wound cards, key cards, randomizers & dividers)\nWilderness tile\nVillage game board\n6 plastic Champion figures\n140 wood tokens\n5 six-sided dice\nRule book\nQuest book\nKickstarter exclusives & extras including The Yellow Knight card & meeple (googly eyes not included)\nBarricades Mode\nOne of the most requested features from the community was the ability to play the game solo or in a co-operative game. Our team has developed an extension to Thunderstone Quest called Barricades Mode to make that possible.\nIncludes:\n6 Guardian Boards\n[ In ongoing playtesting, Guardian Key cards were removed ]\n20 damage chits\n1 Damage chit bag\n2 Marketplace overlay boards\n8 Prestige Class boards\n30 Prestige tokens\n20 Guardian Dice (D12)\n1 Threat Level wooden token\n5 Barricade tokens\n2 Additional Player Packs (all components required for adding a 5th and 6th player to both Competitive Mode and Barricades Mode)\nQuest 6: What Lies Beneath\nWe area also presenting Quest 6: What Lies Beneath in this campaign. What Lies Beneath is designed to work with Barricades Mode to create a seamless storytelling experience. What Lies Beneath can be played in normal competitive mode too. All of the other Quests will be compatible with Barricades Mode.\nIncludes:\nApproximately 245 cards\n6 Dungeon tiles\nRulebook\nEpic Thunderstone support cards\nFull color storage box (will also hold components from Barricades Mode)\nThunderstone Quest Back to the Dungeon is on Kickstarter so that we can bring all our current backers the content they've asked for quickly, and to create an opportunity for new backers to join the adventure and get access to all the Kickstarter Exclusive content from the first campaign.\nThe Stretch Goals in this campaign will be included in the To The Barricades! reward, and the Champion + Barricades!, and the Your Inventory Is Full! reward, but not the Champion reward.\n\n(*) Quest 7: Frostbite is a working title and is subject to change.\nThe rules for Thunderstone Quest are available for download on the Thunderstone page at alderac.com. \nUpdate 15AUG:  We have produced a special Print & Play package for Barricades Mode that you can download and assemble at home. This is version 2.2 of the Barricades Mode system! If you own Thunderstone Quest, you'll be able to play Barricades Mode with this Print & Play!\nThunderstone Quest is a deckbuilding game where 2-4 players (or 1-6 players in Barricades Mode) compete to see who can score the most victory points when the game ends. In deckbuilding games your objective is to try to assemble the best possible deck to achieve the play strategy you prefer based on the options that are assembled for each game, and the random challenges you'll need to overcome.\nEach player's deck represents a party of stalwart adventurers who will face and defeat the challenges of the Dungeon and will return to the Village to recover and re-equip.\nOn each turn you use your deck to generate a hand of cards, and you take actions based on the cards you drew. Sometimes you'll be in the Village buying new cards and using your resources. Sometimes you'll be in the Dungeon fighting monsters. And sometimes you'll do a little bit of both!\nThis new version of Thunderstone enhances the Dungeon mechanic introduced in classic Thunderstone. In Thunderstone Quest you'll be playing an Adventure which is comprised of a set of Dungeon tiles and a selection of monsters, treasures, and challenges that are themed to that Dungeon. You'll get the sense of a dramatic campaign as you grow stronger and finally confront the Guardian.\nDepending on which cards you buy and which adversaries you defeat you will earn victory points. After the Guardian encounter is over, the player with the most victory points is the winner!\nThe competitive mode is designed for 2 to 4 people to play and it takes about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure. Barricades mode is designed for 1 to 6 people to play and will also take about 90 minutes to complete an Adventure.\nThunderstone Quest uses a lot of the rules from previous versions of Thunderstone but the cards from previous versions are not compatible.\nThe heroes must travel through time and into the arctic waste in search of a legendary artifact of great power. Follow along as their story unfolds with each new Stretch Goal!\nEpic Thunderstone: \nOur 1st Add-On is a special set of over 200 cards that supports Epic-style play of Thunderstone Quest for the Champion and Champion + Barricades! Reward. If you backed the first Kickstarter and are backing this Kickstarter at the To the Barricades! level you can also order this Add-on.\nThe purpose of this Add-On is purely convenience. There is no content in the Epic Add-On that isn't already in the Champion Reward.\nAll new content (including Stretch Goals) in this campaign will be Epic-compatible and will have Epic support automatically included.\nThere are extensive answers about Epic Thunderstone and this Add-On in the FAQ. Please check to see if your question has already been answered before asking in the Comment thread.\nEpic Thunderstone is a popular way to play created by players of Classic Thunderstone. In Epic Thunderstone you build a Village and a Dungeon draw pile using one of each of all your cards instead of playing with a pre-selected tableau. It's a way to see and use more of your card collection. Every game will be different.\nRules for Epic Thunderstone are included in the main rulebook.\nThis Add-On is a pre-built Epic Thunderstone deck ready for play. You won't have to subtract cards from your main play set to play Epic Thunderstone.\nYou'll need a full copy of Thunderstone Quest to play the Epic variant since there are cards, boards, tokens and other resources in the main game that are required to play Epic Thunderstone.\nNeoprene Playmat\nThis is one of the most requested upgrades from the community and we're proud to announce that we'll be able to make Neoprene Playmats available as a part of this Kickstarter!\nWe've also heard the suggestions that the size of the Village board is larger than some groups prefer, and this Playmat also addresses that concern.\nThe Playmat will be sized so that it can fit within the To the Barricades box for this Kickstarter, rolled up. The length will be between 295 and 300 mm. The width is still undetermined; the graphics team will be redesigning the Village layout to accommodate the new size after the Kickstarter but the total will be smaller than the current Village board.\nPremium Sleeves\nOur 2nd Add-On are packs of Premium Sleeves. These Sleeves use the same plastic we used in the Mystic Vale sleeves.\nThe Sleeves are 66x91mm, 0.09mm thick (0.09mm = 90\u00b5 (or \"microns\" = 3.54 \"mils\")) and will fit Thunderstone Quest cards and cards that are the same size as Magic: The Gathering cards.\nWe are providing them in packs of 500 Sleeves for $15 per pack. You can order as many packs as you wish.\nTo sleeve every playable card in the Champion Reward and the Epic Add-On you would need 4 packs (2,000 Sleeves).\nYou will need 1 more pack to sleeve the new content in To the Barricades! and Champion + Barricades!.\nThe Champion box holds all the Champion content, plus the Epic Add-on cards sleeved. You will need to store future Quests (including Quest 6: What Lies Beneath and the stretch goals from this campaign) in their own boxes if you wish to sleeve them.\nAdventurer Catch-Up Kit\nOur third Add-on is a way for people who purchased the Adventurer Reward in the first Kickstarter to get the Quests that they did not purchase in the first campaign. It consists of Quest 3: Risen from the Mire, and Quest 4: At the Foundations of the World. The Quests will be delivered in a plain white tuckbox, not the retail packaging. You must back the campaign at the To The Barricades! pledge level to order this Add-on (all this content is included in the Champion and Champion + Barricades! rewards.)\nWe have configured our logistics system to provide the lowest average cost for all our Backers while working with trusted partners for delivery of your Rewards.\nIf you selected the Champion+Barricades (Expedited US Only) reward you will receive your Champion box in an expedited early shipment soon after the campaign ends. We have 1,000 units of Champion in our warehouse in the US so we will be able to send the Champion part of your Reward on an expedited timeline. We believe we can have them delivered 6 to 8 weeks after the close of the campaign. You will need to log in to your order in the Pledge Manager and provide your delivery information immediately after the campaign ends to ensure you get the fastest possible delivery.\nBecause this inventory is already in the United States the cost, customs issues, and complexity of shipping to non-US addresses prohibit us from delivering the expedited portion of the Reward outside the United States.\nThe cost to ship the Champion Reward for expedited delivery will be borne by AEG. Backers at this level will pay for shipping & handling for the rest of the Reward normally based on weight, and the rest of the Reward will ship at the same time as fulfillment of all other Reward content for this Kickstarter in 2019.\n\nIf you have any questions please email kickstarter@alderac.com.\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address. You will pay for shipping & handling in our Pledge Manager. Links to the Pledge Manager will be sent shortly after the Kickstarter campaign ends. \nShipping costs vary widely based on where you will receive your reward.\nWe will ship your Rewards at our cost to our international distribution centers. Based on your delivery address we will either ship to you from our Depot in the EU, in China, in Australia or from the USA (Canada and the rest of the world).\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping Champion + Barricades! (including Stretch Goals) without Add-Ons. Orders that include Add-Ons will be more expensive. \nWe are currently estimating the weight of Champion + Barricades! at 23lbs/12kg.\nUSA:$23 \nCANADA: $40 \nEUROPE: $27 to Germany. $39 to EU + Norway, Switzerland & Lichtenstein \nLATIN AMERICA: $80 to most countries. \nASIA: $33 to China and Hong Kong. $62 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $45 to Australia. $75 to New Zealand. \nRest of World: $80\nThe following chart are estimates for shipping To The Barricades!

That is subject to change due to the advance nature of this campaign but Aetherworks is our currently preferred provider and our estimates for shipping to Australia and New Zealand reflect their cost structure.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for AEG to ship games to them.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nAlderac Entertainment Group is committed to supporting brick & mortar retail game stores.

Each turn provides players a wide array of options and tools to pull ahead. You can focus on improving the lands of your kingdom, upgrading from simple meadows to a thriving economic engine. Or perhaps you'd rather battle your way to victory, plundering the other kingdoms' riches. With limited space to build and only three positions for key advisers, strategic decisions must be made to guarantee victory.\n Now unlocked, the Trade Route. \nA free mini-expansion for backers of any physical copy pledge. The Trade Route includes supplemental rules featuring a card drafting mechanic, new interaction using the Riches cards, and a new beautifully illustrated center game board -- now unlocked!\nNew Trade Route cards have been unlocked!\nRuler Traits have been unlocked for backers!\nAn optional mini-expansion that adds more depth, asymmetry, and replay value. Wall your kingdom off, by taking the Isolationist Trait, or hoard as much gold as you can, by taking the Avaricious Trait. Bring your kingdom to new heights with the Ambitious Trait, or swindle your opponents with the Mercantile Trait.\nIn the solo mode, race against an ever-expanding rival as you try to out-build and outscore the shadow kingdom.  \nA second solo mode, Conquest of the King, has been unlocked!! \nRead more details about this lite dungeon crawling mode, here!\nGeek Spiel\nUnfiltered Gamer\nSkip to example turn here.

Each hand is like a little puzzle where I need to figure out how to get the most value from it.\" -VVildcard\nUnedited audio from a blind playtest at a convention:\n [More reviews coming soon]\nThe current rules can be found here.\nSolo mode game play video with the developer\nI missed counting 2 VP for the Shadow Kingdom, can anyone figure out how many points the Shadow Kingdom had, and if I won this game or not? The rule book might come in handy! Comment if you've figured it out.\nGame Overview from Board Game Coffee\nSet up\nThe Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced decks are placed in the middle of the table. Each player sets a Kingdom Board, 3 Riches cards, and a Center Land card in front of them\nAction Phase \nEach player gets 3 actions per turn to improve their kingdoms, progress to better decks, and gather as many victory points as possible.\nActions\n Playing a card from their hand \n Drawing or drafting a Basic card\nPlayers will play Land, Person, Event and Victory cards as they advance their kingdom.\nLand Cards - The foundation of any kingdom. With only 8 tiles available for land cards players must make their choices carefully. Resource land cards can stack and upgrade resource cards of the same type.\nPerson Cards - The life force of a kingdom. Person cards will add resource, strength and defense to your kingdom and will play a vital role in balancing war and prosperity.\nEvent Cards - Events can alter the course of medieval history, but make sure it's in your favor. A key component to player interactivity, these cards add another layer of strategy. As you progress to higher decks, the event cards become more powerful allowing for victory point swings and keeping each game close right down to the very end. \nVictory Cards - Great achievements rewarded only to those that seize the opportunity. Victory cards allows players to boost their kingdom to glory, provided they meet the demands.\nDiscard Phase\nEach player can then choose to discard any number of cards from their hand. They will redraw back to their maximum hand size during the final phase of their turn.\nDeck Check Phase \nEach player checks to see if they can upgrade their kingdom based on the level of cards they have in play. Once a player has met the requirements, they can upgrade their kingdom and Center Land. They will be able to draw according to their upgraded Kingdom Level in the next phase.\nDraw Phase\nAt the end of a player\u2019s turn, they draft or draw cards back to their maximum hand size. Each card in the draft is replaced when selected. The maximum hand size by default is 5, but it can be expanded by certain cards.\nEnd of Game \nThere is an \u201cAge of Enlightenment\u201d card within the Advanced deck. When this card is drawn, each player will play one final turn. After all turns are played, each player will count their current Victory Points (VP). The player with the most VPs wins!\nSolo Mode\nRace Against the Shadow Kingdom\nIn the Solo mode, the game's setup, player turn actions, and player scoring are identical to the normal rules. After each turn the player takes, cards are drawn and placed face up for the Shadow Kingdom. The amount and type of cards drawn for the Shadow Kingdom depends on the player's current kingdom progression. The player can use Event cards against the Shadow Kingdom but be warned, if Event cards are drawn by the Shadow Kingdom there are unique effects that may occur.\nAfter the player draws the Age of Enlightenment card, the player's Victory Points are compared against the Shadow Kingdoms, the latter using a special scoring method.\nConquest of the King\nRead more details about this lite dungeon crawling mode, here!\nNaming Rules  \nKeeping the medieval theme is very important to us. We want backers to be able to include their own personal touch to our game but it must fit the following rules. \nFor the Person Cards, this can be any variant of First Name, Last Name and a Title within 35 characters. Land card names can be more flexible but all must stay within the theme.\nWe will work with you to agree upon a name but we reserve the right to decline any name that we feel would be detrimental to the game\nThere will be a deadline for sending your name requests to us. If you do not meet this deadline, we won't be able to use your chosen name. You will still be printed as a SIlver or Gold supporter in the rule book.\nThere will be a deadline for sending in a photo for your portrait to be added in to the game. Our talented illustrator, Jeff, may have some preferences in lighting or pose, so sending a couple reference images will help.\nThe Portrait tier will have our Illustrator, Jeff Porter, paint you into the game.

Emperor Xuanzong built the magnificent imperial Garden of the Majestic Clear Lake as an homage of life itself.\nTang Garden is a Zen-like game that will take you to the first golden age of China, where players will progressively build a garden by creating the landscape, placing the scenery and projecting their vision through vertical panoramas. During the construction, noblemen will visit the garden to admire the surroundings and the way the natural elements coexist in the most breathtaking scenery humankind has ever laid their eyes upon.\nTang Garden is played in a variable number of turns. In each of these turns, the player will be allowed to pick only one action between expanding the garden and decorating the garden: Both actions balance each other, putting the player in the position of making simple and profound choices simultaneously.\nBringing Tang Garden to reality will only be possible with your support. \nMake the game better for everyone. Stretch goals will enhance the final quality and content of the game, the more we fund, the more we can upgrade. We will also offer a serie of Kickstarter Exclusive Stretch Goals.\nThe Deluxe edition contains a Limited Edition numbered Expansion. It won't be possible to get it in distribution. \nGet more value of what you pledge and a competitive discounted and tracked shipping rate.\nWe have planned the size and weight of the game after the Stretch Goals are unlocked and the shipping box will weight around 4 to 5 Kg. We are partnering up with our loyal fulfillment centers: QuarterMaster Logistics for USA, VFI for Asia, Snakes & Lattes for Canada and DHL + GLS tracked and reliable shipping couriers for Europe.\nAfter the campaign ends you will be able to choose your Base Game language from: English, French, German and Spanish.\nThe Deluxe Exclusive expansion: Ghost Stories, will include a multi language rulebook.\nFor the Italian version of the game, please pledge towards our partner, GateOnGames!

It is a challenge to create a game, manufacture it and then ship to the warehouse, but the most important of all, fulfill our backers. After what we learnt from our first three projects, specially Tao Long, we feel confident and prepared to manage this project in the best way possible.\n\nWe have delivered three games and Spirits of the Forest is going into assembling the shipped by sea very soon.\n\nTo avoid any delays, we decided to prepare the game assets for Tang Garden before the campaign. All the files but the rulebook are already in hands of our manufacturer and we should receive a final pre-production copy a couple weeks after the end of the campaign. \n\nLogistics is the most difficult part or running a campaign. From the lessons learned we are combining every time inside boxes as we did for Spirits of the Forest.\n\n- Base Game backers will receive two boxes (Base Game + Stretch Goals)\n- Deluxe backers will receive three boxes (Base Game + Stretch Goals, Tang Garden: Ghost Stories)\n\nThis time around we are also making sure all the add-ons have their own packing. For the decorations we are using booster packs, for the single characters as the Wayfarer tuck boxes and all the expansions and metal coin inside 2-pcs setup boxes.\n\nThese are our fulfillment partners for this campaign: \n- VFI will deliver the games to most of our Asian backers while the rest will be sent by DHL from Europe.\n- VR Distribution will deliver the games in Australia and New Zealand. \n- Quarter Master Logistics will deliver the games to our backers in the US. \n- ThunderGryph together with TCG & Happyshops will deliver the games to all our European Backers by using tracked DHL. \n- Snakes & Lattes will deliver the games to our Canadian Backers. \n- Any \"rest of the world\" backers will be fulfilled by ThunderGryph Games and HappyShops using DHL.\n\nWe are consistently monitoring the project and working hard to remove as much risk as we can from you and bear with it ourselves, If you have any questions about the project development please don't hesitate to ask.

The spies are able to move the monkey, and will also count towards the number of worker lice on that monkey (beware of that nitpicking!). This adds a whole new dimension to the game, making you rethink your old strategies. Also, we'll add a completely new game mode in which you're playing as a species of monkeys, trying to get rid of the lice!\nWith it's extensive development and play-testing, high quality components, and beautiful artwork, we believe there's little to improve on Itchy Monkey with (numerous) stretch goals.

We'll provide you with all the necessary information.\nTo make sure Itchy Monkey arrives at your doorstep safely, we will use a great fulfillment partner. All shipping fees are standard, and based on the actual fee we will need to pay our fulfillment partner. This also means we can ship EU and US-friendly to our backers.\nThe shipping fees will be charged after the campaign through our pledge manager Backerkit, another renowned company.\nTo reduce shipping costs for backers in Germany, Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands, we will take care of the logistics in these countries ourselves. For an overview of the prices see below.\nGroup pledge\nYou can reduce shipping costs by making a group pledge!\nHere's an overview of a few examples for sending 5 games. For an accurate price for your country or more information, please send us a message or email us at kickstarter@blackboxadventures.com.\nJust like with our previous Kickstarter it is possible to pick up your game at one of the many conventions we're attending, including Essen SPIEL 2018.\nDanish backers\nIt's now possible to ship to Denmark via a group pledge. The designer (Allan, see below) will facilitate this himself, with the help of a boardgame cafe in the area of \u00c5rhus. Backers will be able to pick up the games on specific dates and will share the shipping costs. This option will be available through the pledge manager after the campaign. The reduced shipping costs will be charged at that time as well.\nBlack Box Adventures is an indie tabletop games developer and publisher from the Netherlands. We strive to bring you games with our three core values in mind:\nQUALITY: what you get is a high quality product worth your time, as we want to bring you more than some cards and dice in a box. Yes, we are a business, and our business is to make you happy.\nORIGINALITY: Zombies vs Cthulhu? Booooring!! We strive to think outside of the box and make tabletop games with unique twists and themes. Lice colonising monkeys... now we're talking.\nPOWER TO THE PEOPLE: we only publish games that have our full support, but we\u2019re all just ordinary people. We like to work with our community so please let us know what you think!\nItchy Monkey: a Battle of Lice is the brainchild of Allan Kirkeby. For the art we partnered up with Maarten de Schrijver, the designer and illustrator of \"Frutti di Mare: Veni, Vidi, Antipasti!\". Maarten is a 2D and 3D designer, which you'll quickly recognize from the beautifully designed artwork and animation. When Allan presented his game to us the original game mechanics and theme struck us immediately. After more play testing and some adjustments Itchy Monkey was ready to be launched on Kickstarter.\nDoing some field research...\nMeet the game designer: Allan Kirkeby\nI\u2019ve always loved playing and making games. I made my first board game as a kid. In my teens I played tabletop miniature games, and designed campaign-worlds as a D&D game master. I got my first computer and started playing games, but quickly realized that making games with a computer was even more fun. Since then I\u2019ve designed and lead the development of a lot of computer games. Today I spend my daytime as an advisor and teacher for start-up computer game companies, and my evenings and weekends designing, building and playing board games.\nListen to a podcast featuring Allan Kirkeby!\nAllan Kirkeby\nClick this badge to get us to the top of the Kicktraq Hot List!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith two successfully funded and fulfilled projects, Black Box Adventures is ready for more. Although every project comes with risks, we've done our best to minimize them. This isn't our first project, we've got a great track record to give our backers confidence.\n\nThe game, artwork and design are ready to be printed. We received quotes from multiple manufacturers, both domestic as well as foreign. To get the high quality we want, we've chosen one of the best production facilities available. The manufacturer will print and assemble the games. None of the components need to come from China, so there won't be any possible delays/problems that are associated with overseas freight shipping.\n\nShipping is always a risk, especially when shipping international orders. Because the game is produced in the EU, EU-backers won't need to worry about extra customs charges. Like before, we're using a highly renowned fulfillment partner for an ultra smooth fulfilment process.\n\nAccording to the manufacturer the game will be ready before Essen SPIEL 2018, however some events may be out of our or their reach. If for some unforeseen circumstances we won't be able to deliver the product at Essen SPIEL 2018, we will have to arrange a pickup at another convention or charge shipping costs.\n\nLastly, although we are working very hard to expand our range of games, we put originality before anything else. Every game we publish must be an original masterpiece drooling in flavor on its own. We will do everything in our power to achieve this goal. Like our previous games, we will listen to the backers.

With a mix of worker placement (using cultists to perform tasks), deck building (collecting monster cards, spell cards and constellation cards to add more effects to the action cards) and programming (each round, players will need to build their own action deck) players will try to start the most powerful cult and complete rituals.\nThese are the prototype Power Dice - the final dice will have more color. \nReview by Bastiaan Nox (Dutch)\nVariable Player Powers: Each Old One has its own unique ability in the game. They all play a bit differently.\nMix of Mechanics: As said, players will use worker placement, deck building and programming to build their cult.\nLuck of the Draw & Strategy: Drawing cards to enhance your deck will mostly be a thing of luck...but the truly powerful Old Ones know how to plan their cards to make the best possible combinations.\nChoose your play style: The game will come with both a Power Die and Power Cards. If you like some randomness, play with the unique 8-sided Power Die. If you like strategy and planning, play with the Power Cards.\nReplayability: The numerous cards and possible combinations, paired with 16 different rituals, 3 different upgrade paths and 20+ unique buildings will give a different game every time.\n*Only real names are accepted. We don't want any profanity.\nAt the end of the campaign, I will contact all the backers who backed with a reward to name a game element (except the Supportive Cultist backers, as all cultists are the same). Starting with the first backer on that list, each backer has a chance to choose which game element (Old One, Artifact card, Cult Leader) they want to attach their name to.\nFirst of all, I want to thank YOU! Yes, you. You took the time to view this page, read about Castle Madness and perhaps you even backed this game. Without you, this project would not even exist.\nFurthermore, I'd like to thank all the people close to me. My friends, because they were the first to endure the many, many (many) playtest sessions of Castle Madness. They provided me with the first feedback and basically made this game into what it is now. My mum, who had to proofread the many, many (many) draft rules I showed her. My girlfriend, who had to put up with me for many (you get the idea) hours while I was in the same room with her, but at the same time, far away in Naallemrak.\nAlso, thank you to the people I got to know along the way. Arne De Cnodder and Gert Breugelmans, who became a valuable playtesters. All the visitors from Spiel '17 who took the time to stop at my booth and play a demo game. Seb Van Deun & Rudy Seuntjens from the Game Brewer and the games store De Kolonisten here in Turnhout, who gave me advice and let me use the store to host some demo games. Daniel Zayas and Tony Shen from LongPack Games for being patient with all my questions. SharkeeGames who helped me with finding shipping solutions. And Justin from OTX and Seth & Chris from QuarterMaster for providing me with those shipping solutions. FatherGeek who wrote a review for the first campaign and gave me some good insights. Bastiaan Nox and Undead Viking for their amazing review videos.\nI'm sure I'm forgetting some at this moment, but that doesn't make your contribution any less valuable. Thanks you.\nAs soon as LongPack Games is done with the production of Castle Madness, OTX will freight the games to QuarterMaster who will use their close contacts with other fulfillment centers (like Aetherworks and GamesQuest) to ship all the games to their rightful owners - you!\nShipping will be charged after the campaign via the pledge manager, to guarantee an honest and accurate shipping cost.\nThe prices below are estimates based on 2018 quotes and a weight of 2,5 kg, and can differ from the final prices.\nUS: \u20ac8,5\nEurope: \u20ac13,5\nNorway: \u20ac23\nCanada: \u20ac14,5\nAustralia: \u20ac16\nNew Zealand: \u20ac21\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong: \u20ac8,5\nRest of Asia: \u20ac18,5\nAll other countries: \u20ac55", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs I'm new to creating on Kickstarter, the entire campaign will be a challenge for me, I\u2019ll be honest. But I\u2019m backed by tested professionals who know their way around in this world.\n\nSome of you might notice that this is the second try on Kickstarter for Castle Madness. I believe I made some mistakes last time which made the funding goal too high. For example, I went to a publisher instead of a manufacturer to get the game made. This time however, I've cut out the middle man and went straight to a manufacturer.\n\nNow, with a realistic funding goal and realistic pledge level values, I believe Castle Madness is truly ready to be released into the world.\n\nLongPack Games will manufacture the game if the campaign is a success. I've met them at Spiel '17 when I was there promoting Castle Madness' first try on Kickstarter. They truly were a big help and I've contacted them after the first campaign failed to get this project on track again.\n\nFor the moment, this game will be a totally Kickstarter and event exclusive. As of yet, I have no publisher to bring this game to the retailers. The goal of this campaign is to get this game onto other players' tables and if a publisher discovers it along the way, so much the better!\n\nI really believe in this game and I think it is worth publishing.

You can download them right now from here:\nExploriana - Reglas\nWe hope to have more translations soon! If you would like to get involved and translate the rules we are currently looking for German and French translations! \nEXPLORIANA is a competitive push your luck game of exploration and discovery designed by Miles Ratcliffe  with stunningly gorgeous artwork by Richard Dearing. The players control the fates of intrepid explorers travelling to the far off regions of the globe in search of unknown species of plants, fantastic animals, glittering treasures and incredible lost cities that have never been seen before!\nLate in the 19th century vast continents open up to exploration and a wave of interest grips scientists and explorers across the globe. Fantastic animals, strange and beautiful plants, fantastic treasures and ancient sites of lost civilisations all await discovery. Expeditions to far-off regions are always filled with peril, but the challenge is hard to resist. Brave adventurers in search of riches, scientists with a hankering for knowledge and recognition, and intrepid explorers with a burning desire to map the globe: all set out for these wondrous lands with hopes of gaining a place in the history books.\nBelow is a brief overview of Exploriana. To get a full understanding of the game we have several ways in which you can get more information!\nWant to try Exploriana? You can try our Print & Play versions or head over to Tabletopia for a virtual experience!\n                 Thanks to Tabletopia you can try Exploriana now with your friends\nPlay NOW on Tabletopia!\n   In Exploriana you decide the fate of brave explorers as they set out to far flung corners of the globe and trek deep into dangerous, uncharted wilds. Exploriana incorporates several game mechanics:\nresource management (money is the major resource in the game)\nvariable turn order (getting to play first can be a major advantage)\npush your luck (the core mechanic, drawing cards discovering treasure & avoiding dangers)\nan auction every round (winning auctions gains special item cards)\nset collecting (with the many card combinations available collecting certain cards will deliver more points)\nworker placement (placing your explorers is a crucial decision)\n Exploriana is played over a number of rounds split into four phases \nIncome & Auction phases\nEach turn the players collect some extra funding during the income phase, then they bid against each other in the quick fire auction phase to attempt to acquire some choice items from the items deck. Some items assist the players on their perilous expeditions and some help the players grab bonus victory points.\nSend Explorers phase\nNow it's time to send your explorers off on their voyages of discovery in the 'send explorers' phase. There are three regions to explore in Exploriana, South America, Africa and the Far East, all uncharted, filled with wonder and teeming with danger and the players must decide which of the regions they will brave. \nDiscovery phase\nThe discovery phase uses three very different region decks. Each deck is packed with fabulously illustrated discoveries but each also has an increasing amount of peril, from South America, to Africa through to the most dangerous region, The Far East. \nThe discovery phase uses an exciting push your luck mechanic to represent the expeditions heading further and further into the wilds. The players reveal cards until they either decide to stop and make some discoveries or to push on, reveal too many hazards they will get hopelessly lost instead.\nAs a player reveals discoveries, one card at a time, there is a chance that the card may have an associated hazard. Before revealing the next discovery the player may first hire a local guide, to cancel one revealed hazard, or use items that can help the expedition avoid disaster. However, if a player reveals any three hazards of the same type or all three different hazards, then the expedition is lost and makes no new discoveries.\nThere are three different types of hazards represented in Exploriana, the dangerous uncharted terrain the explorers must trek through, ferocious creatures that could attack the expedition at any time and simply losing ones way, forcing the party to backtrack and waste valuable time and resources.\nThe number of discoveries that an expedition can make while exploring is dependant on the types of discoveries revealed and how far the expedition manages to push into the wilds. A player can reveal up to five discovery cards for each of their expeditions and may choose to discover all of the revealed animals or any one of the others or they may even be able to rescue a lost explorer. If they were brave or lucky enough to have revealed all five discoveries without becoming lost, they may make one extra selection. \nVictory \nThe aim of the game in Exploriana is to accumulate the most victory points. There are various ways to get victory points in Exploriana and bonus victory points are also awarded at the end of the game.\nThe discoveries the players make can give them renown, wealth and victory points, some even give the player more than one type. Renown determines the turn order and awards some bonus victory points. Any money the players have accumulated during the game converts into bonus victory points. Some of the items may give a player bonus victory points, some enhance victory points awarded by discoveries and some are worth money. Finally, lost explorers that your expeditions have rescued can increase your wealth and also add a variable number of bonus victory points.\nThe various mechanics and hard decisions the players are forced to make at every turn ensure multiple paths to victory, making Exploriana exciting and really enjoyable. A game you will want to play again and again!\nInterested in a run through of the game?

Triple Ace Games alone has run 17 successful Kickstarter campaigns to date. \n\nThe game is complete and we have already self funded the artwork and design. There will be no delay in sending the game to the factory. The funding raised through this campaign is for manufacturing & bulk shipping the game.\n\nThe main risks faced with, when attempting to bring a board game to market, are usually problems associated with production, shipping and fulfilment. Delays in production can hopefully be avoided by using an experienced manufacturer. We intend to use Longpack, a well known and well established manufacturer and we also intend to have Longpack arrange delivery to the fulfilment company to ensure there are also no unforeseen problems with the shipping of the product. \n\nDue to the combined experience and determination of the team involved with the Exploriana campaign, we are confident that any challenges can be overcome and of course we will endeavour to keep our backers up to date with the progress of the project with regular updates.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Team Glory\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nExploriana has been developed and produced by a collaboration of three separate games companies, Chaos Publishing Ltd, Triple Ace Games Ltd...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Show your support for Exploriana with a token pledge and join us on our Kickstarter expedition.\nBy making a small pledge you can follow the progress of the Exploriana campaign.

If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

We've taken all of those lessons to heart in producing Spider Springs, and I think this is going to be a must-have expansion for die-hard FI fans.

Clair. Edge of Darkness combines Card Crafting, Worker Placement, shared deck-building, and a whole new Threat Challenge system in a medium-weight euro-style boardgame of 60 to 120 minutes for 2 to 4 players.\nGraphic design and primary illustrations by Alayna Lemmer-Danner.\nPlayers are the heads of powerful guilds in the city of Aegis. Each Guild vies with the others to become the leaders of the Aegis in a desperate struggle against great evil. But the Guilds must also work together because the dangers facing the city can harm them all.\nThe Guilds exert their control in the city by sending Agents to various locations where they can generate resources or abilities and enable the Guild to take actions. Guilds grow in power as they maneuver their agents and loyalists into positions of importance in the districts and organizations of Aegis. Over time the Guilds can seek to create synergies between the places their agents have been assigned and the tendrils of influence the Guilds have connected to Aegis' infrastructure.\nTo win a Guild must have the most power in the city when the game ends. Power is gained having the allegiance of important citizens and nobles, by accumulating wealth, and by undertaking actions beneficial to the city such as defending it from external and internal threats.\nHere are some highlights of the mechanics in the game:\n1. Card Crafting: \nSimilar to the original Card Crafting System game Mystic Vale all cards are constructed of crafting slips which have game content on 1/3rd of the slip and are transparent on the other 2/3rds. During the game players will construct cards, combining (sleeving) different effects onto one card (ideally in ways that make strategic sense). Each card represents either an important citizen or a patrician of the city which may or may not bare allegiance to a guild. Each advancement in the game is linked to an important location in the city and represents an individual with sway or power over that location. By crafting cards players are giving their citizens and patricians connections to the key power brokers of the city, and thereby the influence needed to benefit from the military, economic and political institutions of the city. Power in Aegis is all about being well connected.\nUnlike Mystic Vale the cards are double-sided. The back side of each citizen and patrician is its evil counterpart from the Blight: either a Dark Agent or an Archfiend. Each time you sleeve a new connection onto one of you citizens or patricians you also are adding a new threat to the back-side of the card, giving the Dark Agent or Archfiend a new minion or evil spirit to command in its sinister plot against the city.\n2. Group deckbuilding using one shared deck: \nRather than having your own deck, there is a central deck that all players draw from and discard to. Different players will have the allegiance of different citizens and patricians in that deck. You may benefit from the connections of other players' guild members, but the favor comes with a price; one coin paid to that player for each connection of theirs you want to use. During the game you can claim the allegiance of more citizens and patricians in the deck by sleeving a slip into the card with your color and seal on it, meaning you now control a larger portion on the main deck.\n3. Card-driven worker placement: \nWhile your actions are card-driven, most costs in the game are in the form of opportunity cost. You don't pay a cost to sleeve an Advancement or use its ability: instead many require the use of Agents. For example, many effects require dispatching or recovering Agents to or from different city Locations. This represents the key connection of that Location granting, jobs, positions or access to your guild members. Many Locations have abilities that are powered-up or can be triggered once you have enough Agents there. Since you have a limited number of Agents to use, you will constantly have to choose which useful thing to forgo in order to do another.\n4. Threat Tower: There is a Threat Tower which dictates when and who the Blight will attack. Cards leave the shared deck and enter the Tower, where they accumulate Threat Cubes on each player's turn. These cubes are color-coded, and when a threshold number of cubes accumulate on a card, that blight attacks Aegis, and player with the most of their color cubes is responsible for defending the city. Fail in your responsibility and your guild loses reputation, succeed and you guild gains reputation.\n5. Modular set up: \nEach game you use 10 Locations. The Agent Reward has 12, the Guildmaster Reward begins with 21 and more planned as Stretch Goals. The rules will have various recommended sets of Location to use, with each set offering multiple paths to victory and a lot of variety from game-to-game in the types of challenges you will face and the strategies you can peruse. The Locations set for a game can also be specifically selected by you or chosen randomly, making for even more variety. These Locations are comprised of a Location Board and Advancements representing the key connection at that Location. Location Boards may specify special rules for Agent placement or extend the basic rules with all new systems such as area majority, or the ability to assemble a party of heroes and hunt the Blight, or offer the possibility to actually join the \"Blood Cult\" and become evil yourself.\nThe game is designed for 2-4 players. Our first Stretch Goal unlocks solo rules. There are no co-op rules for Edge of Darkness. \nClick Here to Download the Edge of Darkness Prototype Rules\nThese rules are not final and will continue to evolve as we move closer to production of the game. Please send any questions or comments about the rules to edge@alderac.com.\nBecause of the complex nature of the components of Edge of Darkness it isn't possible to produce a print & play version of the game.\nWe've designed our logistics system to provide the lowest possible cost for the delivery of your Rewards!\nWe will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship from the closest distribution center to your delivery address.

Rules are subject to change.\n\nAlderac Entertainment Group has been in the publishing business for more than 20 years. We are experienced at producing games in China and distributing them worldwide. Nonetheless there are always risks associated with manufacturing and logistics.\n\nThese problems can delay or otherwise impact our ability to meet our commitments to our backers.\n\nThese issues include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Production delays \n* Shipping delays \n* Customs delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is June 2019, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nBefore the Rewards are shipped we offer no questions asked refunds. Once we have shipped your Reward our refund policy will depend on the circumstances and will be at our discretion.\n\nAt your request we can give you a full refund within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that we will subtract Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from Kickstarter after 14 days). Those fees usually equal 8% of the total pledge.\n\nRefunds will be processed through Kickstarter and will be applied to whatever payment method you provided to Kickstarter. In the event that is impossible we will work with you to arrange a refund through other channels.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed. Not responsible for changes in the rate of foreign exchange.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you agree to conduct all public interactions via Kickstarter's communications channels with this project and our team and other backers in a positive manner. Harassment, name-calling, or attempts to inject inappropriate content into the public communications channels for the project will result in the cancellation of your pledge (with a full refund) and your ejection from the campaign. We want the communications channels for this campaign to be a friendly, positive place for our community to gather and discuss the campaign, ask questions, and provide input. \n\nAEG reserves the right to cancel any pledge (with a full refund) at any time, for any reason. If your pledge is cancelled while the campaign is ongoing you agree not to re-pledge either under your original account or under any other account you control. Violations of this policy will be reported to Kickstarter.\n\nMinor cosmetic damage to the box or other packaging can occur during shipping. AEG makes reasonable efforts to ensure that the shipping containers it uses are suitable for the safe delivery of the Rewards. If you believe that your Reward has suffered more than minor cosmetic damage please contact us immediately. Keep all packaging including outer cartons for our inspection. AEG will at its sole discretion determine if the damage constitutes other than minor cosmetic damage and/or was the result of insufficient packaging.\n\nIf we ship to the address that you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is returned to us as undeliverable you will pay the full cost to ship the Reward again to a revised address. \n\nIf we ship the Reward to the address you provided in our Pledge Manager and the package is delivered to that address but you are unable to receive it, or you have moved and are no longer the occupant of that address and cannot otherwise retrieve the package, or if the package is lost or stolen after delivery, and you wish to have the order fulfilled again you will pay the full cost to ship the order to a revised address plus the amount of the original Reward plus Add-Ons and other upgrades on your order.\n\nIn all cases you acknowledge that quantities are limited and AEG may not be able to ship all or part of your order more than once. \n\nIf any part of your order cannot be fulfilled for any reason AEG will provide you with a pro-rated refund for that portion of your order.\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in to our Pledge Manager and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received.

By order of the bishop, you have been commissioned to restore a large fresco painting on the cathedral's ceiling. But not surprisingly, you are not the only master commissioned for the project.\nThis is an engaging game for families and gamers that has been recognized with over 15 major award nominations and wins worldwide, including a nomination for the Spiel de Jahres (German Board Game of the Year) and the winner of the Deutscher Spiel Preis.\nYou will need to carefully plan your workday: when to wake the apprentices, what stalls to visit, which paints to buy, which tiles to paint, and when it is appropriate to make a generous donation to the bishop. Buying materials costs money, so be prepared to take on additional projects to earn money to acquire the paints and materials necessary for completing your tasks; but your apprentices are not automatons, you need to keep them happy too. An evening at the theater can go a long way toward keeping your apprentices happy. By managing your decisions carefully and planning ahead, you can become one of the masters of the ages.The decisions you make in Fresco are all wonderfully woven into the theme of managing the challenging undertaking of restoring a Renaissance masterpiece!\nThis video describes Fresco Expansion 1 and the Scrolls module included in Fresco Big Box.\nBecause of safety issues, the glass nuggets of the previous print run will be substituted with cardboard tokens.\nThis video describes Fresco Expansion 2 included in Fresco Big Box.\nFor more information on the game check out the following link:\nBGG-Site for Fresco Big Box\nRules in different languages\nShogun re-implements Wallenstein with a setting in Japan during the Sengoku or \u201cWarring States\u201d Period (1467 - 1603). Shogun is Queen Games' highest rated game on BGG (number 126). In Shogun, each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his empire and secure points. Castles, temples and theaters replace the infrastructure of Wallenstein (as rice replaces wheat), creating a thematic experience for players who wish to move their exploits east to the Land of the Rising Sun.\n Japan during the Sengoku or \u201cWarring States\u201d Period: each player assumes the role of a great Daimyo with all his troops. Each Daimyo has the same 10 possible actions to develop his kingdom and secure points. To do so he must deploy his armies with great skill. Each round, the players decide which of the actions are to be played out and in which of their provinces. If battle ensues between opposing armies, the unique Cube tower plays the leading role. The troops from both sides are thrown in together and the cubes that fall out at the bottom show who has won immediately. Owning provinces, temples, theaters, and castles means points when scores are tallied. Whichever Daimyo has the highest number of points after the second tally becomes \u2013 SHOGUN!\nThe main goal of the game is to have as many counties under your control as possible, but that alone is not enough to win you the game. Players must develop these counties by building palaces, churches and guilds. In addition to building infrastructure, you must also feed your peasants or they will revolt. Revolting peasants can lose you armies and possibly the county. At the beginning of the game, starting locations are assigned with a drafting mechanic using country cards and cubes representing armies; this ensures a different game every time you play.\nThere are 10 actions that can be performed by a player during a game round. There are two locations involving actions. Each player has his/her own board. On this board, the player places a county card on a particular action (for example if I want to build reinforcements in Bremen, I would place my Bremen county card face down in the reinforcement action box). The order of these actions is determined by shuffling a deck of 10 cards and displaying the first 5 face up on the main game board and the last 5 face down. This order changes round to round. So while players know the last 5 actions, advance planning and maneuvering is rewarded for the players who think about what is coming.\nMoving (another one of your actions) into a country where there is another player sparks a battle. Battle can also occur when a player has moved into a Neutral County, or when a revolt occurs in one of their own counties. Battles are resolved with the dice tower. The tower is seeded at the beginning of the game with army cubes from all players and some peasants\u2019 cubes so that there can be no perfect knowledge. The attacker and defender put all their cubes from the contested area into the tower at the same time. Whoever has the most cubes that fall out of the tower and into the tray is the winner of the battle. Cubes from other players not involved in the battle that fall into the tray are not counted. However, any peasants\u2019 cubes in the tray side with the defender. In addition to invading and controlling counties, taxing counties for gold, acquiring grain to feed your peasant population, enlisting reinforcements and building infrastructure (whew!), there are event cards and bonus tiles that add additional twists to this exciting and deep game of military conquest!\nFor more information on Shogun and the Big Box check out the following links:\nBGG-Site for Big Box\nBGG-Site for Shogun Basic Game\nRules in different languages\nThe Expansions\nExpansion 1: Tenno's Court\nThe Shoguns are still fighting over the distribution of the empire\u2019s provinces while peasant revolts and famines do not encourage ruling the country. But none other than the disempowered Tenno might tip the scales for some of the sovereigns: Ensuring the favor of the Tenno by using your diplomatic skills will help you win precious gifts and highly rated privileges. But be careful: If you vie too much for the Tenno\u2019s favor you might easily loose control of your armies \u2026  \nPlayer's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; The other way for players to acquire courtiers, is by converting armies to courtiers during the game. Whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available.\nExpansion 2: Samurai\nSamurai which can be used with \"Emperor's Court\" or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as receiving gold or placing armies in the dice tower tray for future conflicts) shown on the newly revealed card. This stack resets after winter (turns represent seasons) ends.\nExpansion 3: Military Leaders\nEvery player is given one military leader figure to place on one of his controlled counties. While performing actions in this county he gets extra benefits, such as costs of buildings are reduced by 1 or he earns one extra grain. At the end of a players turn he then moves the leader to an adjacent county under his control, leaving a marker at the old location. If a player can not place the leader adjacent to his county, he has to move it to any of his controlled counties not leaving a marker behind. The more markers you have on the board at the end of the game the more points will be awarded!\nExpansion 4: Chambers\nMany offices have to be taken in order to rule the land. For each region there are several positions to be filled by the players. At the beginning of each round 6 chamber markers are revealed and placed on the corresponding spaces on the chamber tableau. These 6 positions are available to be filled in each region by the players. Whoever has the most counties under his control in that region will fill the position and exchange the camber marker on the tableau with one of his own player markers. At the end of the game, players are awarded extra points for majorities in horizontal and vertical lines on the chamber tableau.\nProduction and Delivery  \nThe Production of Shogun and Fresco Big Box is planned for August 2018. Once produced, we plan to ship the pledges out to the backers as soon as possible.

This campaign contains the first three titles in the series.\nEvery single game is modular. They can be played stand alone, in series (adding end game scores), or integrated with 1 or more other TOKYO titles for an expanded new experience!\nTOKYO JIDOHANBAIKI is a game about Japanese vending machines and drinks! Utilizing exquisite, tactile components, this title includes over 20 unique 5-15 minute games from various guest designers across the globe. With a huge range of game types and flavors (deduction, dexterity, economic, etc), this game is perfect for any setting or player count!\nTOKYO METRO is a heavy economic simulation of the metro system in Tokyo, using a unique action placement cycling system, stock investments, speculation, loans, bicycles, grid movement, train riding, and more! Playing 1-4 players and taking 120 minutes on average, TOKYO METRO will fill the hearts of train enthusiasts and \u30b5\u30e9\u30ea\u30fc\u30de\u30f3 alike! \nTOKYO JUTAKU is a larger version of the previously sold out game Jutaku, where 1-8 players will take on the role of Japanese architects designing small, abstract home models on strangely shaped plots of land. With 69 unique wooden pieces and a range of building conditions from easy to very difficult, this real time dexterity game is very exciting for a large group, but can also be played as a solitary meditation experience.\nStretch goals have been planned for and costed from the outset, ensuring that their addition will not incur delivery delays or compromises in the quality of the final product elsewhere. All of the TOKYO SERIES games come fully upgraded with SPOT UV, thick chip board, linen cards, real wooden pieces, resin and ABS miniatures, and more to follow!\nAlso available as an add on is a beautiful fully metal currency that can be used with all of the TOKYO SERIES games! Only one print run of this currency design will be created.\nCheckout a basic overview video for how to play each of the games below, or even better read each rulebook after the video! For TOKYO JIDOHANBAIKI, only a few of the 20+ included games are shown, but many more will be added throughout the campaign as the rules are submitted.\nIf a game has the (\u00a5) character inside of a circle next to its title in the rulebooks, that game is eligible to be played in series by keeping a total end game cumulative yen score. (click the rulebooks to view them).\nI've had the privilege of demoing all 3 titles at Essen Spiel 2017, and at the Kickstarter booth at PAX Unplugged 2017 with great reception! Here are some shots from those events, plus some reactions from the players:\nHere are some really cool people I met, betting on which miniature drinks they think will come out of the vending machine tower.

This game of historical set collection will see players taking on the mantle of Curator in one of the world\u2019s great museums.\nDiscover lost civilisations from four continents and acquire relics to display in your galleries. Each object you exhibit will earn you points! Additionally, at the end of the game, you\u2019ll score more based on the size of your different Collections, which can be based on Civilisations or Domains. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!\nThe world will keep turning as you play however and you\u2019ll have to contend with historical events that may make the acquisition of artefacts harder, as well as facing the scrutinising gaze of public opinion.\nWill your Museum go down in the annals of history? Or will it simply be a footnote?\nMuseum is a \u00ab big box \u00bb game of set collection that allows you, as the curator, to choose the strategy that suits you best. Accomplished gamers will be able to draw out all the depth and complexity from the game\u2019s mechanics yet its simple rules can be easily adapted to suit newer and younger players.\nThe fruit of over a year\u2019s research, the 180 objects included in the game are real and each one has been lovingly redrawn by Vincent Dutrait.\n The cards are also furnished with accurate historical information, bringing each artefact to life! This continues into the rest of the game which has been designed to provide a fun and immersive experience featuring almost 300 unique illustrations!\nA challenging set collection game that can also be adapted to suit less experienced players.\nA beautiful game featuring almost 300 unique illustrations by Vincent Dutrait.\nRich historical content that will pique your curiosity!\nFrom 2 to 4 players with a duration of 15-20min per player.\nThe Central Board represents the organised chaos that was a curator\u2019s desk during these wonderous times! On it, you\u2019ll find many of the elements required during the game.\nMost prominent are the 4 Continents and the available Objects brought back for your consideration by industrious explorers. During the game you\u2019ll be attempting to amass collections of these cards. Collections can either be based on the treasures of one Civilisation in particular, or be themed on artefact Domains, and ensure you additional points at the end of the game.\nEach card possesses a Value (used when purchasing/scoring cards), a Civilisation/colour (used when scoring collections based on civilisations) and a Domain/icon (used when scoring collections based on domains). Each of these authentic objects also has a Name, Illustration and Description. These don\u2019t have any effect on the rules but will give you a much better sense of what the game is about!\nAt the start of your turn you can choose one of the eight object cards available on the main board and take it for free. These cards will serve bothfor scoring items and as currency in the game as in Museum, objects are purchased using other objects! So, choose your card wisely\u2026do you want to exhibit a card, or do you need it to pay for something more interesting? Maybe both?\nOther players don\u2019t sit idly by during your turn either. After you\u2019ve chosen one, all the other players may also take a card. If they do though, you get Prestige Points! Prestige points represent the favours and honours your museum accumulates during the game and can be used to purchase cards!\nOnce all players have taken a card, you can move on with your action phase. Each player has a Museum Board representing the hallowed halls of their great establishment and it\u2019s in this part of the turn that you\u2019ll be filling yours with wonders from around the world.\nYou have two actions available to you:\nYou can furnish your museum (placing cards down)\nor\nPerform an Inventory (picking cards up).\nTo play a card into your museum you simply discard other cards of equal or greater value. You can also use any prestige points you collect to pay for cards too. Whenever you play objects into your museum, you score their value in points. There\u2019s no limit to how many objects you can purchase in one turn, as long as you can pay for them!\nDiscarded cards aren\u2019t lost however! Your Discard Pile represents your museum\u2019s storage and Objects in there can still be played exactly as if they were in your hand, with the exception of course being that you can\u2019t use them to pay for other cards.\nHowever, as you\u2019ve shown that you\u2019re not as interested in these cards, you leave them open to being taken by other parties who may have a better use for them! Effectively; cards that are in your discard pile aren\u2019t available only to you, any other player can now access them too! Any player can purchase a card from your discard pile. If they do so though, they must give you one of their Prestige points as payment!\nInstead of playing cards down you can pick them up! This action allows you to take all the cards from your discard pile and place them back in your hand. Although you won\u2019t be able to do anything else that turn, it will allow you to (maybe) get a full hand of cards back and ready to use again as well as keeping them out of the reach of your opponents!\nOnce you\u2019ve performed one of these two actions any missing objects cards on the central board are replaced and play passes to the next player!\nThis represents the basic rules and structure for each turn of the game: play will continue to pass from one player to another as each of you improves upon your collections.\nIf you think that the game is going to let you do that peacefully though, you\u2019re in for a surprise:\nHeadline cards: Historical events will unfurl as the game advances, having a direct effect on players. Headline cards can make it harder, or easier, to acquire objects as well as having other amusing or challenging effects.\nNotoriety Cards: As your Museum grows so will the different favours you can call in. Notoriety cards are powerful single-use abilities that can give you an edge during the game.\nPersonnel: A good museum needs the right people to help run it and that\u2019s where personnel cards come in. Representing experts from different fields, these individuals can help you enrich your collections and score more points at the end of the game.\nPublic Opinion: Hidden within the continent decks are Public Opinion cards. These represent the press noticing curators that have been taking lots of artefacts from certain Continents, without ever displaying them to the public! These can accumulate on different continents, leading to lost points at the end of the game if you don\u2019t manage your discard pile properly!\nPatron Cards: Rich patrons of history and art are more than willing to help you in your endeavour, all you\u2019ll have to do is meet some of their requests. You\u2019ll choose one of these cards at the start of the game and they\u2019ll ask you to assemble certain collections in order to gain more points at the end of the game.\nThe game Continues until a player reaches 50 points. This signals the end of the game as the public starts lining up to visit your establishment! The player in question finishes their turn and then everyone else gets one more turn before we move on to tallying up points.\nCards placed into your museum can be moved around as you see fit during the game as you search for those last items and perfect layout. At the end though you\u2019ll need to decide on your final layout before your museum opens!\nCollections are formed by placing cards orthogonally adjacent to each other, and consist of two categories: Civilisations (cards of the same colour) and Domains (cards with the same icon but different colours). The bigger the collection, the more points you can score!\nOnce everyone has finished organising their collections, your museum opens its doors to the public (with no small amount of pomp and circumstance) and we move into final scoring to see who wins!\nFirst take the points you scored during the game and add those gained from your collections. You can also convert any remaining Prestige points into victory points too.\nYou then score points for your Patron card as well as your museum\u2019s layout. If you managed to amass a big enough collection and fill your Grand Gallery (the red slots on the board) and/or your Entire Museum, you score even more points!\nFinally, players lose points based on the Public Opinion tokens on the board. Each card in your discard pile belonging to a continent with at least one Public Opinion token loses you points! The more tokens there are, the more points you lose!\nYour fellow curators will of course do the same and once scores have been tallied up, the player with the most points wins!\nThis is of course a summary or Museum\u2019s rules. If you\u2019d like to read the full version, you can find the work in progress Rulebook below.\nClick to download.\n Please note that this is a work in progress and not representative of the final product.\nMuseum is, at its heart, a set collection game. It's family orientated with just the right amount of rules and player interaction. Additionally, it can be tailored to suit more casual or younger players by easily removing elements such as Personnel, Events, Notoriety cards or Public Opinion to create an even easier, quicker, yet just as fun to play game. You can then add the different modules back in as the players become familiar with the rules and want to challenge themselves more.\nFor the more seasoned players out there though, don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve forgotten about you. Museum is a simple game compared to some, but it doesn\u2019t lack depth. Whilst the game has been designed with a family setting in mind, some of you may have noticed some of the subtler nuances whilst perusing the rules above. From manipulating discard piles to \u201ctaxing\u201d highly sought-after cards, there\u2019s more than a few ways for gamers to get their kicks! On top of this, upcoming expansions will allow you to add other elements to the game and create a much more cerebral challenge!\nYou can watch a full 4 -player game of Museum here:\nYou can also watch a video explanation of Museum's rules with Jamie here:\nStill not convinced that you want to back Museum? This video by Rahdo might change your mind!\nBarry Doublet from Board Games Everybody should has made a video about Museum !\nYou can also read his written article here!\nInterested in the World's Fair Expansion? You can see a full explanation and playthrough here:\nInterested in the Archaeologists Expansion? You can see a full explanation and playthrough here:\nWe'll be posting lots more video content during the campaign, including interviews with the game's authors and opinions from reviewers from around the world!\nWhat would a good KS be without Stretch Goats? As we move further and further through the project you'll unlock more and more content including plenty of exclusive elements that will enrich your pledge!\n From the seedy underworld of the Black Market, to the prestigious heights of the World Fair, there\u2019s more to the world of Museum than meets the eye!\nHow do I include add-ons in my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page.\n2. On the next screen, click on the blue \u201cChange your pledge\u201d button.\n3. Then, in the current reward box you\u2019ve chosen, increase the pledge amount by the value of the add-on and then click on the green \u201cContinue\u201d button.\n4. A new window will appear, click on the blue \u201cConfirm\u201d button.\n5. It\u2019s done!\n6. A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to complete it. Here you'll be able to tell us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\nCurrently the game design for Museum is complete. You can see prototype copies of the game being played in the reviews and videos shown on this page. Whilst we\u2019re very happy with the game\u2019s current state, there may well be a few final modifications and checks to be made before we\u2019re fully satisfied with the final result.\nAs for stretch goals and other content we may unlock during the campaign: The game design for the majority of these elements have been tested and finalized. Any remaining queries should be resolved not long after the Kickstarter has ended. The brunt of the remaining work lies in the illustration work as you may have guessed.\nThe Core game is around 80% complete whereas the expansions require significantly more work. This has of course been taken into account for the announced delivery date. As Vincent finishes the illustrations the rest of the team will be working on pre-production so that the game is ready to be sent to print as soon as possible. We\u2019re planning for production to begin in late March in order to hit our planned delivery date of late July/early August.\nHowever, all this depends on the route the campaign takes. We have prepared as much as possible but developments during the campaign may cause delays so please bear this in mind.\nOlivier Melison and Eric Dubus have known each other for over 30 years, during which time they have played a huge selection of games together! Museum was born from their mutual desire to create a historically-themed game. When they're not creating amazing games together, Olivier works in international publishing, and Eric is a history teacher.\nVincent Dutrait is one of, if not the most, respected illustrators in the board gaming industry. Having worked on over 50 different projects (including Lewis & Clark, New York 1901, Robinson Crusoe, Broom Service, Lovecraft Letter, T.I.M.E. Stories, Augustus & Tikal 2...) his unique style of illustration and graphic design is popular with both players and publishers alike. He has also had the opportunity to work on prestigious licences such as Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer Fantasy, Pathfinder, Cthulhu and Games of Thrones.\nHoly Grail Games is a board game publisher that was born from its creators\u2019 desire to make great, unique games. HGG brings together the experience and passion of Jamie Johnson (community manager on multiple projects including Conan and The 7th Continent Kickstarter campaigns) Vincent Dutrait (renowned illustrator and artistic director) , and Olivier Melison (entrepreneur, passionate player and game author).\nWell, the real question is - why not? Kickstarter and crowdfunding in general are amazing tools for game publishers and have revolutionized our industry. Financially it is one of the most beneficial routes of publishing and helps us ensure that everyone involved in the project earns a good living from each game. At the end of the day, this is what allows us to continue to do what we love! Kickstarter is also an amazing communication tool, allowing us to reach out directly in a unique and engaging way to those most interested in what we have to offer.\nBut that's not all. Beyond good business sense, Kickstarter allows us to prioritise quality over quantity. It allows us to only deal with games that we love and believe in 100%, taking the time and care necessary to push their development as far as it will go. In the case of Museum, it has allowed us to justify the extensive art budget that we wanted to attribute to the game. Simply put, games like Museum and/or their content would just not be viable with a \"traditional\" publishing method.\nWith the leeway and support afforded to us by these kind of projects, we can take a normal gaming experience and make it extraordinary. Via both material and content, our aim is to have all our games provide a unique, exciting, engaging and luxury experience!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game by August 2018. This may seem like a long time as the game itself is already quite advanced (as detailed in the \"development\" section). However, knowing the intricacies of board game design, fabrication and shipping, we'd rather include a good margin of error in our estimations in order to avoid disappointment.\nMeeple Logistics will be ensuring delivery In Europe and the surrounding regions whereas Shipnaked will be taking care of North America and other worldwide destinations.\nAs mentioned previously, Shipping costs are not included in your pledge. After the campaign has concluded we will ask you to pay for shipping during the \"Pledge Manager\" phase. \nCurrently the shipping for this project is both EU, US and CA friendly. What does this mean? It means that backers from these two regions will not have to pay any import tax whatsoever when they receive their game.\nHowever, even if your region is not covered by this: please rest assured that our dispatcher will ensure you pay the absolute minimum in tax or brokerage for your game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNo crowdfunding project comes without risk but we have done our utmost to minimise it.\n\nEXPERIENCE\n\nThis is not our first rodeo, we have been involved in many Kickstarters before so are very familiar with any potential pitfalls.\n\n\nDELIVERY DATE\n\nWe're estimating an August 2018 delivery date. This corresponds to the time we believe will be necessary to prepare the game for manufacturing, produce it and ship it to you. It also includes a safety margin too in case we come across any unforeseen circumstances.\n\nIt is in our best interests to get the game to our backers as soon as possible and we will do our utmost to ensure that there are no delays. However, it may be that a situation arises that is out of our control, such as issues with shipping, customs or problems at the factory. Should anything cause this date to change we will of course keep you updated.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded -minus KS and Strype fees- up until the closing date of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf, for any reason, we are unable to produce the game we will provide a full refund to all our backers.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ from what is presented whilst the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

We are thankful for their contributions and plan on advancing the tabletop experience.\nThis Water Feature Collection was created for our personal AD&D campaign. While designing a Dark Elf Cavern* deep in the Underdark we wanted a reason for our players to interact with the terrain.  We came up with the idea of having a bunch of pool, spouts and bowls that have random magical effects. Drawing up a d20 water effect generator, characters that drink from the waters experience an effect for a short time.\nFantasy RPG: Its nice to be able to print terrain that will work with your Dungeons & Dragons or Pathfinder campaign that looks great and have an interaction effect! As stated above we have play tested random temporary effect for players that drink from the waters.\nDrinking from the waters could cause the adventurer to instantly cluck like a chicken gaining +5 initiative on the next encounter or whistle a quick melody gaining +5 to next dexterity check or the water could restore d4 health.  Not all waters offer a benefit some could require the adventurer to eat rations or suffer d4 damage.  Great concept and adds great value for interaction with the terrain.\nSiFi Gaming: Spacefinder!

They can easily blend into other terrain pieces I have or standout as needed. I would certainly recommend them to any who actually has a 3d printer. \nDave from Draven's RPG Review: I'm sure any gamers out there who own a 3D printer would love to make their own terrain, and these designs are some of the nicest I've ever seen.\nDave also posted an unboxing video and showed each piece. - Unboxing Video \nIn Game Mechanics: When a players drink from the waters they will be granted a temporary effect. Once a player drinks from the water source they are numb to receiving the effect again until after a short or long rest.  However! the water effect changes the next time the player drinks from it, have player roll for effect result.  The water when collected into a vessel loose the effect so it can't be stored for later use.  Most of the effects wear off quickly but some wear off after a short or long rest.  In general we do not stack effects.  We let the player who drinks the waters roll a d20 and read off the taste and effect for everyone to hear.  Lastly, you can change the effects, taste, let effects stack or even let players store some collected water if you wish, its your campaign Have Fun!\n  Possibilities: With 3d Printers we are able to make complex pieces in a single print which is drastically different from the traditional method of making the same piece using molds. With molds a complex design piece require us to make parts and then glue them together to create the same type of piece. Designing gaming terrain using software gives us the ability to make high definition simple AND complex terrain designs at a level not seen until now.\nWith that in mind we have every intention of taking advantage of this technology and pushing tabletop gaming terrain/scenery to an unparalleled level, this is just the beginning.\nWe See Eye to Eye: We want you to know we are doing this for both of us! You have a 3d Printer and are already part of the future or perhaps getting ready to jump in.  All you need is someone to design new quality content at a fair price, We promise you, we will continue to make affordable designs and offer discounts on our crowd funding campaigns.\n3d Printers in 2017: 3D Printing is affordable and easy to use! Currently there are good 3d printers such as the Monoprice Select Mini v2 pricing in at just over 200$ and PLA plastic for printing is less then 20$. With your own printer and files everyone can now make unlimited pieces for your tabletop gaming adventures.\nBackstory: A few years ago my wife and I created Mystic-Realm and began creating tabletop gaming terrain. Sculpts were made by hand using clay and a full range of tools. We made silicone molds and hand casted each piece using resin. Together we painted each peace offering them on eBay and our website. It has been an incredible experience with lots of fun and now we are moving into the future with 3d printing. This campaign is the first step in that direction. Once this campaign is over each piece will be listed on our website at 2$ per piece.  This is your chance to get the collection at a discount with free stretch goals as they unlock. We are looking for hardcore gamers like yourselves who love tabletop gaming with high quality 3D terrain.\nThis is the beginning of a loyal partnership with you. Thank you for believing in us, thank you for being our partner.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nNearly every design is complete, we just need a little bit more funding to finish the last few models. By the time the crowd funding campaign comes to a close we expect to have 100% of the plans ready for download.

In this dark, medieval universe, kings plot for the throne of France, and on the battlefield their heroic knights clash with foes both real and legendary.\nFor more than a century, from 1337 to 1453, the fields of France rang to the sound of constant warfare. The Hundred Years\u2019 War is one of the longest wars ever fought and is the source of many of our collective ideas about heroic knights of old. It was also a time of myths and legends, and a fervent faith in the literal truth of the doctrine of Holy Mother Church. It is this world of strife and faith that this game recreates.\nIn Time of Legends: Joan of Arc, all the creatures that the medieval people thought were real, are real. Whether they are represented on tapestries, in stained glass windows, or in illuminated manuscripts, we take them at their word. It is this dark and epic universe that you will explore in the game\u2019s many scenarios. Some are historical, with no taint of the whispered legends of strange creatures. Others are replete with the supernatural or (saints preserve us) demonic.\nYou are free to control the army of miniatures that represent your heroes, knights and peasants as you wish in order to achieve your goals. You will decide who moves and where; whether your forces explore, pray, converse with locals, or simply charge into battle. But before we get to the field of glory, you must first choose your side.\nDownload the Beta Rulebook here !  \n  All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\n                                Joan Of Arc, Bertrand Du Guesclin, La Hire, Gilles de Rais & Jean de Dunois (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\n The French have a very large army whose leaders follow the code of chivalry to the letter. These noble knights form the main striking force of the army, with their infantry taking a subservient role. The French employ few archers, but do hire efficient crossbowmen to fight alongside their men-at-arms. All these warriors fight on behalf of the King of France, who sees the war as a chance to reclaim lands lost to the English under earlier monarchs.\nThe Black Prince, Falstaff, John Talbot, John Chandos & John of Lancaster (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe English king considers himself the legitimate heir to the throne of France, and there is some truth in this. In fact, he only failed to gain the crown because the French changed the rule of royal succession to stop him.\nThe English army, though considerably less numerous than the French, are formidable combatants, who often have the best strategists. Their longbowmen wreak havoc on the battlefield, and have repeatedly bested the cream of French chivalry in battle. This is a slight that the French knights are determined to avenge.\nArchangel Gabriel, the Unicorn & Angel (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe army of God is made up of powerful, heavenly beings like the angels and archangels. They fight their righteous battles alongside the lesser creatures of God, and the weary mortals who struggle with sin, but are devoted to their creator.\nThe Holy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\nThe Witch, the Werewolf & the Ghost Warrior (miniatures are supplied assembled and unpainted)\nThe Devil\u2019s army is made up of all sorts of foul creatures: werewolves, demons, skeletons, dragons, witches, and many more. Countless fallen mortals march alongside this monstrous host, having cast aside their God and sold their souls for mere wealth or power. It is rumoured that in this dark time, when the End of Days has never seemed so close, even the Devil himself may make an appearance...\nThe Unholy Army can be played independently, or allied with the French, or the English.\n All of these unlocked stretch goals are added FREE to every Maiden pledge, and every copy of the core box you pledge for.\nTime of Legends: Joan of Arc can be played in two different modes: scenario or battle.\nIn the scenario mode, you choose a scenario from the many options offered in the core box and elsewhere. The key feature of a scenario is that it sets a scene and describes a situation, then lets you finish the story by playing a game. A scenario can be anything from a select group of heroes investigating dire rumours of witchcraft, to a sudden ambush featuring dozens of soldiers on either side.\nIn the battle mode, you fight your opponent using an army of your choice. The key feature of battle mode is that both players choose their own forces \u2013 nothing is pre-set. Once you have constructed your army following the simple rules, you fight a battle, with victory depending on the objectives chosen.\nThe cross of the hanged wolf Scenario (3D Demo Board for convention - Not for sale).\n   All pledge levels will be available in both English and French. You\u2019ll be able to choose the language during the pledge manager phase, after the campaign.\nTous les niveaux de souscriptions seront disponibles en fran\u00e7ais et en anglais. Vous pourrez choisir votre langue lors de la phase de pledge manager \u00e0 l\u2019issue de la campagne.\nThis campaign will be presented in both English and French wherever possible. This does mean a lot more work for us, and we may sometimes need a little time to catch up with translations. Please bear with us.\nThe French version of this page is here.\n   The Maiden Pledge, with more than 230 miniatures plus all unlocked stretch goals and 12 scenarios that each have a strong replayability, includes everything you need to play for a very, very long time. It is however possible to explore new horizons with the optional buys.\nYou can buy Optional Buys separately with the Companion in Arms Pledge, if you are not interested in the rest of the range.\nOr you can buy them in addition to your Maiden Pledge if you want to play them as we've designed them.\nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any optional buy, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Time of Legends: Joan of Arc Kickstarter page, and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t have to specify what you want at this stage, we\u2019ll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed, when we send you our pledge manager.\n BUNDLES ADD-ONS\nLEGENDARY ADD-ON\n   MAJESTIC ADD-ON\n    MYTHIC ADD-ON\n   HEROIC ADD-ON\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nJOAN OF ARC ROLEPLAYING GAME\nClick here to find more about this add-on\nVILLAGE PACK \n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nPLUNDER\n COMPENDIUM\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nSIEGE\n  Click here to find more about this add-on.\nARS NOVA\n Click here to find more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY BATTLES\nClick here to find more about this add-on.\nUNLEASH HELL\n Click to find out more about this add-on.\nLEGENDARY DRAGON\nThe Legendary Dragon is the biggest figure in the game and the biggest playable figure in boardgame history.

Dragon / Human size comparison (Dragon supplied unpainted. Leo not supplied at all)\nThe Dragon is supplied with the Archangel Saint Michael, one bombard, two artillerymen, ruins, 4 hexes, 6 hexagons of destruction and a special scenario featuring the Dragon, played by one player, and an army of human soldiers assisted by angels, played by the other players (1 or 2).\nClick here to find out more about this Add-On\n\u201cI loved loved loved this, and spent two days with the scenario bubbling in my mind around the other tactical options I could have taken!\u201d\nWarren (Beasts of War)\n\u201cThe miniatures are all cool.

Had a great time playing it.\u201d\nSam Healey (The Dice Tower) - in the Top 3 of the best games that Sam played at Gen Con 2017.\n\u201cTime of Legends: Joan of Arc stole the show for us. Mythic Games had pictures of hard plastic miniatures painted up, and they looked incredible.\u201d\n Techraptor at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cWithout a doubt, hands-down, my big giant experience at (GenCon) was Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. An amazing Euro minis game. The way you activate the models is extremely innovative. It was awesome, the most fun of any game I played in the vendor hall.\u201d\nD6 Generation at Gen Con 2017\n\u201cMythic Games is no slouch when it comes to producing excellent gaming experiences and they\u2019re ready to take everyone back in time with their latest game, Time of Legends: Joan of Arc. Words really cannot do the pieces justice.\u201d\nFresh Mana\n\u201csi le c\u0153ur est \u00e0 l\u2019affrontement, le c\u00f4t\u00e9 narratif suinte de toutes parts, envahit le gameplay pour proposer une exp\u00e9rience vibrante et forte, et donner des options significativement vari\u00e9es au joueur.\u201d\n\u201cIf the heart of the game is in confrontation, the narrative oozes in from all sides, and infuses the gameplay to provide a strong, vibrant experience that provides the players with significantly different options.\u201d\n VIDEOS IN ENGLISH\n             VIDEOS EN FRANCAIS\n            Joan of Arc uses a different scale from what is usually offered on Kickstarter, the Legendary Scale. This smaller but extremely accurate and detailed scale offers many advantages:\n- You can play on a normal sized table, and yet have a large area to cover and a wide variety of terrain types;\n- You can play, if desired, with a very large number of figures on each side; We can include complete and numerous 3D buildings: church, houses, trees, rocks, etc.\n- You can enjoy a dramatically impressive size difference between humans and creatures. Thus, our giants and monsters are really enormous... And our dragon has the actual size that this legendary monster should have.\nSize comparison : Odysseus (from Mythic Battles:Pantheon), Gilles de Rais, Crossbowmen & Angel.\nThe Time of Legends: Joan of Arc miniatures fall into three categories:\nHeroes\nJoan of Arc\nThese are figures known from the medieval period. They possess powers and can level up during an adventure or a battle.\nTroops \nHalberdiers\nThese are the basic units of armies. They are set in groups of 3 infantry models, 2 cavalry models, or 1 single model for exceptionally powerful beings such as angels, demons or dragons. They do not level up, but may possess powers.\nCharacters \nBishop\nThey represent professional bodies of medieval society: blacksmith, priest, merchant, diviner, shepherd, etc. They are always set in 1 single model and bring special powers to their allies, but can rarely fight and can not level up. They are neutral at first, and rally those who enter their zone. Some of them are called Protagonists and have a Discussion Deck. Only a Hero or a Character can discuss with a Protagonist.\nGog and Magog \n     Gog and Magog are two giants offered exclusively to all backers who have taken at least one Maiden Pledge (the Companion in Arms does not qualify), only during the time of this 31 days campaign. These \"Super Exclusive\" figures will only be available during the Kickstarter campaign, to thank the backers who supported us from the start. They will not be available during the Late Pledge, or during the Pledge Manager if you only pledged for less than a Maiden Pledge during the Kickstarter campaign, they will not be given or sold at convention or event.\nThese two terrifying heralds of the Apocalypse, foretellers of chaos and the end of time, possess devastating power on the battlefield.\nGog is poured into satanic magic, while the powerful Magog is a real killing machine. You will be able to play Gog and Magog in one of the proposed scenarios as well as in Battle mode, they are part of the Unholy Army.\nTo know more about God and Magog, read this update\n3D Scenery\nThe game offers a large number of buildings and elements of 3D terrain. They are not just eye candy, in fact they all have a real gameplay. Thus, they count in the occupation of the play areas, offering various bonuses/penalties and opening new scenaristic options. For example, praying in a church gives more Myth points than praying elsewhere and the presence of trees in a forest area allows the defender to roll a defence dice against ranged attacks. Buildings can be visited, searched, and offer defensive bonuses. The buildings are laid on cardboard floor plans. When miniatures penetrate inside a building, the building is temporarily removed to place the minis on the floor plans. When all the minis leave, the building is put back on the board to indicate that it is unoccupied.\nTerrain Tiles\nJoan of Arc is played on modular tiles, composed of large Hexagons divided into 1, 2 or 3 areas. Each area is a type of terrain (Forest, Plain, Field, Marsh, Village, etc.) that can accommodate elements of terrain and of course, miniatures!\nAn area taking up the whole hexagon can contain 8 elements (bases of miniatures or terrain elements).\nThis area is saturated, it contains 8 elements\nAn area taking a half hexagon can contain 6 elements.\nAn area taking one third of a hexagon can contain 4 elements\nThis area is saturated, the Tarasque counts as 4 elements.\nBattle Dashboard\nThe Battle Dashboard combines all the elements of the current game that are common to all players: available resources for the turn, Doom dice, river cards. You also lay down the miniatures that were put out of combat after a fight. These figures will return to the battlefield if the Doom dice is favorable to them... or leave it definitively to join the cemetery if fate falls on them!\nPlayer Dashboards\n Each player has their own dashboard that allows them to manage their resources: activation cubes, experience tokens and myth tokens. In his turn, the player spends them to activate his units (cubes), to pay the cost of a Myth or Tactic card he wants to play (tokens Myth/Tactic) or the leveling cost of the hero he wants to level up (Experience tokens). At the end of his turn, the player may decide to keep his resources in the spaces provided for this purpose.\nSpecial Dice\nDuring combat, the players roll dice of different colours, in attack and defence.\nWhite engravings mean that these dice can kill\nBlack engravings mean that these dice are disruptive\nRed dice are the most offensive dice.\nBlack dice are the most defensive dice.\nYellow dice are the dice of the special effects.\nWhite dice are the most balanced dice.\nCards\nEach unit of miniatures has its own card, placed on the table in front of the player so that he can consult at a glance its characteristics. Heroes can level up during the game by spending experience points.\nRules\nWe will be uploading a pdf of the rulebook soon.\n The European Union, USA, Canada and Australia zones will be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d: Backers from these countries will not suffer  import taxes.\nBased on our Mythic Battles: Pantheon experience, we will be charging shipping once the Kickstarter is over, based on the actual costs. We will collect the information via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. We will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in France (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), USA (The USA and the rest of the world), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers). The following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game Joan of Arc package that is roughly the same weight as Mythic Battles: Pantheon (5.25kg weight for core box + SG). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $25-$30 to most states. \nCANADA: $30-$35 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $100 to most countries. \nASIA: $40 to China and Hong Kong. $50 to most other countries. \nOCEANIA: $30 to Australia. $65 to New Zealand.\nEUROPE: $25-$30 to France. $25-$35 to most other countries. \nREST OF THE WORLD: $105.\nWe will do our utmost to ensure that your products arrive on time, before the public release of the game. However, we are aware that some problems concerning shipping and production may arise that are outside of our sphere of influence. The immense majority of backers will receive their game before the general release, but there are specific locations that might take much longer to get delivered, so we cannot guarantee that a 100% of our backers will receive their copy of the game before the general release, there might be a few of them who won\u2019t. We can, at least, guarantee that you will be benefitting from a great discount and many exclusive Kickstarter only features. The commercial version of the game will include a lot less material than the KS one. If these special contents and prices are not sufficient when compared to the risk of not being delivered on time, then we suggest that you do not participate in this crowdfunding campaign and acquire the game when it is released in shops.\nWHO WORKED ON THE PROJECT?\nFrom left to right: Irek Zielinski, Olivier Thill, Beno\u00eet Vogt, Jake Thornton, Leonidas Vesperini, David Rakoto, Christophe Madura, St\u00e9phane Gantiez, Erwann Le Torrivellec\n  Pascal Bernard, author of the game, in front of the \"Joan of Arc house\" in Orl\u00e9ans, the house in which Joan spent the night during the Siege of Orl\u00e9ans.\nOn top of the people from Mythic Games, a huge team of passionate professionals has worked on Joan of Arc.

Scholars say that the Arzians valued it above gold or silver, and wore it as a sign of wealth. Perhaps the rare substance holds forgotten secrets about the long-dead empire and their lust for power?\nThis is an expansion for the game Near and Far and requires Near and Far to play. \nAll reward tiers that include Near and Far: Amber Mines also include the Handy Headwear card promo pack (5 artifact cards) as a free bonus!\nNear and Far: Amber Mines is the first expansion to Near and Far. It includes modules that you can add or remove according to your preference. The modules are explained below:\nMore modules included in the stretch goals!\nThe above list includes stretch goal items that we have reached!\n       Learn how to play without the rulebook:\n Watch a game in action:\n  ITEMS AVAILABLE IN COMBO PACKS\nAlong with the brand new Amber Mines, now is your chance to pick up all the bells and whistles for Near and Far and Above and Below. (Note: These items are not add-ons, and are only available as part of existing reward tiers.)\n              Retail Version: The standard retail version of Near and Far: Amber Mines will have an MSRP of $24.99. It will include all stretch goals we reach here. It will not include the Handy Headware card promo pack.\nRulebook: Take a look at the prototype rulebook here.  \nChanging Backer Levels: For this project we are unable to change or accept alterations to the backer level rewards. Backers may, however, double their rewards by doubling their pledge amount (for example, $40 for two copies of Near and Far: Amber Mines, and then add shipping only once). Backers may not triple or quadruple their rewards, etc.  \nIt is possible that Near and Far: Amber Mines will be printed later by international publishers in various languages. Please take this into consideration when deciding if you would like to pledge. \nCan I add Above and Below to my pledge? We are unable to offer Above and Below in this Kickstarter project. Please support your favorite game store and purchase a copy there!\n    Rewards shipping to addresses within the US, EU, and Canada will be shipped from within the US, EU, and Canada.  \nInternational Shipping: As per Customs law, we cannot label the game as a gift for shipping. International shipments will be subject to customs charges depending on the country to which you are shipping.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my fourteenth Kickstarter project, and with each project, I could not have printed and produced them without the support of Kickstarter backers. We've worked for months testing and polishing Near and Far: Amber Mines. Much of the art is finished and the game is ready, but it won't see the light of day without the funds needed to see that the game is printed.\n\nThere are many other challenges to making sure this project is successful. Because of occasional unforeseen events, it is common for board game production to be delayed. I've done all I can to ensure that this game will be delivered on time if funded. Of course, delays can happen, but most of my projects have been delivered early.\n\nAnother challenge is making sure that all the files and rules are correct when sent to the printer. I've done the graphic design and artwork for many games. My experience helps me ensure a smooth pre-production process.\n\nWith your help, we can have the funds to print the game, overcome the various obstacles that are in the way, and make sure you are delivered a quality product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "SINGLE ITEM: Underforest Printed Book", "descp": "For Above and Below.
