[{"backer": "Stuart Bradley", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "I love to draw. The drawings I like best make me laugh. During the pandemic, I created two new jigsaw puzzles, Rogues Gallery and Lackluster Circus. If you get them now, you\u2019ll be ready for your next quarantine, house arrest, or hibernation.\nOodles of unpleasant characters covering some unpleasant wallpaper.\nRogues Gallery is a collection of framed portraits...peculiar characters covering a swath of curious wallpaper.\nLogically, the world's worst circus must be somewhere. Could this be it?\nLackluster Circus is a gaudy collection of traditional circus acts that have refined their performances to a modest level of mediocrity. And there are enough clowns to make any sane person queasy.\nWhat sponsors get. Your reward can be one puzzle or both. Each is a 1,000-piece puzzle that will measure 19.75\" x 27.5\" (50 cm x 70 cm) when you put it together. The puzzle pieces come in a reusable poly bag in a sturdy, two-piece box with a half-size cheat sheet to help you if you get stuck.\n********\nWhy a jigsaw puzzle? Puzzles are great because you can do them alone or with others. You get to set the pace. You can do the whole puzzle in one marathon session or drag the effort out over weeks. Solving a puzzle sharpens your cognitive skills and helps you learn to focus on details. Snapping a puzzle piece into position feels good and probably releases a flood of endorphins. How nice. And jigsaw puzzles don\u2019t require any batteries, instruction manuals, or wifi.\nGreat puzzles have something to look at on nearly every piece. Never any boring blank areas.\nWhat makes a puzzle great? I believe the best jigsaw puzzles have three vital qualities. First, lots of color. Next, oodles of details. No boring expanses of sky or snow. Last, a good puzzle is puzzling\u2014a little mysterious and full of false clues, duplicates, and distractions.\nI designed both of these puzzles to give you abundant colors, beguiling details, and mild mystery.\nHow difficult are these puzzles? Challenging, but not so exasperating that you will have to be institutionalized. Not as difficult as last year\u2019s Ocean Commotion puzzle.\nThe challenging Ocean Commotion puzzle (detail) is still available for the fearless.\nYou\u2019ll receive an overview of the whole image on the box base and the half-size cheat sheet, so you and a friend can both refer to the complete image while working on the puzzle. If you believe the puzzle is too easy, try solving it without referring to the cheat sheet. If it is still too easy, do it blindfolded.\nWhere are these puzzles going to be made? These puzzles will be made at Sarah's XZY puzzle workshop in China. (We know that sounds like a ridiculous, made-up name, but it\u2019s real.) Printed and bonded to specially made, heavy puzzle board to prevent delaminating and reduce paper dust. Housed in a sturdy clear poly bag and nestled in a robust two-piece box.\nPuzzles make good gifts...easy to wrap.\n\u201cDon\u2019s puzzles are always loaded with interesting and unexpected \u201d\n\u201cThese puzzles will make great gifts for folks with a high tolerance for nonsense.\u201d\n\u201cThe world would be a better place if more people stayed home and worked on puzzles.\u201d\n*******\nWhen can I expect these rewards? Assuming nothing calamitous happens, you should be enjoying these puzzles by September 2021. Probably sooner. \n********\nShipping. The cost of shipping is automatically added to your pledge based on if you live in the U.S. or Canada.\nJust the local neighborhood. We are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, once we ship all rewards, some extras of these jigsaw puzzles will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get Rogues Gallery and Lackluster Circus puzzles there.\nWho are these creatures? Do any remind you of anyone in your circle of family or friends?\nCustoms. Sometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected seemingly by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring your jigsaw puzzles during their next trip.\nTracking number. You will receive a tracking number when we ship, so track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\nFulfillment is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nPlenty of diverting details to entertain you.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects, including previous jigsaw puzzles, are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com.

With white paisleys on a dignified gray background, these bandanas will be 100 percent cotton printed right here in the good-old USA using duplex printing like the quality bandanas I grew up with.

We like to invent fun and useful things. Launching this project on Kickstarter, We want to bring Clobe out to the world successfully!\n Desk accessory that imitates the planet earth\nPut it on your desk and see how the world is turning. Clobe is super functional desk accessory that you can only meet here on Kickstarter.\n\n As you know, the Earth rotates once a day on its axis. And the sunlight always covers half side of the planet rotating. The core design concept is to describe the sunlight reflecting on the Earth so that we can see where is in daytime, where is in nighttime, time, season, some kind of natural phenomenons all at once.\n\n Also it can charge devices like smart phones, earbuds with high performance wireless charger module in it.\n24 O'Clocks\n\nGet Informed \nClobe is first designed as clock. However, it shows you not only the time but also date, temperature, humidity which we want to see in our life so frequently. Just tap the right corner of the screen to see what you want.\n\n\nWorld Clock \n Turn the globe to see the time of a specific city you want to know. Let the city face forward then the time being shown will automatically change.\n\n Almost every capital cities and some popular cities are here. All the cities are in specific time zones that are divided by UTC(Universal Time Coordinated) from -11 to +12. However, a few cities don't use the time zones where they are in. In that case, they have their own time zone given in brackets after each name.\n\n\nThe seasons are always changing\nThe Earth rotates about an imaginary line that passes through the North and South poles of the planet. This line is called the axis of rotation and tilted about an angle of 23.5 degrees relative to our orbital plane - the plane of Earth's orbit around the Sun.\n\n When the Earth orbits with the tilted axis of rotation everywhere except the equatorial regions takes different amount of energy from the Sun everyday. That is why the seasons are changing.\n\n\nWireless Charger\nQC 2.0/3.0 adapter is required. Otherwise, charging system will be unable.\n10W charging mode for Galaxy series\n7.5W charging mode for iPhone series\n5W charging mode for other devices\nNon-slip rubbers on charging bed\nCharging bed dimension : 140mm/5.5in * 88mm/3.5in * 30mm/1.2in which fits every smart phone and also AirPods\n\n\n4 brightness levels\nIt's mood light\n Clobe is designed to look like the real Earth in real time. The light inside describes the sunlight reflected from the Earth in universe. The light keeps rotating once a day and changing the angle according to the date.\n\nImagine when you are lying on the bed in your room and there is a Clobe mildly glowing on the desk at night. This is a beautiful Mood Light. Of course, you can easily turn ON/OFF the light by tapping it or your smart phone.\nBrightness is adjustable within 4 levels.\n\n\nSettings\n You can adjust time, date with control buttons behind or your smart phone via Bluetooth. Once you have done it, Clobe remembers the data with a mercury cell in it so that you don't need to do that again even after it loses power.\n\nYou can also adjust the brightness of the globe and information screen.\n\nDST, date format(yy/mm/dd), 12h/24h format set them all with your preference.\n\n\nColor temperature is also adjustable.\n3000K / 4000K/ 5000K/ 6000K\n\n\nCharging adapter is not included\n It works with 5V/1A adapter if you don't need to charge any other devices. If you want to charge you need to use QC2.0/3.0 adapter.\n\nWhat you can do with smart phone via Bluetooth :\nTime & Date Setting\nTurn On/Off mood light\nAdjust brightness\nDST(Daylight Saving Time) On/Off\nPlay with the light\n\n\nAU$1 is about US$0.74\nShipping\nUS, Australia : AU$20\nThe rest of the world : AU$22\nRewards don't include additional duty and taxes that may be charged as per local laws of importation.\n\n\nWhat's in the box\nCharging adapter will not be provided. To charge any other devices, QC2.0 or QC3.0 adapter is necessary.\nColor options are DARK GREY, WHITE, BROWN. The selection will be asked after this project ends. White is with yellow LEDs.\nSuper Early Bird will get the first delivery.\n\n\n\nCan it be operated in a cordless mode? No it can't. Sorry for the confusion by images. It doesn't have a battery in it not to increase the cost.\n  How long is the USB A to C cable included? It's 1.5m long. Or 59in.\n  How is the texture? Matt and soft. We could not demonstrate as perfectly as it is because we are not experts in camera... Sorry. However, it's definitely high-quality. Not toyish.\n  Are the time zone lines correct? The vertical lines on the globe are simplified version of the time zone lines which is kind of zigzag in real life. Though they are not the same, you can get the accurate time of a specific city if you know its time zone.\n  Is the brightness of the dot-matrix adjustable too? Yes. You can adjust either the light in globe and the dot-matrix separately.\n  Showing mode : The light in the globe can move as you want by a smartphone application regardless the time and date. It will be fun!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first crowdfunding project in our career so we can not be 100% sure about everything that will come in the future.

We have already inspected and approved the pre-production prototypes. So fabrication can start as soon as the project reaches its funding goal.\nBoth bags will be produced at Bella\u2019s textile workshop in China. She and her team do great work and have delighted us with their prototypes.\nPack your bags and you\u2019re ready to go.\nWhat the critics are saying\nBoth bags look great.

Brilliant.\n*******\nHandles over shoulder leaves hands free for fighting zombies.\n********\nExcellent gifts for anyone contemplating an exit.\n*******\nShipping. The cost of shipping will be added to your pledge based on where you live. Because shipping is restricted during the Covid-19 pandemic, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, when global trade is restored, some extras of these bags will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get Skedaddleosaurus Bags there.\nSometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you dinosaurs during their next trip.\nIf you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home. \n Shipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\n Leftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. A good place to find some unusual gifts.\nDon Moyer, Pittsburgh, May 25, 2020", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project is using established production methods\u2014textile printing, cutting, sewing, etc. We don\u2019t need to quarry any unobtanium or invent anti-gravity devices. The design of both bags is complete and I\u2019ve already tested prototypes, so we are good to go. The most likely threat is some unanticipated obstacle in the production schedule that will slow us down. Perhaps insidious microbes will disrupt global supply chains or manufacturing capacities will be diverted to produce hazmat suits. Who knows? I\u2019ve built extra time into the schedule to accommodate mild disruptions. But biggies could surprise us all.

After previous four playing card projects (modestly successful due to the support of our backers) that were entirely focus on the theme of change and transformation, we decided to explore something different - street graffiti. We have always been interested in street culture, which Flagrant Agenda started off with, particularly graffiti and how it can be use as an medium to make a point. After at least two unsuccessful attempts to come up with a concept and design that we are pleased with, we stumbled upon MILTZ.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nMILTZ https://miltz.myportfolio.com is a young and talented graphic artist from Japan and we are particularly intrigued with his project, Shibuya Bluffiti. The juxtaposition of negativity associated with graffiti and the possible normalization of graffiti as a part of a neighbourhood and the modern interpretation of a traditional lettering style showed us a new way of looking at graffiti - graffiti does not have to always be counter culture and anti establishment. While change usually happens by going against the norm, it can also happen by working within a system.\nThis collaboration between us and MILTZ has taken in quite unexpected directions with very fascinating bouncing of ideas and crafting of visual elements to be included in the deck. May we present the Edo Karuta Playing Cards. \nThe aesthetic mainstay of Edo Karuta is the ubiquitous Edomoji, Japanese typographic and lettering styles that were invented and vastly popular during the Edo period. They are primarily used for advertising and branding in the various trades that sprung up during the prosperous epoch before the advent of modern Japan. You can still see many traditional Japanese brands using Edomoji in their marketing efforts. Walk by any Japanese restaurants and you will bound to see banners with Edomoji written on them. In Edo Karuta, these typographical elements are superimposed onto each other to make up interesting and visually arresting motifs, the signature style of MILTZ that we saw in his Shibuya Bluffiti project. You can see these representations most clearly in our card backs. \nThe pips are stylized motifs of the 4 seasons\nThe Edo period of Japan was chosen, or shall we say, fallen upon us as the thematic mainstay of Edo Karuta. Edo period can be considered the golden age of pre-industrial Japan. The Pax Tokugawa that was enabled by the unification of Japan by the Tokugawa Shogunate allowed for unprecedented economic growth as well as the flourishing of arts and other cultural pursuits. However, the Edo period was also characterized by isolationalist outlook and the cementing of strict societal hierarchy that lead to what some say as a general slow-down of industrialization. The Edo Period  ended with the arrival of the external powers that the Tokugawa regime cannot resist which lead to a modernization spur.\nThe aesthetic and thematic mainstay bring us back one full circle in terms of change. Edomoji symbolizes the merchant class, the beneficiary of the Pax Tokugawa and the catalyst for change due to the upset of the social order - on the surface of the system, all is rosy but change is already set in motion by the actions within the system. Alas, the last straw usually comes from outside the system, in this case, black ships appearing over the horizon.\nTuck Case  \nMeaning of the stylized edomoji on our tuck case\nCard Back \nThe thick border of our card back with MILTZ's signature superimposition of two different edomoji scripts\nPLAY\n\nPrimary Joker\nThe Aces\nEach of the aces include a haiku, short, 3-phrases poems based on the four seasons from Matsuo Bash\u014d (\u677e\u5c3e\u82ad\u8549, 1644\u20131694), recognized as the greatest of all haiku masters.\nThe 4 haiku and their rough English translations:\n\u2663 \u6625 (Spring) | \u6625\u3082\u3084\u3084\u6c17\u8272\u3068\u3068\u306e\u3075\u6708\u3068\u6885 | After a long winter, plums began to bloom. The moon has come.\n\u2666 \u590f (Summer) | \u99ff\u6cb3\u8def\u3084\u82b1\u6a58\u3082\u8336\u306e\u5302\u3072 | Although it is the season of the flower of Tachibana, Suruga-road smells of tea.\n\u2665 \u79cb (Autumn) | \u671d\u8336\u98f2\u3080\u50e7\u9759\u304b\u306a\u308a\u83ca\u306e\u82b1 | A monk is drinking tea in the garden in the morning. Chrysanthemums bloom in front of their eyes.\n\u2660 \u51ac (Winter) | \u521d\u96ea\u3084\u6c34\u4ed9\u306e\u8449\u306e\u305f\u308f\u3080\u307e\u3067 | The first snow has fallen. The snow piles up on the daffodils, and the leaves are bent.\nCourt Cards\nThe court cards feature subtle differences when view from different orientation with the graphical differences inspired by how the characters' lives and personalities have changed throughout their lifespan. The overall illustration is based on ukiyo-e motifs, poses and animal mascots with bold visual arrangements and liberal use of colours.\nTokugawa Ieyasu, the founder and first shogun of the Tokugawa Shogunate. Tokugawa Yoshimune, the eighth shogun and considered to be the best shogun in Tokugawa Shogunate\n\nTokugawa Tsunayoshi, the fifth shogun, also widely known as the 'dog shogun' for his love of dogs\nTokugawa Yoshinobu, the last of the Tokugawa shoguns\nYoshino, highly accomplished courtesan who was conferred the highest rank of Tayu\nKasuga no Tsubone, influential female politician in early Tokugawa shogunate that contributed greatly to the stabilization of the new regime\nKatsushika Oi, consummate female painter in the style of ukiyo-e\nTenshoin Atsuko, official wife of the 13th shogun and key figure in the peaceful transition of Edo period to Modern Japan\nHattori Masanari, head of Tokugawa founder's castle guards\nHoninbo Shusaku, Go master and nicknamed the 'Invincible' for his 19-game undefeated winning streak\nRaiden Tameemon, legendary Sumo wrestler\nHijikata Toshizo, the last chief of the special squad, Shinsengumi, formed by the shogunate to protect its interest in the final days of the Edo period\nSecondary Joker \nEDO KARUTA features:\nTwo colour schemes - The red/white Daimyo deck and the black/gold Shogun deck\nPrinted by United States Playing Card Company\nTraditional cut and magic finish\nAvailable in 2 editions - the Basic and the Special\nPremium metallic ink for Shogun deck\nFully customized seal\nFor Basic - a classic Bicycle deck with a standard tuck case\nFor Special - custom pressed tuck case with special deck sleeve.\nThe Special Edition of both Daimyo and Shogun deck come with a custom design tuck case and deck sleeve. As the artwork for Edo Karuta fills all available space in a deck, the tuck case and deck sleeve are modified to showcase the inner tuck case and deck sleeve artwork while maintaining the structural integrity of the deck. \nYou can see the prototype of rendering of the tuck case and deck sleeve below for both Daimyo and Shogun deck. The tuck case is open from the front, thus allowing the whole of the inner tuck artwork to be seen. The middle portion of the tuck case, when opened, is also hollowed, which allows the card back to be seen immediately when the tuck case is open. When cards are removed, the rest of the inner tuck case artwork will be revealed.\nSticker seal for the Daimyo Special Edition will be printed on foiled paper\nThe stylized edomoji (\u8ced\u535a\u5c01) on the sticker seal refers to the ban on gambling during the Edo period. Ironically, underground gambling and creative ways to overcome the prohibition flourished. We toyed with the alternative meaning of the phrase, \u5c01, also meaning 'seal',  to put in on the sticker seal.\nArtwork of the outer and inner deck sleeve for Daimyo Special Edition\nSticker seal for Shogun Special Edition will be printed on textured paper\nArtwork of outer and inner deck sleeve for Shogun Special Edition\nAs part of our decks, we will also be rolling out custom minted coins as add-ons. Previously, we had Agenda EDC Coins as part of our playing cards campaigns. We think of coins as an natural extension of what we did with playing cards as they are related to playing cards in spirit as they are both are used by magicians in variety of tricks, collected vehemently by collectors, and, are instruments of chance. \nEdo Karuta Coin will again be a high quality offering that we have and help us provide a different, more durable and tactile way to express our ideas. We are hoping to again ride on the wave of the EDC (Every Day Carry) movement where coins are an integral and essential part of the movement and present opportunities for our ideas to be carry around and ponder upon every time the coins are being handled.\n  Six Different Finishes for Edo Karuta Coin\n6 different finishes from left to right - Antique Silver, Satin Gold, Black Nickel, Antique Copper, Antique Brass, Antique Gold\nThe Edo Karuta Coins will be die struck out of of a base brass material by CoinsforAnything and are 2\u201d (approx. 50mm) in diameter. The coins will come in 6 finishes \u2013 Antique Silver, Antique Gold, Antique Copper, Antique Brass, Satin Gold and Black Nickel \u2013 and will feature smooth edges. All coins will be minted in USA.\nFUNDING GOAL // SGD$22,000 \nSTRETCH GOAL 1 // SGD$25,000 <CRUSHED PREMIUM STOCK>\nFor add-ons, you need to be already pledging for a reward.\nClick on \u2018Manage your pledge\u2019 and under the pledge amount of the reward you pledge, increase the amount accordingly to each of the add-ons price (see below).\nHelp us with this process by dropping us a message after you have adjust your pledge to include the add-ons with the details of your add-ons.\nRespond to the post campaign survey asking you for the details of your add-ons. If you have any question, do feel free to drop us a message as well.\n Group 1 Countries include US, SG, HK, UK, JP, DE and AU.\nEdo Karuta Coins are available in six different finishes.\nFlagrant Agenda started off in 2014, focusing on street fashion and serving as an outlet to express ourselves on issues that we feel strongly about. We have, since launching our first project in Kickstarter in 2017, transited to being a lifestyle label and exploring a wider range of apparels and products. A strong focus on graphics and illustrations with a contemporary and urban overtone continues to be our modus operandi.\nOur apparels and products are strongly driven by issues related to our surroundings, the environments we grew up in, what we encounter in our everyday lives and the society at large. On the fun side, we enjoy experimenting how these issues and themes can be realized visually. On the reflective end, we seek fulfilment in understanding how people who grew up and live in different cultures interpret these themes and gaining insights into similarities and differences in the way how people think.\nWe are grateful for all the support that we have gotten for the 3 projects that we have launched so far on Kickstarter - Agenda Playing Cards V1, Mini Agenda Playing Cards, Agenda Playing Cards Redux and Agenda Playing Cards Facade. Kickstarter is a wonderful platform that have extended our capacity to experiment with our ideas in ways that we could not have done before and, of course, provide platform to reach all of you who have supported us. On that note, we will continue to strive to explore and improve the way we bring our ideas to life.\nFollow on Instagram\nFollow on Twitter\nLike the Facebook page", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk to any project now is the ever changing situation related to COVID-19.

If the situation deteriorates, we promise to refund all the pledges and hope for a better time to relaunch our project.\n\nIf the project is going ahead, we sincerely seek your understanding if there is any minor hiccups along the way.

Del Fiore. Tangled decorations balance the rationality of the geometric shapes and stylized architectural elements complete the composition.\nFlorentia Antica Ace of Hearts, back and box.\n\"Florentia Nova instead was born as a free and dynamic artistic expression, without constraints or fear of the contrasts between ancient (or classical) and modern.\"\nThe back design combines a clean geometric basis with dynamic elements. Its beating heart is the coat of arms of the Medici family, which is supported by two cherubs and surrounded both by a dancing ribbon and a laurel leaves frame.\nFlorentia Nova Ace of Hearts, back and box.\nFrom the sketch to the final Ace of Spades of Florentia Nova.\nThe Jokers of Florentia Antica are Giotto, one of the most famous Italian painters and architects (legend says he was able to draw a perfect circle by hand) and the \"Marzocco\", the heraldic lion and symbol of the city of Florence.\nThe Jokers of Florentia Nova are Leonardo Da Vinci - he needs no introduction: a 360\u00b0 genius in many fields - and the \"Porcellino\" (Italian \"piglet\"). This figure is the main subject of THE Florence fountain par excellence, which is linked to good fortune according to a special popular tradition that will be soon presented in our project updates.\nThe court cards of Florentia Antica and Florentia Nova are all different... and definitely full of surprises.\nA comparison between the KoC of Florentia Antica and Florentia Nova, Dante Alighieri and Giovanni dalle Bande Nere.\nA comparison between the QoH of Florentia Antica and Florentia Nova, inspired by sculptures made by Bartolini (from Prato) and Cecioni (from Florence).\n\nIt has become a tradition for Passione Playing Cards to produce a luxury double-deck tuck case, shaped like a book, which is a work of art in its own. Florentia Aeterna will hold both Florentia Antica and Florentia Nova cards together in a limited, hand-numbered edition.\nFlorentia Aeterna double tuck case.\nFlorentia Aetena back and front view, plus a detail of the art print.\nThe Florentia Aeterna (eternal, timeless) tuck case is the evolution of Acheronte and Pinocchio double boxes and will be printed by Archivio Tipografico in Italy (see Business Partners section) on very special stock. Whoever has acquired one of our previous double boxes already knows what to expect (top quality!) However, more information will be disclosed during the campaign.\nFlorentia Aeterna double tuck-case uncut sheet.\nAs a special feature, the uncut sheet shows a frame that would normally be cut.\n\nFlorentia Fine Art Prints enhance the quality and the detail of the illustrations which substantiate the decks. Printed on luxury paper, hand-numbered (only 99 available!) and signed by the author, the limited art prints are conveniently included in the top tiers (see the Rewards Description section).\nFlorentia Fine Art Print.\nFlorentia Fine Art Prints are 35cm x 50cm. Letterpress technique will be used to print them.\n  Details of Florentia Fine Art Print.\nBut now let\u2019s have a closer look at the two main decks.\nFlorentia Antica represents a classical and elegant vision of Florence. Touches of gold enrich the detailed black and white illustrations.\nDepicted in Florentia Antica, you can find important historical figures from Florence; as concerns the all custom aces, they represent some of the most iconic sculptures and monuments that you'd admire when visiting Florence \u2013 especially the so-called 'Loggia dei Lanzi'.\n  Hearts and Clubs of Florentia Antica.\nDiamonds and Spades of Florentia Antica.\n\nFlorentia Nova somehow represents the blooming of the Renaissance: innovation, dynamism, and freshness are the keywords. Unexpected neon touches add a modern look to the cards.\nDepicted in Florentia Nova you can find important historical figures from Florence; as concerns the all custom aces, they represent some of the most iconic sculptures and monuments that you'd remember after visiting the Italian city.\nHearts and Clubs of Florentia Nova.\nDiamonds and Spades of Florentia Nova.\nFlorentia Aeterna will be printed on cotton paper with gold foil and hot impression. The limited-edition tuck box will be hand-made in Italy by letterpress experts. \nFlorentia Aeterna double tuck case.\nThe following image is a rendered version of the Florentia Aeterna uncut double tuck case. You will be able to order it as an add-on item as well or find it conveniently included in the top rewards.\nFlorentia Aeterna tuck case.\nThe two decks are doubly protected: first with a wide lid that \"closes the book\" and then with two individual flaps.\nThe outer lid of the Florentia Aeterna double-deck reveals the individual illustrated flaps.\nThe double tuck case opens like a book and shows a technical drawing inspired by Santa Maria del Fiore.\nTo better understand the content of each tier, please check the following table.

Meanwhile, friction between Dr Frederick Treves and his friends comes to a head over his disastrous dabblings in the dark arts, and old enemies make an unwelcome return.\nAs always, thanks to our returning backers for your continuing support, we couldn't do this without you. And if you're new to our comic, a warm welcome to the sensational adventures of The Elephantman, the most remarkable human being ever to draw the breath of life! \nPuppets is a perfect jumping on point for new readers, but you can also check out the series from the beginning by downloading issue #1 for FREE.\nISSUE #9 PREVIEW\nCheck out the cover for issue 9, and the opening pages, all drawn by Luke. If you love them as much as we do, the artwork is available as pledge rewards.\nISSUE #10 COVER\nISSUE #11 COVER\n\nTHE WORLD OF MERRICK\nMerrick: The Sensational Elephantman is a Victorian penny dreadful pulp adventure comic set in 1880s' London. Based on a fictional version of the life of Joseph Merrick, it steps between historical facts and turn of the century folklore juxtaposed with the superhero comic conventions of super powers, masks, secret identities and fantastic adventures.\n\n\n\nQUALITY COMICS\nIf you've encountered any of our physical issues of Merrick I'm sure you have noticed the print quality and the nice distinctive feel they have, it's something we feel really passionate about.\nWe're striving to make every issue of Merrick something special, an item that you will want to keep. These are not disposable comics.\nBoth issues are beautifully presented, full colour, standard US size comics printed on heavy stock 120GSM uncoated bond paper. Issue #9 is 24 pages, #10 is 20 pages, #11 is 28 pages, all plus covers.\nAs with all single issues of Merrick, issue's #9 - #11 will be limited numbered runs of 500 never to be reprinted with the same cover.\nA maximum of 2 print runs for each issue.\nAll single issues are shipped bagged and boarded to ensure they reach you looking as great as they went out.\nWe'll also send you digital versions of each issue in .pdf and .cbr formats so you can enjoy issues of Merrick on the move on your tablet, smartphone or PC.\nAlthough issue #1 of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman is completely sold out, there is still a chance to build an impressive collection of single issues by picking up copies of #2 - #8 with less than 60 copies of Merrick #2 left!\nDon't worry about missing any of the story, you can download issue #01 in .PDF/.CBR absolutely free. \nGetting up to 11 issues is a huge achievement for any comic series. We're super excited to be making more books. Everything we've published to date is available on this Kickstarter.\n\nTHE TEAM\nTom Ward: Writer and creator of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman. Tom is also co-creator and writer of Doc Dino and has been published in Comichaus, The Grime, British Showcase Anthology and has a story in Rum Row later this year. @highbrowtrash  \nLuke Parker: Artist, colourist, designer and co-creator of Merrick: The Sensational Elephantman. You may have also seen his work on SEX, or The Winternational (Image Comics), or Halloween Eagle (Dark Horse Comics). @artofparker www.artofparker.com \nMicah Myers: As a freelance comic book letterer, Micah has lettered a host of comics for Image, Dark Horse, IDW, and many more. @micahmyers\nClare Lenton: Freelance editor and senior content designer, with a Masters degree in English Literature, specialising in Gothic literature. @ClareLenton\nTHANK YOU\nThanks to the amazing Kickstarter community, we have been able to create and release the first 8 issues of Merrick, a one-shot spin-off; Treves: A Restless Night and a special cross-over issue; Merrick & Crowe: Birds of Prey. \nWe love making this comic, and we think it keeps getting better as a series as we learn and improve as creators, and we have you guys to thank for that for giving us these opportunities.\nNow it's time to continue Joseph Merrick's story so we've returned to Kickstarter to hopefully fund the fourth arc.\nAll our books, plus prints and t-shirts, are available at our webstore www.merrickcomic.co.uk or digitally over at Comixology. \nWHAT THE REVIEWS SAY\n\"In each issue, you can feel the love, sweat, and tears the team put into their work. Although the art and some story beats take inspiration from Mike Mignola and some Hellboy, it stands apart creating its own history in indie comics, and it'll carve out its own slice in your heart and brain, making you crave more of the world.\" - www.comicbookyeti.com\n\"the art and story in Merrick grows with confidence in every issue and with each arc Ward and Parker find their voice more and more \u2013 as well as feeling free to experiment with where the story is heading. The artwork also becomes more imaginative and iconic (and less derivative), with Parker creating this dark and angular style which manages to perfectly evoke Victorian London, but also has a modern edge to it at the same time. A book that really definitely deserves the use of the word sensational!\" -www.pipedreamcomics.co.uk\n\"Merrick started off as a character surrounded by myths who I felt I had half an idea of where this adventure could go \u2013 but the creative team have surprised me time & again and that\u2019s made me come back to the title to re-read, rediscovery and enjoy.  A great character that has been filled up with endless potential thanks to Tom & Luke and eight issues in there\u2019s still so much more for it to give.  Can\u2019t wait for issue nine and beyond.\" - ComicsAnonymous", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not my first, second, or indeed third rodeo, this is my EIGHTH Kickstarter.\n\nI have delivered on all my previous projects, and things are a fairly well oiled machine at this point. The art for issue #9 is already completed, and will be heading to be lettered as I type this.\n\nI've scheduled in plenty of breathing room on the completion date and I will always keep you updated on our progress.\n\nI love making this comic, it really is a passion project for me and I am 100% dedicated to getting it finished and out to you all.\n\nObviously the COVID-19 pandemic is currently making things somewhat unpredictable. Currently the UK post offices are still open and our printer is still working, but these things could change. Digital issues will of course go out as they are ready.

My sketchbooks are filled with silly things that I like to draw. A few months ago I found myself drawing apes as they would appear in the line waiting to get through airport security. Wouldn\u2019t that make a marvelous jigsaw puzzle?\nWhy a jigsaw puzzle? Puzzles are great because you can do them alone or with others. You get to set the pace. You can do the whole puzzle in one marathon session or drag the effort out over weeks. Solving a puzzle sharpens your cognitive skills and helps you learn to focus on details. Snapping a puzzle piece into position feels good and probably releases a flood of endorphins. How nice. And jigsaw puzzles don\u2019t require any batteries, instruction manuals, or wifi.\nMore than 100 primates and a few aliens being extruded through the indignities of air travel.\nWhat makes a puzzle great? I believe the best jigsaw puzzles have three vital qualities. First, lots of color. Next, oodles of details. No boring expanses of sky or snow. Last, a good puzzle is puzzling\u2014a little mysterious and full of false clues, duplicates, and distractions.\nI designed the APES AND ALIENS puzzle to give you abundant colors, beguiling details, and mild mystery. \nHow big is the finished puzzle? There are 1,000 puzzle pieces. Once you put the Apes and Aliens puzzle together, it will measure 19.75\" x 29\" (50 cm x 70 cm).\nHow difficult is this puzzle? Challenging, but not so exasperating that you will have to be institutionalized. We included an overview of the whole image on the box lid and base, so you and a friend can both refer to it while working on the puzzle. If you believe the puzzle is too easy, try solving it without referring to the image on the box. If it is still too easy, do it blindfolded.\nPuzzles make great gifts because they are easy to wrap.\nWhere are these puzzles going to be made? These puzzles will be made at Sarah's XZY puzzle workshop in China. (We know that sounds like a made-up name, but it\u2019s real.) Printed on specially made, heavy puzzle board to prevent delaminating and reduce paper dust. Housed in a sturdy clear poly bag and nestled in a robust two-piece box with an image of the finished puzzle on both the lid and base. \nMy two previous jigsaw puzzles in Kickstarter were smaller. Now they are rare collectibles.\n*******\nShipping. The cost of shipping will be added to your pledge based on where you live. Because shipping is restricted during the Covid-19 pandemic, we are limiting rewards to residents of the U.S. and Canada only. Later, when global trade is restored, some extras of this puzzle will be available at our online store. So, anyone excluded from the Kickstarter project will be able to get puzzles there.\nSometimes, but not always, shipments to Canada get hit with customs duties. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your puzzles in their luggage next trip.\nIf you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are ready to ship, we\u2019ll send out a Kickstarter address survey. If you don\u2019t respond to that survey within 6 months, we\u2019ll assume you no longer want your reward. I don\u2019t have the space to hold your reward in perpetuity or until the cows come home.\nShipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhat\u2019s going on?

We have fully stretched the game to perfection unlocking 15 Stretch Goals along the way that have upgraded all of the components, added some additional backstory cards, some mini expansions, a solo mode and expanded the Art Forgery case into a deeper experience.  We are looking forward to supporting Lawyer Up with a bunch of new case expansions down the line!\nClick the 'Late Pledge' button above and you'll be able to pledge/pre-order via Gamefound. Remember, this option will only be available for a limited time so act fast!\nIf you miss the Gamefound.com pledgemanager, you can visit our online store at https://shop.rockmanorgames.com to place a preorder (or just buy the game if it's available)\nIf you have any questions, be sure to check the FAQ or our most recent Kickstarter updates before messaging us directly!\nMeticulously designed and developed by Samuel W. Bailey (Forbidden Stars, Talisman: Cataclysm) and Mike Gnade (Maximum Apocalypse, the Few and Cursed) over the last 4 years, Lawyer Up is an asymmetrical two-player courtroom drama card game where one player is the noble prosecution and the other the steadfast defense. Each game begins with the Discovery phase, where players draft vital evidence to support their case and bury evidence that might help their opponent. Next comes the Trial phase, where players call witnesses and play powerful arguments along with the evidence they drafted into their examination pools. To form a coherent line of questioning, players will need to chain together their cards by matching bias symbols. The player who can best examine the Witness by generating the most influence will spend the difference to sway the Jury to their side. Every game is different, but the lawyer with the best case and most convincing arguments will be sure to get the verdict they are after!\nThe core game includes the base decks for both the prosecution and defense along with all the other components (jurors, bias tokens, etc) you need to play any case of Lawyer Up.  The core set also features two unique cases to play: The Art Forgery Case and the Murder Case.\nThe Art Forgery Case is a shorter case (6 Witnesses instead of 9) that focuses on learning the arguments and procedures in the base Prosecution and Defense decks.  It is all about drafting the paintings from famous Dutch painters and using the right evidence to replay them from discard piles.\nThe Murder Case is your modern Law and Order murder trial.  Jessica Fairmount was found standing over her father, covered in his blood, but insists that she was only trying to save him. The wealthy socialite has a lot to gain with her father's murder, but did she do it? This case features major asymmetry between the Prosecution (who can lock jurors to their side) and the Defense. The Prosecution must get all the Jurors to believe she is guilty while the Defense only needs one Juror to believe in her innocence for reasonable doubt.  \nLawyer Up is divided into two phases, the discovery and trial phases.  The discovery phase is a drafting phase representing both attorneys working back at their offices going through all the evidence of the case. During this phase, players simultaneously draw 3 cards and add one card to their deck, one card to their opponents deck and bury the last card.  This means that every time that you play a case, your deck will be unique.\nPlayers will not only draft unique decks, they will also select their legal strategies and Witnesses.  The trial phase of the game is typically made up of 9 rounds of witness examinations. During this phase, players take turns calling witnesses and chaining together legal arguments fighting to win the witness and influence the jury.\nYou can only play cards from your hand that share at least 1 symbol with the card previously in your Examination.  You can't jump from legal argument to an emotional one, because that would confuse the jury.\nAs you win witnesses, the jury will be swayed more and more to your side.  Each case can have slightly different win conditions, but in general whoever wins the most witnesses will have the jury on their side and win the case.\nFor the first time ever, Rock Manor Games has two deep thematic expansions already developed and available as part of this campaign!  Each expansion offers up new mechanics and win conditions - while staying true to the drafting and easy to learn card play of the core game.\nBetween February 1692 and May 1693 more than two hundred people were accused of being witches in colonial Massachusetts. This case takes a look at this infamous time in America's history, where mass hysteria is taking hold of the judicial system.\nThe Witch trial features over 80 unique illustrations by Abigail Larson whose art beautifully captures the time period.  The Witch Trial does away with the jury and is instead lead by an angry mob who is ready to hang anybody they believe is a witch. The goal of the Prosecution is to hang 3 witnesses as witches before they run out of cards.  The defense is scrambling to keep the mob under control and prevent a full blown witch hunt!\nThis case transports you back to Atlantic City in the 1920s where Carmine Monacelli is put on trial for conspiracy to violate the National Prohibition Act.  Carmine is accused of operating a network of criminals involved in bootlegging, murder, gambling and more - but he's a powerful man in AC so it's going to take more than some Federal Prohibition Agents to take down this Godfather. \nThe Godfather expansion features over 80 unique illustrations by Nabetse Zitro and introduces a Dossier deck. As players win witnesses, they are able to reveal or discard the top card of the Dossier deck.  The prosecution needs to prove Carmine's Mafia connections by revealing these Dossier cards while avoiding the powerful criminal activities such as \"Jury Tampering\" and \"Swim with the Fishes\" that the defense has shuffled into the deck.  \nWhile these expansions are planned for retail release, we plan on spreading out their release over a few months.  Kickstarter backers will get everything first! well before any of it enters retail and distribution.\n Tons more previews in the playlist below!\nRetailers \nWe love to work with retailers from all around the world. Brick and Mortar Retailers who back at our retailer pledge will receive an early demo copy of the Art Forgery case to promote Lawyer Up in their store.  The demo copy will be ordered shortly after the campaign ends and produced in the USA with the Game Crafter (most of the videos above feature such a prototype).  The shipping associated with this pledge is for the prototype only.  All orders for the actual game will be handled outside of Kickstarter.\nSomeone from Rock Manor Games will contact you after the Kickstarter to help you with your personalized order.  Retailers are NOT required to pay for their orders upfront, we simply invoice you for your order and ask that you pay the invoice before Kickstarter fulfillment commences (~6 months later).\nIf you're an online retailer or simply not interested in contributing on Kickstarter, signup as a retailer here. We will email you closer to our retail release so that you can get Lawyer Up into your store.\nGroup Pledges\nWe do not have a specific Pledge Level for Group Pledges and plan on handling this in our Pledge Manager.  If you have a group of friends and are looking to pledge for at least 6 copies of Lawyer Up, message us on our website at rockmanorgames.com/contact and select the Subject \"Group Pledge\".  You will need to make sure you pledge for at least 1 base game here on Kickstarter and then we will import you as a group pledge into the pledge manager after the campaign is completed.\nWhen our pledge manager is sent out via email, you will be asked to fill in your address and you will be charged for shipping at that time.  You must fill out the pledge manager and pay for shipping to receive your reward.  We know that high shipping costs are the worst, so we are offering a $5 shipping discount to all of our Kickstarter Backers. Here are our estimated shipping costs for this project. Keep in mind these are just estimates based on our 2020 shipping rates and costs could change based on a variety of circumstances.\n1: Lower 48 States\n2: Canada, Hawaii and Alaska\n3: Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, and Switzerland\n 4: Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam \n 5: Rest of World does not include Afghanistan, Brazil, Bolivia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Niger, North Korea, Russia, South Africa, Syria, Somalia, Yemen. \nWe have key fulfillment partners in the US, Canada, Australia, China and the EU and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT. We have typically shipped EU rewards from a German depot. For this campaign, it's possible we may ship UK rewards from within the UK if necessary We'll make this decision as we get closer to fulfillment, based on the fees/customs/taxes after Brexit has occurred.  If you have any specific shipping questions before pledging, please message us on Kickstarter.\nAbout the Team\nGame published by Rock Manor Games, owned and operated by Mike Gnade.

I thought it was a typo and they added an extra zero.  After talking to 2 different UK fulfillment partners, I have discovered that not only was the quote correct but it's the result of some BREXIT policy changes with VAT calculation that start January 2021.  TLDR your government requires us to prepay 20% VAT on the MSRP.  That leaves us in the predicament of either shipping everything from the EU (and having you deal with VAT/customs/import etc) or figuring out a way to invoice and collect the VAT fees for each UK backer and then shipping from within the UK.  I'm currently investigating ways to best handle this unfortunate reality.  I feel the best result would be to figure out a way to invoice everyone in the UK for the VAT based on their order so it can ship UK friendly, but we could also just ship from the EU and see how it goes (no one really knows with BREXIT looming).

I recently retired from the United States Army.  I served two tours in Afghanistan and two in Iraq as an infantry officer.  I am frustrated by the poor outcomes of both those wars - in great part because we repeated the mistakes of Vietnam.  The Vietnam generation did a fantastic job of recording the lessons of that war in books; yet those books had little impact on Afghanistan and Iraq.  The purpose of this project is to transmit lessons from the war in Afghanistan to current and future generations through video. \nTo accomplish this, I will read The History of The Peloponnesian War, written by Thucydides, and consider how it applies to the Afghanistan War.  The History of The Peloponnesian War is divided into eight books, and I will make one video for each book.  In each video I will orient the viewer to the text and then I will let Thucydides' narrative draw out my experiences in Afghanistan.  By considering my combat tours through the lens of The History of The Peloponnesian War I will highlight some lessons that are relevant for future conflicts.  Below is my video from Book One of The History of The Peloponnesian War: \nWhat do you receive for backing this project?\nYou receive a subscription to my videos in a course format on the Teachable platform.  The teachable platform will enable you to watch the videos, read and download my notes on your web browser or on a phone app.  As a backer, you will receive an exclusive video not available to the general public and I will list you in the credits.  You will also receive any stretch goals that are unlocked - see the stretch goal section below.  Please be aware that I will make the core videos and notes available for free to the general public on YouTube, my website, and Facebook because I want to educate as wide an audience as possible about the war.\nWho was Thucydides?  \nThucydides was an Athenian General who fought in the Peloponnesian War, the great Greek conflict between Athens and Sparta that lasted twenty-seven years, from 431-404 BC.  He was defeated by Sparta and then exiled by Athens.  He wrote his military history of the war as it happened, taking advantage of his exile to throughly research events. Because of the rigor he applied to his research, many believe Thucydides, and not Herodotus, is the Father of History, or they refer to Thucydides as the Father of Scientific History.  He is considered one of the great military philosophers.  Check out this white board \"explainer\" video about Thucydides:  \nThucydides Testimonials\n Thomas Jefferson wrote to John Adams in 1812: \"I have given up newspapers in exchange for Tacitus & Thucydides, for Newton & Euclid; & I find myself much the happier.\"  Reference.\nGeneral of the Army George C. Marshall said in 1947: \"[I doubt] whether a man can think with full wisdom and with deep convictions regarding certain of the basic international issues today who has not at least reviewed in his mind the period of the Peloponnesian War and the Fall of Athens.\u201d  Reference.   \nStretch Goals\n FUNDED!!! $250 (funding goal) = Nine Videos & Notes.  If the project is funded you will receive access to the course that you purchased on Teachable  (Thucydides Ponders Afghanistan or Sun Tzu Ponders Afghanistan).  I expect to release them in early August.  Each course will include nine video talks and pdf notes to accompany them.    \n FUNDED! $500 = Google Earth Flyovers.  The geography of the Peloponnesian War can be confusing for modern readers.  If we reach this funding level I will produce eight google earth flyovers to highlight the key locations.  The flyover videos and KMZ files will be available in Teachable.  Check out my effort below (which will be much improved with funds for professional help!): \nPLAY\n\nFUNDED! $750 =  Maps.  If we reach $750, I will add nine maps to help clarify key parts of Thucydides' narrative.  These maps will be available in Teachable.\n FUNDED! $1,250 = Infographics.  At this funding level, I will add nine infographics to illustrate some of my takeaways from the Afghanistan War.  These infographics will be available in Teachable. \n $2,500 =  Podcasts.  If we reach $2,500, I will have someone(s) interview me about my video and record the interview.  The audio files will be available in Teachable, and I will also let you know where to find them on podcast software.\n $4,000 = Video Transcription to Podcast.  At this funding level, I will have the audio from my video transcribed into a podcast.  The audio files will be available in Teachable, and I will also let you know where to find them on podcast software.\n $5,500 = White Board Videos.  At this funding level, I will add nine white board videos to help explain key concepts from The Peloponnesian War or my lessons from Afghanistan.  These videos will be included in the Teachable course.  Below is an example that I made myself where I discuss a lesson from the Iraq War drawn out by Sun Tzu's The Art of War.\nAbout John Lemay\nI recently retired after serving 25 years and 7 months in the United States Army.  My career began at West Point and upon graduation I became an infantry officer.  I did two tours in Afghanistan and two tours in Iraq.

The Athenians sent a huge expeditionary force to conquer the island.  The Spartans responded by sending a very small force to rally the Sicilians against their invaders.  The result - the complete destruction of the Athenian Expeditionary Force - changed the course of the Peloponnesian War, eventually resulting in Sparta' victory.

But I believe that President Bush's speech on April 17, 2002 at the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) illustrates the basic US strategy for the following 19 years.  At that point US operations in Afghanistan had transitioned from CIA / Special Forces \"unconventional warfare\" to conventional warfare.  President Bush then made a speech at VMI, where George C. Marshall graduated from, on the occasion of awarding the George C. Marshall Award to ROTC Cadets, and then went on to compare the US occupation of Afghanistan with the post World War 2 Marshal Plan for Europe.  The US strategy was to prevent terrorists from using Afghanistan as a base for operations by creating a new Afghan government that was a Republic allied to the United States and equipping it with a military capable of controlling Afghanistan's territory.   To accomplish this the United States would implement a \"Marshal Plan for Afghanistan\".

Spartan strategy required two elements - controlling Attica with land forces and then controlling the Aegean Sea.  Sparta had the army to control Attica from the start of the war but it took them 27 years to achieve naval superiority in the Aegean.  In addition to building their own navy, they had to weaken Athens' navy.  There were two ways of doing this - the first was by winning naval battles.  But before the Athenian disaster in Sicily it was almost impossible for Sparta to defeat Athens at sea.  The second was by freeing Greek Cities from the Athenian Empire.  The Athenian Navy was enormously expensive and required the tribute of many Greek Cities to maintain.  It could be attritted by slowly depriving Athens of tribute."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #51", "update_userinfo": "Fear, Honor and Interest Infographic", "update_content": "Team,\nHere is the first Thucydides Infographic by Luis!

Sparta voted for war after Athens, which had an eastern facing empire that dominated the Aegean Sea, moved westward into the Ionian Sea.

The blue \"Joan of Arc\" deck is the first in a series of six famous decks we plan to release in 2020...  \nThe very first transformation deck issued by Cotta is from 1805. This deck is probably the most famous of all six, and is incredibly scarce. Original illustrations were fiddling artworks done by hand, on copper plates that were manually engraved with stipple and etching, and the cards were printed on linen period stock that was 97 mm x 69 mm in size, with blank card backs and squared corners at that time. Only the court cards were hand-colored, while the number cards used red stencils.\nCotta\u2019s transformation cards were very successful and became a role model for later transformation decks from other publishers. And since the card backs were blank, individual cards were sometimes used by the nobility as visit cards and for leaving messages, so these playing cards often became multi-purpose items.\nThere are many historical values in the series of decks! But if you are only interested in the deck details & images instead of history & backstory, then please skip about half way down.\n The story behind these playing cards, which probably conceal the most of the world's playing card secrets, begins in T\u00fcbingen, a city in southwest Germany.\nThe atmosphere here is bursting with memories and experiences of the past. Visitors today can still enjoy the small stairs, narrow alleys, and pointed gables that shape the silhouette of old T\u00fcbingen on the way to its famous castle. T\u00fcbingen is home to one of Europe\u2019s oldest universities and even today combines the colorful bustle of an university town full of students with the flair of a restored medieval center and a touch of many ancient cultures. The Romans already left some traces of their presence here in AD 85, but the city itself dates from the 6th or 7th century. Little wonder that this city attracted many eminent notables and artists, who found it inspirational for their work. \n The idea behind the concept of Cotta's transformation decks was to create a series of six decks on an annual basis from 1805-1811. Each deck would focus on a different theme, with the first set based on Schiller's play Jeanne d'Arc, which was about the famous historical figure Joan of Arc. \nForming a \"Card Almanac\" (Karten Almanach), each card in the deck would represent one of the 52 weeks in a calendar year. At the time it was popular to print various almanacs, which were special pocket books for the new year, and often included a short poem or quote for each week of the calendar year. It was a logical move to connect each of these 52 weeks with a playing cards.\nJohann Friedrich Cotta (*April 27, 1764 - December 29, 1832), publisher, industrial pioneer, and politician, the man at the helm of family publishing house J. G. Cotta (founded yet in late 17th century by his grandfather Johann Georg Cotta *1631 - 1692) from T\u00fcbingen, Germany, around 1804 went on to produce a series of six playing card almanacs in successive years from 1805-1811, with a new deck appearing in all but one of those years. \nIn addition to Johann Friedrich Cotta's high standing as a publisher, he was a man of great practical energy, which flowed into various fields of activity, he promoted even many reforms and supported talented individuals. It is also noticeable that in such period of his life he published numerous works of his own literature, political materials, and also yearbooks.\nCotta did have the goal of replacing the \"inelegant\" designs of contemporary German playing cards with a more artistic high-quality deck. But these playing cards were not intended for playing games with in the first place, but rather for stimulating discussion about the \"themed\" images on each of the cards. Each year the court cards were designed to represent another theme, while the number cards featured pictures that were largely independent drawings without a common topic, since they were especially intended as conversation pieces and depicted happenings.\nThe Cotta's famous house was the place, where among other brilliant German authors of the time, the works of Schiller and later of Goethe were published there in its journal pages, as well as journal's major contributor was Heinrich Heine, who with his early lyric poetry has inspired even composers such as Robert Schumann and Franz Schubert who set his works into music... \nSo the picture that emerges from this time in Cotta's life is that he was constantly engaged in thoughtful conversation with literary men, and enjoyed close friendships with leading figures of the day like Schiller, Huber, Gottlieb Konrad Pfeffel, and others, many of whose works he published.\nJohann Friedrich Cotta's long term friendship with the famous German poet, dramatist, philosopher, and historian Friedrich Schiller was well known. In 1795 Schiller and Cotta founded the Horen, a periodical that became important for students of German literature. Schiller's goal was to use his work to infuse higher ideas into the common lives of men, by giving them a nobler human culture, and \u201cto reunite the divided political world under the banner of truth and beauty.\u201d It was as a result of this relationship that Goethe became part of a close circle of friends with Cotta and Schiller. Even today there is evidence at Cotta's house of Goethe having slept there. \nIt is probably this friendship that gave birth to the idea of creating a unique decks of transformation playing cards with the purposes of igniting discussion about the \"themed\" picture on each card. This was after all a time when people were open to such ideas, and producing a series of playing cards as almanacs for a continuous period of years was a natural development.\nWith help from you the backers we plan to produce the entire 6 deck series! The color of each tuck box created by Azured Ox has been inspired by Goethe's experimental optic and color theory, since Goethe was an important contemporary of Cotta, along with Schiller. (Goethe's deepest immersion into colors was during Cotta's decks issuing.)\nLimited Edition Decks\nStandard Edition Decks\nGoethe\u2019s spent years on his theory (built on wavelength theory of light broken into 7 colors demonstration after Newton), which became a personal obsession in his last years, and which he considered more important than his literary works.\nGoethe believed that colors arise from the interaction between light and darkness, light and dark edges along the spectrum; that colors are realities, phenomena of nature... His color theory was intended to be a paradigmatic model for natural science in general, and Goethe was concerned with the psychological effects of each color, as well.\nHe believed that colors symbolize different values and that colors have a clear effect on the mind and feelings. Goethe had little use for concepts of divinity or for systematic thinking. His theory formulated a psychological and philosophical account of the way we actually experience color as a phenomenon.\nMuch of historical happenings, influences and activities would later find a place in the Cotta decks, including events in the life of Cotta's own family and of notable figures like Schiller and Goethe. Other important influences include the literature, art, history, politics (e.g. Napoleon's invasion), and religious reforms of the time, which all served as an important context to shape the art in the decks themselves. \nFor example, Schiller experienced a grave illness that led to his death, and this around as well as many more is even depicted in the playing cards from the Cotta decks. In short, there is significant evidence of such connections between the artistic pictures and the immediate context that produced them.\nIt is especially significant for the way it displays meaningful and inspirational happenings from the time; in this first deck, such as Schiller on his death-bed (Six of Clubs) or sadness of Goethe (probably depicted on Nine of Clubs), assumed depictions from life of noble families, etc...\n First almanac deck: Jeanne d'Arc (Year 1805) \nThe images on the court cards are characters inspired by Schiller's play \"Die Jungfrau von Orleans\" (\"Joan of Arc\"). \nThe central figure of Joan of Arc is depicted as the Queen of Spades, the Maid of Orleans who inspired the French army to victory, but was later burned at the stake.\nFeatures:\nPrinted by USPCC on Classic Stock\nPoker Size\nEmbossed Finish\n52 Cards + 2 Extra Jokers + 2 Extra Collectible Cards\nMetallic Ink On Box & Backs\nCustom Numbered Seals\nPuzzle Image on all Tuck Spines of the Series\nDigitally Hand-Recreated and Designed by Azured Ox\n Produced By Will Roya \nCotta's first deck was designed by Countess Mary Day von Jennison-Walworth (sometimes spelled with a single `n'). Her maiden name was Beauclerk, and she was the wife of Count Francis Jenison Walworth (1764\u20131824). She was an illegitimate (twin) child who led a very colorful life, and finally settled down somewhat after marrying Count Francis in 1797. (Probably, she was creating illustrations in Stuttgart.)\nWe are limiting this 1st deck to only 1,000 copies with numbered seals. We may print a small amount additional decks without seals to meet demand or for a special edition. \nThe entire 6 deck series is in many ways designed by Azured Ox to meet collector's demand (as \"collection of historical books\") and will be produced with the piece of puzzle image on each tuck spine (left side of box) to create together nice display of the Tuebingen monument surroundings, where the idea for Cotta's decks was born. \nThe publisher's name was placed on the Ace of Clubs as follows: \"A Tubinge chez J. G. Cotta, Libraire.\"\nThe transformations on the number cards have no reference to each other or to the court cards (as well lots of them might be considered as unexplained mystery).\nThe court cards were designated with the words \"Valet\", \"Dame\", and \"Roi\", which are the French terms corresponding to the Jack, Queen, and King.\nIn the first deck, beside Joan of Arc depicted as the Queen of Spades, other individuals closely associated with Joan include Etienne de Vignolles or La Hire (Jack of Hearts), who helped Joan to victory in the battle of Patay in 1429; and Raymond (Jack of Diamonds), a peasant who was Joan's page.\nKey political leaders who figured prominently in the events surrounding Joan's life are also represented, including King Charles VII (King of Hearts), the French monarch who relied on Joan's help to reach the Rhiems, the traditional place of coronation; Charles' mother Isabeau (Queen of Hearts), who was in league with Charles' enemy; Charles' mistress Agnes Sorel (Queen of Diamonds); Charles' opponent Philippe the Good (King of Diamonds), an ally of England; and the king of Naples, Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou (King of Clubs), who lost the kingdom after defeat in battle. General Talbot (King of Spades) was the English commander of the outpost of Orleans at Saint Loup, who was wounded in battle, captured, and was part of a prisoner exchange.\nBoth Joan's \"sister\" Louison (Queen of Clubs) and Montgomery (Jack of Clubs) are fictional creations of Schiller, while the fictional Lionel (Jack of Spades) is the character who holds up Joan's sword in a location revealed by the voices that she supposedly heard telling her to help.\n Clubs: Montgomery, Louison (Joan's fictional sister), Ren\u00e9 d'Anjou (King of Sicily) \nDiamonds: Raimond (villager), Agnes Sorel (Charles' mistress), Philippe de Bourgogne \nHearts: Etienne de Vignolles (La Hire), Isabeau de Baviere (Charles' mother), Charles VII (King of France) \nSpades: Lionel (knight), Joan of Arc, Talbot\nAt last we came with an idea to reflect opposite of noble life and to bring closer to you even more of the unique artistic history placed on extra collectible playing cards...\nAlso we thought it could be interesting to put another illustrations from the far past on the additional extra cards, in respect to year almanacs, we came with an idea of twelve calendar months in the series as exclusive collection of unique historical artworks...\nAn absolutely original playing card masterpiece to hang on your wall (double sided)\n New Standard Deck Rewards\n Please note: Limited edition decks are no longer available for add-on.

The Deck will NOT be available elsewhere\n Limited Print Run, by the Legends Playing Card Co. \n54 Completely Custom Playing Cards. Each Card have Original illustrations \nPrinted on the Classic Finish (which is the highest quality card stock that Legends Playing Card Co. has to offer)\nTuck box is Shadow Black with Amber Orange Foil [SUCCESS] Stretch Goal #1\nCard Back with Shiny Amber Metallic Ink (54 cards) [SUCCESS] Stretch Goal #2\n Limited Antique Brass DEALER COIN, Made in the USA \nShipped from the USA by the Gambler's Warehouse \nLimited Dealer Coin available now!\nLet's dive now into the deepest imagination and fears of the ancient Greek civilization with \"SKOTOS\" (\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 from Ancient Greek \"Darkness\" ) :\n Silenus was the old rustic god of wine-making, companion and tutor to the god Dionysus. It was believed that he acquired arcane knowledge and was able to predict the future. He plays an important role in the myth of King Midas and his lust for gold.\n The Sphinx was sent by the gods to plague the town of Thebes as punishment for some ancient crime, preying on its youths and devouring all who failed  to solve her riddle. She's involved in the infamous myth of the Theban prince Oedipus.\n Every day this giant wild boar would come crashing down from his lair on the mountain of Erymanthos, attacking men and animals all over the countryside, gouging them with its tusks, and destroying everything in its path. It's connected to the myth of the Twelve Labours of Heracles.\n The Aetos Kaukasios is a giant eagle that was summoned by Zeus to be used in the punishment of Prometheus. Prometheus was chained to the top of a mountain so that every day the Eagle would fly to him and eat out his liver. Since he was immortal, his liver would regrow and would be eaten out the next day.\n She was a Gorgon, a chthonic female monster, and a daughter of Phorcys and Ceto. Gazing directly upon her would turn men to stone. She was beheaded by the hero Perseus, using the sword Harpe, who thereafter used her head as a weapon until he gave it to the goddess Athena to place on her shield.\n Cerberus the three Headed Dog was the multi-headed dog who guarded the gates of the Underworld, preventing the dead from leaving, and making sure that those who entered never left.\nIt's a monstrous lion and could not be killed with mortal weapons because of its golden fur which made him impervious to attacks. The creature's claws were sharper than conventional swords and could cut through any armor. It was slain by Heracles as part of the first labour, which earned him the Nemean Lion's hide.\nThe Chimera is a mixed beast from Greek lore whose body typically consists of various bits of a lioness, a goat, and a serpent. It is known to breathe fire while the snake portion is venomous.\n The Cyclops Polyphemus was encountered by Odysseus and his crew, and instead of helping them, he ate and killed various members of the crew and trapped the rest in his cave. When Polyphemus slept, Odysseus blinded him with a wood stick in retaliation of what he did.\n Chiron the Centaur was notable for his youth-nurturing nature. His personal skills tend to match those of his foster father Apollo, who taught the young centaur the art of medicine, herbs, music, archery, hunting, gymnastics and prophecy, and made him rise above his beastly nature.\n Its lair was the lake of Lerna in the Argolid. Lerna was reputed to be an entrance to the Underworld, and archaeology has established it as a sacred site older than Mycenaean Argos. In the canonical Hydra myth, the monster is killed by Heracles as the second of his Twelve Labors.\n He was the offspring of the Cretan Queen Pasiphae and a majestic bull. Due to his monstrous form, King Minos ordered to build a huge maze known as the Labyrinth to house the beast. The Minotaur remained inside receiving offerings of youths and maidens to eat. He was killed by the Athenian hero Theseus.\n Pegasus remained a mysterious creature capable of everything, symbolizing the divine inspiration or the journey to heaven, since riding him was synonymous to \u201cflying\u201d to the heavens. It was represented as a goodhearted, gentle creature, somewhat naive but always eager to help.\nFor his service and loyalty, Zeus honored him with a special immortality turning Pegasus into a constellation on the last day of his life.\nPIPS of Skotos are inspired by genuine ancient Greek symbols discovered on pottery Art, Shields and Armours decorations.\nTo stick with ancient greek aesthetic, I have chosen the Orange/Red Cinnabar and Brown Sienna colors to contrast with a slight Pentelicus marble effect. To embellish and balance the Design, each card is represented with two Ionic columns with the respective greek number on top of it.\nThis superb tuck box illustrates ancient Greek Patterns and symbolism such as Greek Keys, Waves of the Mediterranean sea, Flowers and Sun decoration.\nYou also notice the shield looking part with the capital Lambda (\u039b) referring to \u039b\u03b1\u03ba\u03b5\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd, which was the Hellenic name of the Spartans. Athenians did the same thing, putting an alpha (\u0391) on their shields as a symbol for Athens \u1f08\u03b8\u1fc6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9.\n As you can see the overall look is directly inspired by the distinguished ancient \"Red-Figure\" Art, one of the most important styles of figural Greek painting. I have chosen Premium Amber Foil and Shadow Black Paper to render this authentic aesthetic for SKOTOS | Amber Foil unlocked with Stretch Goal #1 [SUCCESS] \n The cards back let you appreciate a meticulous sense of detail with Greek Keys, Waves of the Mediterranean sea, Flowers, Sun, the renowned Laurel Wreath and the enigmatic maze structure designed to hold the Minotaur : The legendary Labyrinth of Knossos | Amber Metallic Ink unlocked with Stretch Goal #2 [SUCCESS] \n Dealer Coin can be added to any pledge\nSide 1 : SKOTOS\n  \"SKOTOS\" (\u03c3\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 from Ancient Greek \"Darkness\" ) decorated with ancient Patterns and symbols such as Greek keys, flowers, Dory spears, and olive leaves.\nSide 2 :  Athenian Hoplite Helmet\n  Heroic Athenian Hoplite Helmet decorated with ancient Dory spears, olive leaves, and greek keys. Hoplites were courageous heavy infantry citizen-soldiers and Athens was the richest and most famous city-state in ancient Greece.\nAfter you have backed the project at your  chosen reward tier,  click on the \"Manage my Pledge\" button at the  right, and increase your  pledge by the \u20ac Euro amount of your chosen  Dealer Coins\nAntique Brass Dealer Coins are limited metal coins with a large Diameter of 2 inches (50mm).

As a way to bring a smile to the faces of our customers, I learned a few VERY SIMPLE card illusions (\"tricks are what whores do for money\" -Gob Bluth). During the process I fell in love with playing cards, magic, and cardistry. Short story long, I talked to some WONDERFUL individuals (including Brendan Hong and Gio aka Thirdway) and they inspired me to create a deck for the pharmacy. I reached out to an incredible illustrator, Russell Gray, and after almost a year of brainstorming and countless adjustments, we created the Meadowlark Deck. I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.\nIf you find yourself in Lincoln (Nebraska), I encourage you to take a 10 minute detour south and visit the pharmacy. I would love to see your cardistry moves and card illusions!\nQUICK OVERVIEW:\nPrinted by United States Playing Card Company on Art of Play trademark stock and finish\n Metallic Copper Ink \nFully CUSTOM Back Design, Court Cards, Pips, Aces, and Jokers\nFulfillment by Art of Play \nShipment estimated to begin in October 2020 \n GIVEAWAYS!!!! Follow @meadowlarkdecks on Instagram\n**NOTE: All images are renderings. Final product is subject to change**\n******** UPDATED April 12, 2020 ********\nLUXURY EDITION NOW AVAILABLE!!!!\nThe cards will be printed by Cartamundi. The card backs will be cold foiled with yellow gold (replacing the yellow of the standard card back). The tuck box will be printed in Greece by Lotrek (Oath Playing Cards) and will be double foiled (with yellow gold and copper foil). The bottom of the tuck box will be hand numbered. This edition will be limited to no more than 400. The price for the Luxury Edition deck will be $35.\nCUSTOM HALF-BRICK BOX UNLOCKED!!!! \nCopper foil on a black paper with a small amount of white to bring it all together. For every 6 decks that you pledge, it will be shipped in one of these half-brick boxes. For example, if you are a \"Full Brick\" tier backer, then you will receive 2 half-brick boxes with 6 Standard Edition decks each. If you are a \"Triple Deck\" tier backer and add on 3 of the Deluxe Editions (unlocking soon?), then you will receive 1 half-brick box containing 3 Standard Edition decks and 3 Deluxe Edition decks.  If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.\nDELUXE EDITION UNLOCKED!!!!\nCopper foil on a black paper stock with the yellow and white as the accent colors. Inside will be a yellow gilded deck! We are doing our best to match the yellow from the deck with the gilding, so it might be more of a yellow gold to make sure that it is shiny (see render below). The Deluxe Edition decks are available as an add-on for $30 per deck.\n****Remember! The Deluxe Edition Deck will be added for FREE as a 13th deck for all \"Special Brick\" Tier backers.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBACK DESIGN\nThe poker-style back design intended to take the Bicycle Rider Back and give it a retro yet modern feel. The Meadowlark was drawn in a fashion to be cohesive with the rest of the deck including the court cards, Ace of Spade, and Jokers. The back design is perfect for magicians, cardists, poker players, and art enthusiasts alike.\nCOURT CARDS\nThe goal with the court cards was to give the traditional courts a modern update while maintaining a retro feel. Keeping with the theme of Meadowlark Pharmacy, we mixed some subtle (and some less subtle) items into each court card. We hope that you enjoy finding them as much as we enjoyed adding them.\n\nJOKERS\nTruth be told, the jokers were one of the hardest things to nail down. There were multiple versions, but when Russ sent me these I was so excited that we had the perfect jokers for the deck.\nI mean... how cute are these guys?! Am I right?????\nACES\nThe number cards will have a standard layout with custom pips (we got a little crazy with the prototype). For the Aces we wanted to continue to tie together the rest of the deck, making it feel custom yet functional. Which one is your favorite?\n\nTUCK BOX\nThe tuck box will be a matte finish stock with embossing as seen in the picture below. These custom tucks will be produced by Clove Street Press.\nSTRETCH GOALS (UPDATED)\n $9,000 [UNLOCKED] = Upgrade tuck box to have copper foil replace the copper ink\n $12,500 [UNLOCKED] = Custom Half Brick Boxes and Seal (see pictures below)\n $15,000 [UNLOCKED] = Deluxe Edition with gilded deck will be available as Add-On for $30 per deck \n Giveaways will be held (more info on Instagram so follow us @meadowlarkdecks)\n\nADD-ONS\nPosters and Postcards:\nShashin with Masuta Design (@masutadesigns on IG) has designed a beautiful \"RX\" poster! I just received the postcard sized prototypes for the 2 posters we will offer and I LOVE THEM. The posters are 11x17 and will be numbered and signed. Each poster is limited to 25 and will cost $25 (for USA) and $28 (for International). The postcards will come as a set of 2 (one of each) and will be $8. You can add these on by managing your pledge and adjusting the pledge amount accordingly.  Please be sure to message me so I can keep a total count of the posters sold and let everyone know when no more posters are available.\nHere is the Postcard Sized Prototype of the RX Poster (playing card added in picture to show scale)\nHere is the Postcard Sized Prototype of the Initial Design of the King of Hearts (playing card added in picture to show scale and final design)\nDeck Protector created by Retro Rocketeers:\nThis is a full wrap deck protector made from Eco-friendly Bio-plastic and hand finished with gold leaf paint. The edges are beveled for extra comfort in your hands and when carried in your pocket. The deck (including tuck box) slides in from the top and the bottom has a hole so you can push the deck up and remove it easily. The pictures don't do it justice but I hope that you can at least get an idea. The cost is $25 and can be added by simply clicking on \"Manage your pledge\" and adding $25 onto your total. Please message me after this to inform me that you are adding one onto your pledge so I can make sure that I have all the proper information during fulfillment.\nAdditional Decks:\nWould you like more Standard Edition decks? Really?!?! WOW!! Thank you!! Simply add $15 onto your current pledge. This will include shipping, so no need to add more than that. If you want more than that please message me and I will let you know how much to add (will give a little discount with multiple decks).\n**If you have any troubles or if you have any questions, please message me and I will be happy to assist you**\nFulfillment\nFulfillment will be handled by Art of Play.

I apologize for my ignorance and for my broken promise of yellow gilding. I have worked continuously with the gilders and Art of Play regarding foils and what we can use (ie- different gold colors), and after multiple failures, we decided to go with a copper gilding.

The first launch of this kickstarter was unfortunately unsuccessful, but I am optimistic that we can make to the goal this time! \nThe Beekeeper's Playing Cards\nThe Beekeeper's Playing Cards is a custom, fully illustrated poker card deck which I have been designing on and off for the past two years. What started out as four prototype card designs for a class assignment has become an amazing journey of learning and experiences. Now that I have finished every hand-painted illustration, I am overjoyed to finally have the opportunity to share them with you!\nWhy bees?\nThe fuzzy little creatures that buzz around in your garden are often overlooked as just another stinging pest. Many people just assume all of  the yellow and black-striped insects are out to get them, when really, they are all different and each play an important role in the ecosystem. Honey bees, one of the leading pollinators, are crucial to the  environment, but their population is declining. I hope to spread awareness of the significance that these adorable flying fluff-balls hold for our survival.\nThe Cards\nEvery card in the deck contains a detailed illustration, hand-painted in watercolors.\nEach individual illustration was carefully planned and designed to thoroughly represent its assigned card.\nThe King features the worker bee, as they are the ones truly in control of the colony. All female, these worker bees have the power to overthrow the queen and raise a new one, if they so desired.\nThe Queen is, of course, the queen bee. She is the most important bee in the hive, as she is the only one who can lay fertilized eggs, which create worker bees.\nThe Jack is represented by the Drone. The only males in the hive, the drones' primary function is to mate with the queen.\nEach Ace features a different style of man-made bee hives used by beekeepers throughout history and around the world.\nThe types of honey bees\nThe four suits have been redesigned from the traditional pips to represent different plants that honey bees love to frequent. Each number card features its suit's plant, with its respective number of bees and corresponding flowers for them to pollinate.\nThe Diamonds have been re-imagined as crimson clover.\nThe Hearts are made up of crocuses.\nThe Spades have become the blossoms of teasels.\nAnd finally, the Clubs, which are envisioned as white clover, complete the set.\nDiamonds\nHearts\nSpades\nClubs\nOn the Joker cards is \"The Busy Bee\", who spends all of her time making delicious honey.\nJoker\nOn the back of the cards is a honeycomb pattern. This will be printed right to the edges, so there will be no white space or margins. \nBack of cards\nEach deck of cards will come in its very own tuck box.\nTuck box cover\nManufacturing\nThe cards will be professionally made in the USA by The United States Playing Card Company. For more information on the company, you can visit their website at https://usplayingcard.com/about-us/\nOther Backer Rewards\nFor the reward tiers that include signed artwork prints, here are some examples of what they may look like. Frame styles and colors may vary, depending on availability in the coming months, but I will try to keep them as close to the samples as possible. The frames will all have a wood-grain finish, and the prints will be matted. The prints will be full size of the original illustrations (aside from the worker and drone bees, which will be scaled to the correct ratio next to the queen. The queen, however, will be full sized, measuring about 3 inches tall), making them about 20-30% larger than what is on the cards. The largest of the illustrations, \"The Busy Bee\", measures about 4 inches in height.\nThe Busy Bee sample\nHives sample\nHoney Bees sample", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with viewing anything online, colors may vary from the physical product. This is due to different devices having different color settings, as well the fact that computer screens display color using light (RGB), while printers create color using pigment (CMYK). I will do all I can to keep everything as true to the original colors as possible, but unfortunately that is the nature of reproducing traditional artwork.\n\nOther risks that are beyond my control may include delays in manufacturing, delayed shipping, or product damage in shipping. Each product will be carefully packaged to ensure safety while shipping, but in the case that damage does occur, contact me and I will replace it.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sarah Herrmann\n2 created \u00b7 0 backed\nHi!

No longer science fiction, now you can discover Martian mountains, valleys, and riverbeds  - many of which are still unnamed.\nFrom Cover to Cover, We Made Every Page Count\n218 masterfully created topographic maps of the Martian surface\n  Detailed introduction on the history of Martian exploration\n  An alphabetized index of over 2,000 named places and geographic features\n  Locations of historic and future human landing sites\n  Comprehensive index map to guide readers to areas of interest\n  Standard cartographic elements such as scale-bar, north arrow, and projection\n  A carefully selected quote from the late astrophysicist Carl Sagan printed on the back cover\n  A synopsis of what it takes to map a planet from scratch\n  A personalized message from the RedMapper Team\n  A special Thank You page commemorating Kickstarter Pledgers who helped us get The Mars Atlas to print\n  Mars Portal access: Use Mars Portal alongside The Mars Atlas \nTrack the Evolution of The Red Planet with Mars Portal\nImagine if we had satellite images and maps of a pre-human Earth. With Mars Portal, a web-based map of the entire planet of Mars, we now have that capability with our Red neighbor.  An online community with features similar to Google Maps, you can use Mars Portal along with The Mars Atlas to learn about the planet, its history, and its future.\nMars has never been more accessible to explorers, students, and enthusiasts alike. Go off-world with The Mars Atlas and Mars Portal as your guides. You now have unprecedented passage to humanity's next frontier:\nPLAY\n\nZoom in on the Curiosity Rover's path and the landing site of Viking. Glide over the water-filled polar ice caps.\nTraverse the majestic cliffs of Valles Marineris. Dive into calderas atop Olympus Mons\u2060\u2014the largest mountain in the solar system (more than 2x the size of Everest).\nAlthough the Atlas is designed as a tabletop reference book, it contains the most up-to-date map data available as it draws from data collected by NASA's previous Mars missions and orbiting satellites. It is the comprehensive cartographic representation of the Martian surface.\nWith The Mars Atlas, you can examine the actual places on Mars that appear in research, the news, and popular writing. Learn where these places are, their relative location to one another and plan your future adventures!\nThe sweeping plains and colossal cliffs of the Red Planet are clearly visible in the red-to-blue elevation relief with accompanying topographic lines. Use the alphabetized index to find more than 2,000 features and places already named including mountains, craters, valleys, and plains.\nStep into Mankind's History on The Red Planet\nSince 1971, international space agencies have sent at least 14 artificial objects to the surface of Mars, including the in-operation Curiosity rover and InSight lander. Retrace their steps (and tracks) with precision and follow along as new explorers arrive:\nPreview the Journey for NASA's Mars 2020 Rover\nLaunching this summer and arriving at the Jezero Crater in February 2021, the Mars 2020 Rover will search for ancient signs of life in the rocky sediment. Study its landing zone in The Mars Atlas and visit its new home in Mars Portal!\n Our Mission for The Mars Atlas and Mars Portal \nThe Mars Atlas was born out of the idea that if you're going to land a ship, construct a colony, or travel on Mars, you need to know where you are going.\nHere in the 2020s, we're globally set on going to Mars; so what better time to introduce accessible maps for our increasingly space-conscious society?\nIt is our hope that The Mars Atlas and Mars Portal result in an increased awareness and contextual understanding of Martian geography, resulting in impactful conversations that benefit our drive to go there.\nIt is our intention to deliver these tools in the form of detail-rich illustrations and immersive experiences so any generation can access and enjoy the journey to Mars.\nIt is, after all, our collective destination.\nPushing the Boundaries of STEM Education\nOur development team built The Mars Atlas and Mars Portal on the premise that every person should have access to space. We are inspired by the idea that young students will pick up a copy and have an appreciation for space exploration ignited within them as we were with some of the greatest milestones in our history. Perhaps one of these students will go on to play an active role in the settling of the Red Planet.\n Meet the Astrocartographers \nThree years ago, our founder Eian Ray had the honor of participating in an exercise to map NASA\u2019s future missions to Mars. He discovered that the public has limited access to the geographic information of our red neighbor.  Because of this, the RedMapper team decided to create a detailed set of maps in the form of an atlas, that draw readers to the otherworldly places of Mars, most of which have yet to be explored. \nPack Your Bags to Mars with These Rewards\nThere are several different reward levels. The Mars Atlas is offered as a standalone reward or combined with one year of Mars Portal access. If you only wish to use Mars Portal, access is offered in a lifetime, one year, or a \"sneak peak\" 30-day option. Both  are offered as individual or classrooms/small groups reward levels, depending on how you wish to use the product. Look for rewards that include the special Mars Poster Pack featuring poster maps of four prominent locations - one of which being the landing site for NASA's 2020 Mars Rover mission... As a bonus, a couple rewards include clues to guide you to special Easter eggs hidden within the map! Read the rewards section to learn more.\nOur Launch Equation\nAll funding acquired through this campaign will be applied to:\nFinal copy-editing process of The Mars Atlas\n  Preparation for publication\n  Upgrade mapping software and other tools RedMapper requires so that we can continue to produce these and other useful products on into 2021 and beyond.\n  What the Future Holds for Us\nMapping other planets is a huge endeavor. It requires a lot of time, patience, and especially computing power. As RedMapper evolves it will:\nContinue to provide Martian map content including The Mars Atlas and Mars Portal\n  Significantly improve the resolution of next generation Martian map products (up to 10x resolution!)\n  Prepare future editions of The Mars Atlas using this improvement\n  Develop an educational curriculum on interplanetary mapping technology and processes to encourage other students and professionals in this important work.\n  Present this map work at the 2020 Esri User Conference - the world's largest event dedicated to geographic information system (GIS) technology.\n  Join Our Growing Community\nPledge to one or more of The Mars Atlas rewards and own your very own Mars Atlas. Be one of the first 200 Kickstarter contributors to have your name added to a special contributor page, forever memorializing you as a contributor to the ongoing research of our Red neighbor.\n  Spread the word on social media and email! The Human species may well be the first life-forms to establish a presence on two planets.

Life is good!\nThe Things-Could-Be-Worse Mug is designed to remind you how lucky you are.\nThese mugs are big, giant, jumbo versions of the classic Things-Could-Be-Worse Mugs I introduced on Kickstarter in 2015. People requested larger mugs to help them satisfy big appetites.\nThese porcelain mugs feature my drawing of a traditional blue-willow paradise discombobulated by more than a dozen calamities, perils, and pests. You\u2019ll find...\n              \u2022 hairy fiend\n              \u2022 giant frog\n              \u2022 pirates\n              \u2022 cephalopod\n              \u2022 unpleasant blob creature\n              \u2022 voracious sea monster\n              \u2022 UFOs\n              \u2022 aggressive pterodactyls\n              \u2022 rambunctious robots\n              \u2022 zombie poodle\n              and other suspicious animals and shrubs.\nDetails to charm and edify.\nWhat do you get? Sponsors of this Kickstarter project will receive sets of two identical 20-ounce mugs decorated with my multi-calamity drawing. These mugs are made and decorated by the award-winning Kristoff porcelain workshop in Poland using the traditional in-glaze technique. The mugs are food safe, microwave safe, and dishwasher safe so you can use them every day to remind you of all the problems you don\u2019t have. \nA big mug for creatures with big appetites.\nThe Things-Could-Be-Worse Mug is NOT like those cheap ceramic mugs you get free from the auto body shop or the veterinarian. This is fine porcelain that will enhance your dinner table today and could also delight your descendants for generations.\nComparison of the classic TCBW mug and the new mug.\nThings-Could-Be-Worse Mugs make perfect gifts. So, consider getting extras\u2014especially for your coffee-loving friends.\nYour Things-Could-Be-Worse Mugs are sure to become treasured family heirlooms cherished for their beauty, utility, and humor. Plus, these mugs help you achieve inner peace by keeping life\u2019s setbacks in perspective and promoting a healthy attitude of gratitude. Things could be worse.\nIn-glaze porcelain is fired at extra-high temperatures to allow the image to melt slightly into the surface of the plate. Connoisseurs will appreciate the beauty of the in-glaze technique which the artists at Kristoff have been refining since 1831. This is the look of porcelain you see in museums. Sweet.\nQuality porcelain like you see in museums.\nWhen will you receive your mugs? I\u2019ve already completed this mug design and inspected multiple samples and approved a production prototype. Production can start as soon as I have enough pledges. Assuming nothing calamitous happens, you should be enjoying your favorite beverage in an amazing mug in August 2020. Probably much sooner.\nWhere are you? When the rewards are nearly ready to ship, I will send out a Kickstarter address survey. I can\u2019t send you your reward until you send me your current address. So please complete the survey as soon as it is available. If I don\u2019t get your address within 12 months, I'll assume that you no longer have an interest in receiving your reward.\nShipping. Mugs can ship anywhere in the world. Postage charges vary depending on where the package is going. Porcelain is heavy, so postage costs are shockingly high. But for a treasured heirloom that may last generations, you might be able to justify the expense.\nRead this if you are outside the U.S. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to reward shipments. I have no way of predicting what customs fees might be and if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your porcelain in their luggage next trip.\nIf you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\n Shipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\nWhat\u2019s going on? Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m a pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\n If you missed my previous Kickstarter projects, you\u2019ll find a few earlier pieces, including the classic Things-Could-Be-Worse Mugs, at Calamityware.com.\nDon\u2014Pittsburgh, February 9, 2020", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the pre-production proof has been approved. So if I get enough sponsors, I can green-light production without delay. I\u2019m using a workshop that produces porcelain for monarchs and potentates and has perfected production techniques over 180 years. So technical problems are unlikely. The biggest risk is that production will take longer than anticipated\u2014perhaps because a potentate gets into the production queue ahead of us.\n\nI promise that I won\u2019t stop working until all my sponsors receive their things-could-be-worse mugs.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 43 or more", "title": "A: One pair of mugs", "descp": "Set of two matching 20-ounce porcelain TCBW mugs with multiple calamities to remind you no matter how bad your day might be going, it could be far worse.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["944 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 84 or more", "title": "B: Two pairs of mugs (four mugs)", "descp": "Set of four matching 20-ounce porcelain TCBW mugs with multiple calamities to remind you no matter how bad your day might be going, it could be far worse.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["238 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 164 or more", "title": "C: Four pairs of mugs (eight mugs)", "descp": "Set of eight matching 20-ounce porcelain TCBW mugs with multiple calamities to remind you no matter how bad your day might be going, it could be far worse.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["29 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 240 or more", "title": "D: Six pairs of mugs (twelve mugs)", "descp": "Set of twelve matching 20-ounce porcelain TCBW mugs with multiple calamities to remind you no matter how bad your day might be going, it could be far worse.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["12 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #5", "update_userinfo": "Big Mug: Update 5", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #4", "update_userinfo": "Big Mug: Update 4", "update_content": "Huzzah!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #3", "update_userinfo": "Big Mug: Update 3", "update_content": "Half baked."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #2", "update_userinfo": "Big Mug: Update 2", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #1", "update_userinfo": "Big Mug: Update 1", "update_content": "Off to a big start"}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "1,237 backers pledged $79,194"}, {"Project launches": "FEBRUARY 9, 2020"}]}], "comments": [{"username": "Al Porterfield", "content": "Love it.

The post was received very enthusiastically with tons of messages and comments. That was the point we decided to pursue with full efforts for a Deck of Playing cards on the theme of Rocket Science and SpaceX.\nYou can see the post here - Instagram Post\nHow the deck is organized?\nThe entire deck is themed on Rocket Science and SpaceX. Each Individual suits are sub-themed as follows:-\nHearts: Rocket Science Concepts\n13 cards on various fundamental concepts related to Rocket Science. 3 of them shown below.\nClubs: Epic Orbital Rockets \n13 cards on epic orbital rockets of the world. Priority is given on the type of payload and any extra-ordinary features. 3 of them shown below.\nSpades: Renowned Scientists and Innovators\n13 cards on renowned scientists and innovators who have made significant contributions to the field of Rocket Science. 3 of them shown below.\nDiamond: SpaceX, Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy\n13 cards dedicated to Falcon 9, Falcon Heavy and various others tested works of SpaceX. 3 of them shown below.\nJokers\nJust in case you got friends(!) who are flat-earthers. You got one card for them! And one card for a person whom we all love a lot - Elon Musk!\nBackground\nWe wanted the cards' backside to share the story of the evolution of rockets. A trio of past, present and future images is what we came up with.\nPackaging\nThis is what you will get in your hands -\nQuality \n100% plastic (PVC), 310 GSM, 290 microns, Premium printing.\nResistance to bending, tear, and water (ensuring long-term life)\nFront side: Matte finish for good grip.\nBackside: Semi-glossy, for an aesthetic look.\nAll this has been discussed with our manufacturing team and actual cards from the portfolio passed the above-mentioned specifications. Feel free to comment/message us for any suggestions or feedback or queries on the above.\nTechnical Specifications \nWe Need Your Support\nWe need your support and backing to meet the minimum order quantity required for starting the production. Your continuous support in the design of cards and content has already helped in bringing this project to the current stage. On the accomplishment of the Kickstarter goal, we will be able to meet the required cost quoted by the manufacturing team and get the Rocket Deck in your hands.\nAny queries - reply promised in 24 hours\nFeel free to directly message us on Instagram or simply shoot an email to - spacexfalcontech [at] gmail.com. We promise you of getting your query addressed in 24 hours. Maximum. Any day of the week.\nTimeline\nSpecial Thanks \nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank two people who connected with us on Instagram and volunteered to help us in this project - \n1. Ma\u00ffa Cant\u00fa Ledezma, a card collector, and creative artist from Mexico. She helped in deciding the technical specifications, card quality and provided nice design critique.\n2. Christian Seiser, a card collector, and designer from Germany. He did extensive design review for some of the cards and helped in fine-tuning of the cards' design.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have worked through many iterations of design of each card and based on feedback from 1000s of fans on Instagram, finalized the artwork. We have tested the quality of sample decks from our manufacturing team and also got pricing and terms in writing. We have taken into account various factors that go into pricing and we are very confident in timely delivery of the product. As with any project, unforeseen events can occur, but we've done everything we can to keep unknown factors to a minimum. \n\nWe are all ears to the feedback from backers and due to that, there could be minor adjustments to the design of cards seen in the above photos.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title":

The book turned out great and we intend to duplicate it's look and feel, but with a more literary feel.  \n We're planning to ship your book out in December using USPS.

He not only witnessed natural and man-made disasters, but also war zones and famine; he covered royal tours, political events, the famous and the infamous, the needy and the poor.\nHe has won numerous awards, including the British Press Photographer of the Year an unprecedented seven times, the United Nations Gold Medal in 1990 and the International Photographer of the Year in 1994 (La Nation, Argentina). \nIn 1992 he was honoured with an MBE for \u2018Services to Journalism\u2019; in 2001 he was presented with a Lifetime Achievement Award from the UK Picture Editors Guild and in 2011 he received an Honorary Fellowship of The Royal Photographic Society.\nMujahideen Fighters during the Russian invasion of Afghanistan\nQueen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, poses for a regimental picture with the Irish Guards, on St. Patrick's Day\nFamilies living on a giant rubbish tip in Brazil\nJohn Downing: Legacy is a long overdue celebration of his illustrious career. Press photographers are often overlooked for their contribution to photography but it is their images that define how we see the world's events unfolding on a daily basis. John Downing's work is right there at the pinnacle of photojournalism.\nMother Teresa\nThe Beatles at the Sgt Pepper album launch\nDeer Stalking in Scotland\nThis is an important book demonstrating that despite the pressures John worked under, he produced quality photographs time after time. Every day press photographers are given an assignment with the challenge of capturing images that will immediately reflect what is happening - be it a war zone, disaster or a striking portrait of a personality. Success is often measured by claiming the front page - something John managed on many occasions.\nA landmine victim in hospital, Bosnia\nSophia Loren in her Paris apartment\nThe Queen during the State Opening of Parliament\nJohn Downing: Legacy covers some of his key assignments, including most major wars and international events. He travelled to East Pakistan/Bangladesh, Rhodesia, Beirut, Iraq, Somalia, Rwanda, Croatia, and over a dozen visits to Bosnia.\nHe was beaten and imprisoned in Uganda by the regime of Idi Amin. The Daily Express described its front-page headline as, 'World exclusive pictures taken inside the black hole of Kampala'.\nInside the Kampala Prison\nTogether with writer Kim Willsher, John was one of the first journalists to visit Chernobyl after the nuclear explosion.\nA mother holds her dying son, believed to be a Chernobyl victim\nHe lived rough for many weeks with guerrilla fighters in several wars; the Anyanya in Southern Sudan, the Contras in Nicaragua, and the Mujahideen in Afghanistan.\nAfghan Warrior\nA Russian tank enters Kabul\nRwandan refugees\nAnd - as the video cryptically refers - he was the only photographer inside the Grand Hotel, Brighton, when the IRA bomb exploded in a failed attempt to kill PM Margaret Thatcher and her government. This led to further world exclusive photographs.\nInside the Grand Hotel, Brighton, seconds after the bomb exploded\nAmongst all these key images were thousands of others; royalty, street scenes, celebrations, landscapes - occasionally with a humorous take. All in a day's work for one of our finest photographers. This book is his legacy.\nRotten Row, Hyde Park, London\nPrince Andrew shares a joke with fellow helicopter pilots\nPrincess Diana leaves hospital with newborn Prince Harry\nFamilies sleeping on the streets of Kolkata (formally Calcutta)\nReward Prints\nReward print #1 - Skinhead arrested in Southend\nReward print #2 - Russian soldier on duty in Kabul\nReward print #3 - Battersea Power Station in the snow\nReward print #4 - Back to work after the Millennium celebrations, 3rd January 2000\nThe Book\nJohn Downing: Legacy will be a hardback book with dust jacket, size 270 x 290mm (landscape) and 192 pages.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nJohn Downing: Legacy is being published in collaboration with Bluecoat Press, who have published over 200 books and run many successful Kickstarters.

Me too.\nDraw every day...to keep abysmal gloom away.\nI draw every day. Over the years, I\u2019ve experimented with countless different blank books and always been disappointed. Until now.\nEarlier this year, I found a bookbinder, named Ann, who can make me reasonably priced books with all the features I crave. (See detailed list below.) This Kickstarter project is about making books for people who want the same features I desire in a sketchbook, notebook, or journal. \nI call this design the Landing Zone Sketchbook because taming wild ideas begins when they land in your sketchbook. \nWhat makes a sketchbook great? \nLarge enough to capture big ideas but small enough to carry everywhere, every day.\nInviting feel. Not slick or rubbery. Dark to hide schmutz. Landing-zone icon differentiates front and reminds you what a sketchbook is for\u2014giving ideas a safe place to land.\nPages stay open without a struggle. One hundred pages means you have enough space to sustain a productive streak.\nHeavy, white (not yellow), acid-free paper with smooth surface that welcomes pencil, pen, and brush pen without show through. No tyrannical lines or grids to inhibit sketching.\nA place to stash clippings, emergency cash, business cards, postage stamps, templates, and other necessities.\nElastic closure loop, ribbon to mark your place, radius corners to soften knocks and prevent damage.\n\nWHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING\n\u201cThe binding cloth is soft. Like a cross between a cloud and the belly of a baby mink. I think I\u2019m in love.\u201d\n\u201cThe paper is smooth and delightful to draw on with pencil or ink. It erases cleanly without damaging the surface.\u201d\n\u201cI wish the LZ Sketchbook included a heater for drawing on cold mornings. But for this price, it\u2019s a very good deal as is.\u201d\n\u201cThe mysterious icon on the cover suggests membership in some elite inner circle. Well, yeah.\u201d\n\u201cDon talks about a \u2018sketchbook\u2019 but these are prefect for a journal too. Blank pages to record life\u2019s passing parade, bitch about injustices, or noodle ideas for a screenplay.\u201d\n\u201cCarrying a notebook makes you look smarter by hinting that you\u2019re the kind of person with valuable ideas that are worth recording.\u201d\nWhy two? All of the pledge levels are for multiples of two sketchbooks so I don\u2019t have to diddle with single copies. That helps keep costs down. If you really only need one sketchbook, you\u2019ll have one to give away to a lucky friend. \nOriginal drawing. Pledge level D includes an original drawing. Don picks the subject. It\u2019s bound to be something weird. It will arrive loose and require matting and framing. If you prefer to have me draw in one of the sketchbooks, you\u2019ll have to say so when you make your pledge. That might be a good reward choice for someone who prefers rare collectibles.\nTESTING\nI tested a prototype of the LZ Sketchbook and was delighted. Here are some of my drawings from the first week of testing.\nPLAY\n\nSCHEDULE\nWhen will you receive your rewards? All the production details have been worked out and the prototype tested. As soon as I see support for this project, I can ask the workshop to start the first production batch. You can be making notes and doodling in December 2019, maybe sooner. If a second batch is needed, those sketchbooks should be done in January 2020.\nBlank books like this make great gifts. Why not just get ten?\nSHIPPING\nWhere to? Kickstarter will add the cost of shipping to your pledge based on where you live. \nInternational shipping. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to print shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most shipments slide through without any extra duties, but a few sponsors may find that a customs fee has been slapped on. I can\u2019t predict it or avoid it. Customs costs have been built into shipments to Australia and the European Union. Everywhere else it is a gamble. If you can\u2019t tolerate the notion that you might get hit with a customs charge, you probably shouldn\u2019t support this project. Or maybe you should move?\nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to me. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled when they are nearly at your house, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly\u2014before the authorities send the package back.\nShipping is provided by our capable and multi-talented partners at Fulfillrite. Our Fulfillrite friends are fast and they do things right the first time.\n\nTitle page includes drawings from Don\u2019s sketchbooks. Some are parts of my previous Kickstarter projects. Recognize anything?\n\nLOOSE ENDS\nUpdates and progress reports. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m an obnoxious pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and if I know the answer, I\u2019ll add the Q and A to the FAQ section of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. Not only is this a good place to find some unusual gifts, but it is the only place you\u2019ll find the world\u2019s greatest shower curtain and the amazing book, Monster Etiquette.\nDon\u2014Pittsburgh, September 8, 2019", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 43rd Kickstarter project. I\u2019m starting to understand how they roll, so the risk is relatively small. The design is complete and the prototype tested. Only proven bindery techniques are called for\u2014no technological innovations are required.\n\nOf course, the project is still vulnerable to all the problems that fickle fate can throw at us (meteorites, wrinkles in the time-space continuum, fallible human beings, etc.). For example, in the extremely unlikely event that there are more pledges than I have sketchbooks, the bindery will have to make a second batch. If that many people want LZ Sketchbooks, I\u2019ll be truly flabbergasted.\n\nI assure you, this project will get my almost-full attention until production is successfully completed. I haven\u2019t let any of my Kickstarter sponsors down yet.

It's a tribute. A history. A love letter.\nThis is the extraordinary story of Notre Dame de Paris.  \nWhat is the story about?\nThe Girl and the Cathedral is not a dry retelling of history. Rather, in the spirit of The Little Prince, it is the extraordinary tale of a small girl with an island in the Seine. There, she begins a garden\u2014but not a garden of flowers. It will be a garden of people, she says: Paris. \nIn the center of her garden, the little girl plants her greatest treasure of all: Notre Dame de Paris. She watches as heaven reaches through the cathedral's windows. She wonders as the people in her garden change through kingdoms and empires and revolutions. She weeps as war ravages and burns. Over 850 years of history, her garden changes\u2014as people must. And through it all, her most beloved flower, Notre Dame, resolutely offers divine solace and light, and the little girl learns much about life, freedom, love, loss, and the glory of new beginnings. It is a story about Notre Dame, but much deeper, it is a story about all that Notre Dame has stood for. \nThe little girl admires the most beautiful flower in her garden: Notre Dame de Paris.\nIncludes faux stained glass windows built right into the cover\nBuilt into the front cover are a series of stained glass windows (made with printed clear plastic). Hold the book up to the light, and each window glows!\nComes with a fold-out timeline of architectural and period drawings\nA stunning 4-page flap folds out to reveal original architectural drawings and artwork of the cathedral throughout the centuries.  \nIntroduces children to famous figures\nAstute readers will find references to famous Parisians who changed the world.

Her people loved her. She loved her people. Her song rang across the city and across the years, bells mingled with mystery through the ups and downs of joy, war, suffering, prosperity, and happiness. Her story spans the ages of kings, emperors, presidents, revolution, and change. \nAnd then, like most of the world, we were stunned as we watched flames erupt through her roof. Like the light that pours through her windows, we had come to believe she would always be there\u2014a beacon of hope and inspiration, a quiet touch of the divine in the midst of the world's clamor.\nWe are grateful to know that Notre Dame will always be there, due in large part to the generosity of the world and those that love her. \nWhile that reconstruction goes on, we wish to offer a tribute of our own\u2014a story of hope and love, of life and rebirth. In this book, through illustration and prose, we pay homage to the grand story of Notre Dame\u2014who she is, how she was, and what she has come to mean to millions the world over for 850 years. And in the spirit of giving back, we pledge that for every book sold, we will donate a book to kids in need\u2014book for book.

Let\u2019s make big, fine-quality porcelain bowls festooned with oodles of robots.\nGet it? A big serving bowl decorated with a big crowd...for when you are entertaining a big crowd.\nWho needs a deep porcelain bowl loaded with robots?\nTop quality. A true work of art. Like the previous Calamityware dinner plates, this platter is fine porcelain produced at the award-winning Kristoff workshop in Poland using the in-glaze technique. Final production will feature white porcelain with a rich blue image. Food safe, microwave safe, and dishwasher safe.\nA close look reveals scads of robots and some other surprises.\nIn-glaze porcelain is fired at extra-high temperatures to allow the image to melt slightly into the surface. Connoisseurs will appreciate the beauty of the in-glaze technique which the artists at Kristoff have been refining since 1831. This is the look of porcelain you see in museums. Sweet.\nWith in-glaze production, sharp, detailed decorations are permanently fused into the surface.\nOodles of Robots Bowl is bigger than previous Calamityware plates and bowls.\nThe Oodles of Robots Bowl measures 12\" (30 cm) in diameter. Big enough for duty as a serving bowl or extremely generous individual bowl. The bowl will hold 2 cups of liquid (16 oz, 500 mL) with room to spare. Stuff like mashed potatoes, veggies, or pasta can be piled high. \nIdeal as a serving bowl when you have lots of hungry robots to dinner.\nCaring for porcelain is easy. How much pampering you give your porcelain should depend on how long you want it to last. I wrote a blog post that offers practical advice about living with porcelain. Read it and follow the advice if you want to keep your porcelain pristine.\nWhen can I expect my reward? Assuming nothing calamitous happens, you should be dining with the robot gang by the end of November 2019.\nRobots galore\u2014on rim, in center, and even some on the back.\nFree shipping in the U.S.\nInternational shipping. Oodles of Robots Bowls can ship anywhere in the world. Orders outside the U.S. have a postage charge that varies depending on where the package is going. We apply the amount we budget for U.S. shipping to reduce how much you pay for international shipments, but it is still expensive. Porcelain is heavy, so postage costs are shockingly high. But for a treasured heirloom that may last generations, perhaps you can justify the expense.\nRead this if you are outside the U.S. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to porcelain shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your porcelain in their luggage next trip.\nWe\u2019ll be using the U.S. Postal Service for these shipments because that seems to minimize the number of packages that get hit with customs fees, and there are no extra broker fees added. \nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\n********\nBig enough to share doesn\u2019t mean you must share.\nProject updates. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that I\u2019ll feel like a pest. You can also receive a trickle of news about designing, producing, and enjoying Calamityware plates (and the other projects Don is working on) by joining the email list at Calamityware.com.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section of this page.\nMore than 40 Kickstarter projects have sprung from the drawings in my sketchbooks.\nPrevious projects. If you missed my previous Kickstarter projects, you\u2019ll find leftovers from all my previous projects at Calamityware.com. While supplies last. Not just porcelain\u2014there are some other unusual products there, too, that began as Kickstarter-Don projects.\nWant to see more of Don\u2019s drawings? I post a new drawing of something almost every day on Flickr. You can see my preliminary Calamityware sketches and drawings in this Flickr album.\nDon\nPittsburgh, August 11, 2019\nLoad them up. These bowls are ready for the big time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the pre-production proofs have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors, I will green-light production right away.\n\nI\u2019m using a workshop that produces porcelain for monarchs and potentates and has perfected production techniques over 180 years. So technical problems are unlikely.

Five decades later, man's most outstanding milestone continues to thrill us as if it had happened yesterday. Apart from loving flip books, we are passionate space enthusiasts, and this enormous achievement has always been an inspiration to us, so we thought it would be amazing to create the ultimate flip book edition on the Apollo 11 journey, to mark the 50th anniversary of this event in history.  \nThe first volume of the Apollo 11 Flip Book Edition is based on original footage from the NASA archives, shot during the different stages of the mission. It wasn't easy  to decide which sequences should go into the flip book, since there\u2019s really a lot of incredible material available, but after some back and forth, we chose 6 sequences that reflect the most significant maneuvers of the Apollo 11 mission. Some of the sequences are edited  in multicam shots to show the action synchronized from different angles. You\u2019ll find 3 sequences on each side of the book.\n\n\nAfter testing the first prototypes, we were fairly satisfied with the result, however we still missed  some of the most important events that took place. What about those crucial moments that helped to make this journey a success, but couldn\u2019t be filmed because they happened out there in space? We wanted to create a flip book that not only tells this story, but also really makes you understand what happened out there. That\u2019s how Volume 2 came up. \nLuckily, as we have our own flip book and animation studio, the solution was not too far away: during our research we learned about the original concept art, created by NASA artists in 1966 to explain the main stages of the mission to the broader public, so we decided to select the illustrations of the stages we were missing and turn them into animations. \n\nAs a result, Vol 2 has 6 more sequences depicting the moon landing from a more technical and informative point of view, whilst maintaining an artistic approach through the handmade paintings. They are some of the most important maneuvers performed by the astronauts, such as the stage separations and docking procedures and the lunar orbit insertion of the CSM-LM module. Here they are in detail:\nConcept art created by NASA artists in 1966 to help the public understand the principal stages of the mission\nBoth flip books are intended to complement each other, so if you switch between the real footage and the animated sequences, together they become a powerful educational tool that explains the whole process of the Apollo journey.\n\nBecause we like challenges and really want to take flip books to the next level, we decided to add an interactive component to the edition. That\u2019s why we added an exclusive Augmented Reality feature to the flip book edition that gives you more insight into the three main spacecrafts used by the astronauts to accomplish this remarkable mission.\nEach of the flip books includes a different 3D model that can be displayed on your mobile device right above the flip book. On Vol. 1 you'll see the powerful Saturn V rocket, on Volume 2 the Command and Service Module docked together with the Lunar Module and when both flip books are packed together in the Anniversary Edition slipcase (Flip Book Set), you can see a real-time 3D animation of the last exciting moments of \u201cThe Eagle\u201d before it touches the surface of the moon - well actually before it touches the surface of the flip book. :)  \nEach of these 3D models will incorporate extra detailed information about the technical specifications of each spacecraft, combining videos and additional text. This way, you can not only engage with your Apollo 11 Flip Book, but most importantly, you can learn more about the mission and the vehicles the astronauts used throughout their journey.  \nFor the development of the AR content we work hand in hand with our friends from the British studio Seymour & Lehrn, specialized in creating AR and VR content for virtual experiences. With their help, we will develop our own Flipboku Apollo 11 AR app, which you can easily download for IOS and Android.  \nThose of you familiar with our last flip book project Molecularis, may already have an idea about how the magic works. If you observe the flip book in closer detail, you will notice that the edges are cut in a specific way, so that you can swap between the different sequences. This is the key to the optical illusion that gives the Apollo 11 Flip Book its unique feature of showing you six different animations, one after another - you'll have a blast watching people's faces when they see the flip book for the first time and try to understand how it works! :D \nAnd here's the secret: it all depends on the position of your thumb. You can switch between the sequences by placing your thumb either in the upper corner, the center or the lower corner of the front edge of the book. \nAs there are 3 sequences on each side of the book, the images are arranged alternately. This means that you will have sequences 1, 2 and 3 on the A-side and 4, 5 and 6 on the B-side of the book, when you turn it around. This works the same for both flip books, resulting in a total of 12 different sequences. \nWith the aim of providing you with maximum enjoyment of the whole epic Apollo experience, we have developed a complementary educational tool for those of you wanting to gain additional insight, not only about the Apollo 11, but about the entire Apollo Program. \nWho were the astronauts, which spacecraft did they use, and which experiments did they perform during the different lunar explorations? To answer these questions, we created a deck of 70 neatly designed Commemorative Cards, representing three different categories: 32 astronauts of all the Apollo missions, 18 of the science experiments set up by the astronauts at the landing site of each of the five Apollo missions to land on the moon, and 20 cards showing the vehicles and hardware that brought them there \u2013 and back to earth. \nEach of the illustrated cards includes basic information of the displayed subject, and also includes a QR code that takes you to the specific page on Wikipedia where you can find out even more about each of the many components of the Apollo Program. \nYou can also combine the cards into different groups by joining all the astronauts of a specific mission as well as their scientific experiments and vehicles, or turn it into a question-and-answer game and not only learn from it, but have a lot of fun with your friends and family.\n\nWe couldn't help but include a little flip book feature in the card deck! If you hold all the cards in the correct order, you will be able to see a 360\u00ba animation of the Lunar Module while flipping the cards with your thumb. :D \n\nFor all those passionate space lovers out there who want the full experience, we\u2019ve created an exclusive bundle with 250 units available only for our Kickstarter backers. This one of a kind Limited Edition tier includes a real fragment of mission-flown Kapton Foil that protected the Columbia Command Module during its re-entry to Earth. \nThis unique piece is preserved in a small commemorative acrylic container that comes individually numbered and with your name on it. A unique collector's item for those who want to hold a real piece of human history in their hands. \nThe Limited Edition Foil Bundle will come in a sleek packaging that we\u2019ve created especially for the occasion, along with the Apollo 11 Flip Book Set (which comes with all three 3D AR models) and the Apollo 11 Commemorative Cards. The limited edition includes a Certificate of Authenticity with additional information on the origin and traceability of the foil. \nWe are passionate about great packaging, which is why all our flip books come in their own sleek slip case which not only looks attractive, but also protects them from wear and tear. \nFurthermore, the Apollo 11 Anniversary Edition (Flip Book Set) has a double slip case with a stunning  gold embossing we\u2019ve created for this special occasion,  so that you can keep both flip books together.\nWe only use environmentally-friendly materials, such as acid-free sustainable forest paper. All materials are from local providers to keep our project as sustainable as possible (this means European materials for us). We have chosen a semi-gloss coated paper with the perfect thickness and elasticity so that the pages slide smoothly when you flip them with your thumb. \nEvery single Apollo 11 Flip Book is largely hand-produced and the whole process requires a number of steps that rely on careful supervision, which is why the entire production process will be carried out in our very own printing studio in Mallorca, Spain. Our experienced printing technicians will take care of the complex manufacturing process which requires absolute precision to ensure that the sequences perform perfectly.  Here you can see a small making-of video of the Apollo 11 prototypes:\n\nVol. 1 and Vol. 2 are two separate flip books in their own right but they complement each other beautifully. When combined, the real footage and the animated sequences provide extraodinary insight into the entire Apollo 11 mission.\nYou can choose between the following combinations: \n\n\n\nAs the campaign's rockets gain height, we have created a series of stretch goals that we will include for all our backers once we reach certain marks. \n65K EUR! We will design a Digital Pack that includes 3 items: a gorgeous Infographic with background information about the Apollo program, plus 2 Commemorative Posters: Mission Events, with the full explanatory illustrations made by NASA, including the most relevant stages of the entire mission, and the Commemorative poster for all the 6 landed Apollo missions. These files will be sent to all backers as soon as they receive their surveys and can be downloaded in high quality, in order to be printed in large format or used as desired. \n85K EUR! As a second stretch goal, all of you will receive a Set of 6 fabulous Apollo Stickers. It will include the original Apollo 11 patch, a lunar map with all the Apollo landing sites, the Lunar Module based on original NASA artwork, Lunar Orbit Rendevouz, Buzz Footprint and Translunar Injection. Here is a sneak peek at some of the designs:\nDespite their small size, a great deal of work goes into the design and development of  a flip book like Apollo 11. We have spent months on the design board, illustrating, animating and collaborating closely with our printing technicians, cutting, binding and testing to achieve this result. Since the Apollo Flip Book has almost twice the number of pages as any other Flip Book we've made so far, we had to find a new technique to get the magic trick to work perfectly. \nPrinting projects such as this one are only cost effective if you reach a certain quantity threshold, which is why we need your help to complete the final step \u2013 to finally bring the flip book to life and get it into the printers.\nThe funds will also be used to develop the AR feature, in collaboration with the British studio Seymour and Lerhn.\nFlipboku is the brainchild of animator and designer Jossie Malis and music composer Julie Reier. Besides loving animation and flip books, we're also huge space enthusiasts, so we are thrilled at the idea of creating something unique for the 50th anniversary of this memorable achievement. With Flipboku, we want to bring flip books to the next level and create unique editions, that are not only fun, but also useful either in a creative, artistic or educational way.\nSince our last project Molecularis, the Flipboku team has grown and now consists of 6 members, all working in our design and printing studio Boku Lab. The team is completed with the invaluable hands of illustrator and graphic designer Noemi Aiolo, and the 3 members of our irreplaceable printing crew Gustavo Berdayes, Tom\u00e1s Pons and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Pineda, who are responsible for the development of the prototypes and for leading the entire production process. \nWe are extremely grateful for your support and would love to welcome you on board!\nWe would especially like to thank NASA video librarian Sheva Moore for her support through the incredible film archive and Bert Ulrich from the NASA multimedia and content department, to Andy Bernstein for his support with the video narration and Victoria Amengual for her help with the writing.  Also special thanks to our webmaster Israel and our dearest Angel, Mireia, Anselm, Marcos, Raquel, Angel, Nuria, Naru, Yui, Yuko, Nadal and Alejandro for their participation in our video. \n This campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

How To Film Moving Pictures in the 1910's, which was funded here successfully in early 2018, 1907 Chicago Projecting Co.'s Entertainer's Supplies Catalog No. 122; Deluxe Edition (printed in 2015) and a reprint of the 1907 pulp novel The Great Express Robbery, funded through Kickstarter in June, 2019. \nWhy Reprint These?\nDime novels from the 1890s are extremely scarce. Ever hear stories from older family members who regretted the loss of entire boxes of baseball cards and comic books that were thrown out?  The main readers were adolescent boys who's collections oftentimes were discarded as \"junk\" by someone in the family.  Somethings do not change!  Also, the pulp paper doesn't survive well under certain conditions -- after many decades the paper can become brittle to the point they can't be read from cover to cover without shedding.\nAll four dime novels are from The Old Sleuth series, which numbered in the hundreds of published original and reprinted books and magazines from the 1870s into the 1910s.  However, a scant few of them are available today in an easy to read form.\nIf this book is funded it will reprint...\n Amzi, The Detective; or, Morning, Noon and Night In New York. A Detective Tale. (1896)\n A Detective's Daughter. An Extraordinary Narrative. (1898)\n A Struggle To Win; or, A Gypsy Boy's Secret. (1898)\n Seth Bond; or, A Lost Treasure Mystery. A Startling Detective Narrative. (1898)\nThe plots move along swiftly, are full of action and I believe will be enjoyable to most readers.  \nIf the funding goal is reached the pledges will pay for a print quantity of one hundred books plus the cost of shipping from the printing company. \nHow Was This Reprint Created?\nThe valuable dime novels needed to be taken apart so the pages and cover could be individually scanned at 600 dpi laying completely flat on a table scanner.  The covers have been extensively retouched and readability of illegible text restored.\nOne example of the thousands of print corrections made to the text.\nMost of the retouching was to reduce the yellowing on the pages, being careful that none of the printed ink was removed.  Some of the characters in the printing press had too much ink and left blotches.   Some were barely readable due to too little ink.  These were fixed by moving legible characters from other areas of the page on top of them then erasing the surrounding smudge.  The skew of the pages was also corrected and centered.  With these thousands of touch-ups the easy flow of reading has been restored.\nMore info on how this was done will be in upcoming updates!\nIf funded I endeavor to restore and reprint even more crime, adventure and romance novels from the 1860's-1910's period.\nThis proof was ordered after the novels were read and scanned. It was used a guide to fix unreadable text. The cover is temporary and is not going to be used on the finished book.\nWell over a thousand corrections were made to all 430+ pages of the four Old Sleuth dime novels.\nWhen Does It Ship? \nIf the goal is reached, all rewards will ship September, 2019.  \nAs soon as they are delivered to my house all will be packaged and mailed to backers.

Over the course of the campaign a Mystery will unfold for you to solve. A one-of-a-kind prize volume that money can't buy will be awarded to the first person who cracks the puzzle and prizes may be given to ALL backers to reward participation in the project and help us break new frontiers on Kickstarter. \nPresenting DEATH ON THE NILE \u2014 A handmade, limited edition from Thornwillow Press.\nThe Thornwillow Edition of Agatha Christie's DEATH ON THE NILE\nHaving written more than 70 novels, 14 short story collections, as well as the longest running play in history, Agatha Christie is the most widely read author of all time. Her murder mysteries, above all, brought her fame and have endured in the public consciousness for nearly a century, earning her the undisputed title of the Queen of Crime. The popularity of these novels is no real mystery at all. As Dame Agatha Christie wrote in her introduction to Death on the Nile, \u201cIf detective stories are \u2018escape literature\u2019 (and why shouldn\u2019t they be!) the reader can escape to sunny skies and blue water as well as to crime in the confines of an armchair.\u201d\nYet for all that she has been celebrated, with television, film, and even video game adaptations of her work, she is not the household name that she once was. Now, we aim to honor her legacy, and shine a spotlight once again on the enduring brilliance of her work. It is with great pleasure that we announce that Thornwillow Press, with the blessing of Agatha Christie\u2019s family and estate, is publishing the first ever fine press edition of one of her most iconic works\u2014Death on the Nile.\nLike all of Thornwillow's books, DEATH ON THE NILE will be printed letterpress and hand bound in limited numbers. Please help us create the most beautiful edition of Agatha Christie's masterpiece ever.\nA bibliographic excavation...\nWe are joined by archaeologist and crime fiction scholar Dr. A.T. Reyes of Groton and Oxford University. With a brand new original monograph and exquisitely reproduced collection of maps and ephemera from Christie\u2019s travels, Dr. Reyes is our guide as we walk in the footsteps of the great Queen of Crime through a world of ancient tombs, evil curses, and archaeological discovery. For after all, what is an archaeologist but a reader and detective of the ancient past? \nCelebrated archaeologist and crime fiction scholar Dr. A.T. Reyes of Groton and Oxford University presents the novel in the context of Christie's life... and has created a mystery puzzle to test our sleuthing skills.\nThe novel stars Hercule Poirot, the archetypal detective and one of Christie\u2019s most beloved and enduring characters. As Sophie Hannah, best-selling author and scholar of crime fiction describes him, Poirot is \u201ca miraculous blend of opposites. He is the perfect memorable caricature, with his luxuriant moustaches, egg-shaped head and fussy ways ... but he is also a real person with depth, and past pain, and a third dimension that will forever remain hidden, which makes us believe in its presence all the more.\u201d Of the more than 30 Poirot novels, Death on the Nile is among the best. Upon its release in 1937, The New York Times Book Review wrote \u201cYou have the right to expect great things\u2026 and you will not be disappointed.\u201d \nWe are offering DEATH ON THE NILE in a number of different versions \u2014 from copies bound in letterpress paper wrappers, half-cloth, half-leather, and full-leather as well as a few very special collector bindings. All of the half-leather and full-leather copies are individually hand-numbered and signed by Dr. Reyes and Luke Ives Pontifell.\n\u201cChristie\u2019s books are so much more than great puzzles,\u201d said Sophie Hannah, best-selling author and scholar of crime fiction, \u201cEach of her novels demonstrates a profound understanding of people\u2013how they think, feel and behave\u2013all delivered in her crisp, elegant, addictively readable style.\u201d \nOver the ensuing decades, the popularity of the novel has never waned. Death on the Nile has gone on to inspire countless stage, radio, television, and movie adaptations; it has even been made into a computer game and a graphic novel. In 2017, it was announced that 20th Century Fox is developing Death on the Nile as a sequel to their film adaptation of Christie\u2019s Murder on the Orient Express, with the great actor and director Kenneth Branagh returning as Hercule Poirot.\nThe edition features maps, photographs, artifacts and ephemera from Agatha Christie's travels in Egypt with her archaeologist husband that also set the stage for the novel.\nA MYSTERY for you to solve. A Spectacular PRIZE to Win:\nOver the course of the campaign a Mystery will unfold for you to solve. Created by Dr. Reyes, we present this mystery to connect you to and celebrate the spirit and legacy of Agatha Christie. \nA magnificent, one-of-a-kind prize volume that money can't buy will be awarded to the first person to crack the puzzle. But take note... the spirit of the contest is the more the merrier!\nThere will be prizes for ALL backers that reward participation. Join the contest. Get the word out. Invite others to take a shot. Build your crack team. Work in groups. The more who get involved, the more rewards there will be for everyone. Help us break new frontiers on Kickstarter.\nTHE MYSTERY CONTEST is open to all. Over the course of the campaign, 21 clues will be revealed. They will be sent to all people backing and following the project and will be posted on the project page and on Thornwillow's website. Anyone, regardless of whether you back the project or not, is eligible to win the grand prize. Additional rewards will be given to all backers of the project based on participation in the mystery and the success of the project.\nSTRETCH GOALS:\nGET 250 PARTICIPANTS BEFORE THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN (August 8, 2019 at 11:55PM New York Time) AND WE WILL RELEASE THE ANSWER TO A SECOND CLUE.\nAND/OR... \nIF THE CAMPAIGN BREAKS $100,000 WE WILL POST WHETHER TO USE THE FIRST OR THE LAST LETTER FROM EACH CLUE'S ONE-WORD-ANSWER.\nHere are the parameters for THE THORNWILLOW DEATH ON THE NILE MYSTERY:\nEach clue leads to a one-word answer.

Only one copy will ever exist.\nHow our books are made:\nAll of the design, printing, and binding are done at Thornwillow in our workshops in Newburgh, New York. We are perhaps the only fine press publisher in the world to unite these related arts and crafts of the written word under one roof, and we are committed to teaching and perpetuating them for readers today and for years to come.\nPLAY\n\nWe start with a beautiful layout.  The text is set using classical ratios of type to page, giving each book luxurious margins and elegant proportions.  \nWe set the type with an eye towards proportion and scale.\nOnce the book is laid out, the text is printed letterpress on our Heidelberg Cylinder Press. The type is literally pressed into the heavy archival stock, so that you can feel the letters as you run your fingers across the page. This is an ancient art\u2014the same process by which Johannes Gutenberg printed his books 500 years ago.\nThe pages are printed letterpress on our Heidelberg flatbed cylinder press. You can feel each letter as you run your fingers across the page.\nEach book is then folded into eight page signatures, collated and sewn together. \nThe books are sewn into \"signatures\" which assures their durability and makes them open more easily for a beautiful reading experience.\nThe books are then bound by hand by our master craftsmen, who create the highest quality bindings in the world.\nThe binding of every volume is made by hand at the press. At Thornwillow we are committed to teaching and perpetuating the arts and crafts of the written word.\nThe skills involved in gold tooling and decorating a leather binding take years of practice.\n THE EDITION: \nWe are offering Death on the Nile in four distinct bindings: letterpress printed paper wrappers, half cloth and letterpress boards, half Morocco and handmade paste papers, and magnificent full leather. Each copy will also include a letterpress printed list of subscribers in recognition of their generous support and to let future generations of readers know how this book was made possible.\nDeath on the Nile is Christie at her best. Whether you are a Christie fan, a mystery reader, or a collector, the Thornwillow edition of this great novel is the one to own.\nTHE BINDINGS:\nPaper Wrapper  |  $95  |  Edition limited to 100 more than backed\nThe Letterpress Paper Wrapper Edition\nHalf-Cloth  |  $195  |  Edition limited to 100 more than backed\nBound in cloth with letterpress printed boards\nHalf-Leather  |  Starting at $595  |  Edition limited to 25 more than backed\nBound in half-leather with handmade pastepaper boards.

Genteel but scary. Decorated on all four sides with fearsome, cookie-loving dragons to scare away timid snack pirates and discourage unauthorized withdrawals.\n2. Weighty. Heavy enough to be a murder weapon. Even before you put stuff in it, this cookie jar weighs 4.25 lbs (2 kg). Will not blow away in typical household windstorms.\n3. Food ready. Easy to clean. Dishwasher safe. Air-tight lid with silicone seal to preserve freshness. \n4. Capacious. Can hold 90 Oreo cookies! Exterior measures 5.125\"D x 5.125\"W x 10\"H (13 cm D x 13 cm W x 25.5 cm H). Opening measures 4\" (10 cm) diameter. This cookie jar may actually be slightly bigger on the inside than it is on the outside! (Research into this possibility is still underway.)\n5. Not just for cookies. Makes an excellent storage place for all your snacks. And because it looks like an innocent cookie jar, you\u2019ll find it an excellent place to conceal caches, hoards, and stashes. For example, some people have said they plan to use the cookie jar to hide secret accumulations of contraband, gemstones, antique coins, and chocolate. No one will suspect.\nA close look reveals cookie-loving dragons.\nWhat you\u2019ll get. Sponsors of this project will receive stoneware cookie jar with lid. All decorated with cookie-loving dragons from Don\u2019s sketchbook.\nSchedule.  Assuming this project reaches the funding goal, production will go fast and we should be ready to ship by the end of August 2019. \n********\nMakes a great gift. There are several pledge levels that allow you to get multiple cookie jars. You don\u2019t even have to bake cookies to fill the jar, but we have included some proven cookie recipes for inspiration in case you want to go that way.\nIs there also a cat? Yes\nAnimals? Don\u2019t forget that a handsome cookie jar is also an ideal way to store dog treats and cat rewards.\n\nODE TO A VIGILANT-DRAGON COOKIE JAR\nLosing treats to cookie pirates is the worst of aggravations.\nGet a jar to hide your treasures from unwanted observations.\nAll four sides should be embellished with dragon decorations.\nThat\u2019s the best you can do to stop misappropriations.\nLid includes more dragons and a silicone gasket for a tight seal.\n\nShipping. There\u2019s a shipping charge that varies depending on how far away you live. It\u2019s relatively small in the United States but goes up dramatically overseas because the cookie jars are heavy. Some places are shockingly high. But for a treasured heirloom that may last generations, perhaps you can justify the expense.\nRead this if you are outside the U.S. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to ceramic shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most packages sail through without any duty, but some are selected by chance and the recipient gets hit with a duty fee. So if you can\u2019t tolerate the risk that your shipment might get selected for extra costs, you should probably not support this project. Or arrange to have your reward shipped to a friend in the U.S. who can bring you your cookie jar in their luggage next trip.\nWe\u2019ll probably be using the U.S. Postal Service for these shipments because that seems to minimize the number of packages that get hit with customs fees, and there are no extra broker fees added.\nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to us. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly.\nCapacious interior is a good place to stash your false passports, ray gun, gold bullion, or other treasures.\n********\nProject updates. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you\u2019ll think that I am a pest. You can also receive a trickle of news about Don\u2019s projects, sketchbook, and ridiculous blog by joining the Calamityware mailing list. Sign up for our newsletter here.\nAn enhancement to any domicile.\n\nQuestions? Send me your questions and I\u2019ll add them and the answers to the FAQ section at the bottom of this page.\nPrevious projects. If you missed my previous Kickstarter projects, you\u2019ll find extras from the production run from most of my previous projects at Calamityware.com. While supplies last. Not just porcelain\u2014there are some other unusual products there, too, that began as Kickstarter-Don projects...including the world\u2019s most delightful shower curtain and the groundbreaking book, Monster Etiquette.\nWant to see more of Don\u2019s drawings? I post a new drawing of something almost every day on Flickr. You can see my preliminary Calamityware sketches and drawings in this Flickr album.\nDon\nPittsburgh, June 6, 2019", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCountless things could go wrong to delay this project. But the design is done and the pre-production proofs have been approved. So if I get enough sponsors, I will green-light production right away without waiting until the project closes.\n\nI\u2019m using a workshop that has produced countless cookie jars for many years. So technical problems are unlikely.\n\nIf you have supported my previous Kickstarter projects, you know I always come through. Frequently, I complete my projects ahead of schedule.

We explore a fantastic and speculative world, where people in the past and present are engaged in creating compelling new futures! \nSYNOPSIS: It\u2019s 1951 in Chicago\u2019s Bronzeville and a spaceship sighting has everyone buzzing. Bonnie, a 20something  artist/columnist with the Chicago Defender, covers a not so secret society of people who dissect speculative science theories and the realm of the paranormal. \nBonnie\u2019s fascinated by this world of eccentrics introduced to her by a mysterious, handsome poet named Mandalay whose freedom she envies. The society meets in the basement of a slaughterhouse. However, when a blue haired pansexual pleasure activist from the future presents the attendees with the opportunity to live in the 2020s, Bonnie must decide whether life in the Alter Destiny is real or a dangling fantasy. \nA Spaceship in Bronzeville is a project published by Mouse Books and is was written by Ytasha L. Womack.\nABOUT YTASHA\nYtasha is an author, Afrofuturist theorist, filmmaker, dance therapist and champion of the imagination. She's author of the book Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci Fi & Fantasy Culture, a Locus Awards Nonfiction Finalist. She's also author of the Rayla Universe series. as well as the nonfiction books Post Black and Beats, Rhymes and Life, What We Love and Hate About Hip Hop. She's lectured at numerous colleges and festivals all over the world. \nShe is a Spring 2019 creative-in residence at Kickstarter and 2018 writer-in-residence with Emerson College in Boston. Much like Bonnie, she got her start as a journalist at The Chicago Defender. Although her families Chicago roots began in Bronzeville, she personally has not seen a spaceship there... although she's met people who claim they have. \n\n EXPLORING BONNIE'S WORLD \nChicago South-side, 1950s\nChicago's Bronzeville neighborhood was one of the great destinations for African Americans escaping hardships in the South during the first half of the 20th Century.  \nOur story's protagonist, Bonnie, lives and works in Bronzeville. Esoteric ideas and new philosophies were hotly debated as people looked to create new futures in the face of new opportunities. Those who came during the Great Migration created a unique culture; a blend of the aspirations and beliefs rife with robust civic and nightlife. The Chicago Defender (where Bonnie works), is one of the leading black-owned papers and was instrumental in attracting people north. \n\n1951: POINT OF TRANSITION \nMusician and poet Sun Ra was a resident of Bronzeville in the 1950's\nIt's after WWII and the African American population in Chicago has nearly quadrupled, the Red Scare is in it's early years, housing segregation is being challenged (think A Raisin in the Sun) and  the country is on the cusp of both a civil rights movement and cultural renaissance. The Regal Theater, Savoy Ballroom, and Club DeLisa were among the popular hang outs and Washington Park and the Southside Community Arts Center are hubs for the exchange of ideas. Chess and Vee-Jay Records were on the rise. Chicago's meat packing plant (where the characters meet) was at an all time high. \n\nCustom Slip Case for 3 Book Set\n Mouse Books offer a convenient alternative to reading on your phone: a phone-sized book. \nMouse Books are approachable, carefully curated, beautiful, durable, real paper books. They are small enough to go with you anywhere. They don\u2019t ring, buzz, vibrate, need batteries, and there are no screens to break.

When you are working at a small scale, every detail matters. \nOUR FIRST LIVING AUTHOR!!!\nYtasha being a good sport during late night work session planning this campaign!\nMouse Books launched by publishing  classic literature by celebrated authors like Joyce, Dostoyevsky, Austen, and Melville. All along we have been waiting for the opportunity to partner with a contemporary author on a special project. We are delighted that Ytasha agreed to work with us, and has created this set of novellas specifically for the Mouse format. \n\n WORLD-CLASS PRINTER \nThis is the actual Heidelberg Speedmaster XL 105 at eDOC that prints Mouse Books!\nMouse is obsessed with making these books extremely high-quality. We've partnered with one of the great printers in the USA, eDOC Communications from Mount Prospect, Illinois, to bring Mouse Books to life.

If pledges go above that, the more the better!\nThe Great Express Robbery (1907) crime pulp novel.\nThis crowdfunder is to get a 102 year old pulp crime paperback back into print.  The Great Express Robbery (1907) by Grace Miller White is based upon the play by A. H. Woods. It's protagonists are two young women who live near their father's coal mine somewhere outside of Old San Francisco and they deal with rough outlaws.  Including a husband with bad intentions for everyone!  The setting is barely more than a decade after of The Old West era (1865-1895)! And as you can figure from looking at the cover, train robbery is involved!\nHello!  My name is Darren Nemeth and I published two other books.  How To Film Moving Pictures in the 1910's, which was funded here successfully in early 2018, and 1907 Chicago Projecting Co.'s Entertainer's Supplies Catalog No. 122; Deluxe Edition (printed in 2015).  Both are about early motion pictures and filled with carefully retouched ephemera, some are very similar in printing as The Great Express Robbery.\nI found The Great Express Robbery a few months ago and never saw a pulp novel going back that far in person. Especially with a color cover.  While reading it the story and language was surprisingly fresh, not \u201cye old timey-wimey.\u201d The plot is brisk and I believe is enjoyable for modern readers. \nWhy Reprint It?\nPaperback pulp novels from over a century ago are hard to find.  Even more rarer is finding one that isn't shedding paper flakes and even more rarer than that are ones that can be read from cover to cover without coming apart.\nThe 128 pages story is fast paced and full of action.  I rarely read fiction and had a hard time putting it down.  Read nearly all of in one sitting which is something I've never done before.  I think that most everyone will enjoy it also.\nIf the funding goal is reached it will pay for a print quantity of eighty books. If above the goal, the more the better! \nHow Was This Reprint Created?\nThe binding of The Great Express Robbery was taken apart so the pages and cover could be individually scanned laying completely flat at 600 dpi.  The cover was extensively retouched and readability of illegible text was restored.  I doubt anyone will be disappointed. \nDisassembled so the pages can be laid flat on the scanner.\nMost of the retouching was to reduce the yellowing on the pages, being careful that none of the printed ink was removed.  Some of the characters in the printing press had too much ink and were blotchy.  Some were barely readable due to too little ink.  Those were fixed by moving legible ones from other areas of the page on top then erasing the surrounding smudge.  The skew of the pages was also corrected and centered.  With these minor repairs the easy flow of reading is restored.\nMore info on how this was done will be in upcoming updates!\nIf funded I endeavor to restore and reprint more crime, adventure and romance novels from the 1890's-1910's period.\nWhen Does It Ship?\nIf funded, all rewards will ship July, 2019.  As soon the printer, Blurb, delivers the books they will be mailed to backers.  \nThe interior pages are 100% finished, the cover is 99% finished (the bottom part shown below will be changed) and the spine is done.  The only thing left to do is the back cover! \nThe first proof. The text at the bottom will be changed.\nAfter the back cover is designed \"The Great Express Robbery\" will be finished and ready for the printing press.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLow risk.

Whose love? Our happy customers! The tiny letters and packages transcribed and crafted by Lea Redmond and her pals have charmed tens of thousands of people in the US and around the world. Y'all have asked for more and more tiny mail, so here we are!\nThe truth is: as much as people love their smartphones, they miss real mail. The world needs more letters and care packages. People want to slow down, to reflect, and to appreciate each other. Tiny mail offers one small way to do just that.\nTiny mail is a double-delight. It's as much fun to send a tiny letter or package as it is to receive one! Tiny mail is for anyone and everyone. It is most certainly for all ages. Some people love tiny mail because it's cute, while others are in it for the absurd. Whether tiny mail is adorable, hilarious, wonder-full or just plain strange, you're bound to make someone's day when your tiny letter or package arrives. (You should see our happy customer email folder!)  \nTo send tiny mail, you type out the info for your custom tiny letters and packages on our website, add real-world shipping addresses, review your order, and go through checkout. Then we wave our magic wand and turn it into a tiny version before shipping! (For reals, it's actually a careful process involving a fancy laser printer, very steady hands and excellent craft skills!)\nWhy doesn't it get lost in the mail? No worries! We package up all tiny mail (with a magnifying glass!) and ship it in a larger mailer so that it arrives safely.\nOver the past ten years, the World's Smallest Post Service has been bursting with creativity. We've released dozens of new formats to spread the magic of tiny mail: DIY stationery sets, \"Keep Me Posted\" 6-week serial stories, tiny seed packets and trowels from the Easter Bunny, anonymous \"Secret Spider\" letters, tiny chocolate package sets, patches, tiny postal ink stamps, letters from the Tooth Fairy, advent calendars containing antique postage stamps, and big batches of tiny mail as invitations and promotional mailings for art museums and other organizations. We've even transcribed wedding proposals!\nBut there's ONE thing that Lea has been daydreaming about for years...\nLea visiting the antique post office counter that she found on craigslist in Drytown, CA. Score!\nWith this Kickstarter project, we want to put even more tiny mail magic and wonder into the world. We propose to create an enchanting, museum-like, open-to-the-public brick & mortar home for our World's Smallest Post Service. We want to make a place, a magical coordinate on the globe where people can count on wonder and kindness.  Here is an illustrated list of the special moments we want to create there:\nA hot air balloon on a pulley descends from the P.O. ceiling to delight a visitor with a treat! (Thank you to the ever-talented Lauren Nassef for these animated illustrations!))\nA diorama of our postal office hiding inside the mail slot inside our postal office!\nWe'd love to put on puppet shows about the history of mail in our postal counter window!\nSend a Bay Area pal to us to redeem a birthday treat in a wall of antique brass P.O. boxes!\nWe'd like to create custom apron postal uniforms for us to wear while greeting visitors.\nNew Bohemia Signs is excited to paint our sign and windows for us!\nWe'd love to offer pressed penny souvenirs with custom imagery on the pennies!\nOur pals at Year Round Co have designed this gorgeous certificate for us!\nTo go along with our new postal storefront in Downtown Oakland, we want to make our online tiny mail experience extraordinary too! What we do is unusual, which means it requires custom programming. And Lea has a long list of cool ideas to make the web interface more user-friendly and powerful. These include: a code redemption system for gift certificates and pre-paying for response mail, better editing and preview tools, etc.\nWe are re-vamping our online ordering system with Ryuhei at Y Designs.\nWe have a quote in hand from our programmer and plan to use about half of our Kickstarter funding to pay for custom code upgrades for our site. The rest will be used to create as many magical moments (see above!) as we can afford, and to set up the new space with the amazing antique post office counter that Lea found in addition to work tables, lighting, and shelving. The more funds that we raise, the more magic we can make! (Our current monthly sales will be able to cover rent, payroll, and insurance, in case you're curious.) \nChoose a reward that you love! \nSee below for visuals of all the options in the list to the right. \nOakland artist Michael Wertz has created a sheet of faux postage stamps celebrating 10 years of the World's Smallest Post Service. They're not real postage, but you can add them to the postage stamp area on envelopes as long as you have enough proper postage too!\nAll backers will receive a WSPS patch and commemorative faux postage stamp sheet.  \nA Little Support! ($15)\nThe tiny mail certificates -- good for one classic custom tiny letter or package -- are discounted from our regular prices (once you add shipping, in case you're comparing). We hope you'll stock up for the next few years, giving us the boost we need right now to stretch into our new storefront and website. Please note: these certificates will arrive in September, once our new code redemption website is built, making the codes functional. (And between now and then, you can send tiny mail via our current website like usual.) \nWho are you excited to send tiny mail to? Who needs a little love? For what occasion or sentiment?

No gimmicks or flashy sales bombarding your inboxes, just illustrated email newsletters from Lea. Our working assumption is that you, our customers, want to be treated like real human beings -- like intelligent, kind people with excellent taste. We put our energy into making wonderful things, and hope that the rest takes care of itself. We count on word of mouth to bring us our future customers, and we're counting on YOU today. Thank you for all the support you've given us over the years, and we look forward to making tiny mail for you and yours for years to come!\nIf you know people who you think would LOVE this project, we'd be happy to mail them a free tiny postcard from you letting them know about it.

Special Delivery!\nLea in the early days, transcribing by hand for passers-by.\nLea Redmond started the World's Smallest Post Service on a whim back in 2008. The idea just popped into her head and she thought it was so hilarious that it must be done. So she sewed herself a postal uniform, crafted tiny envelopes, bought a roll-top doll desk and a fine tipped pen, and biked down to Sweet Adeline Bakeshop where the owner gave her permission to set up her tiny post office in the corner all afternoon. To her great surprise, people loved it and actually bought transcriptions from her - wow! She then set up shop monthly with the good folks at the old Curiosity Shoppe on Valencia Street in San Francisco. After being featured in Ready-Made magazine, Lea started offering tiny mail through a website. One thing led to another, and with the help of a very thoughtful Boing Boing post and a Design Sponge feature, a tiny business was born. \nHow it all began...\nPLAY\n\nHow to make a DIY tiny package from our kit...\nPLAY\n\n\nLea on NBC!\nPLAY\n\n\nA few years ago, Lea built a tiny PO diorama into a knothole in a tree at Tilden Park in Berkeley. Hikers leave trinkets and notes as they pass by. If you want to visit it, here's a map.\nLea has loved making things since she was a wee one, such as this tiny paper soda pop machine. You can explore her world at LeaRedmond.com. Her participatory art projects, such as With A Pencil In My Pocket and Sugar Books invite people to find the extraordinary in the ordinary. Lea dreams up and designs whimsical goods such as Seed Money and Matchbox Theater for her business, Leafcutter Designs. Her World\u2019s Smallest Post Service has charmed tens of thousands of people with teeny tiny mail. Lea also creates books, journals, and games via various publishers, including Letters To My Future Self, Knit The Sky, Paint Chip Poetry and Everyday Offerings. She dreams up new worlds and tries to make them at Lucky Penny Parlor, her tiny 250-square-foot studio / tea room in Downtown Oakland. Her most recent Kickstarter project funded a set of quirky activity cards called Lively Matter. She was recently the first  \"Artist In The House\" at Chronicle Books, where she turned the publishing house's elevator into a tea room.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHonestly, we've done our homework and are confident that we can accomplish our goals if we get the funding we're seeking. This is Lea's 9th Kickstarter project since 2011 (all successful so far) and she's very good at follow-through! The riskiest part of the project is probably the time-line of the custom computer programming, which is estimated but can't really be confirmed until we're well on our way into the review process. As such, we've built a cushion of time into the schedule to be sure we can deliver the tiny letter/package certificates by September. In terms of the brick and mortar aspect of the project, the trickiest part is getting enough in-person customers to justify paying someone to run the register, but our plan for that is to add hours and days as we are able and work our way up to being open all the time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 15 or more", "title": "A Little Support!", "descp": "Just the goodies: a WSPS patch & sheet of our 10th Anniversary commemorative faux postage stamps.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["48 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Send ONE + goodies!", "descp": "You will receive 1 certificate to send a tiny letter (or package) through our new website.

I am please to present a 4th edition to the family ! Here is the silver and black hot foil on white paper. This special deck will be exclusive to Kickstarter and later only available in the box set edition. It won't be available alone or on whole sale.\nHow to get this new edition ?\nYou can just update your pledge and add 20\u20ac or upgrade to the new pledge with the 4 decks. Look for this button and do the upgrade. No posts costs extra !\n\nIMPORTANT : \n>> if you pledge with any early bird price, just add 20\u20ac to not lose your special price. \n>> this new edition will be included in the box with coins edition, no need to change anything. \n>> if you want more than 1 deck, the price is 20\u20ac by deck so just do your maths ...\n>> if you pledge for 3 decks you can upgrade to 4 decks. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \nFollowing the success of the first edition, here is a precious metal edition. Each tuck case will be letterpress printed with gold, silver or copper hot foil. A special box set will come with real metal coins to play poker like a pirate.\nEPHEMERA: any items such as tickets or cards that were originally meant to be discarded after use but have since become collectibles. / EPHEMERIDE: French name of a paper calendar that gave you daily information all over the year.\nFrom this idea and my collection of Ephemera over the years, I get the idea of the EPHEMERID playing cards: each card comes with a unique design based of my thousands of hand-letters, invoices, bills, tickets, and photos! \nThe tuck cases are printed with letterpress printing by Studio Pression in France. We us a copper plate which makes amazing details. During the process of printing the first edition, we took time to do some test of hot foil printing and paper colors, that bring me the idea of this new edition.\nThe card are printed by Noir Arts NPCC who already print the first edition. After the tuck cases are printed in France, they are sent to them and the finalize it with a seal.  \nAs a dyslexic kid, it was always complicated for me to make the difference between the hearts and diamonds, and between the spades and clubs. So the contrast between them will be more obvious like this.\nI am also ambidextrous and I hold my cards like a left-handed ! Which means I do not see the numbers when they are only on 2 corners!\nNot only the tucks cases will be different, but also the cards colors. Here are the details.\n\n The silver edition will be limited edition, and only available with set and boxes editions.\n\nYou can choose from 100 coins or the ultimate edition with 200. It contains all the items produce for this edition : deck, dices and coasters.\nCOINS\nI am not a poker expert, but I like to play with my cousin and nephew when we have a family dinner. But I always wanted to play with real coins. I want to have a going all with the sound of metal... I will be working with Fantasy Coins, as I love the coins they made. \nAs the project reach the 400% stretch goal I will design and produce 6 different coins : 1 / 5 / 10 / 20 / 50 and 200. You can choose pledge with set of 20, 40 and add on of 80 coins (mixed). Box set edition comes with 100 or 200 options.\nHere what you will get :\n20 coins : 10x1 / 5x5 / 2x10 / 1x20 / 1x50 / 1x100\n40 coins : 20x1 / 10x5 / 4x10 / 2x20 / 2x50 / 2x100\n80 coins (add on) : 40x1 / 20x5 / 8x10 / 4x20 / 4x50 / 4x100\n100 coins (with boxset) : 30x1 / 20x5 / 20x10 / 10x20 / 10x50 / 10x100\n200 coins (with box set) : 60x1 / 40x5 / 40x10 / 20x20 / 20x50 / 20x100\n\nDICES\nI will also produce special dices with numbers on them. \n4 letterpress coasters \nI am french (did I tell you that?). On French decks, face cards are associated with historic or mythical personages. King of Spades is David, Queen of Diamonds is Rachel and the Jack of Clubs is Lancelot!  It gave me the idea to propose you to giving your name to a card! Be a jack, a queen or a king ! Or make this an opportunity for a great gift! \n12 spots are available : 4 GOLD Kings, 4 SILVER Queens and 4 COPPER Jacks. If you pledge this reward it will include a super deluxe 100 coins box edition. If you a specific card, contact me as soon as you pledge!\nIt will states your First name and the initiale (first letter) of your last name.

Kickstarter let's you know that if you don't think you can trust the creator, then don't back them. They tell you to try and research them before you back a project. I decided not to back many other projects, because I thought I was a scam. Some of them were and some weren't. And I did ask if I could get a refund for the three projects that I backed that I did lose my money, however I didn't get anything. Sure I'm upset about it, but I know that a refund isn't guaranteed, so I cant do anything about it. I just deal with it. One project that I back in 2015 and I still havent gotten the full reward yet. However he still post updates just about every month. And he shipped out half of the rewards. It's just one item from the rewards that hasn't been shipped yet. And no. It's not NEVER the creators fault. Sometimes it can be but this time and most of the times it's not. There could be problems with the manufacturer, but that's not something the creator can fix. They can't just walk in the factory and fix the machine that broke. Or completely rebuild a factory that burnt down to the ground. (Yes, both of those have happened to projects I backed.) Sure you can use the Corona virus as an excuse, because shipping and manufacturing has been very difficult to do since its started. However, that wasnt the only excuse Mr. Cup has provided since the campaign ended. For example on July 31, 2019 he asked us the backers for feedback about the back design. And he changed it to please us the backers. On November 16, 2019 he told us about the problems with his idea of wanting to hot foil the cards. And in that same update he mentioned about a few items shipping in early next year (2020). In January he mentioned he had to redesign the seals to have then printed and cut differently. He also showed all of the tuck boxes being printed. In February he announced that everything has been printed. Later in February he said the tucks and seals were being sent to Noir, and he mentioned the problem with the coin company. They told him they could make the coins but then dropped all communication with him and now he has to find a new company to make them probably at a higher price that the other company offered. In March he said the ESTIMATED time of shipment would be in April for everything except pledges that included coins, since they had just started production. Since then I'm sure that everything has been a huge pain, because everything around the world has slowed down for the Corona virus. And in his update on April 17 he said the likely shipping time will be June. He has been giving honest answers, however thing change. And unfortunately he can't predict the future.", "time": "about 1 year ago"}, {"username": "Richard S", "content": "You guys need to be patient. Especially with the corona virus going around.

Except one where usps destroyed it, but Mr Cup replaced it free of charge. I have complete trust in him and do expect him to deliver this project. I'm sure this project will be very late because of the corona virus, but there is nothing he can do about it. Also you can not get a refund from kickstarter. When you pledge to a kickstarter, you are putting your trust and money into the project the creator is making. If the project somehow fails then it's your loss and your money is gone forever.

I\u2019m Shing Yin Khor, and for the past several years, I\u2019ve been painting strange and wonderful creature friends. They appear in my webcomic, Otherworld Science, in gallery shows across the United States, and at several conventions and events annually. I\u2019ve often been asked to compile them into an art book, and I finally have!\nfinished paintings on my workbench(technically a work floor, in this case).\nStrange Friends is a postcard book featuring 20 paintings of odd creatures, furry, scaled, blerpy, and/or horned. It will be offset printed on a lush felted paper, and each postcard will be a art-print quality piece of art. The cover will be a lovely thick cardstock, with foil printing! I make beautiful objects, and I intend to make this one as fancy as I can!\nOf course, I am a very practical person, so they are also nice postcards that should be sent to people you like. \nHere are some of the creatures that will be in the Strange Friends postcard book.\nGood friends. Much friends.\nThis is a very straightforward Kickstarter - you can buy the postcard book, or buy multiple copies of the book. That's because I just want to make this book, and I want to make it a beautiful and special object! There is a one fancier option, where I'll hand-wrap the book for you so you can give it as a very thoughtful gift. For Kickstarter's Make 100 program, I am also making a care package edition, which allows me to indulge in telling weird little narratives through ephemera and other objects.\nHere is a draft of what the cover will look like! I'll be hand painting it, and updating you on its progress in Kickstarter updates. The pink bits will be rendered on the cover in shiny foil! \nDigital First Draft - Strange Friends cover.\nThe Make 100 Care Package edition\nI love making care packages, as my long-time Patreon subscribers can attest to, and this is a lovingly hand curated care-package of the Strange Friends postcard book, limited edition prints, heartfelt letters from fictional girls, and other delightful handmade ephemera and found objects. I don't want to spoil the arc of the tiny-story-in-a-package, but the keywords are: mysterious disappearances, summer camp, and special beasts. \nI\u2019m using this as a platform to experiment with new found object narratives that won\u2019t be available anywhere else!\nCombining pledge levels\nPlease pledge at the highest pledge reward level listed that you would like, and add the additional cost of other reward levels you want to your pledge. \nCosts, and other details.\nPrinting costs for this book, including proofing, fancy foil printing, felted paper, and shipping from Malaysia, will cost approximately $11,500.00. I'll be printing an initial run of 2000 copies, and have budgeted an additional $4000 for shipping costs, print consulting fees, and production of the care package items. I'm requesting a little bit under this as my goal, as I will be funding approximately 1/3rd of the project myself.\nThe print consultant for this project is Rhiannon Rasmussen-Silverstein and music used in the video is Lobo Loco's Glueworm Evening Blues, from the Free Music Project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've successfully run and fulfilled multiple Kickstarters!

Let\u2019s do something about it.\nThis book offers 50 principles to help the ill-mannered behave with civility and grace. As a public service, I\u2019ve illustrated these principles to make them vivid and easy to remember.\nFull disclosure. Actually, I wrote the book so I\u2019d have an excuse to draw strange creatures doing rude things.\nBooks don\u2019t need to be big to be useful.\nRewards. Each sponsor of the project will receive one or more copies of this rare, collectible, hardcover book. I urge you to pledge at a level that gets you extras so you can share with friends. It also makes a perfect gift for young people whose behavior leaves room for improvement. Because the books are little and easy to wrap, they make superb gifts. \nAlready perfect? If your behavior is already sophisticated and leaves no space for improvement, each page of the book will allow you to enjoy a delightful feeling of smug superiority as you contemplate how far below you most creatures are. Priceless.\nSpecifications\nThe size is A6 size (4.1\" x 5.8\", 105 mm x 148 mm). 68 B&W pages plus color end sheets and a color dust jacket. \nIllustrations. There are more than 50 drawings in Monster Etiquette and I created each of them especially for this book. It\u2019s a visual extravaganza.\nDubious poetry. Each of the captions in this book is a small poem. It has been said that a good poem helps change the shape of the universe. Well these aren\u2019t that kind of poem. These are like the poems Mrs. Katzenbarf taught me to write in 7th-grade English class...but worse. But they get the job done and may make you smile.\nGetting started with advice about introductions\nSpread addressing some airy topics.\nFrom a chapter on mealtime behavior.\nIncludes topics to help build character.\nMissed the previous book? If you missed my Kickstarter project to create the book Stay Home: The Ugly Truth About Space Travel, there are pledge levels to get them too (B and D). \n\n\n\nWhat the critics are saying...\n\u201cFarting is wrong? Who knew?\u201d\n\u201cNice drawings. They haunt my dreams.\u201d\n\u201cExcellent gift for friends\u2014especially those unaccustomed to Earthly ways.\u201d\n\u201cA perfect blend of silly and practical.\u201d\nSCHEDULE\nWhen will you receive your rewards? The book is written and the drawings are done. The page files are complete. I feel safe to promise July 2019. There\u2019s still a lot of proofing, printing, binding, inspecting, and packing to do. I\u2019ll push to make it sooner, but cannot promise.\nSHIPPING\nWhere to? Kickstarter will add the cost of shipping to your pledge based on where you live. \nInternational shipping. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to print shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most shipments slide through without any extra duties, but a few sponsors may find that a customs fee has been slapped on. I can\u2019t predict it or avoid it. \nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to me. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled when they are nearly at your house, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly\u2014before the authorities send the package back.\nLOOSE ENDS\nUpdates and progress reports. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m an obnoxious pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and if I know the answer, I\u2019ll add the Q and A to the FAQ section of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. Not only is this a good place to find some unusual gifts, but it is the only place you\u2019ll find the world\u2019s greatest shower curtain.\nDon\nPittsburgh, February 15, 2019", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 38th Kickstarter project.

I have been a woodturner for around 6 years now. I am blessed to make works of functional art for a living. I am a grateful husband to the most wonderful person I know, my lovely wife Kiley. I am a proud dog father of the cutest german shepherd you have ever seen, and tender of three sassy chickens. A chicken tender if you will..... \nAll jokes aside I am obsessed with what I do for a living. Few things bring me as much satisfaction as finishing a salad bowl that I have crafted from a tree. That being said I firmly believe that trees are best served as living organisms. Removing carbon dioxide and depositing oxygen into our atmosphere, as well as providing shelter to diverse ecosystems and being darn pretty to look at. It's easy to see why so many people are in love with trees and how important they are to society and the natural world. \nIt is vital for me to convey this importance to every person who purchases one of my wares. Most of the trees that my products are crafted from lived much longer lives than any human and were planted/grown decades before I was born. It is my upmost desire that the honor and respect I put into this raw material is evident in the final product.\nFor this campaign, I am raising funds to incorporate a custom bowl drying kiln to my shop. This will create a much quicker turn around time for my salad bowl production as well as adding more control to the process overall. The funds will be used to purchase a small dehumidification kiln unit as well as foam insulation to craft the kiln chamber. This campaign offers a unique shopping opportunity, as I have marked the prices down substantially from my usual retail price. I have added reward levels for varying sizes of bowls. If you pledge at that level, I will turn a custom bowl of that size for you specifically. Each bowl will receive my usual brand as well as a number specific to this campaign. You will receive this bowl packed carefully with a free tin of board butter as well as care instructions and a hand written thank you note.  You will find more information about the different sizes of rewards below this section as well as in the rewards menu on the right. \nIt all starts with the material. Here is a photo of some pieces of sycamore I harvested last summer. Almost all of the bowls I turn are made from salvaged trees in the Lincoln area.\nAs you can see here, I have to make design choices from the very beginning. Starting with how to process the raw material or log.\nPLAY\n\nHere you can see the initial shaping of the bottom of the bowl.\nAfter rough turning, bowls are coated with a green wood sealer to help prevent cracking during the drying process.\nA pile of rough turned bowls before getting stacked and sticker for air drying. The air drying process takes anywhere from 6-18 months. This is where the kiln comes in. Drying times can be reduced to weeks instead of months and years.\nAfter they are dry. I put them back on the lathe for final turning. You can see the color difference between the fresh exposed wood and the exterior that has been exposed for months. The bowls are then sanded to a smooth finish.\nThe final step is the oiling process. I oil all of my bowls with a high quality walnut oil made specifically for salad bowls. The pieces are oiled a number of times and then polished using a walnut oil and beeswax paste.\nHere you will find a section of finished products. The first being this figured Ash Bowl\nDeep Honey Locust Salad Bowl\nBlack Walnut Salad Bowl\nAmerican Sycamore Salad Bowl\nI hope that I have given you a glimpse into the process of making handmade salad bowls. It is a labor of love that is it worth it every single time I get to see a bowl come to life. Each and every piece is a unique tribute to it's host tree and the conditions it lived through. If you choose to support this campaign, I thank you from the bottom of my heart and promise that you will receive the very best product I am capable of making.

As badly as you wish to control the process, sometimes nature does what it wants to do. Drying bowls quicker than they want to dry naturally can lead to cracks or warping. The chance of this happening is the reason that I always expect to get 80% of the bowls I rough turn to survive. Planning this way ensures that anyone who has ordered a bowl will get one, and if I happen to have more than 80% survive, that's a bonus. Please feel free to reach out with comments, questions, or concerns.

It basically change my way of designing. My first items were my own business cards, and soon I created a set of 4 coasters to explore the possibilities. Limited (as all my products) they are sold out for a long time.\nWith first printing, I create prototype of a wood box for a set of 8 coasters, but it never goes further, only 5 were made to see how it looks like. \nTo celebrate the past 10 years, I decided to reprint the original coasters, create a set of 4 more coasters and an edition of 100 with the wood box as the part of the Kickstarter MAKE 100 project.\nWOOD MAKER\nThe wood box will be strictly limited to 100 copies, and made in France by Thibault Malet, who work with me on other projects. Based on 1st prototype created 10 years ago, he will handmade them in his workshop.\nHere is the prototype we did and want to produce. \nTHE LETTERPRESS PRINTING & STUDIO PRESSION\nThe coasters will be printed in France, at Studio Pression, my printing partner for the past 6 years. Letterpress printing has the ability to create relief into paper by adding tons of pressure while printing. It\u2019s called deep impression. And it\u2019s done at the same time, printing AND debossing, always one color at a time. The thicker the paper, the deeper the impression. For a crisper effect, we use much harder magnesium plates instead of photopolymer. Here come some pictures of last year printing.\nTHE REWARDS\nTHE LETTERPRESS CALENDAR\nAdded of the coasters I will add copies of both edition of my 2019 letterpress. They will be send right at the end of the campaign, while the coasters would be produced a little later.\nThe calendar is created with 11 others worldwide designers, each creates an unique design based on an inspiring sentence.\nThe STANDARD edition of the calendar comes with black cover with gold and black hot foil, pages are letterpress printed in black on white an grey paper. The DELUXE edition comes with a gold cover with gold and black hot foil, all the pages are hot foil printed on black paper.\nMore picture are available here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery new Kickstarter is challenge, but also an experience. Hope it will be another nice success. I will use backerkit at the end of the campaign to have the address as soon as possible for the calendars and send them as soon as possible.

It will feature over a hundred paintings, acquired from museums and private collections worldwide: we\u2019re giving life to a congeries of animals of a unique kind, a species made immortal through the craftsmanship of its painters.\nAbout the exhibition\nIn the history of art, animals of different kinds and species have been portrayed and many of them often concealed a symbolic meaning. As a matter of fact, the relationship between animals and art is a matter of iconography: for instance, did you know that the tiny dog of the Arnolfini portrait by Jan van Eyck represents marital fidelity? Did you know that the Unicorn in art symbolizes royalty and chastity? And think about the power of all those biblical characters like St Jerome and the lion, John the Baptist and the lamb... \nThe idea behind the exhibition is to bring to the public\u2019s attention the essential role that animals often had in the history of art as well as to raise awareness towards animal welfare. Furthermore, this is an opportunity to learn how the alliance between man and animal has changed - or stayed the same - over the years.  \nOf the vastness of art history, we focused on a programme of ten thematic sections: \nAnimals in sacred paintings: symbols and allegories\nAnimals in paintings with a mythological subject\nAnimals and man: a millennial relationship\nDogs\nCats\nFish, reptiles and insects\nBirds\nFarm animals\nDwarves against animals\nExotic and imaginative animals\nThanks to the partnership with the Department of Natural Sciences of the University of Pisa, we\u2019ll include essential information on ancient races and their evolution throughout the centuries. \nThe WWF cooperation and our help to the \"Backing the Rhinos to survive\" project\nBy virtue of its cultural, artistic and scientific importance, WWF gave us their patronage: so significant to us as we want to bring to the visitors attention our concern towards themes such as the conservation of biodiversity, the protection of wildlife as well as the fight against illegal hunting. We will donate part of the amount we will raise to the WWF safeguard project \"Backing the Rhinos to survive\", a conservation campaign to protect rhinos in Africa and Asia through microchipping and translocation to safer areas.\nWhy we need your support: the catalogue and the virtual tour project\nWe need a hand to help cover the catalogue printing costs as well as the virtual tour development. The catalogue will consist of 260 color pages and will be published by Silvana Editoriale, one of the most respected italian art-book editors, and it will include all these paintings as well as all the stories and curiosities behind each artwork. Furthermore, we want to bring all the backers, wherever they are in the world, along with us in a virtual tour of our rooms, to take a thorough look at all the paintings and give them the chance to learn everything about these masterpieces. An immersive, mesmerizing and very detailed virtual circuit among creatures, pets and beasts and the artful brush strokes of their painters.\nThe curator\nThe exhibition is curated by Davide Dotti, an italian art historian and curator from Brescia, Italy.\nSo far he curated 22 exhibitions in prestigious museums and cultural institutions both in Italy and abroad and today he\u2019s in charge of Palazzo Martinengo\u2019s exhibition space, where \u201cAnimals in Art\u201d will be hosted. \nOpening dates and venue\nThe exhibition will run from 19th January to 9th June 2019 in Brescia (ITALY), right in the old city center, where the beautiful Renaissance Palazzo Martinengo dwells: that is our exhibition\u2019s venue.\nThank you for your support and we hope you can come and pay us a visit in Brescia!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only risks for this project are undertaken by the Palazzo Martinengo association, in charge of the exhibition.

from 200 rare travel photographs from 1870-1930 that I will restore to crisp perfection.....or select them all!  \nClimbing Paradise Glacier in Mt. Rainier National Park, Washington ( 1911-1920 )- Curtis & Miller/National Photo Company\nWhat is The Grand Tour about? \nRelive a bygone age of discovery and romance. Before the age of jet-travel and Eurorail, intrepid men and women explored the four-corners of the world via sailing ships, ocean liners, trains such as the Orient Express and the Trans-Siberian Railway, or via bicycle, camel, donkey, or foot. \nThis was an era when traveling the world was a thrilling new possibility for those with the resources, time, and pluck to take those first steps outside of their home. Few individuals had even seen photographs of such exotic places as Bali, Kenya, or Brazil and yet were brave enough to embark on extended journeys to places unknown. \nThis campaign is a celebration of that era. \nThe Rameseum of El-Kurneh, Thebes ( 1857 ) - Photographed by Francis Frith / The Metropolitan Museum of Art\nTwo-hundred ( 200 ) rare travel images from archives around the world have been selected and will be brought back to their original splendor by being digitally restored to high-definition sharpness. You will be the recipient of these newly-restored photos and can enjoy them in digital format or by taking your pick with an 8x10\" print. \nLast year, during Kickstarter's Make 100 initiative I chose to unearth 100 rarely-seen historic images for a restoration project entitled \"The Past in Focus\". The support I received from the Kickstarter community was tremendous and humbling, too. Little did I realize that so many other people were interested in seeing these rare images digitally restored!\nThis year, I am continuing the restoration work with this new endeavor - The Grand Tour. The Grand Tour is your passport to experiencing the romance, elegance, and adventure that enthralled passengers of the golden age of travel. Take a journey back in time along with me!\nView of Venice, Italy ( 1890-1900 ) Photochrom/Library of Congress\nWhat Kind of Images Are Being Restored?\nThe pyramids of Egypt, ancient ruins, Turkish mosques, the bustling Riviera, snow-capped temples of Japan, the Grand Canyon, the rushing falls of Niagara, ooh-la-la Paris..... you'll see all the locations that travel agencies such as Cook's Tours would have offered in the late-1800s. \nCoastal View of Brazil ( 1860s-1880s ) - Marc Ferrez/The J. Paul Getty Museum\nAt the conclusion of the campaign, all 200 of the restored images from \"The Grand Tour\" will be available for viewing online and you can then make your pick of which image you want to frame for your home. Enjoy a mystery? I can surprise you with a print! \nIf you can't decide which photo you would like to own, then you can own them all - The Grand Tour Image Collection will include all 200 images fully-restored as downloadable hi-res jpegs ( 1200-5800px ) so you can make 5x7\",  8x10\", or 16x20\" and larger prints yourself. \nTemple of Athena, Aegina Island, Greece ( 1850-1880 )/Library of Congress\nThe majority of these images will be unearthed from the largest and most magnificent photo collection in America - the Library of Congress - but I will peruse libraries from the far corners of the world as well... libraries such as the Rijksmuseum, the National Maritime Archives of Australia, The J. Paul Getty Museum, and The British Library. \nPromenade and Grand Salon, Trouville, France ( c1890-1900 ) / The Library of Congress\nLibraries make it a practice to scan photographs and then upload them to their archives untouched and unrestored. Most need color correction, sharpening, and a great deal of spot cleaning to bring them to vibrant life again. It takes me anywhere from 10-45 minutes to clean and restore each photo. If \"The Grand Tour\" gets successfully funded, I'll be taking time off from my small business to focus on the digital restoration of these 200 images. \nThe original image scans will come from a variety of different photo types: albumen prints, glass plate negatives, photographic prints, stereoviews, photochroms and autochroms. \nOne of the photographs before restoration......\n....and then after restoration!\nMy sister and I operate a home-based photo business, so making beautiful photographs is our specialty. All 8\"x10\" photographs will be printed and cut by hand in our home studio. They will be printed on Canon premium luster photo paper with Chromalife inks ( 150+ year lifespan ). All photos are archival so you'll have a print that one day will be as old as the image printed on it!  \nTHE GRAND TOUR COLLECTION \nThis grand image collection contains all 200 photographs restored for this project. Each image is in JPEG format at 300dpi, ranging in size from 2500-5500 pixels ( 1.5-6mb each ). Since this makes for a very heavy file, they will be zipped up neatly in one downloadable .zip file. Since the project is not completed yet, I don't know what the full size of this zip would be, but make sure you have space on your computer! \nWhat could you do with these files? Just about anything you like. Almost all of the photographs are in the public domain meaning you are free to be as creative with them as you like. The few that are licensed as Creative Commons or Attributive will be marked as such. You could use the photos for a book project, make albums with them, frame them as wall art, or if you want to open up your own photography gallery and sell prints, you could do that, too! \nThe collection will also include a listing of with each photo's title, the photographer ( if available ), date, and source ( this is especially useful if you want to browse more photos on your own! ). \nTHE PAST IN FOCUS - SECOND EDITION\nThe second edition of The Past in Focus was completed last July but only offered as a pre-order to those who backed the first Make 100 project. Now it is available for everyone! \nThis collection contains 100 rare historic photographs dating from 1851-1946 and, unlike the first edition of The Past in Focus, each digital file is sent in its largest hi-res size so you can make prints for yourself. All images are in the public domain. This, too, will be sent as one downloadable large .zip file containing all one hundred individual JPEGS. \nHere is a tiny sample of some of the photographs included in this edition: \nLeigh Brintnell outside his Fokker Super-Universal airplane ( 1935 )/ Provincial Archives of Alberta\nArizona. Grand Canyon, photographer suspended on climber's rope ( 1908 )/Kolb Brothers Photographers\nPlaying a game of \"sl\u00e5 p\u00e5 ring\" at Folkefjellet ( 1910 ) - Paul Stang/Fylkesarkivet i Sogn og Fjordane\nStrongman Paul Remos hoists his son in the air to feed a giraffe at the zoo ( 1930s )/Library of Congress\nNavajo Indian warming hands over fire in tepee ( 1915 ) - William J. Carpenter/Library of Congress\nDancing Lesson - The \"Mazurka\" ( late 1800s ) - Karl Karlovitz Bulla/The J. Paul Getty Museum\nSAILS & SPARS COLLECTION\nThis bonus set of 25 photographs includes images of yachts, three-masted sailing ships, steamers and ocean liners dating from 1870-1930. All images are fully-restored hi-res jpegs sent in one downloadable .zip file. \nTHE BONUS SETS\nTake a peek at my first Kickstarter campaign - The Past in Focus - and you will see that as the campaign grew in size more and more photos were added onto it.

The aim of this Kickstarter project is to find homes for 100 of my original drawings in art collections like yours.\nWhere do these drawings come from? These are drawings from my previous Kickstarter projects creating porcelain, textiles, t-shirts, books, and other nonsense. There are also some new drawings from projects that are not yet complete but may appear on Kickstarter soon. The suite of drawings has already been selected. It includes monsters, aliens, exotic creatures, and a few robots.\nI draw characters every day. Get one to add whimsy to your art collection.\nWhat is the reward for supporting this project? In addition to the warm glow you will experience from supporting the arts, you will also receive a unique, original drawing. These are signed ink drawings on heavy-weight, acid-free paper. You\u2019ll also receive a lavishly pompous certificate of authenticity to document the drawing\u2019s back story.\nYour drawing will be matted (also acid-free) so you can pop it in any sufficiently elaborate 8\" x 10\" frame. Or you can have your framer redo the whole thing from scratch. Perhaps a gilded frame with cherubs?\nDocumentation will make it easier when you give your collection to an art museum later.\nWhy would someone want one of these drawings? That\u2019s an excellent question. Here are three reasons:\n\u2022 Like to have original artworks in your art collection.\n\u2022 Like weird creatures doing inexplicable things.\n\u2022 Like to receive packages from Don.\nHere are some samples from the suite of 100.\n[21] Bug-eyed alien with pipe\n[17] Orc in a bunny suit\n[14] Creature coping with inadequate gravity\n[15] Enthusiastic alien with mismatched eyes\nLet Fate decide\nWill sponsors be able to choose their drawing? No. I have no way to manage individual requests without driving myself mad. Instead, sponsors and drawings will be matched up randomly by blind fate.\nEach original comes in a mat like this so it\u2019s ready to pop in a standard 8\"x10\" frame.\nWhen will the rewards go out? This project will be active until the end of January. By the time the project ends on Kickstarter, all the drawings will be packed up and ready to ship. As soon as Kickstarter collects the pledges, I can send out the address survey. Shipping should be able to start around March 1, 2019.\nInternational shipping. In some countries, customs duties may be applied to print shipments. I have no way of predicting if they\u2019ll apply to your shipment. Customs inspections are very arbitrary and willy-nilly. Most shipments slide through without any extra duties, but a few sponsors may find that a customs fee has been slapped on. I can\u2019t predict it or avoid it. \nPay attention. If you are an international sponsor and receive a tracking number when we ship, track your package daily to make sure it doesn\u2019t get hung up in the system and returned to me. Don\u2019t just assume it will show up at your door. Shipments have a way of getting stalled when they are nearly at your house, and monitoring the status of the tracking number allows you to intervene promptly\u2014before the authorities send the package back.\nUpdates and progress reports. Sponsors of this project will receive periodic updates through Kickstarter as the project unfolds but not so often that you think I\u2019m an obnoxious pest.\nQuestions? Send me your questions and if I know the answer, I\u2019ll add the Q and A to the FAQ section of this page.\nLeftovers from my previous Kickstarter projects are available while supplies last at www.calamityware.com. Not only is this a good place to find some unusual gifts, but it is the only place you\u2019ll find the world\u2019s greatest shower curtain.\nDon\nPittsburgh, January 4, 2019", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my 37th Kickstarter project.

A faint tap-tap-tap at the window? A scratching at the door? Those are the sounds of my nightmares trying to get in. They want to tell their stories and delight in making you gasp. They've already filled one book full of mystery and now they are back and want to slide onto the pages of another book to make you shudder and snort in terror forevermore.\nHello! I'm the writer and creator of the Bertram Fiddle Adventure games and work as a children's illustrator and character designer at  Rumpus Animation in Bristol, UK. Last year I self-published 100 Days of Mystery - a collection of scratchy ink drawings set in a Victorian world full of crooked houses and creepy characters that I kickstarted as part of the Make100 initiative. It took me a lot longer to complete than I intended, but I was really happy with the result and have decided to try and make another book continuing the themes of befuddlement and dread. \nBy backing this project you will help make this gloriously twisted book of drawings and stories become a reality and be the first to hold it. Hours of delirious rapture are guaranteed!\nSome of the 100 Original Ink Drawings from my last project\nShe clutched the box to her chest, her heart trembling like a bowl of jelly being eaten by an unruly five year old\nIt was so much fun to get back to drawing with ink on paper instead of being hunched over a computer screen all day. The illustration ideas come from a strange and peculiar version of Victoriana which blends my love of comedy, Hammer Horror and Victorian novels and are heavily inspired by Edward Gorey, Arthur Rackham and Tim Burton. In this world anything is possible, although it will usually be soggy and/or flea-ridden. I found that once I started the ideas all came tumbling out and there were many I never got the chance to put in that first book. It seems a shame to waste them and I'd love the chance to make another volume binding them together for all to enjoy.\nHe stumbled towards a pot of inconceivably large onions and crouched down low behind it\nI draw them with a scratchy old dip pen in Japanese ink I picked up in Tokyo on pure white A4 270gm card. The extra shading is done with a brush and the same ink. For printing purposes I will scan the originals and may alter the contrast to achieve the best print results but won't alter the drawing in anyway. This will be a book of pure inky, scratchy splodginess.\nThe accompanying stories will be no more than a page long and are written in the style of Victorian fiction, with nods to Edgar Allen Poe, Conan Doyle and a generous dollop of Lovecraft.\nA spread from the 100 Days of Mystery book I self-published last year\nAs with the first book I am, once again, going to collect my drawings and put them in a book along with 50 short stories. A book guaranteed to make your bookshelf 35% more intriguing and one all your friends will covet. \nThe money raised will cover the cost of printing the 150 page, perfect bound softback books in black and white. They will be A4 portrait sized with a 300 gsm spotUV cover to match the first book.\nREWARDS\nBackers will get a copy of the 100 Days of the Macabre artbook, which will be designed and printed to match the 100 Days of Mystery book that I have already completed.\nBackers of the limited edition original ink drawing will receive a signed copy of the book and a hand-drawn original artwork that is featured in the book.\n100 Days of Mystery\nUnbelievably we\u2019ve reached our total all ready and this book of dread and befuddlement shall now become a reality! Huzzah! As we\u2019ve still got quite a few days to go let\u2019s see how far we can go! \nIf we are able to reach these stretch goals then every backer will have their pledge upgraded to include the new rewards. \nSTRETCH GOAL 1 - UNLOCKED!\nNow we have reached \u00a38500 I will include a set of 4 Stickers in everyone\u2019s reward.

The question is, \"What are we reading?\" If you are like us, you can only take so much social media and online journalism. Mouse Books offer a convenient alternative to reading on your phone: a phone-sized book. \nMouse Books is literature for a mobile lifestyle. Our books are approachable, carefully curated, beautiful, and durable enough to go with you anywhere. They don\u2019t ring, buzz, vibrate, need batteries, and the screens never break. \nHOW IT WORKS\nSTEP 1 - Subscribe and get a year of Mouse Books delivered right to your door. \nSTEP 2 - Mouse Team cranks away making the BOOKS, BLOGS, and PODCASTS. \nSTEP 3 - Enjoy literature without having to cart around huge books.\nWe launched last year on Kickstarter, and in Season 1 we grew the Mouse Book Club to 40+ countries and all 50 states, shipping 30,000+ books!!!  Mouse is back for Season 2 and we feel we have made nearly every aspect of the reading experience better!\nSPECIFICATIONS\nMouse Books are carefully crafted to optimize the reading experience in a very compact format. When you are working at a small scale, every detail matters. \nQUARTERLY THEMES\nMouse encourages you to make connections between what you're reading and the larger world. This starts with the books we pick. Each quarter, the Mouse editorial team selects full texts, excerpts, short stories, speeches, poetry and more built around a theme.  Together they form a conversation around an important topic: a literary playlist. \nTHIS YEAR :\n LAST YEAR:\nKICKSTARTER SPECIAL: FOUNDERS EDITION\nOn the morning we first thought of the Mouse Books idea, the VERY FIRST book we tested was The Blue Hotel by Stephen Crane. As a special offer for the Season 2 campaign, we've created a limited Founders Edition of this book and will mail you a copy IMMEDIATELY when you make a pledge. This book is not for sale and available only to people who back this campaign.\nMOUSE MICRO-LIBRARY\nGet the first 15 Mouse Books in a sweet box set. Authors included are: Herman Melville, Jane Austen, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, Jonathan Swift, Walt Whitman, William Shakespeare, Andrew Marvell, John Donne, Charlotte Bronte, Gustave Flaubert, Homer, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Henry David Thoreau, and Thomas Paine.\nMOUSE BOOKS MAKE GREAT GIFTS!!!!!\nSince starting Mouse Books, the number one comment we receive from people is, \"I think this is really cool, BUT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD LOVE THIS!\" If you back the Season 2 campaign at the gift subscription level by December 19th we will guarantee delivery of a GIVING Series 3-Pack with custom gift card by Christmas.  \nMOUSE READER REVIEWS\n\"I love small things that are beautifully made.\" Clarissa in San Antonio\n\"I was reading the Murders in the Rue Morgue and another passenger was so very intrigued by the Mouse Book, I had to give it to them. It was the most wonderful idea, they were very happy. But now, I wanna finish reading it for myself. What are the steps to ordering another copy?\" Joel in Austin (we gave him another copy...)\n\"\u201cI am once again smitten with literature. This new medium (Mouse Books) offers a unique approach, an engaging appeal to consider, to ponder.\" Tim in Portland\n\u201cI LOVE being a member of the Mouse Club!! I smile every time I see my card in my wallet.... mostly because I think about what an amazing thing you\u2019ve done. Experiencing the written word tactically is not only irreplaceable and difficult to articulate, but it is vital we read, caress and FEEL the power the written word possesses. We have strayed so far!!\u201d Kelly in Walla Walla\n\"Congratulations on an awesome year of books! I love the surprise in this shipment and it's a great way to showcase the year. Looking forward to year 2!\" J in Collinsville, OK\nWORLD-CLASS PRINTER\nWe are obsessed with making these books extremely high-quality. We've partnered with one of the great printers in the USA, eDOC Communications from Mount Prospect, Illinois, to bring Mouse Books to life. And since our printing partner is local to our Chicago-based team, we know our quality standards are upheld during every print run.  \nThis is the actual Heidelberg Speedmaster XL 105 that prints Mouse Books!\nTHANK YOUUUU!!!!\nIf you are NEW to Mouse Books, THANK YOU for making it through the whole description!

It is a porcelain platter, shaped in the texture of a well known city and contains the main architectural landmarks. These trays can be used for presenting food, storing items or a great addition to any interior. By running a crowd-funding campaign, Studio Lorier tries to raise enough funds via Kickstarter for a diverse collection of the most popular cities around the world. \nEach plate and landmark is handcrafted in their Rotterdam based studio. All miniature buildings are slib-cast into self made molds. The landmarks are joined as a solid connection and all is finished with a non-toxic, food safe glaze that is even dishwasher proof. \nDuring the crowd-funding campaign, people can support the project by funding it. Rewards vary from a set of mini landmarks, to an embossed city plate including it's architecture. You can even get a fully customized plate, made to order. Supporters can choose from a list of the most popular cities, that will expand when extra funds will be raised. During the campaign, backers have the possibility to get the city plates for the lowest price ever until December 4th 2018. \nStudio Lorier is a design firm that is based in the Netherlands.

It's a beautiful deck of playing cards that will be your indispensable companion in the new world of weed.\n    Each of the 56 cards focuses on one key element of cannabis, providing a concise explanation and a detailed illustration. Whether you're new to cannabis, or an old hand, The Weed Deck will improve your understanding of the drug.\nThe contents of the deck have been painstakingly researched and designed to provide a deep and comprehensive overview of the cannabis field. \nAnd the casino-quality card stock with linen texture makes the deck perfect for all your favourite card games.\n  The Weed Deck covers all of your questions about cannabis. From the basic (How long will I be high for? How should I store my weed?), to the more advanced (How does THC interact with my body? What is \"dabbing\", and do I dare try it?)\nThe main subject areas are shown below:\n        The deck is being manufactured by Legends Playing Card Company, the producers of some of the finest decks in the world. They'll use state-of-the-art presses and top-end card stock to print a deck that both looks and feels amazing.\nIf you prefer to ingest your cannabis information in a more traditional format, The Weed Book is just the thing. It contains all of the same content as the deck, in an elegant hardcover book format.\nThe larger page area gives the beautiful illustrations room to shine. Take The Weed Book on your next dispensary visit, or put it on your coffee table as a conversation starter.\n        Below are the items that are available. Your reward will ship in early December, 2018, once manufacturing has been completed.\n        The Weed Deck and The Weed Book will be manufactured and ready to ship by early December. This means you can give the ultimate Christmas gift to any \"canna-curious\" friends or family members.\nBen Barrett-Forrest is the creator, writer, and designer of The Weed Deck, living in Victoria, British Columbia. This is Ben's third deck of educational playing cards launched on Kickstarter.\nCelia Krampien is the illustrator of The Weed Deck. She lives in St. Catharines, Ontario, and has worked for clients like The LA Times, The Globe and Mail, and Scientific American.\nThe video was filmed and edited by the lovely Ben Kerr: http://benkerr.ca/\nAnd social media is being handled by the talented Vanessa Elie.\n Previous Decks\nIn the past 4 years, Ben has released two educational decks of playing cards: The Design Deck, and The Font Deck. They have now sold over 10,000 copies, been shipped to 90 countries, and are used as curriculum aids in several colleges and universities. \nYour can purchase a deck for yourself at this link.\nThe Weed Deck works beautifully for card tricks. It has rotationally symmetrical card backs with a striking design, and silky finish for easy card handling. \nWatch magician Jason Verners bust some jaw-dropping moves with The Weed Deck below.\nPLAY\n\n        We'd love to tell as many people as possible about this new way to learn about cannabis.

Here is an interview of Poe expert Stephen Rachman that might be useful to listen to before you plunge into your Mouse Book!\nRAVEN READING\nOne of our backers, Jon Rehwaldt, was kind enough to lend his considerable talents to delivering a reading of The Raven for us all to enjoy!!! Back in Poe's time, this kind of performance of the poem was common and Poe himself read it publicly many times. Definitely worth 8:21 seconds of your day!!!\nWORLD-CLASS PRINTER \nWe are obsessed with making these books extremely high-quality. We've partnered with one of the great printers in the USA, eDOC Communications from Mount Prospect, Illinois, to bring Mouse Books to life. And since our printing partner is local to our Chicago-based team, we know our quality standards are upheld during every print run.\nThis is the actual Heidelberg Speedmaster XL 105 that prints Mouse Books!\nCUSTOMER FEEDBACK   \n\"I tentatively examined these little iPhone-sized booklets, making sure to take them to a quiet corner of the house where I could enjoy the experience. I then proceeded to devour them, page by page, chapter by chapter, story by story. What an incredible experience.\"\u2013 Brian in Portland\n\"I GOT THE BOOKS! *people-dancing-emoji* *people-reading-emoji* They are BEAUTIFUL! Great job!\" \u2013 Americo in San Francisco\n\"I purchased a Mouse Books subscription from Kickstarter last year. They are mailed to my daughter and she loves them \u2013 she just graduated with a BA in English with a minor in Writing. We talk about the books she gets as soon as she reads them and we both have great fun with the whole process.\" \u2013 Steve in Ohio\n\"I love the new quarterly books. You all do a terrific job. I eagerly await the new quarterly shipment.\" \u2013Russell in Louisville\n\"I put my book down to go start dinner and my daughter (being a 14 year old) picked it up, laughed at the size, and made some \u201cfunny\u201d jokes about books being obsolete. Twenty minutes later I walked through the room to find her curled up in the chair reading the book. It led to some interesting discussions, and she is now devouring a second book, taking notes and making interesting observations.\" \u2013Shannon in Maine\n\u201cI just love this little thing.\u201d \u2013 John in Oakland\nT-H-A-N-K Y-O-U-! \nOK - you made it to the bottom of the page.

Kennedy Funeral Train - The People's View  \nJune 8, 2018 will mark the 50th anniversary of the RFK funeral train. Up to one million Americans stood along the railway, paying their respects as the train slowly made its way from New York City to Washington, D.C. The book I intend to publish in spring 2018 will be a reflection on that day in the form of photographs, film stills, and the personal recollections of eyewitnesses. The beautiful color photographs taken for Look magazine by the photographer Paul Fusco from aboard the Robert F. Kennedy funeral train originally triggered my search for the reverse photographic perspective: What were these bystanders looking at and what did they see? The only way to find out was to look through their cameras and start searching for the people's views: the photos and films they had made of the events surrounding the journey of the RFK funeral train, including images of the very train itself, which remained outside Fusco's lens.  \nMy source of inspiration: 'Paul Fusco RFK' (Aperture, 2008)\n  From early 2015 through summer 2017, I visited nearly every city, town, and neighborhood through which the train passed. I always had my copy of the book Paul Fusco: RFK (Aperture, 2008) with me. I knocked on many doors and hung around railway stations and bowling alleys. Thus I met many people and was able to collect their photographs of the event, including blurred snapshots, color and black-and-white photos, and Kodachrome slides, in addition to a handful of 8mm home movies. Furthermore, I recorded several personal interviews with people as they reflected on this particularly turbulent moment in American history, now almost half a century ago.\n2 Elkton MD Photographer: Annie Ingram\nFor my book Robert F. Kennedy Funeral Train - The People's View I wish to link these images together, in the spirit of the people who stood side by side along the tracks in 1968.\nThe book will be an homage to RFK, the beautiful photo series by Paul Fusco, and the democratic tradition of the United States. I hope to make a contribution to the American collective memory. 1968 was marked by political and social upheaval, including the Civil Rights Movement, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and RFK, and the ongoing war in Vietnam. The world looked at America with a mixture of fascination and disbelief.\n6 Baltimore MD_ Photographer: Herbert H. Harwood Jr\n  5 Tullytown PA Photographer: William F. Wisnom Sr\nThis book also contains a section with 10 so far unpublished photos taken by Paul Fusco from aboard the funeral train. \nThe acclaimed American art critic and poet David Levi Strauss has written a comprehensive essay for the book on the relationships between photography, history, and contemporary politics in light of the people's views of the RFK funeral train as collected for this project.\n11 Elizabeth NJ Photographer: Rich Taylor\nThe book will be published in May 2018. At least three exhibitions based on this project are planned. The first will open in late March at the SFMoMA in San Francisco, combining this material with works by Paul Fusco and Philippe Parreno. This exhibition will also be shown in Les Rencontres d'Arles, France. I will also present this project at the International Center of Photography (ICP) in New York City in May 2018 and at the Dutch Photo Museum in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. At these exhibitions, I will present a film installation consisting of photos, film clips, and audio (recorded along the railroad on June 8, 1968), accompanied by narration of eyewitness accounts. \n3 Iselin NJ Photographer: Claire Leary\nBut I'm not there yet. I would really appreciate any financial support for this extensive project. Essentially, this is a collaborative project that could not exist without your help, about a subject and a time that has played such an important role within American society and far beyond, even to this very day.\nArdwick MD - Photographer: Alan Virta\nBook details:\nThe photobook will be a joint publication between two non-profit publishers of photography and art books: Fw:Books (Amsterdam) and the Magnum Foundation (New York City).\n\nPhotographs and film stills: By Americans who stood along the railway on June 8, 1968\nTexts: Essay by David Levi Strauss, letters and quotes from eyewitnesses\nPreface and editing: Rein Jelle Terpstra\nGraphic design: Jeremy Jansen\nTranslation and text editing: Felix van de Vorst, Hannah Vernier, and Taco Hidde Bakker.           \nPhotographs: approx. 140 color and black and white reproductions\nSize: approx. 8 x 10.5 inches (203 mm \u00d7 267 mm)\nRetail price: approx. $45\n\nPublication date: May 2018 \nAll image rights belong to the owners of the images and are published with their full consent. \ntentative cover of the book\nThe book will also feature the names of all the participants who had confidence in this project and helped me by sharing their personal images, films, and stories. \nRewards\nAs a special thank you, I offer several gifts in return for your kind support for this project.\nSee all gifts: \nhttp://www.reinjelleterpstra.nl/?key=e6ab5c11649a8d06010b12f3\n(If the URL doesn\u2019t link directly, please copy and paste the link into your browser window)\nOf course, I would be delighted to meet those of you who are willing to help make this project a reality.

As soon as I know where the book launch will take place, I'll let you know. \nAbout myself:\nI was born on July 4, 1960 (Independence Day), so I was nearly eight years old when RFK was assassinated. My father was very fond of the United States and all things American, in addition to being a true Kennedy admirer. He told us many stories about the Kennedys, which have left an imprint on me ever since. Later, as an artist, especially after a residency at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten (Amsterdam), I began working with photography in relation to the theme of memory. My photo projects - slideshow installations and books - investigate the relationships between perception, memory, and the absence of images. My work is held in various collections, including the collection of artists' books at the MoMA Library (New York), The Royal Museum of Arts (Brussels), Yale University Library (New Haven), and the Getty Research Institute (Los Angeles). Furthermore, I was nominated for the Dutch Doc Award in 2014, and I teach fine arts and photography at Minerva Art Academy, Groningen (NL).\nDuring the spring of 2017, I undertook a Smithsonian Artist Research Fellowship in Washington, D.C. to work on the project RFK Funeral Train - The People's View (2014-2018).\nMy website: www.reinjelleterpstra.nl\nProject Facebook page: www.facebook.com/RFKfuneraltrain/\nNo part of this publication may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic, mechanical, photocopying or recording otherwise, without the prior permission of the authors.

And we will keep communicating in the 'Updates' tab, but if you're a first time viewer, please read on for more\u2026 **\nThe Rough Stuff Cycling in the Alps guide book was compiled by Fred Wright and self-published in 2002. \nIt preserved the collective wisdom of generations of riders who pioneered riding the 'rough stuff' \u2013 riders who headed into the high peaks armed only with touring bikes and canvas rucksacks, sandals and floppy hats, crossing mountain ranges and joining up towns and famous cols on little-known gravel tracks, dirt trails and even icy climbs(!). \nThis was gravel biking before gravel bikes \u2013 mountain biking before mountain bikes, in some cases. \nFred's bike at the Fen\u00eatre de Ferret, on his adventures in the late '80s.\nThe book contained nearly 300 routes, ranging from easy unsurfaced roads at little more than 1000m to steep footpaths above 3000m, and from the southern French Alps to Switzerland, the Dolomites and the Austrian Tirol.\nFred's original book\nThe entries often included detailed personal accounts of when the route was ridden, and the book also offered tips for beginners, advice on equipment and maps, and suggestions for routes not covered in the guide.\nOriginal design and layout and maps\nOnly around 100 copies were made, and they are now impossible to find. But Fred does not want this information to be lost. With his permission we are reprinting Rough Stuff Cycling in the Alps, in a very limited edition, for the first time.\nMore and more of us are choosing to head off the beaten track with our bikes. Adventure touring, gravel biking, bikepacking \u2013 whatever you call it, we all want to get out there. The Alps are one of cycling\u2019s ultimate playgrounds, and this guide is an invaluable resource of practical information about cycling in some of the most remote and beautiful places in Europe. \nFred Wright at the top of the Arlscharte Pass, Austria, in 1992\nRough Stuff Cycling in the Alps is a springboard to adventure, something to leaf through and dream over, whether you\u2019re planning your next bikepacking trip or simply sitting at home watching the raindrops run down the windowpanes and wishing you were out riding in the sun. \nWe\u2019re proud to offer a new edition of Fred\u2019s book to the next generation of adventurers.\nAbove the Passo dello Stelvio, 1990\nTHE NEW EDITION \nThe Isola Press Rough Stuff Cycling in the Alps will be a beautiful and functional object \u2013 a fitting way of preserving Fred's pioneering work. \nIn it, we will reprint Fred\u2019s work in its entirety. We will also improve and updating it. Fred typed his book at the library and bound it at his local branch of Staples. We will be using an art gallery-quality printer either in the UK or Belgium (depending on final order numbers). \nThe new edition will be wiro-bound, and with rounded corners, for practicality, with a laminated card cover. \nFred has also given us a large quantity of beautiful original photos from his travels, and we will print as many as we can. Have a look at the images in this campaign and the video \u2013 they are amazing!\nThe new cover \u2013 initial concept\n New for this edition there will be: \n16 new hand-drawn maps, showing the areas covered and the routes described, so that readers can easily locate the main towns and road passes, and the potential unpaved tracks and paths to navigate between them\nA beautiful overall Alps map illustrated by Stefan Amato of Pannier.cc\nAn extended colour photo section. Fred included just four photos of his adventures. We will have at least 16 pages of original photos taken by Fred and other pioneers of rough stuff riding in the Alps. See the pics in this campaign for a selection.\nA new introduction by Fred Wright himself, explaining the genesis of the book and recounting his riding life \nA new postscript by James Olsen (founder of the Torino-Nice Rally, who used the guide to create the TNR) on rough stuff in the 21st century. This will give advice for using the book in the age of mountain bikes and gravel bikes, bikepacking luggage, 3G and GPS \nUpdated information \u2013 for example, on the availability of paper maps \u2013 and adding a few suggested routes where possible \nEvery book sold on Kickstarter will include a \u00a31 donation to the Rough Stuff Fellowship, and \u00a31 split between Fred's chosen charity, the Salvation Army, and Smart Shelter Foundation. \nThis new edition will mainly available via pre-sales. We will not be over-ordering stock and there will not be many available after the Kickstarter has closed \u2013 once they're gone, they're gone. \nBuy this book because you\u2019re planning a trip, buy it for the incredible photos, buy it for inspiration \u2013 but please dig into your pockets and help us bring this amazing book back to life. \nA mock-up of the new text design and layout\nSome initial layouts and tests for the new edition\n WHO ARE WE? \nIsola Press is run by me, Max Leonard. I have written books including Higher Calling, about why cyclists like riding in the mountains, and Lanterne Rouge, about the last man in the Tour de France. They\u2019ve been published in multiple countries by Yellow Jersey (UK), Pegasus (USA) and others. In 2016 I set up Isola Press to make \u2018adventures in illustrated books\u2019. \nThe first Isola Press book, Bunker Research, written by me and with Camille McMillan's photos of World War 2 bunkers in the Alps, won a prize: Best Self Published Book at the 2016 British Book Design & Production Awards. The second, The Men of Paris-Roubaix, was made in partnership with Rapha and presented beautiful archive portraits from the early years of cycling\u2019s most beautiful one-day Classic. \nBunker Research\nThe Men of Paris-Roubaix\nRough Stuff Cycling in the Alps will be the third Isola Press book. It will be designed by Andy Edwards. He\u2019s also a cyclist, and a map geek. We\u2019ve worked together on things including books for major publishers, like the Rapha City Cycling Europe guides for Thames & Hudson. \nWe\u2019ve been helped along the way in this reprinting project by Stefan of Pannier.cc, James of the Torino-Nice Rally and others. \nBut mainly Fred Wright. Thanks Fred.\nWHY ARE WE DOING THIS? \nI\u2019m really passionate about riding my bike in the mountains. I do it to the exclusion of most normal things. I spend a lot of time, from snow melt to snow fall, on road bikes and on gravel in the Alps, mainly in France, exploring them. I love the mountains, and the people and the sights in them, and I have worked as a cycle guide with travel companies helping other people have these same experiences. \nMe! (photo: Antton Miettinen)\nI wished I\u2019d been able to find this book when I first read about it online \u2013 I searched and searched for it but couldn\u2019t find one to buy \u2013 and now I\u2019m in a position to help it live longer. That's a good thing. And Fred Wright, who made the original book, doesn\u2019t want this knowledge to disappear as the surviving copies of the original edition disperse over time.\nI also love making beautiful books. This will be a beautiful book. (On a slight side note, I also collect vintage postcards of the Alps, and I will give some away in the Kickstarter rewards, if you would like one!)\nWHERE YOUR MONEY GOES\nOur initial target basically covers:\nPrint costs for our minimum print run (I\u2019m setting the minimum at 100 copies) \nMoney to photographers for permission to use their photos \nMoney to pay Fred and James to write new essays \nMoney to pay Stefan to draw the new map \n Kickstarter fees \nIf we achieve our target, and I hope we will, we will set a range of stretch targets, which will include: \nAn extended colour picture section\nA bigger donation to charity\nBut more of that later as and when the time comes.\nDELIVERY\nOnce the Kickstarter is finished, we estimate we are a month away from finishing the design, layout, proofing and other jobs.\nWe will then send it to print around the start of May for an early June delivery. So we anticipate sending it to backers then, in time for high Alpine adventures this summer.\nREWARD DETAILS\nHere's some more details about the different rewards offered.\nPostcards: we took some of the best of Fred's images and made postcards of them, for you to send or display.\nSome of the postcards we might send you\nVintage postcards: I've built up a collection of old postcards of the Alps, which I've used in other books. Some of them are unused, and if you choose the SPECIAL VINTAGE THANKS reward, Andy and I will sign and send one to you. \nVintage postcards \u2013 someone has to buy them :-)\nLimited edition Rough Stuff Alps x Pannier.cc cap: we designed this cap in association with Pannier.cc. It will be a one-time thing, and it'll be made through Rapha Custom, so the quality will be excellent. \nProposed cap design\nCaf\u00e9 du Cycliste neck warmer: neck warmers are one of the most useful items to have on a mountain tour, and we love these stripy Merino ones from Caf\u00e9 du Cycliste. More details here. Colours may vary.\nCaf\u00e9 du Cycliste Merino neck warmer\nIsola Press books: Bunker Research uncovers the hidden history of modernism in the mountains through Camille McMillan's photography; The Men of Paris-Roubaix is a postcard book of beautiful archive portraits.

As a journalist, I feel an obligation to help these veterans reach a mass audience so that they can share their stories and inspire children, especially African-Americans, to serve their country for the greater good.\nHarlem Hellfighters in Trenches\nTHESE EPIC STORIES MUST BE TOLD\nGenerally, these are stories about all the decorated (by France and, not until recently, the United States) African-American soldiers of World War I \u2013 those 400,000 men who braved their own country\u2019s stereotypes in order to fight the enemy. Specifically, we feature the men of the 369th, the \"Harlem Hellfighters.\" If you\u2019re expecting a \"woe is me\" story, you won\u2019t find it here. You will find an exciting coffee table read about the bravery and heroism of these men whom France honored when America would not.\nI will write the stories, as well as collect, catalog, and audit content to make these incredible photographs and tales available in one unique book that you can own and share. It\u2019ll be a rare addition to your personal collection.\nThe stories will be fully researched and vetted. For example:\nThe most celebrated man in the 369th was Pvt. Henry Johnson, a former Albany, New York rail station porter who earned the nickname \"Black Death\" for his combat actions in France. In May 1918, Johnson and Pvt. Needham Roberts fought off a 24-man German patrol, though both were severely wounded. After they expended their ammunition, Roberts used his rifle as a club and Johnson battled with a bolo knife. Reports suggest that Johnson killed at least four German soldiers and might have wounded 30 others.\nWhile overseas, the 369th Regiment made up less than 1% of the soldiers deployed but was responsible for over 20% of the land territory assigned to the United States.\nDuring the war, the 369th's regimental band became famous throughout Europe. It introduced a strange new music, called \"Jazz,\" to British, French, and other European audiences.\nOn December 13, 1918, one month after Armistice Day, the French government awarded the Croix de Guerre to 170 individual members of the 369th. The entire regiment received a unit citation.\nThese stories were deliberately kept hidden from American citizens because of racism during that time. Today, they shed light on the true heroism of African-Americans \u2013 heroism that France, Great Britain, and even the German soldiers came to know and admire.\nThe nickname \"Men of Bronze\" was given to the regiment by the French. The nickname \"Hellfighters\" was given to them by the Germans due to their toughness and the fact that they never lost a man through capture, nor did they lose a trench or a foot of ground to the enemy!\nThe enemy tried heavily to recruit the \"Hellfighters,\" though because of these men's loyalty to the United States, the enemy failed.\nHarlem Hellfighters with French\nWe're shedding light on the truth of their journey so that more African-American children can be proud of their heritage of service to the country. More researchers, teachers, and students can learn from these stories and keep their fighting spirit alive.\nThis real history is as exciting as a #wakandaforever #blackpanther movie superhero.\nAlthough the book itself is a collector\u2019s item full of rare photographs and a collection of rarely shared stories, I am also including a collectible coin to commemorate the centennial celebrations this year.\nThis is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to obtain this rare gold coin, which will never be offered anywhere else again.\nAdvance Release:\nOrder Your New 2018 Collectible Gold Coin Now!\nMinted by United State Military Veterans, with the finest quality.\nNew 2018 Collectible Gold Coin\nAlthough this book can stand on its own, I have put together a team of professionals with expert credentials to offer you a unique collectible coin that celebrates this amazing group of young men.\nOur coin will be minted by Coins For Anything (https://coinsforanything.com), which is America's largest veteran owned custom coin company, founded by former Marine, Jeff Morin.\nCoin Size Comparison\nMillions of people collect gold coins. Right now, they are lining up to collect the hottest new coins. Today, you can be at the front of the line by reserving your own 2018 collectible gold coin in uncirculated condition, before millions of others beat you to it.\nThis 1.5-inch antique gold coin, minted in the United States by veterans, is 3.5mm thick\u20140.5mm thicker than other minted coins. This increased thickness allows these 3D coins to display the sharpest detail and imagery in the industry, making them remarkable one-of-a-kind collectables.

I had just cracked a joke and gotten Ernie to laugh. On this day, I didn't realize that Stack and I were standing on the shoulders of the brave men of the 369th. Their LOYALTY and sacrifice opened the door for other African-American men, like us, to be invited to serve this great nation.

That idea grew from a few illustrations that followed a Japanese folk song full narrative and the idea of printing the whole thing with letterpress. Because of Kickstarter, I made that book a reality.\nShortly after the campaign ended, I had an idea for another book. I've been working on that for the past two years.\nTamaishi is about a little pebble who gets the idea to be something he's not, eventually discovering that its better to just be who you are. He travels far and wide across the valley where the little things live, to the ancient forest of Niwaki, and gets lost in the Great Sea.Read the first chapter!\nI use Ulysses for writing\n   So what are you making?\nThree editions of Tamaishi \u2014 preliminary cover design\nThere are three goals: a softcover edition, an audiobook, and a casebound edition. The book is printed using black and spot color on a Ryobi 2-color press. I plan on using black + a blue PMS and black + green PMS for different parts of the book as they have different moods. \nI'm still working on recording the audiobook, so I don't have an example just yet. But if you want to know what it might sound like, check out the 3-minute sample of my last book Z\u014dsan on soundcloud.\nExamples of spot color art!\nAlso available are 1-color letterpress prints \u2014 and a limited run of hand-watercolor painted prints: For a sampler of all the artwork, please see this blog post. Letterpress prints will be available for the 14 \"full plate\" (6x8) artwork. \nWatercolor example (not the final rendering \u2014 each unique!)\nSo how's this going to work?\nIf successfully funded, I'll start making final steps towards production. I'll wrap up the writing and continue ahead with the audiobook recording and editing. I'll work on composing all the music for the audiobook. \nI'll get the plates made for letterpress prints and I'll work with the offset press to determine the final paper choices and PMS spot colors. I'll begin ordering necessary materials for casebound books: bookcloth, end sheets, headbands, cover stock, etc. Then I'll let them do their thing while I work on the audiobook and prepare for shipping.\nZ\u014dsan was such a joy to behold in its final forms. I hope you'll join me in making this next book a reality as well.\n\u2014\u00a1\u2122", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been here before.

With the relaunch of our Kickstarter campaign, we have revised our offering from a paperback book to a hardcover limited edition--a true collector's item you'll be proud to display.\nThe book is more than 170 pages, with more than 100 photos, mostly color, by photographers such as Delena Gray Ostrander, Eden Saunders, Duane Cochran, and Jamil Zraikat. The core narrative, by former cast member Dwayne Walls, follows the cast and crew through The Lost Colony's 80th anniversary season. His observations are supplemented by first-person stories from Colony alumni.\nThe Contents Page\n  The book discusses the show's founding and major milestones.\n  A group photo from the 80th reunion is one of many photos featuring alumni\n    About The Lost Colony outdoor drama\nFor eight decades, The Lost Colony has defied the odds. From its improbable founding during the Great Depression, through flood and fires, playwright Paul Green\u2019s first and most famous symphonic outdoor drama is a study in resilience. And like the \"lost\" colonists of Roanoke Island, the people who created and sustained The Lost Colony\u2014and who continue to preserve its legacy\u2014are a study in passion and determination.\nOur fondest wish is that you will support our passion project AND take in a performance of The Lost Colony during its 81st season.\nAbout the Author\nThe son of a journalist, Dwayne Walls Jr. is uniquely suited to tell the Backstage story. He first signed on with The Lost Colony as a 19 year-old actor technician\u2014a hapless \u201cspace puppy\u201d who was too preoccupied with the itch of his colonist\u2019s beard and the paucity of his paycheck to enjoy his first summer with the show. But he returned a few years later with a different outlook and, even though his beard still itched, he grew both professionally and personally. Through his experience with The Lost Colony, Dwayne developed an enduring appreciation for the work and the workers behind the scenes, which is evident in the story he tells. After leaving The Lost Colony, Dwayne went on to New York City to build sets for theater, film, and television\u2014including NBC\u2019s Saturday Night Live. These days, he lives with his wife Elizabeth in Pittsboro, North Carolina, where he remains a member in good standing of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local One.\nPhoto of Dwayne Walls Jr. by Frederick V.

Over ten years of research has revealed the life of a relatively unknown artist/illustrator who started out to be \u201cjust a cowboy.\" Turns out, Joe De Yong was quite a \"mover and shaker\" who touched the lives of so many in the western art world of the 1920s through the late 1960s. His was a life of challenges, including overcoming cerebral meningitis in 1913 that left him totally deaf. Never one for self-pity, De Yong went on to become the only prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of his artistic hero - the legendary Montana artist, Charles M. Russell.  He would take the skills he learned and make a life in the movie business working with Cecil B. DeMille and many others.\nJoe De Yong sketching in the Judith Basin, Montana\nThis is a grand, untold story and the goal here is to raise the funding to get the book to print and into your hands. All the research, photography has been done and paid for; the money raised on Kickstarter will go to printing books and shipping them to readers.\nDe Yong costume sketch - 1938\nHow You Can Help.\nJoe DeYong\u2019s story is an important one in the history of the art and culture of the American West. Your funding of $50.00 or more assures you a signed copy of this effort. Together we can bring Joe\u2019s story to life.\nAbout Joe DeYong (1894 \u2013 1975)\nJoseph Franklin De Yong was born in Webster Groves, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. He had an immediate attraction to the cowboy way of life and when he was not at school he would help out a local ranches. If he wasn\u2019t riding he was sketching the subjects he loved the most \u2013 cowboys and horses. At 13 years of age, he started working a local ranch when he heard a movie was being made in the area and they need cowboys. He jumped at the chance and met the silent-screen's ultimate cowboy of the day, Tom Mix. Joe was hit with the idea of acting in moving pictures and followed the film company to Arizona in 1913. Somehow he came down with what was called at the time \u201ccerebral meningitis\u201d which would leave him totally deaf.\nJoe De Yong, 1919\nUndeterred and further focused on his love of the cowboy ways, De Yong recuperated by traveling the West - including seeing in an exhibit in Wyoming of the works of the renowned artist, Charles M. Russell. The exhibit stopped young Joe in his tracks and he started writing to Russell resulting in Joe\u2019s opportunity to move to Great Falls, Montana in late 1914 to work with Russell in his studio. De Yong would be the first and only prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Russell\u2019s staying with him - and his wife Nancy Russell - until CM Russell\u2019s death in 1926. De Yong moved to Santa Barbara, CA at the urging of Russell and his mutual friend, artist Edward Borein. Borein would introduce De Yong to people in his circle that led to a meeting with film producer Cecil B. DeMille. De Yong would go on to a diverse career in the movie business, writing and creating artwork until his death in 1975. Joe De Yong contributed much to the fabric of the cultural West and most importantly brought people together to understand and appreciate the need for authenticity and detail in the representation of the pre-1900, American West. A West that both he and Russell knew was rapidly disappearing. After Russell\u2019s death, De Yong dedicated his life to making sure the West he and Russell loved would not be forgotten.\nAbout the book\n  Alice and Will James (left) with Joe De Yong at right.\n\u25ca case bound with dust jacket\n\u25ca Hundreds of full color rare and many, never seen photographs, artworks, sketches by Joe De Yong.

Thanks for taking a look at my project. As you can see, I'd love to publish a brand-new book of paintings of my home town, Bath. \nThis will be my second book about the city. I published 'Brown's Bath' in 2008, and I'm down to my last couple of boxes. Rather than reprint, I decided it better to start from scratch (my work's moved on in ten years) and create a brand-new hardback gift book, to match the format and design of my recent London book.\nI've been capturing the city for twenty years now, always painting from life in all weathers, so I've built up quite a selection of images to choose from.\nThe book will feature 130+ paintings and drawings, as well as stories and annecdotes 'from the street'. I hope Bath's residents and visitors will enjoy this celebration of the city, as well as fellow artists and art lovers.\nMy London book started life as a Kickstarter project, so I'm turning again to you - my crowdfunding chums - to help me make this happen. The team that produced the London book are poised to work their magic on this project, but there are not-unsubstantial upfront costs associated with printing a high-quality colour hardback gift book, so I'm hoping you'll be able to lend me your support in return for one of the following rewards...\nRewards\nAs well as the book itself, I've got a whole host of other goodies for you to choose from including limited edition prints, original oil paintings and the chance to spend a day painting with me. Or, if you're feeling really altruistic, you can make a small pledge in return for nothing more than my gratitude. If you want a combination or permutation of rewards items that's not covered by the packages listed, drop me a message and we'll figure something out.\nThe book\nBath: Paintings by Peter Brown. 156 pages crammed with 130+ paintings and drawings, along with accompanying annecdotes to give you additional context and insight. Kickstarter price: \u00a325 (RRP will be \u00a330 upon publication).\n 2019 wall calendar. A painting of Bath for every month. A great Christmas gift, or stick it on your very-own fridge door.\nLondon: Paintings by Peter Brown - the fruits of my first Kickstarter project. Same format as my new Bath book, so a companion volume for anyone out there who hasn't already got a copy!\nBook Bundle\nContains all of the above PLUS 'Brown's Bath' (my 2008 Bath book); 'My Indian Travels' and a book of London painting postcards.\nLimited Edition Print (1 of 50)\nA rare opportunity to own a signed, numbered, limited edition. 18\" x 24\" gicl\u00e9e print of the cover artwork for the book. I generally don't really sell prints - you could say my prints are rarer than my originals! Here are the specs from the printer, for those who understand them: Cannon 4000 Pro printer, on Hahnem\u00fchle Photo Rag Ultra Smooth 100% Cotton Rag, pH neutral, acid-free art paper. 12-colour Lucia Pro ink which is colour fast for 80+ years.\nYou can choose to receive the print and my new Bath book; or the print and book bundle, which works out as great value.\nPaint with Pete The Street (that's me!)\nAnother rare opportunity: I offered this as a reward on my London book Kickstarter, and was delighted that people actually wanted to hang out with me for a day's painting! This time I'm offering two outings: one in Bath [SORRY! ALL BATH SPACES BOOKED!] and one by the coast (probably Devon or Dorset) with up to 5 spaces available on each day, so you'll get to meet other plein air enthusiasts too.

I did! In several expeditions with a small group of friends over nearly 30 years we were literally cut-off from the civilization for several weeks. There was no telecommunication, no infrastructure, no contact to anyone. Just us and the forces of the Arctic nature. Every step created a lasting impact on the ground, followed by a clear, crunchy noise as our feet compressed various layers of snow. The strong wind in our faces caused pain and one crew member froze his feet and couldn\u2019t feel them for several months. But we had to go on. By ranging deeper and deeper into the remote land we got so much rewarded by the real beauty of Frozen Latitudes. The experiences we made and the shifts in our minds were worth all the frost bites and in the end we were completely fused with the nature and everything was just good. We could not have experienced such a freedom without complete dedication to the very moment at the very places we were.\nThe remoteness of Arctic landscape lets the tiny person dissappear in the vastness of the snow covered mountains. What is man in the vastness of Frozen Latitudes? A breathing heartbeat.\n\"Our internal goal, which guided the external goal of looking for possible routes, was strongly influenced by the yearning for pristine landscapes, untouched by humans. The harsh beauty of the Arctic landscape, with its barren nature, should resonate at a deeper level and even touch our souls. Actually, we were looking for the permanent in the changing forms or for the eternal in the transient. Contemplating the landscape which is being shaped by ice through the enormous forces of cryogenesis, virtual Frozen Morphs emerged - visions of the morphology of frozen landscapes - which became a reality through our experiences. Comparable to the desert experiences of the ancient Christian hermits hundreds of years ago, our image of Frozen Latitudes was complemented by a spiritual dimension: how is each of us going to deal with loneliness and absolute self-reliance?\u201d\nExcerpt from the book's passionate stories.\nThe omnipresent fog covers Cape Flora Island, Franz Josef Land\nThe Fine Art Photo Book\nMy limited edition fine arts photo book Frozen Latitudes will give a portrait of the beauty of the High Arctic. It is my photographic tribute to the Arctic cryosphere which is currently undergoing a fundamental change by becoming un-frozen. Still, it is dominated by the processes of cryogenesis: the creation of landscapes from the freezing and thawing of earth\u2019s materials. The book's mission is also a call for more humility and a plea for us all to pay attention to the cryosphere and the importance of it being preserved for future generations.\nNature shapes icebergs incredibly beautiful, Franz Josef Land.\nFrozen Latitudes will be an extraordinary book of 288 pages with about 320 photos and maps presenting rare panoramic views portraying some of the remotest landscapes of the High Arctic in Greenland and far up to Franz Josef Land and the Arctic Ocean. They are solely formed by natural forces such as wind, water and ice and are perceived as existing since the very early times of the Earth's Genesis. Animals and artifacts often appear unexpectedly in these landscapes and set accents that emphasize the vastness of the nature with its inherent impression of permanence. In search of Pure Landscapes it is my photographic challenge to capture the everlasting natural changes which are hard to recognize by human scales.\nKirken - the Sagrada Familia of Northeast Greenland.\nSix text chapters will present essays about my experiences when ranging through the High Arctic and are supplemented by the scientific perspectives of the cryosphere and how it is affected by the observed trends of global warming, written by Professor Dr. Wolfgang Sch\u00f6ner - the internationally renown Austrian glaciologist and secretary of the Austrian Polar Research Institute APRI.\nThe publication of the book is scheduled for June 2018. It will be published bilingual in English and German by the German publishing company Seltmann und S\u00f6hne specialized in fine arts photo books - if I can raise the money for the print production expenses. For that I ask for your valuable help. Get inspired by the preview of the book below.\nThe Mission\nI ask for your generous support for my book project - you will be rewarded with extraordinary photos and ambitious stories full of passion for the High Arctic. Its remarkable design and layout will be produced by one of Germany's best photo book publishing companies. Any support is appreciated ranging from the beautiful post cards over early bird book bargains to personally signed books. You can even join me on the special Frozen Latitudes expedition to Spitsbergen and receive your personal book copy right in the High Arctic. Or you participate at the book unboxing event at my home in the heart of the Wienerwald, Austria. Decorate your home or event locations with one of the incredibly beautiful canvas prints with optionally handmade color finish from one of the book\u2019s photos.\nSo please do not hesitate and become an enthusiastic backer, go for one of the attractive pledges and help spreading the word. Thank You!\nThe Preview\nMockup of the book's beautiful cover and back page.\n  The book will be divided into six chapters.\n  Each chapter tells a story in English and German about my experiences when ranging through Frozen Latitudes.\n  The impact of climate change on the cryosphere by Professor Dr. Wolfgang Sch\u00f6ner, Austrian Polar Research Institute APRI.\n  Aurora Borealis at its best!\n  Read about a winter dog sledge skiing expedition with Inuits from Northeast Greenland.\n    Polar bears on Franz Josef Land in search for food. They are actually sea mammals and not adopted to an ice free Ocean.\n  Large ice caps cover the islands of Franz Josef Land. Enjoy rare panormamic views from some of the remotest places on earth.\n  Walrus eyes are red with a billion years old glimpse of the Earth's Genesis.\n  One of the remotest settlements on earth is Ittoqqortoormiit located in Northeast Greenland with about 400 inhabitants - 800 km away from the next village, over wild and glaciated mountain ranges.\n  Panoramic canvas print as living room decoration.\n  My canvas prints decorating the antique event halls of the Austrian Academy of Sciencies, Vienna.\n  Canvas print of Wiener Neustadt Island outlet glacier (120 x 80 cm)\n  Canvas print \"The storm wanderer\", cemetry of Ittoqqortoormiit, 30 x 20 cm.\n  Canvas print of Salisbury Island's glacier reflections (200 x 80 cm).\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Arctic can be a risky and challenging place, and apart from minor frost bites I'm thankful that so far I've come through relatively unscathed! Creating \"Frozen Latitudes\" might seem straightforward in comparison, but it is difficult to do well in order to have a fully pleasing and high quality photo book. There are almost no risks involved at this stage with the printing of this book. All the photo development, story writing and layout work of the last months is behind me. A noted publisher was found to match the high quality photo print requirements who is fully engaged to make the book a success. The final challenge is to ensure that this Kickstarter campaign succeeds in order to cover the print production costs, so that I can trigger the book\u2019s production for the Spring 2018 program.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac5 or more", "title": "Support for \"Frozen Latitudes\"", "descp": "You are passionate about supporting my book project without expecting a reward in order to help spreading the word about the beauty of the Arctic and the importance of its preservation for the coming generations.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac10 or more", "title": "Three Postcards of \"Frozen Latitudes\"", "descp": "Three postcards 10x15 cm from selected photos of \"Frozen Latitudes\".", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac20 or more", "title": "Postcards and your name in the book", "descp": "Three postcards 10x15 cm from selected photos of \"Frozen Latitudes\".

From its improbable founding during the Great Depression, through flood and fires, playwright Paul Green\u2019s first and most famous symphonic outdoor drama is a study in resilience. And like the \"lost\" colonists of Roanoke Island, the people who created and sustained The Lost Colony\u2014and who continue to preserve its legacy\u2014are a study in passion and determination.\nMuch has been written about The Lost Colony and the historical event that inspired it, but Backstage at The Lost Colony is the first book to go behind the scenes to offer a view of the show the audience never sees\u2014the grinding toil, the artistic vision, the occasional mishaps, the moments of mischief and glimpses of grace.\n  Photo by Delena Gray Ostrander\n  Photo by Delena Gray Ostrander\n    Photo by Jamil Zraikat\n  In Backstage at The Lost Colony, author Dwayne Walls follows the cast and crew through The Lost Colony\u2019s 80th production season. His observations are supplemented by first-person stories from Colony alumni and about 100 photos, mostly color, by photographers such as Delena Gray Ostrander, Eden Saunders, Duane Cochran, and Jamil Zraikat.\nThis is not an historical account of the show, though it does discuss the drama's founding, important milestones, and near-death experiences. Rather, we wanted to offer readers a fresh look at a legend in American theater, because, while we honor the past, we hope to illustrate that The Lost Colony, with its themes of freedom, community, hope, and optimism, is as relevant today as it was in 1937 when it premiered to a standing-room-only audience of more than 2,000 people. \nOur fondest wish is that you will support our passion project AND take in a performance of The Lost Colony during its 81st season. \n  The manuscript is final and we're in design and production, on schedule to publish in May.\n  Author Dwayne Walls follows the cast and crew through the 80th production season.\n  The narrative is supplemented with first-person stories from alumni, who share some of their favorite memories.\nAbout the Author\nPhoto of Dwayne Walls Jr. by Frederick V. Nielsen II\nThe son of a journalist, Dwayne Walls Jr. is uniquely suited to tell the Backstage story. He first signed on with The Lost Colony as a 19 year-old actor technician\u2014a hapless \u201cspace puppy\u201d who was too preoccupied with the itch of his colonist\u2019s beard and the paucity of his paycheck to enjoy his first summer with the show. But he returned a few years later with a different outlook and, even though his beard still itched, he grew both professionally and personally. Through his experience with The Lost Colony, Dwayne developed an enduring appreciation for the work and the workers behind the scenes, which is evident in the story he tells.\nAfter leaving The Lost Colony, Dwayne went on to New York City to build sets for theater, film, and television\u2014including NBC\u2019s Saturday Night Live. These days, he lives with his wife Elizabeth in Pittsboro, North Carolina, where he remains a member in good standing of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees Local One.\nHow We'll Use the Funds\nThe book will be printed in a quality full-color paperback format (dimensions about 8\" x 9\") and will be 160 to 176 pages (as this campaign begins, we're just heading into design and production). We set an ambitious goal of $15,000 to offset the costs of design, production, and printing. That's only part of the cost of publishing this book, and here's how the estimates break down:\nPre-press: $7,500.00\n Printers Proofs $1,000.00 \n Printing/shipping $7,200.00 \nTOTAL: $15,700\n This doesn't include costs such as the author's royalties, marketing, developmental editing, and distribution. If we exceed our goal, we'll use the extra funds to add photography and increase the print run.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been working on this book since early 2016, when we first posted a Facebook page announcing our intention to the Lost Colony community, which showed enthusiastic support right from the beginning (thank you!). We brought author Dwayne Walls on board just prior to the start of the 80th season, and he delivered a 37,000-word-plus manuscript several weeks thereafter. After editing and photo selection, the final manuscript went into design and production in January. We'll finalize cover and interior designs while this campaign is in progress, and the files will go to the printer in March. Printing bids are in hand, and we have chosen a printer in the United States. We're on schedule to have copies in hand for The Lost Colony's 2018 Opening Night (May 25).

Hemingway, Faulkner, Jan Morris, Steinbeck and Mary McCarthy were travel writers.\nWe wanted stories that didn't just tell you where to stay and what to do in a place, but made you feel, smell, taste and hear it. We launched the magazine online so we could instantly publish it in every country in the world. Ten years and 500 travel features later, we publish to a readership of 20,000 across 119 countries.\nWe have seen dozens of travel magazines come and go since we started. They were all great, but most fell prey to the ambition to grow, monetize, merge, get bought, buy-out, get famous... Nowhere never strived to get bigger. We just wanted to get better.\nAnd we did. One hundred percent of our content now comes from submissions. We receive thousands of stories every year and sift through them slowly and thoughtfully. The stories the editors select go through a complete editing and design process, followed by promotion and, for the best work, submission to national competitions and awards. We have won Lowell Thomas Travel Journalism Awards and been anthologized in Best American Travel Writing.

That idea grew from a few illustrations that followed a Japanese folk song full narrative and the idea of printing the whole thing with letterpress. Because of Kickstarter, I made that book a reality. \nShortly after the campaign ended, I had an idea for another book. I've been working on that for the past two years. \nTama and Kani\nTama\nThe idea of the story was simply about a little pebble, and how he wanted to be something he wasn't, like his friend Boulder. As I wrote, I did some research. Turns out in Japanese the word Tamaishi (tah-mah-eee-she) is a word that means literally \"jewel stone\" and metaphorically, a hidden gem or \"diamond in the rough\". \nThat discovery helped me write the story about a little pebble and his path of finding out it's okay to be yourself \u2014 a journey from the heights of the valley where all the little things live to the depth of the Great Sea.\nRead the first chapter!\nI use Ulysses for writing\nSo what are you making?\nOffset, Letterpress & Audiobook\nLike before, I want to make three editions:\nOffset\n Letterpress \nand Audiobook. \nThis time around, the offset edition will include a second spot color. It's a small addition that will help add depth. The letterpress will be still be only one-color, but I'm going to create special limited edition will have handmade watercolor end sheets and a watercolor painting attached to the cover. \n72 Pages this time!\n  Not the final design!\nMockup of the casebound version\n  I've been focused on the writing and artwork all this time, and now I'm excited to really begin work on the audiobook. Like before, it's more than just reading the words: there are multiple actors, a musical score and sound effects. I used to listen to these kinds of books on tape ( I still have some of them!). And I used to make book reports on tape (Thank you, Ms. Kevra). \nFor now, I don't have a sample of this book, but to get an idea of what it will be, please listen to an excerpt from the Z\u014dsan audiobook.\nWait, why not digital printing? \nDigital has its advantages. There are even options to print offset for cheaper than I've ever seen. But I have two motivations: 1) I've always preferred the look and feel uncoated stock, ink in the paper and printing with plates and things that are made by hand. 2) My printing, be it offset or letterpress, is done by artisans of their craft, in the US. It's archival, beautiful, and made by hand.\nLetterpress is tactile, subtle, and elegant, with the plates making a noticeable impression in the paper. You can see and feel the difference. Each letterpress impression is hand pulled by an artisan. Then the signatures are hand bound and glued and sewn together. The whole work is a piece of art.\nThat's really what I want to make again.\nWhat about MAKE/100?\nI've added a special hand draw sketch of the characters to those that purchase the audiobook or the twofer - up to 100. This will be drawn on paper using colored pencils as the base and a micron to ink it.\nSo how's this going to work?\nIf successfully funded, I'll start making final steps towards production. The writing is done, and the artwork is nearly ready for plates. I'll probably make revisions to both for a few weeks as I start recording the audiobook (reading everything out loud always makes you change things slightly). I've been in communication with the same printers as before and they're both excited to begin. \n\nI'll begin more focused work on the audiobook \u2014 I've got some voice talent lined up, and lots of disparate musical ideas. I can begin recording all the narrator parts and the various characters. \nPlates will made for both printers and I'll begin acquiring all the necessary materials for production: bookcloth, end sheets, headbands, cover stock, etc. Those are all shipped directly to the bookbinders and printers for their use.\n\nZ\u014dsan was such a joy to behold in its final forms. I hope you'll join me in making this next book a reality as well.\n\u2014\u00a1\u2122\nAll the illustrations\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been here before. I know the printers and binder and I've been communicating with them for months about this. I know the costs and what it's going to take \u2014 and my funding goal reflects that. \n\nThe project is small enough that I can single-handedly manage the fulfillment process. It's actually smaller than the non-profit publication process I used to run a while back (30 some odd books all shipped to Canada and back) \u2014 so no worries there!\n\nThe audiobook music will be a bit more of a challenge than the last time, since I don't have a folk song melody to work from, but now that the artwork and writing are mostly finished I can concentrate on that.\n\nIf funded, the magic begins:\n\u2022 I'll finalize all the plates and let the printers do their thing.\n\u2022 I'll get back all the pages and send them to the binder\n\u2022 I'll press ahead with the audiobook. There's no way I could finish this before the campaign. But while the printers are doing printerly magic, I am free to work on that.\n\nIf you have any doubts, please take a quick look at Z\u014dsan! I can't guarantee there will be zero delays, this being an artistic process, but I can guarantee it'll get done.

Because of my skills in this area and my years of proven success in the online marketplace I know that I can make this project succeed.     \nAug. 1864. Washington, D.C., vicinity. Seven officers by a big gun in a fort.\nPhoto above with cracked glass, missing emulsion, then after restoration.\n\nWhy back this project?\nThe U.S. Civil War was the first major war to receive substantial photographic coverage. The glass negative \u201cwet-plate process\u201d was not easy. The process involved traveling with large cameras, hand-mixing toxic chemicals, and developing negatives in make-shift darkrooms on horse-drawn wagons. Many of the results were less than ideal.\n\nNonetheless some of the images that survive are striking. They are worthy of our time and attention. They deserve to be restored to their original condition. This is why I have launched my Make 100 project: Digital Restoration of 100 Rare Civil War Photos. \nAug. 1863. Bealeton, Virginia. Capt. Cunningham of Gen. T.F. Meagher's staff.\nThe Process.\nI have selected 100 high-interest Civil War photos in need of restoration. I have focused exclusively on collections that have been scanned using professional high-resolution equipment. All 100 photos will come from original public-domain source items dating from 1861 to 1865.\n\nLimiting my selections to high-quality scans, typically high-resolution JPEG or TIFF files, will ensure more accurate restoration along with better quality enlargements.\n\nSpending as much time as needed, I will digitally restore each photo using up-to date software and techniques. Heavily damaged photos or negatives, for example cracked glass negatives or photos with torn or missing pieces, will take significantly longer to restore than negatives in better condition. I will pay careful attention to staying as close to the original photographer\u2019s intent as possible. I will digitally repair scratches, stains, cracks, missing sections, along with restoring original tone and shading. \nApril 14, 1865. Ft. Sumter view from parapet.\nPhoto above with heavy damage stuck on glass slide, then after restoration.\n\nProfessional photo restoration which involves Individual attention (vs. automated software) can range from about $35 to $100 per photo. Walgreens charges $39 just to restore one photo.\n\nOnce the restoration of the 100 photos is complete I will put all restored high-resolution files on a DVD. Each file will be saved in the optimal file size for an 8 x 10 print (2400 x 3000). I will also produce photo prints on archival paper using a top-rated photo lab known for their work with black and white photography.\n\nPlease note that I will NOT be merely printing these out on a home printer. I will be using a professional, premium photo lab that uses archival paper specially designed for continuously-toned black and white prints.\nSept. 1862. Antietam, Maryland.

Willcox's headquarters.\nWho am I?\nI am a husband, a father and a college professor (Ph.D. Philosophy) who spends a good part of my week teaching philosophy and communication courses. Now in my 33rd year of teaching, I enjoy balancing my academic life with family activities and pursuing research interests like historical photographs. I am also active on eBay and Discogs under the user ID SocratesofAthens.\nFinal thought.\nWhen we can restore historical items from over 160 years ago we pay homage to those photographers who had a strong sense of history; they knew that their messages would resonate with generations far into the future.\n\nI want to offer something of historical value at a reasonable cost. For about the cost for two people to go out to the movies you can own 100 high-resolution restored Civil War photos on DVD. I have also included rewards that involve archival printed copies.  I hope that you will join me on this project and help keep photographic history alive.\n\nThanks so much for your support!.\n1865. Washington, D.C.

This Kickstarter campaign is a celebration of that accomplishment. \nIn 1967, two years before the first man set foot on the moon, NASA had charted the entire route that the command module \"Columbia\" and the landing module \"Eagle\" would make on its journey from earth to the moon and back home again and released it as a poster. This chart has now been fully restored, recolored, and - with your support - will be launched as a special reissue. \nThe Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart\n  On July 20, 1969, two American astronauts ( Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin ) became the first men to step foot on the moon. It was a dream and a challenge set forth by one man, President John F. Kennedy, when he declared in May of 1961 : \n\"I believe this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to earth.\"\nIt took years of planning and the work of thousands of people to accomplish this task but on July 16th the massive Saturn V rocket lifted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center carrying three astronauts on their mission to the moon.\n\"All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of people.... All you see [are] the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others.\"\n                                             - Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins \nThousands of people across America and the world watched in anticipation, and all those years of planning culminated in celebration on that exciting day.\nSpiro Agnew and Lyndon Johnson Watching the Launch\n  The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart proves how well planned out the project was even two years prior to when the Saturn V launched the capsule into space. Stages of the launch, orbit, descent, and return were precisely calculated...and those who owned this chart at the time could have followed along with the astronauts on every leg of the journey. \nThis chart is a wonderful paper souvenir of one of the most glorious events in humankind and yet very few people own it. So I hope to change that with this project. \nI have fully restored this original lunar landing chart, bringing out the deep blacks of outer space, and the details of the capsule drawings. Then I changed the hues of the earth and moon ( to give it that added sci-fi punch ) and colored the text and lines, adding plenty of \"stars\" too. \nA fifty-year-old chart given new life.....it deserves it. \nThis reissue of The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart will measure 1' x 3' ( 12\" x 36\"/30cm x 92cm ). It will be printed on 80lb glossy cover stock with a UV coating and feature a 1/4\" border - in black - so it will be easy to frame. The title block will also feature foil stamping to really commemorate the occasion. This is a standard panorama frame size as well, so pre-made frames can easily be purchased. \nDetail from The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart\n  Detail from The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart\n  Simple rewards for a humble, but worthy, project......\nTHE STICKER SET - $5\nOne 4\" circular sticker featuring the original artwork from the Apollo 11 mission patch. The astronauts had wanted the image on the patch to be symbolic so they chose a bald eagle with its \"landing gear\" extended. The eagle is a proud symbol of the United States but it was also the name of the lunar module. To symbolize the peaceful nature of the mission, the eagle is carrying an olive branch - the symbol of peace. \nAlso, included will be two 3\" x 6\" stickers of the original Apollo 11 logo. \nTHE APOLLO 11 LUNAR LANDING CHART - $30\nOne Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart + the sticker set. This is what this project is all about. It measures 12\" x 36\" ( 30cm x 92cm ) and will come shipped rolled in a tube. As a bonus, you'll also receive all of the stickers!\n THE APOLLO 11 LUNAR LANDING CHART X2 - $60\nTwo ( 2 ) Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Charts + two ( 2 ) sticker sets. Double the charts, double the stickers.\nTHE APOLLO 11 PROJECT SET ( Limited to 100 ) - $50 \nTwo ( 2 ) Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Charts + two ( 2 ) sticker sets + one ( 1 ) 11x14\" double-sided poster featuring images of the original concept artwork of the landing and command modules. A bonus poster, plus a discount! This is a Kickstarter exclusive. \nWhile this project is listed under my name - Constance Metzinger - it will actually be a joint effort by my sister, Diana, and myself. I enjoy the restoration work, all design aspects of the project, and handling \"customer service\" while Diana takes care of packaging duties. Currently, she is running her own Kickstarter campaign called The Past in Focus which also deals with history - restoring historic photographs.

I don't think they would have considered the result to be a marginal American victory in the slightest, and it is hard to claim a marginal victory when your capital is burned down. However, it is game and a game needs to define victory, so I am good with it. I do hope that the upcoming campaign in Niagra defines victory a bit differently, as the result of the actual campaign that occurred can only be considered a decisive defeat for the US.

I will pick a photo specifically for you and 99 other backers, according to your personal wishes.\nSouth Water Street Illinois Central Railroad freight terminal, Chicago, Illinois / By Jack Delano / 1943\nDo you want a photo of a striking skyline? Of a landscape, animals, workers, factories? Should it specifically be a photo of a mine in Utah in the 1970s? You decide, and I will do my best to fulfill your wishes. Alternatively, you can let me decide and be surprised. With your help, I will create a collection of 100 photos of the United States of America.\nBingham Canyon Mine, Copperton, Utah / Unknown Photographer / 1972\nIf large photo prints aren\u2019t your thing, you can still support this endeavor in return for a single postcard \u2013 or a set of five postcards. And if large photo prints are really your thing, you can get one of five huge 20\u00d730\" prints, also selected specifically for you.\nThe photos will be printed on high-quality photo paper, leaving a small white border on the prints to allow for easy framing. Each print and postcard will note the photo\u2019s location, and if available its photographer and creation date, on the back.\nWhy am I doing this? \nThe United States are a vast, incredibly beautiful country. I\u2019m living here now, but as a foreigner, it still often seems to me that I\u2019m on a movie set. I\u2019ve been fascinated by the Library of Congress\u2019 photo archive of this country\u2019s nature, architecture, and people for years. With this Kickstarter project, I\u2019m combining my love for America\u2019s beauty with my interest in the Library\u2019s photo collection.\nOver the years I\u2019ve traversed that archive for weeks on end, so I know my way around it. I created personal photo books and ran a blog with photos from the archive. I\u2019m currently sharing shop window type and lettering from the archive on Twitter.\nHow will I find your perfect photo?\nYou will fill out a questionnaire giving me both basic parameters as well as more specific ideas that you\u2019d love to see matched, too.

Or you let me surprise you!\nLeft: Questa, New Mexico / John Collier /1943 \u2014 Right: Drillers at Fort Loudoun Dam, Tennessee / Jack Delano / 1942\nThe photography archive has its limitation, so while I will try to match more specific points like the exact place and year, I can\u2019t guarantee that. You might want a photo of three horses, but might end up with a photo of four horses in front of a beautiful mountain. That still sounds pretty good, right?\nWhy should you back this project?\nWith your help I will be able to take this journey into the Library\u2019s archive and create a collection of 100 beautiful photos from around the country. As a labor of love, this project aims to shine a light on the Library of Congress, to help them continue their mission of preserving and sharing knowledge and history.\nMillion Dollar Bridge, Cordova, Alaska / Jet Lowe / 1984\nIn the end, the project will create a body of 100 photos from the Library of Congress\u2019 archives, only connected by the thread of your questionnaires and my selection. I hope to exhibit these photos on the web and in a physical space in NYC later in 2018.\nWhy wouldn\u2019t you just print photos from the archive yourself?\nWorks by the U.S. Government are not eligible for U.S. copyright protection, which is how I am able to share my appreciation for the archive with you.

Will you love your photo? I certainly hope so! But I can\u2019t guarantee it.\n\nI will work with a U.S. based, high-quality printer that will produce and ship your prints and postcards.

Appearing in Renaissance Europe, the 'cabinet of curiosities' is an early ancestor of the modern museum.\nCabinet of Curiosities 1599, 1690\nA Cabinet of Curiosities or - wunderkammer - stored and exhibited a wide variety of objects, with a particular leaning towards the rare, eclectic and esoteric. Modern terminology would categorize the objects included as belonging to natural history (sometimes faked with objects like dragon's blood or unicorn horns), geology, ethnography, archaeology or historical relics and antiquities. \nWorking around this cool subject matter, creating/collecting pieces for a personal version of a wunderkammer became exciting! It took months of work but wanting to create a unique art deck it was well worth the time spent. \nCabinet of Curiosities - Alabaster Deck\nInside the Cabinet of Curiosities art deck is a complete series of 54 fully illustrated and imagined objects inspired by the works and personal collections of naturalists and explorers. \n  Each card from this deck is a juxtaposition of elements such as mechanisms coupled with an organic look that inexplicably forms a truly unique and obscure object. \nJokers & 2 of Diamonds\n      Cabinet of Curiosities - Court Cards\n    Card Backs & Queen of Spades\n      Features:\nPrinted and Fulfilled by NPCC\nLimited to 1000 decks \"no reprints\"\n54 fully illustrated cards & 1 double backer\nPremium German Cardstock\nMatte Finished Tuckbox\nCustom Perforated Tax Stamp Seal\n*Embossed Tuck\n*Inner Tuck Print \n*stretch goals\n      You can help make this Cabinet of Curiosities playing card deck a reality.

Sharing this project with your friends is a huge help that can get us closer to our goals!\nAll artworks are complete with just a few tweaks to be made. Our personal timeline for this is to have all rewards to be delivered by May 2018. We're just looking at getting those stretch goals to immediately start production. Here's a rough rundown.\nDesigns will be sent and printed by NPCC this February. They will also do the fulfillment so that will be a good thing since they're great with that. We have a pretty good relationship with them and have seen a fast production on their projects and their quality looks great. We also choose them for their manageable production costs and flow which we needed for this project. The cards should be ready within March and since postal services are not hampered by the holidays anymore around April this should alleviate problems for the transit of parcels globally. \n\nWe have made enough wiggle room for a June shipping but our personal timeline is to get everything shipped starting April to May. \n\nFollow Us Here!\nCellar Window's Instagram\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have created a lot of decks and personally created 4 projects and this will be our fifth.

We have learned to keep backers updated for all our projects and we will do this and be as transparent as we can going forwards. With a new manufacturer specifically chosen for this project and a more experienced team on our part we are extremely confident in our supplier and in our goal to make this our personal best turn around for Cellar Window from funding to shipping. We will try to beat our June shipping estimate!

They deserve to be displayed and marveled at....and they deserve to be restored and seen in hi-definition.\nThe ship Garthsnaid weathering a storm ( 1920 )/National Library of New Zealand\nI will unearth 100 rarely-seen images from these archives and give them new life by digitally restoring them to their original splendor. You can help me select these photos and then you will have the choice of any of the 100 restored images to own as a print. Together, we'll be archaeologists sifting through the sands of time and discovering rare photographic jewels to polish and bring to life again. \nWhat Kind of Images Are Being Restored?\nSailing ships, arctic explorers, adventurers in Africa, magnificent buildings, workers and laborers, thoughtful portraits, beautiful scenery from America's national parks, aviation images, captured moments from the era of the wild west ..... anything unique, truly eye-catching, and RARE. The rarer the juicier. \nThe Ghost Town of Eureka, Colorado ( 1900 ) by William Henry Jackson/Detroit Publishing Company Archives\nThis project is as much yours as it is mine, so if there is a particular image ( or a general subject ) you want to see included, spit it out and let me know! I'll hunt for a matching image and then you can tell me whether you believe it should be in the collection or not. \nJuan Domenjos flying an Antionette airplane ( 1915 )/Harris & Ewing Collection\n  A streetside view of Saratoga Springs, NY ( 1915 )/Detroit Publishing Company Archives\nPicking Your Print\nAt the conclusion of the campaign, all 100 of the restored images from \"The Past in Focus\" will be available for viewing online and you can then make your pick of which image you want to frame for your home. Enjoy a mystery? I can surprise you with a print! \nIf you can't decide which photo you would like to own, then you can own them all - The Past in Focus Image Collection will include all 100 images fully-restored as hi-res jpegs ( 1200-2500px ) so you can make 5x7\" or 8x10\" prints yourself. Only 100 of The Past in Focus Image Collections will be available. \nAn Italian mother with her child at Ellis Island, NY ( 1905 ) by Lewis Wickes Hine/Preus Museum\n  The majority of these images will be unearthed from the largest and most magnificent photo collection in America - the Library of Congress - but I will peruse libraries from the far corners of the world as well... libraries such as the Rijksmuseum, the National Maritime Archives of Australia, and The British Library. \nGrafton Street, Dublin ( 1903 )/National Library of Ireland\n  A Jewett touring car in the San Francisco area ( 1923 )/Wyland Stanley Collection\n  Libraries make it a practice to scan photographs and then upload them to their archives untouched and unrestored. Most need color correction, sharpening, and a great deal of spot cleaning to bring them to vibrant life again. It takes me anywhere from 10-45 minutes to clean and restore each photo. If \"The Past in Focus\" gets successfully funded, I'll be taking time off from my small business to focus on the digital restoration of these 100 images. \nScratches, specks, and other damage is repaired one click at a time\nThe photos shown on this page are just a sample of some of the past restoration work I have done.\nPhotographer Marion Post Wolcott on assignment in Kentucky ( 1940 )/Library of Congress\n  My sister and I operate a home-based photo business, so making beautiful photographs is our specialty. All 8x10\" and 16x20\" prints** will be printed and cut by hand in our home studio. They will be printed on Canon premium luster photo paper with Chromalife inks ( 150+ year lifespan ). All photos are archival so you'll have a print that one day will be as old as the image printed on it! \n**If there are more than 30 orders than all 16x20\" photos will be printed by a professional U.S based photo printer. \nThree-masted ships in formation ( 1899 )/Library of Congress\n  A grotto in an iceberg ( British Antarctic Expedition, 1911 )/National Library of New Zealand\n  The Past in Focus has reached its goal! In order to spice up the collection, I've added Bonus Sets. Every time we reach a new goal level a bonus set will be added to the collection. If you have already backed the project then these photos are a bonus reward! ( Backers who selected the print option will be able to select from these images as well ). Check back here often because every few days a new bonus set will be added! \nNOTE: If you do not wish to select a print or The Past in Focus Image Collection, these sets are available individually under the \"Bonus Set\" reward option. \nIf the project reaches $2500.....\n ....then SHIPS AND THE SEA will be added. This set of 12 hand-picked photos will feature beautiful three-masted schooners, yachts, and brigantines sailing the seven seas. \nIf the project reaches $3000.....\n...then THE AGE OF EXPLORATION will be added. This set of 15 hand-picked photos will feature images of explorers and hardy pioneers of foreign lands such as Africa, Australia, South America, and the polar regions. \nIf the project reaches $3500.....\n....then HOW BIZARRE! will be added. This set of 10 hand-picked photos will feature images of the strange, unusual - and downright bizarre! \nIf the project reaches $4000.....\n....then INTO THE SKIES will be added. This beautiful set of 15 hand-picked photos will feature images from the early days of aviation: aeroplanes, gliders, bi-planes, blimps, balloons, and the pilots that flew them.\nIf the project reaches $4500.....\n....then THE LAND DOWN UNDER will be added. This set of 15 hand-picked photos will feature images of Australia in all its glory: landscapes, city views, the people, culture, and, of course, kangaroos!\nIf the project reaches $5000....\n....then NEW YORK, NEW YORK will be added. This set of 18 beautiful images will feature scenes of the Big Apple dating back to the mid-1800s. See New York like you never saw it before! \nIf the project reaches $5500....\n...then SEASIDE HOLIDAY will be added. This set of 10 images will feature lovely scenes of happy beachgoers, lighthouses, and toe-dipping youngsters at the seaside. \nWOW! We made $6000 without a stretch goal....\n....but you're still going to receive a bonus set, of course. This time it's 12 images of Mother Nature in all her glory: waterfalls, mountains, geysers, volcanoes, etc. \nAnd since the campaign passed $6500....\n...another set just got added! Choo-choo, we're steaming ahead! A set of 12 beautiful images of trains from around the world. \nIf the campaign reaches $7500....\nThe Past in Focus Photobook\n....a new reward level will be offered. Requests for the photobook have been heard! I wouldn't want the assembling of the book to distract from the restoration work of the photos so it will have a longer fulfillment date ( April ) but anyone who would rather own the book featuring all 100 images from The Past in Focus Image Collection will be able to switch their reward at this level. It will be a hardcover, glossy, 115-page photobook with a very limited print-run of 100. Would you like your name in the book? You deserve it, so just let me know and you'll be accredited as an official restoration sponsor! \nSince we passed $8500.....\n...another bonus set just got added! SMALLTOWN AMERICA will feature 15 beautiful images from small hamlets across the USA. \n$10,000! ......\n....at that level we all deserve a JOURNEY AROUND THE WORLD! Let's see, we'll have to make a stop in England, the Continent, India, Africa, Asia, and certainly South America. Twenty images, twenty ports of call. \nIf the project reaches $12,000.....\n.....then it's time to have a spot of recreation. The A GOOD SPORT collection will feature 12 beautifully restored images of sports: auto racing, tennis, golf, horse jumping, boxing, etc. \nIf the project reaches $13,000.....\n....then A VIEW OF THE HEAVENS will be added. My sister just launched her Kickstarter campaign - The Apollo 11 Lunar Landing Chart - so this is sort of a tie-in celebration of space. It will include 12 amazing photos of observatories, early space photographs ( can you believe that moon image was taken before 1920? ), rare NASA images, and astronomers in action. \nSpread the word about the project and more and more photos will be added to The Past in Focus Image Collection! \n                                                         ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter project but my sister and I had previously teamed up to create The Spotting Chart Project, a campaign which was successfully funded by pledgers like you back in February 2017.

After the first three years of intensive training, I met so many exceptional Sushi Chefs who taught me the secrets of Sushi making. They also taught me the work ethics and philosophy of Japanese hospitality.\nIn 2008, I started teaching Sushi classes because I wanted to share and pass my knowledge to others. My first class had only three participants, but it was a start. I found out that there are so many people who want to learn Sushi but they simply do not know where to start, like how to get ingredients as fresh fish.\nThis prompted me to started Breakthrough Sushi, the first and only Sustainable Sushi Class company in the US. The year was 2011. After six years in business, we've served over 7,000 guests both corporate and private clients, teaching and showing how to make and eat Sushi.\nWe are a very small company, but I feel so fortunate to have so many big name clients like Google, Facebook, Pinterest, Prudential, Chevrolet, and Citibank.\nThen about two years ago, I starting answering Sushi questions on Quora, an online site known as \"A place to share knowledge and better understand the world.\" I enjoyed writing my answers so much so that before soon, I have written several hundred answers which were published in HuffingtonPost and Slate:\nWhy I Love Making Sushi More Than Eating It\nThe Best Sushi Tips and Etiquette From a Real Sushi Chef\nWhich Types of Sushi Best Test a Sushi Chef\u2019s Abilities?\nI put some of the answers together, which became my first book, \"All the Answers You Always Wanted to Hear from Your Sushi Chef.\"\n    While I enjoyed writing those answers on Quora, I realized people are interested in my story of how I learned the art of Sushi making. My desire to share my story grew more and more, so I started writing my experience little by little, every day.\nI'VE WRITTEN A MEMOIR\nTwo years passed. Now, I have written over 100,000 words and planning to add another 20,000 words to finish the story.\nHere is the outoine of the book.

I am asking for your help to raise the money to hire the editor to finish the book.\nThe current estimate to finish the book is six months, so we expect the book to complete in August 2018.\nI am going to publish it on Amazon Kindle Publishing.

You can read about his personal experiences with mental illness and his reasoning for making a game featuring this topic in his essay \"This Is Why I Created a Card Game About Mental Illness\", published on Thought Catalog.  \nOur motto is beautifully designed, slightly offensive. We specialize in making \u201cplayable art\u201d with a sense of humor. Side Effects is the first game for Pillbox Games. We\u2019re 4 Brooklynites (yes, more hipsters making games\u2014we\u2019re [ironically] sorry) dedicated to turning our motto into a successful independent game company.\nWe have more games in the works, including a Side Effects expansion pack (hint: NSFW), a global warming profiteering game, and Mud, a game lampooning the US presidential election process.\nWith this successful Kickstarter, we hope to have the support and backing to continue making more games. Kickstarter does not allow us to donate any of these profits to charity, but our ultimate aim is to support local organizations that speak to the themes of each game we create. Side Effects efforts will support mental health, our global warming game will go toward environmental charities, and so on. \nJen Igartua is unlikely to understand cultural references from the 90's due to the fact that she still super Spanish. Her daytime hustle is to operationalize businesses, her night time hustle we can't talk about here.

In 2011, he received a creative writing scholarship to attend The New School, where he received his MFA in 2013.

You are alive at a time when human beings are reading more than ever. But too often we choose sources of shallow information like news feeds, photo streams, online news, and email.\nRead With a Purpose\nMouse Books brings great literature to the mobile space. Our physical books are phone-sized, hand-selected, durable, beautiful, approachable texts that go with you anywhere. They never run out of battery life, they don\u2019t have screens that crack, and they don\u2019t ring, buzz, or vibrate. Mouse Books are all 48 pages.\nGIVING COLLECTION\nSince starting Mouse Books, the number one comment we receive from people is, \"I think this is really cool, BUT I KNOW SOMEONE WHO WOULD LOVE THIS!\" That feedback became the inspiration for this campaign. We created a collection of three books around the theme of GIVING that helps us take a reflective attitude into the holiday season. We're also designed a custom GIFT CARD to accompany the books!\nHOW MOUSE WORKS \nCURATE: Our Mouse editors carefully curate selections of literature, short stories, speeches, poetry, and more, all structured around themes that are topical, challenging, and varied. Basically, we create a great literary playlist.\nDESIGN: Each text is thoughtfully designed cover-to-cover to make the reading experience easy, fun, and beautiful. \nBUY: Readers can buy a single themed three-pack and/or a subscription of a monthly book shipment. \nREAD & SHARE: Read Mouse Books on a plane, during your commute, in a coffee shop, at the dentist, at home. When you finish your Mouse Book, give it a home on your bookshelf, or pass it on to a friend, family member, or stranger!\nREFLECT: Reading without reflection is like eating without digestion (Edmund Burke). Reading Mouse Books is just the first step: We organize online discussions, host weekly podcasts, support local book clubs, and provide thought-provoking questions at the back of the text. \nBUILD COMMUNITY: The Mouse Book Club brings people together around great works of literature. Join a movement of reading that demands we slow down, look around, reflect on how we are living, and imagine the possibilities of humanity.\nBook reader or phone junkie? Mouse is here to help.\nCAREFULLY CRAFTED \nMouse Books are meticulously designed. From the text size, to the thickness and color of the paper\u2014every element has been considered, tested, and refined to give you the best and most portable reading experience.\nSUBSCRIBE TO MOUSE BOOKS!\n  A one year subscription will get you one book a month, plus the corresponding audiobooks, podcasts, and surprises! Check out our page on Kickstarter DRIP! You can also buy subs as gifts!!!\nSURPRISE & DELIGHT\nOur team of editors and designers put a tremendous amount of care into the Mouse Book experience. Our objective is to surprise and delight you with every single shipment. From our in-house podcast book club to surprises slipped into your shipment, we are constantly scheming to create a mind-blowing experience. Basically, we want receiving your shipment of Mouse Books to be one of the best feelings in your life.\nWORLD-CLASS PRINTER\nWe are obsessed with making these books extremely high-quality. We've partnered with one of the great printers in the USA, eDOC Communications from Mount Prospect, Illinois, to bring Mouse Books to life. And since our printing partner is local to our Chicago-based team, we know our quality standards are upheld during every print run. \nMOUSE FEVER\nSome user LOVE:\n\u201cI received the package today!

We are offering them in a beautiful limited edition, and in ebook and audiobook formats.\nStories of virtue, stories of wonder.\nChildren's literature is the cornerstone of modern society. With it, we impart the wisdom of the past to the citizens and leaders of the future. Through story, through fable, through myth, through fairy tale, we teach the virtues upon which we build our society. There can be no more important role in literature than this\u2014and in this, children's literature is supreme.\nAnd so, we proudly present Seven Towers of Wonder, a seven-volume set of myths and fairy tales, collected by storyteller Bill Gordh and illustrated by John Hutton.\nStories from cultures around the world.\nEach volume is a collection of seven classic myths and fairy tales on a theme. Gathered from around the world and imaginatively retold by Bill Gordh and illustrator John Hutton, each breathes new magic into old stories, and teaches lessons important to both the young and old. The stories are as follows . . .\nVol. 1 - Courage\nDewando and the Flying Head (Iroquois - Native American)\nThe Story of Tom Thumb (Germany)\nInchworm Mountain (Miwok - Native American)\nA Bundle of Sticks (West Africa)\nMehmet, the Brave Little Mouse (Turkey)\nThree Friends (Thailand)\nSumac and the Magic Lake (Ecuador)\nVol. 2 - Courage\nThe Woodcutter's Dream (Eastern Europe)\nThe Boulevard of Somersaults (Mexico)\nMagpie and Milk (Turkey)\nHansel and Gretel (Germany)\nThe Peaceful Night (Scotland)\nThe Happy Man's Shirt (Italy)\nPandora and the Beautiful Box (Greece)\nVol. 3 - Justice\nThe Farmer and the Dragon or The Way of the World (Norway)\nSnow-White (Germany)\nAnacy and the Stone with a Beard (West Africa)\nThe Crow Ship (South America)\nKwame, the Parrot, and the Singing Canary (West Africa)\nThe Story Bird (Mongolia)\nThe Talking Eggs (African American)\nVol. 4 - Faith\nMr. Wanna Be Big (African America)\nDaniel in the Lion's Den (Bible)\nTime Will Tell (Middle East)\nFrost (Russia)\nSnow Babies (Arctic) \nWhatever Comes My Way (England)\nSongs for an Egg (Africa) \nVol. 5 - Wisdom\nTurtle and Knowledge (West Africa)\nHalf a Blanket (Mexico)\nThe Emperor's New Cloths (Denmark)\nThe Frogs' Chief (Abenaki - Native American)\nJonah and the Whale (Middle East)\nThe Best King (Thailand)\nTomorrow Monkeys (Brazil)\nVol. 6 - Temperance \nThe King Who Wished To Touch The Moon (Dominican Republic)\nThe Fisherman and his Wife (Germany) \nThe Talkative Turtle (India)\nThe Purple Jackal (India)\nThe Fountain of Youth (Japan)\nHenny Penny (England)\nThe Dragon's Eye (China)\nVol. 7 - Love\nThe Night Fisherman and the Mermaid (Indonesia) \nThe Three Daughters (Kazakhstan)\nBeauty and the Beast (France)\nThe Rabbit in the Moon (India) \nStrawberry Fields Forever (Native American - Cherokee)\nBread to Roses (Italy)\nThe Most Beautiful Gift (China)\nThese are no ordinary books. They are \"fine press\" publications (we'll get into what that means in a moment). Each volume is printed letterpress, and bound by hand by master craftsmen and each is offered in two different bindings: in letterpress paper wrappers, and in half Moroccan leather with handmade pastepaper - both hand-bound by our master binders. Each volume is in an edition of only 350 copies.\nThe books are printed letterpress using archival inks on fine paper stock.\nEach volume includes a fold-out tower illustration, with seven floors corresponding to the seven stories of the volume.\nThe letterpress paper-wrapper bindings.\nThe half-leather bindings.\nHalf-leather volumes pledged for individually come in a clamshell box; the whole set of half-leather volumes comes in a slipcase.\nSeven magnificent full-leather sets.\nWe are making only seven magnificent full-leather sets of Seven Towers. Each set is completely unique\u2014 one of a kind. The volumes are bound in full Moroccan leather and include gold tooling on the front. Each set uses a different dyed leather, so get your favorite color while you can! The sets are: Scarlet, Green, Vivid Blue, Purple, Yellow, Midnight Blue, and Crimson.\nWe are offering seven unique full-leather sets. Note: yellow set not shown.\nEach full-leather volume is hand-tooled with decoration from the stories.\nA master storyteller meets a master illustrator.\nIt has been an absolute joy to work with Bill Gordh and John Hutton who, together, created these seven towers of wonder.\nBill Gordh is an award-winning Banjo-playing storyteller, author, educator, and early childhood literacy specialist. He has studied and collected myths and fairy tales from across the world. He has performed countless times, including as the featured storyteller at the White House Easter Egg Roll on three occasions. Here's a clip of Bill reading the Turkish tale of Mehmet from volume one, The Tower of Courage.\nJohn Hutton is a celebrated artist, illustrator and art historian. He was educated at Princeton, Harvard, and the Courtauld Institute and is fascinated by the art of storytelling. He has illustrated numerous children's books including eleven titles for Thornwillow Press and several projects for the White House Historical Association.\nAudiobook and Ebook!\nWe have been working on these limited edition for nearly ten years now, and are thrilled to bring them all to the public. We believe that literature is for everybody, and so we are offering The Seven Towers of Wonder in audiobook and ebook formats - to be included with every tier.\nThe audiobooks present Bill Gordh reading the stories, and the ebooks present the illustrations of John Hutton. \nBackers will receive these monthly\u2014that is, one volume every month\u2014starting at the end of the project. It will something to look forward to in your inbox, every month through the end of the year and beyond.\nWhat is a 'fine press' book?\nMost folks have never encountered a 'fine press' book. It's truly something to behold! While most books are mass-produced in factories where machine spit out cheaply-made volumes meant to be discarded after a few reads, a 'fine press' book is made with master craftsmanship, with the finest materials, and with heart.\nWe start with the layout. While most publishers' first concern is minimizing page count (to reduce printing costs), ours is readability and elegant design. Our books are laid out by our team of master typographers, using specially crafted fonts and centuries-old design techniques based on the golden ratio. We aspire to creating an unrivaled reading experience, to enhance the relationship between the reader and the written word. In this digital age when you can turn a book on and off with a switch, we believe that typography and layout matters.\nA few sample pages from 'The Tower of Courage'.\nThen comes the printing. Each page is printed letterpress, a technique dating back to Gutenberg and the first printing presses. The words are literally pressed into the paper on our historic Heidelberg press. Reading a letterpress book is an experience like no other: you feel the text as you run your finger across the page. We use only the finest archival ink and heavy stock. While trade paperbacks yellow and wither away, our books will last far longer than we will. For this reason, Thornwillow books are included among many of the world's great archival collections, including the Smithsonian, the Vatican, and the White House, to name only a few.\nMaster-printer Sergio running our Heidelberg flatbed cylinder press.\nAnd then we bind each volume by hand. The pages are sewn together, and then bound in leather, letterpress paper wrappers, and paste papers, depending on the version. A great deal of time goes into the binding of each book, the quality of which you can feel when you hold one in your hand. If you've never experienced a hand-bound book before, this is an excellent place to start.\nEach binding is made by hand. Here the signatures are being sewn and glued together.\nUsing only the finest materials, and historic techniques. Throughout the entire process, we use only the finest materials, from archival inks to heavy wove paper stock. The presses and techniques we use are historic. In making books in this way, we continue a great tradition which has been passed down for centuries, and which is at the heart of culture.\nA historic Chandler & Price printing press, hard at work using our finest archival inks.\nBut that's not all: we're presenting three other children's literature classics!\nFor those who can't get enough, or for those who aren't quite ready to jump head first into the world of fine bookmaking, we're offering three s-h-o-r-t titles, three little gems: Cinderella, The Walrus and the Carpenter, and A Visit From St. Nick - all classics of children's literature, printed letterpress and hand-bound.\nEach of these editions feature illustrations from John Hutton, and are printed in multiple colors. They also offer a panoply of different bindings\u2014if you're interested in fine bindings, we suggest picking up all three! Cinderella is bound in handmade pastepaper wrappers, with a letterpress title label. The Walrus and the Carpenter includes an essay by Adam Gopnik and is bound in letterpress wrappers. And A Visit From St. Nick is bound in green cloth and handmade pastepaper hardcovers.\nA look inside 'Cinderella' and 'A Visit From St. Nick'.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have successfully completed several projects before, including an edition of Shakespeare's 'Sonnets' and Arthur Conan Doyle's 'Sherlock Holmes' stories.

Though it sounds idyllic, managing the island is time consuming, weather-dependent and costly. \nHaving made this work whilst living and working on the island, my intention was to elaborate on these difficulties, exploring widely held romantic notions about the Scottish landscape, whilst also trying to get under the surface to the vernacular level. The images attempt to show a \u2018portrait of place\u2019 through views, details and portraits of the people who contribute to the fabric of the island. I've always been fascinated by the way that humans leave traces and marks evident within the landscape; a calling card of their existence. Over time these traces build-up, layered on top of each-other forming a kind of catalogue of existence like a palimpsest. This becomes particularly evident in smaller, self-contained or continually populated landmasses, such as Tanera Mhor. With this work I wanted to explore both this rich past, as a Viking sanctuary, and a fishing and crofting community, and it's current state and the people who are leaving their traces today. I felt in a privileged position; neither outsider, nor truly local resident- engaged anthropologically but still able to access a degree of objectivity. The intention was to encourage the viewer to reflect on the relationships evidenced and challenge some tropes about rural life.\nEscaping Hebridian\n      Patricia\n   Firstly thank you for stopping by the page and spending some time with my project. The aim is to produce a stunning photography book of a stunning place, which gives something of a flavour of the area and the contribution people have made to the island.\nSteve\nCombining my images with texts, both from my time on the island, and several perspectives from people who have long associations with Tanera, I hope to give a rich and varied understanding of Tanera as a place. This understanding will ideally be specific to Tanera but draws parallels to other rural areas. It was important to me to try and represent the multiplicity and variety of such communities and, for this project, not to be solely about my own viewpoint, as a half-outsider.  \nRoslyn Bay\n  Eleanor\nTigh-An Quay\n       The book is not intended as a complete history of Tanera, nor a catalogue of everyone who has ever lived there or ever contributed to the fabric of the place. With a place like Tanera, periodically inhabited for over 1000 years, such a task would be impossible. It was my intention to create a small but timeless snapshot, focused on the particulars of how the island has been managed for the past 20 or so years. Perhaps also suggestive of other times, or places and of rural living generally. \nDerry\n     \nJane\n  \nTanera Bay - Looking South East\n  \nScott\n   This Kickstarter is an attempt to realise that goal. Much of the local area\u2019s history and traditions (as with much of the Highlands & Islands) relies on oral traditions and passing knowledge through spoken word, from one generation to the next. As such, much of Tanera\u2019s history remains sketchy, with the exception of the period when Frank Fraser Darling lived and worked on the island during the 1940s. I hope this book will be a modest, but more tangible contribution to the timeline of such an inspiring place.\nIsland Life\n      Thank you again for spending some time with my project.

They make the best playing cards in the world, including Bicycle\u00ae and Bee\u00ae, casino-quality decks. The smallest batch they will produce is 2,500 decks, so that's why your pledges will give me the funds and quantities to manufacture with such a great company.\nThis deck is being printed on Bicycle\u00ae card stock, with Air-Cushion finish. Air-Cushion finish is a linen-textured coating on the cards that give them an incredibly smooth, slippery feel. They're a pleasure to play with.\nThe USPCC's high-quality industrial printing presses give the cards a rich, vibrant colour, and the lettering is very crisp and legible.\n   The Rewards\n \n The Design Deck\nIn 2014, I designed and kickstarted the Design Deck, and received tremendous support from the design community, with almost 1000 backers.\nSince then, thousands have of Decks have been sent to dozens of countries. The Design Deck is available as a reward for this campaign, so you can have the pair of decks. If you'd like to purchase the Design Deck and get it right away, click here to visit my website.\n\nTypeface Poster\nAnother pledge reward for backing the Font Deck is the 'How to Choose a Typeface' poster that I designed. It allows you to answer a few simple questions, follow the flow chart, and then arrive at the perfect font for your project.\n\nThe History of Typography\nA few years ago, I created a stop-motion animation about the history of typography. It seemed to strike a chord with people, receiving more than a million views, and that prompted me to create the Design Deck and now, the Font Deck.\n\nThanks for your support!\nTo get in touch, please send me a message on Kickstarter or email me at forrestmediaco@gmail.com.

You are alive at a time when human beings are reading more than ever. But too often we choose sources of information\u2014news feeds, photo streams, online news, email\u2014that nourish our minds like candy bars nourish our bodies. What if we all spent 10% more time reading great literature?\ufffc \nRead With a Purpose\nMouse Books is literature for the mobile space. Our books are hand-selected, durable, beautiful, approachable texts that go with you anywhere. They never run out of battery life, their \u2018screens\u2019 never crack, and they don\u2019t ring, buzz, or vibrate. Mouse Books are all 48 pages. \n Here\u2019s how it works: \nCURATE: Our Mouse editors carefully curate selections of literature, short stories, speeches, poetry, and more, all structured around themes that are topical, challenging, and varied. Basically, we create a great literary playlist.\nDESIGN: Each text is thoughtfully designed cover-to-cover to make the reading experience easy, fun, and beautiful.  \nBUY: Readers can buy a single themed three-pack or a subscription of quarterly, themed shipments. Each quarterly shipment includes a themed series (three-pack), bonus books, and other surprises. \nREAD & SHARE: Read Mouse Books on a plane, during your commute, in a coffee shop, at the dentist, at home. When you finish your Mouse Book, give it a home on your bookshelf, or pass it on to a friend, family member, or stranger! And if you subscribe, we\u2019ll send you extras to pass around to people in your life.\nREFLECT: Reading without reflection is like eating without digestion (Edmund Burke). Reading Mouse Books is just the first step: We organize online discussions, host weekly podcasts, support local book clubs, and provide thought-provoking questions at the back of the text.\nBUILD COMMUNITY: The Mouse Book Club brings people together around great works of literature. Join a movement of reading that demands we slow down, look around, reflect on how we are living, and imagine the possibilities of humanity.\n   CAREFULLY CRAFTED \n Mouse Books are meticulously designed. From the text size, to the thickness and color of the paper\u2014every element has been considered, tested, and refined to give you the best and most portable reading experience.\n   QUARTERLY THEMES \nEach quarter our literary experts curate a selection of three pieces of literature (short stories, speeches, poetry, and more) that explore a given theme. Take the guess-work out of book-picking, and be sure you're reading dignified texts wherever you go.\nLIMITED EDITION BONUS BOOKS\nAnd there is more! In addition to the themed 3-pack of books, in each quarterly shipment there will also be some surprise, limited-edition bonus books carefully chosen by our team! (subscribers only!)\nONE YEAR OF MOUSE BOOKS!\nA one year subscription will get you all of this! Four quarterly themes, bonus books, and surprise goodies! \nSURPRISE & DELIGHT\nOur team of editors and designers put a tremendous amount of care into the Mouse Book experience. Our objective is to surprise and delight you with every single shipment. From our in-house podcast book club to surprises slipped into your shipment, we are constantly scheming to create a mind-blowing experience. Basically, we want receiving your shipment of Mouse Books to be one of the best feelings in your life.\n  KICKSTARTER EDITION - $75,000 Stretch Goal\nThe Mouse team is thrilled with the Kickstarter experience and to celebrate we want to make this stretch goal a collaboration with YOU. Last week, we put out a call for artists from the backer pool and got many amazing responses. Ultimately, we picked an incredible concept artist named Bobby Rebholz, who will help us create an illustrated version of an episode from the Arabian Nights!!!  If we hit $75,000 every backer will get one copy with their first shipment. (For subs, this be one of the limited edition goodies) \nTHANK YOU AND PLEASE HELP GET THE WORD OUT SO WE HIT THIS GOAL!!!\nFront Cover Mock-Up\n  Interior Mock-Up with Placeholder Image by Backer Bobby Rebholz\n  Back Cover Mock-Up\nSHARING EDITION - $25,000 Stretch Goal\nThe Mouse team believes that while reading great literature is an imperative start, SHARING great literature is even better! Our first 1000 backers at any level will receive TWO COPIES of Michel de Montaigne\u2019s Of Friendship - one for you and one to share with a friend! We're sending to the printer on June 15 and will get them to you ASAP!!!!\n\nMOUSE SHARING EDITION\n\n\nEARLY ADOPTER EDITION (All Gone...)\nOur first 500 backers at any level will receive an early-adopter edition of The Dead by James Joyce. This book is super-hot and cuts right to the heart of the Mouse Book experience. You'll also get access to the audiobook and a podcast of the Mouse team's book club discussing The Dead. (immediate shipping to US backers only)\nMOUSE EARLY ADOPTER EDITION\nWORLD-CLASS PRINTER\nWe are obsessed with making these books extremely high-quality. We've partnered with one of the great printers in the USA, eDOC Communications from Mount Prospect, Illinois, to bring Mouse Books to life. And since our printing partner is local to our Chicago-based team, we know our quality standards are upheld during every print run. \nThis is the actual Heidelberg Speedmaster XL 105 that prints Mouse Books!\nMOUSE FEVER\nMOUSE HOLIDAY PREVIEW EDITION\nWe had the idea for Mouse Books in late 2016. To test it out, our team handmade a 100-copy HOLIDAY PREVIEW EDITION and sent them out as surprise gifts. We kept it a secret from most people that we were actually behind the books, and the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.

It was like reconnecting with an old friend and it reminded me that there is no greater mystery in the universe than the human mind, which my neuroscience colleagues remind me has more synaptic connections than all the stars we know of in the universe.\u201d \n\u2014Tom in Minneapolis\n\u201cThe Mouse Books idea is exceptional.\u201d \n\u2014Cal in DC\n\u201cThe book\u2019s format is compelling, so much so that my wife has taken the book and hasn\u2019t let me carry it.

In this most curious of times I am looking for ways to see the larger context as some form of insight into how exactly we find ourselves here, not in a cosmic or existential \u201chere,\u201d more like WTF?\u201d \n\u2014Wendee in DC\n\u201cThanks for sharing that short story with me. I found it uncomfortable, exponentially exciting, and also inspiring, as I have been doing a lot of writing myself recently.\u201d \n\u2014Mac in New York\n\n\u201cThanks so much for the gift.

Watch this video to learn about the importance of preserving diaries, the focus of the Museum\u2019s first-ever Kickstarter campaign. \nWe\u2019re thrilled by the response to this Kickstarter campaign to raise funds for cataloging and digitizing over 200 Holocaust diaries and translating and transcribing three of them. \nAfter reaching our $250,000 goal we\u2019re excited to announce a new stretch goal: An additional $50,000 to translate and transcribe 10 more diaries. Back this project today to help Save Their Stories!\nPLAY\n\nThis is no ordinary map.\nUS Holocaust Memorial Collection, gift of the family of Joseph Strip\nIt\u2019s a deeply personal illustration of one family\u2019s harrowing escape and survival during the Holocaust. It\u2019s included in a diary\u2014one of over 200 diaries the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has in its collections waiting to be cataloged, translated and published online.  \nWe\u2019re in a race against time to do this specialized, expensive and time-consuming work, and we urgently need your help.  \nWe know first-person accounts are powerful. Most people are familiar with the diary of Anne Frank, and her personal account is often the first introduction that many have to the devastating history of the Holocaust. But it\u2019s not the only diary of its kind.  \nEach of the diaries in our collection has an important story to tell, of suffering and strength, persecution and perseverance. Written by people young and old, from diverse backgrounds and countries, they bring to life a broad spectrum of individuals\u2019 experiences during the Holocaust. Now, in the face of growing Holocaust denial, we must bring more stories to light before we lose the firsthand memories of survivors and witnesses who can shed light on the context of these diaries and other priceless artifacts in the Museum\u2019s collection.  \nAs the survivor generation passes, it is our responsibility to make sure their voices live on so that their experiences will not be forgotten. You can be a part of preserving history: Back this project and Save Their Stories.\nFor this project, we'll catalog, preserve, and make available online over 200 Holocaust diaries in the Museum\u2019s collection -- for the first time ever. The handwritten pages and notes are in 17 different languages and will need to be transcribed and translated into English. While we would love to raise enough funds to complete the translation of every diary, reaching our project goal will enable us to translate into English three diaries written by Jewish refugees who fled their homes to escape the Holocaust:  \nThe diary of Joseph Strip, a young boy who wrote about his family\u2019s harrowing experience over the grid-lined pages of his math notebook. \nThe papers of Lucien Dreyfus, a journalist and schoolteacher from Strasbourg, France, who was deported to Auschwitz in 1943. His collection includes letters to his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter who escaped to the United States in 1942.\nThe diary of Hans Vogel, who fled Paris with his family while his father was interned, which contains hand-drawn and colored maps of their journey. \nEach of these three diaries will be published in its entirety online so that people everywhere can view the original pages and read the translations. Like Anne Frank\u2019s personal record, these stories expose the truth of Holocaust history -- so that ever more researchers, authors, teachers, students can learn from them and help fulfill the promise of Never Again. \nHere is our estimated timeline for this project:  \nSummer/Fall 2018: Cataloging complete for all 200+ diaries \nWinter 2018: Digitization complete for all 200+ diaries \nSpring 2019: Collections for all 200+ diaries published online at ushmm.org  \nSummer 2019: Translations and transcriptions for 3 feature diaries added to ushmm.org collections listings\nThe Museum has collected millions of pages of historic documents containing details on the individual experiences of Holocaust victims and survivors. Although we are committed to making our entire collection available online, the sheer size of it makes this a lengthy, expensive project. \nEach additional first-person account or piece of evidence made available on the Museum\u2019s website--which is visited by millions of people every year--has the potential to reveal a new aspect of Holocaust history or highlight its relevance to the world today.\nThese three are just some of the many accounts we hope to bring to the public:  \nJoseph Strip (formerly \u201cStripounsky\u201d)\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum Collection, gift of the family of Joseph Strip\nJoseph Stripounsky awoke early on the morning of May 10, 1940, to the sounds of aircraft and gunfire. The Germans had invaded his town of Antwerp, Belgium. He was just 17.  \nJoseph fled with his parents and younger brother, leaving almost everything they owned behind. He carried with him a math textbook and two math notebooks, one of which became his diary.  \nThey joined thousands of others heading south through France, making a slow and arduous journey with very little food or money. In France, they spent a year trying to get farther away from the ever-encroaching Nazis. They managed to secure American visas through Joseph\u2019s father\u2019s employer and finally landed in New York in May 1941\u2014just six weeks before Joseph\u2019s 18th birthday, when he would have been legally required to stay in France.  \nJoseph tells the story of his family\u2019s harrowing exodus through everyday details and extraordinary sketches.\nLucien Dreyfus\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum, Gift of Monique Allen\nLucien Dreyfus was a dedicated journalist and professor of modern languages in Strasbourg, France. In 1940, anti-Jewish legislation was passed in France, and he was dismissed from his teaching position because of his faith. \nAs persecution against Jews intensified, he fled his town and sought safety in southern France. Refuge did not last long. In October 1943, he and his wife were arrested and just one month later, they were deported to Auschwitz and murdered. \nLucien had kept a diary since 1925, but his writing became more frequent during World War II, recording the realities of day-to-day life, the experiences of his students, and what he knew about Jewish persecution in other parts of Europe. \nHis diaries also contain deeply personal messages he wrote to his daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter who were able to escape France in 1942 and eventually made it to the United States. Lucien knew he might never see them again, but continued to write with the hope that they would receive his diaries. Miraculously, they did years later. \nHans Vogel\nUS Holocaust Memorial Museum Collection, gift of Eva Vogel\nAt the age of seven, Hans Yakov Vogel fled Germany with his parents and elder brother in 1936, settling in Paris where they remained until the outbreak of war. His father was separated from the family and interned by the French as an enemy alien at Lisieux, and later at Gurs in the south of France. In May 1940, just 24 hours before the invading German forces reached Paris, the rest of the Vogel family fled south. They traveled among a stream of other refugees, mostly by foot, as the Luftwaffe shot machine guns at them.  \nThrough the help of friends, the Vogels were reunited and settled in Oloron-Sainte-Marie in the unoccupied zone near the Spanish border. They remained there from June 1940 until April 1941, when they received papers from the United States Consulate allowing them to immigrate. They arrived in New York via Lisbon on the steamer Nyassa in August 1941. Two years later, Hans Vogel died at the age of 16 from an illness.  \nHans kept an extraordinary diary of their flight, including photos and hand-drawn and colored maps tracing the family's journey from Germany through France and eventual immigration to the United States.\nYour pledge doesn\u2019t just get you access to behind-the-scenes updates on the work (and often the discoveries made) during the process of cataloging, translating, and publishing these stories.

It's an expedition to map new territory in a dream-like world. These photographic hallucinations are a commentary on the real world: the colors are plausible, the subjects are almost normal. Look closer and the fiction is revealed. Delicate tones, vibrant colors, or subtle gradations mimic classic hand-colored photography. Inspired by oil painting, highlights and shadows are embellished with opposing hues of warm and cool to set the mood for the illusion. \n2017 Art Catalog\nThis twenty-seventeen catalog is a beautifully-printed collectible memento of the body of work and a conversation piece for your coffee table or bookshelf.

You will also have the opportunity to weigh in with your opinion by voting on some images.\nI will also credit project backers on my site. You can choose to be thanked publicly, privately (where only other backers can see) or remain anonymous.\nShipping Options\nIf you live in the US, standard shipping will probably suit you just fine. Prints are sent via Priority Mail and take 3 business days for most. Catalogs and cards take 9 days or less. International shipments are sent via first class mail. If you are outside the US and don't want to wait for regular delivery, ask me to quote express delivery.\nLimited Editions\nI am debuting designs that are available here for the first time, each in single print size. Once each limited edition is finished, it will not be reprinted. Many of these prints are being first offered here on Kickstarter and will be available to the public in 2017.\n\"Limited Edition,\" is thrown around haphazardly, but it has a legal definition in 11 US states. I take it seriously, producing small numbers of artworks under my direct supervision. I personally inspect, sign, and number each one.\nArtists have produced limited edition prints for centuries. The process begins by choosing a trusted printmaker. These prints are made with archival inks and 100% cotton rag paper. The product is acid free and the colors are guaranteed to remain at their original brilliance for at least 150 years. Each print is personally inspected by me for quality and consistency before I sign and number it.\nThe photography will be printed on a very heavy (300 gsm) matte finish papers. These are not posters or photo prints. The printing process provides dense color coverage that is as opaque and vivid as a painting.\nI work directly with a skilled, local printmaker who specializes in art prints. We work together to make certain the appearance of each color and even small details such as the texture of the paper are exactly as I intend. If anything doesn't come out perfect, we destroy it and print another one. Each image is printed in a single size, strictly limited to the indicated quantity. A certificate of authenticity is included.\nWhat is Archival?\n\"Archival\" is a word that gets thrown around a lot. There is no one standard, but for art prints it means it is intended to last for a long time. I use the best methods available to me, independently tested to last at least 100 years without a change in color. This doesn't mean they will disappear in 100 years, just when you could start to notice a change. Contact me for more details.\nWhat is an Original?\nTechnically speaking, a hand signed, numbered photograph, produced by the artist is an original. I don't use that word a lot because there is some confusion surrounding it. Each print in an edition is virtually identical (except where it is signed and numbered) so they are original but not unique. It is not a reproduction because it is not a copy, think of it more like having identical twins.\nThe limited edition prints are originals in this sense, and the gallery cards are reproductions of those originals.\nAbout Me\nMy style is candid and unapologetic; offering my unique perspective of beauty, nudes that are unbridled and aesthetic. I am a self-employed art photographer and all the images are of my own making. I have created and fulfilled several Kickstarters; it has been a great community to connect with repeat backers and a new audience.\nMore draft page layouts\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a low risk project.

Check out the full book summary in italics at the bottom, or watch the video!\nThe $15k will be used to pay my living expenses while I go to France, Italy and Greece. Sounds luxurious but this is no lux trip! The amount I would be spending to support myself in LA, matches the cost in Europe.  The primary point to going abroad is to get away from daily life, hole away and focus.  Also, there's some research I'd like to do in each of these places on ancient perspectives on masculinity, femininity and sexuality. And lastly, I am always deeply inspired when in these places, so it seems like the perfect fit.\nSerendipitously, I got an offer to sublet my apartment for the exact three months I was looking to go away, which means the majority of my living expenses for LA are already covered.\nThought I should mention... any funding BEYOND $15k that's raised would be amazing! And would go toward my living expenses when I come back to LA so I can keep charging through.\nAdditionally in the total amount, I've accounted for the 10% fee Kickstarter will take, and the conversion rate from dollar to euro.\nAnother amazing way to help instead of funding would be to DONATE a place to stay, negotiate a good rate, OR arrange for lodging in one month increments if you happen to have access to a place in any of these countries. \nAlso, if you need to make a more discrete donation, please go to my website, www.StephanieAllen.com/FundMe where you can pay by cc via paypal -YOU DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE A PAYPAL ACCOUNT- where it will read 'ICG Consulting' on your statement.\nDETAILED BUDGET\nAirplane ticket: $1,500\nLeftover monthly expenses from LA: $500/month                               $1,500 TOTAL\nLIVING EXPENSES IN EUROS\nDaily expenditure: 50 euro (1,500/month)                                              4,500 euro TOTAL\nLodging: 1,000 euro /month (or free!?),                                                  3,000 TOTAL\nMonthly travel (research trips, sanity check) LODGING: 30 euro/night, 8 nights/month = 240 euro /month TRANSPORT: 100 RT, 3x month= 300 Euro 550/month                                                                                     1,650 TOTAL\nTOTAL EURO LIVING EXPENSES = 9,200 = about $10,000\nEmergency Cushion (in case of the unspeakable, or mis-calculation): $2,000\n=$14,000\nKickstarter fee: up to $1,500\nGRAND TOTAL: $15,500 ish\nBOOK SUMMARY: \n\"This book offers a model of the masculine and the feminine that gives new understanding to how to interact as men and women in order to create a magnetic, electric, and powerful connection that thrives on our differences and necessitates equality. This is a guide to true empowerment as men, as women, and as a couple.\nAfter a decade of my study of masculinity and femininity through my seven years as a sensual body worker, host of a sex-talk show and my own sexual awakening through my personal relationships as a millennial woman, I\u2019ve learned what captivates men and endlessly excites them, is a truly feminine woman. And what women truly long for, is a man amongst men. We want polarity. We crave it by design with our whole being, physically, mentally and spiritually. Like the north and south poles of the Earth, a magnet, or a battery. Like the sun and the moon, like night and day. We crave polarity because we need it to survive and to thrive as a world, as a society, as partners and lovers, as men and as women. Yet we also crave equality.\nOur human history has, largely, only ever known the oppressed feminine and the oppressive male. Therefore, we need the \u2018Strong Female\u2019 and the \u2018Sensitive Male\u2019 archetypes of today. Yet, our efforts to find balance mean women are taking on more masculine characteristics in order to be seen as competitive in the male dominated world, yet in doing so, often abandon the \u2018softer\u2019 side of their femininity. Meanwhile, men are taking on more feminine characteristics in an attempt to avoid being a participant in the patriarchy, abandoning the very force that acts as a barrier of entry to the beloved women in their lives, their masculinity. In our attempt to become equal, we are also becoming the same. But what happens to a world that has lost its poles?\nWhat happens to the magnet that has no positive, and no negative? Or the battery? There is no energy. And without energy, we are incapable of powering anything. Our world, our relationships or ourselves. Without polarity, there is no attraction, no electricity, no connection. Yet ironically, we live in a time where one could argue there is the most connection. We live in a world who\u2019s economy is fueled by our sexual desires- our \u2018attraction\u2019. Where social media and the internet allow us to stay in touch and reach more human beings than ever before, where we can marry whomever we want for love. We live in a time of sexual liberation, with polyamory and a hook-up culture, where women are free to have sex without being shamed. Attraction, magnetism, electricity seem to be ubiquitous between men and women. But how deep are the ways we know to connect currently taking us? How much power are we actually generating from our current interactions? \nBecause of this homogenization of the sexes, masculinity and femininity, our sexual poles that lead us to connect with one another in the strongest way a human being can experience, are operating form a deformed state, leaving us at a fraction of our sexual and relational potential. So how do we do it? How do we attain equality, and avoid sameness? How do we exist as polar, yet equal opposites? What do these polarities even look like in the face of equality? These are questions our world is only now ready to answer.\nThrough analysis and philosophy, woven into my personal experiences through sex work and an evolving sexuality as a millennial woman, this book will explore:\n.What composes masculinity, what it\u2019s function in the world is, what it needs to do its job, what factors deform masculinity and how deformed femininity results in deformed masculinity. \n.What composes femininity, what it\u2019s function in the world is, what it needs to do its job, what factors deform femininity and how deformed masculinity results in deformed femininity.\n.What \u2018surrender\u2019 and \u2018submission\u2019 really are and why it is key to the nature of femininity\n.What \u2018domination\u2019 really is and why it is key to the masculine\n.The current state of masculinity and femininity, where it is out of balance and how it got there. \n.How all of this creates imbalance in our personal lives, our relationships and the bedroom. \n.How to be a magnetic woman- a strong, yet truly feminine creature that will ignite and captivate men.\n.How to be a magnetic man- sensitive and nurturing yet strong and leading, who attracts endless women\n.Why we criticize and objectify women\u2019s bodies and not men\u2019s\n.How our misunderstanding of the terms \u2018sexist\u2019 and \u2018feminist\u2019 are hurting us\nAnd more...\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThese days, the number one thing book agents and publishers will ask you is, 'What's your online presence'.

This is because, we, as individuals fail to do our part to heal our lives. When we heal ourselves, we are healing the world around us too. The ultimate objective of this project is to create a world filled with forgiving human beings responding to the challenges of the day with compassion and a desire for unity and peace over retribution and suffering.    \nThe Power of Forgiveness: A Guide to Healing and Wholeness is a comprehensive handbook to forgiveness as a personal healing practice. Forgiveness is an act of self-empowerment. It empowers us to create the lives we dream of by releasing our psychological and spiritual attachment to the past. As we create space for healing and transformation, we come to realize the true power of forgiveness to transform our lives. \nThis fundraising campaign will provide the resources needed to complete the production, promotion, marketing, and distribution of the book - The Power of Forgiveness: A Guide to Healing and Wholeness. \nThis book came into being almost magically. I have been writing a memoir for over four years, plodding along at a merciless pace and feeling like it would never end. So, I know all too well how painful the process can be. Not so with this project. I decided to write it in April, started writing (with the indispensable help of my editor, Nirmala Nataraj) in May and completed all ten chapters by the end of June! Yes, really! And, while it was a grueling two months for both of us it was also inspirational and, in many ways, life changing! As I go back and read the pages today, frankly, I wonder where the hell it all came from. My hope is that everyone who reads the book will feel the same fundamental healing energy I feel as I turn the pages. \nIn addition to pre-ordering the eBook (Amazon or Kindle) or paperback edition of the book at a discount, we are also offering a limited edition Power of Forgiveness bookmark and daily inspirational cards written by the author and created to provide us with the reminders and support we all need on our path toward wholeness. Feeling a little lost? Just pull a card and get centered. The bookmarks and card decks are available as individual rewards or as part of the Personalized Forgiveness Package, which also includes a hand autographed copy of the book!\nThe Power of Forgiveness: A Guide to Healing and Wholeness\n                Finding Forgiveness Inspirational Cards\n                The Power of Forgiveness Bookmark\n I am also offering many of the services provided at the Forgiveness Academy. With the \"Let's Talk!\" reward you will receive an autographed copy of the paperback 1st edition, access to online meditations and resources, plus a 1-hour forgiveness consultation with the author or admission to a workshop anywhere in the United States. The \"Let's Work!\" reward is the best deal with three months of one-on-one coaching with the author in addition to Personalized Forgiveness Package! \nLast but not least, a few of you will be able to become a part of the movement with a major contributor acknowledgment in the book and lifetime access to Forgiveness Academy courses and events by supporting the project with the \"A Lifetime of Love\" pledge. We are planning to launch three online courses in 2017 and I will be speaking throughout the U.S.  \nBudget\nThe following funding will help get the book on shelves and in the hands of supporters like you. And, as you know, we either make it or we don\u2019t. This is a baseline budget to complete the next phase of the project. \nBook cover design and production $3,150\nPrinting for the first run of 500 paperback editions $1,179 \nISBN and bar code purchase $350 \nCopyright registration $115\nVideo support $500\nPR / Promo $5,000 \nMarketing $5789\nFees $905\nSTRETCH GOAL: $24,979 to help make the book a bestseller!

I would love to speak with you. Are you a bookstore or distributor? Let's talk. As you know, this is the single biggest challenge for a project like this. Are you a reviewer or expert in the field of forgiveness or spirituality willing to offer your support? I would be truly honored to speak with you. \nSchedule\nDesign and formatting will be completed in December - January. The eBook should be available on the platform of your choice by the beginning of February. Printing will be completed in February, and we plan to begin distributing by the end of that month or early March. For rewards that include the Finding Forgiveness Inspirational Cards and Bookmark, we are estimating a late March or early April delivery to be conservative. Signed books will go out at the end of March or early April.\nThe Book\nThe Power of Forgiveness is a comprehensive guide to forgiveness as a healing practice. The author makes the crucial point that, for us to be the most empowered versions of ourselves in the world, we must prioritize our healing. And forgiveness is the most important path toward healing that we can undertake.\nThe book is made up of three distinct parts. Part I engages the reader in considering what forgiveness is, what it isn\u2019t, and why it is so important to participate in this powerful and often misunderstood process. \nPart II reveals the framework and process. The author offers readers a comprehensive roadmap with a series of written exercises and guided meditations toward forgiveness. The structure she provides helps to strengthen the competencies we need to forgive fully. \nThe final section of the book discusses concepts related to forgiveness that deepen our understanding of the healing practice. In considering the impact of personal forgiveness on the world around us, Hooks shows us in great detail how people who practice forgiveness in their daily lives have the capacity to heal both themselves and the world. \nAbout the Author\nEmily J. Hooks (me!) is an author and the founder of the Forgiveness Academy. I am on a quest to make the world a more forgiving, compassionate place! \nWhy? Good question. \nFourteen years ago I was homeless. After a four-year journey through hell and an addiction that left me very near death many times, I experienced a moment of grace that sparked a determination to live and find my purpose in life. This project and the work I do was born out of the suffering I endured, the lessons I learned over the past decade and a half of healing and practicing forgiveness in every area of my life.     \nIn truth, fourteen plus years has not been easy. Healing work is hard work. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard the expression, \u201cliving life on life\u2019s terms.\u201d Well, that\u2019s not always a breeze. And, sometimes I still kick and scream but what I have come to understand is that all real transformation happens in the space of non-resistance, or embracing things just the way they are. I\u2019ve said it for many years (just ask my son who can begrudgingly confirm), \u201cYou can\u2019t get any traction unless you\u2019re standing on the truth.\u201d \nBut here\u2019s the real miracle. I started systematically forgiving everyone in my life a long time ago. This process became a part of who I am. And, I didn\u2019t even realize it. I certainly didn\u2019t know the power of sharing my story and understanding of the process with others. Then one day not too long ago, I started talking with some friends about forgiveness, and everything changed. It was that simple. I started writing and working with others, and here we are today. My world is nothing like I could have ever imagined. And, I am so, so grateful for every day. \nThank you for your support. I am grateful for each of you and know, without a doubt, that this book will help you heal your wounds and transform your life. Namaste. \nWant to hear a little more about the book?

This is the birth of the American Gangster and although many books have been written and many movies made, numerous key figures from this era have gone missing. Characters like Monk Eastman who ran the lower east side alongside others carved out sections of Manhattan as their turfs. These hoodloms grew in numbers as the skyscrapers started to bloom. This was the birth of Modernism and New York City as we know it today.\nThe Eastman Gang's Headquarters, Chrystie Street, Manhattan 1901\nIt\u2019s more than just the stories of the gangsters, It\u2019s New York City as a whole. Other crucial moments of New York will be addressed including the Birth of Electricity, the General Slocum Disaster, the Triangle Fire, Audrey Munson, and Coney Island. It\u2019s an endless list of health hazards and political incorrectness. It\u2019s without a doubt New York\u2019s most forgotten time period.\nThe Bowery at Grand Street, Manhattan 1905\nProduction of the film will consist of archival, chronological illustrative and documentary footage. The funds will pay for archival illustration, narration, editing, production, post production and distribution. In addition various authors on the subjects will be interviewed. Books such as Monk Eastman: The Gangster Who Became a War Hero by Neil Hanson and The Starker: New York City\u2019s First Great Gangster Boss by Rose Keefe will help build the narrative. With your help, we can make this documentary a reality. Your support will do more than make a documentary. It will forever enrich the lives of those looking to seek information on the origins of the New York Gangster.\nThe Tombs, New York 1900's\nThis forgotten history of the New York underworld will finally be told.

The story introduced one of literature's most widely-recognized characters, a bitter old miser known as Ebenezer Scrooge.\nScrooge is greedy, cold-hearted, contemptuous toward his fellow man, and generally without virtue.\nRemind you of anyone?\nThis project is simple: I'm replacing each instance of Ebenezer and/or Scrooge in Dickens' original text with Donald and/or Trump. That's it. I'll take the resulting text and publish an updated edition of the book.\nThe plan is to publish a standard trade paperback. The book will be 6 x 9 inches (15.24 x 22.86 centimeters), and the interior will feature cream paper and black text. If the project were to overfund there would be room to explore including John Leech's original illustrations, or updated versions of them (as below).\nI should be able to begin a production run as soon as this campaign has hit its baseline goal. So while I've set January as the estimated delivery date on tiers that include the book, I am endeavoring to fulfill before Christmas.\n  Part of the reason you've seen so many different renditions and adaptations of A Christmas Carol is because the work is in the public domain. Since there is no longer a copyright on Charles Dickens' original story, transformative works are permissible.\nThat said, am I worried about being sued by the President Elect? You bet.\nNaturally, there will be some folks who find this endeavor in poor taste. To you, my friends, I say only that A Christmas Carol is ultimately a hopeful story. It is one of redemption, about recognizing the error of your ways before it's too late. Let us look upon and celebrate our fellow man, it suggests, no matter their station.\nIs it unfair to compare Donald Trump to Ebenezer Scrooge? Maybe.

We look around and see suffering. Sometimes what we see doesn't make sense, and our life can seem like it\u2019s heading towards chaos\u2026\nThose inconceivable circumstances are a wake up call for us to make the decision to become stronger, more strategic, upgraded versions of ourselves, and to choose to operate first and foremost from a place of love. \nOur goal with this book is to help you do just that.  -Bill and Daniele Hargenrader\n\nBILL'S STORY\nWhen I was 8 years old something happened that changed the course of my life forever. I\u2019m one of 7 kids, and one night, one of my brothers set fire to our house. \nNo one got hurt, but I got the blame, and I was sent away to a mental institution. \nI'll never forget my first night in the padded cell, crying myself to sleep, hoping that someone would come save me. I woke up the next day, and realized that no one was coming. \nI knew at that moment that it was going to be up to me to figure a way out.\nThis is a picture of me when I was allowed home from the Mental Institution to visit my family for Christmas.\nAfter failing many times, I finally did figure out a way to gain my freedom. And 11 months later, I returned home to my family. \nHowever, after being back home for only a month, another fire was set.I was blamed again, and this time I was sent away for 2 more years.\nI fought back, once again gained my freedom, and eventually proved my innocence. After many years of struggle and self development, thankfully our family was able to come together and heal. \nAlong the way I learned three powerful lessons that became the source of My Greatest Strength: I realized that we don't have to play the role of the victim, but instead, we can choose to be the hero of our own story. \nTHE THREE LESSONS\n1. The first lesson is the power of love. My parents loved me the whole time. They sent me away out of love, they sent away the wrong kid, but even then, I knew they loved me. Their love was like a life line through the whole experience.\n2. The second lesson is the power of forgiveness. My brother has grown up to be a kind and caring husband and father, and he is one of my best friends. He was going through some rough times of his own growing up. Forgiveness gave us the space to heal.\n3. And the third lesson is never, ever give up. Since then, I\u2019ve gone on to serve in the Army during Operation Iraqi Freedom III, after 911. I made the best decision of my life in marrying Daniele. I\u2019ve had a successful fifteen year career as a cybersecurity professional, and now as a motivational speaker I get to travel the world sharing with people how they can take their life to the next level, especially after they've been through something they weren't sure they could ever heal from. \nI never would have been able to get to where I am today if I gave up on myself back then, or at any point during the healing process.\nThese three lessons make up the core of the book, but there's is a lot more to it than that. \nABOUT THE BOOK\nI\u2019ve teamed up with my amazing, heart-centered wife and bestselling author Daniele, to create this book project.  \nTogether, we\u2019re co-authoring our next book: Love, Forgive, Never Give Up: How to Turn Tragedy Into Triumph, Adversity Into Advantage, and Take Your Life to the Next Level.  \nOur mission with this book project is to empower our readers to go beyond self-imposed limitations, reach their maximum potential, and become the hero of their own story, no matter what they\u2019ve been through.\nWHY THIS BOOK\nWe are proud and grateful to have thousands of successful students that we've coached and trained that are making real, sustainable progress towards their biggest goals, and collectively are making the world a better place.\nBut that's not enough. There are still so many people that are experiencing consistent emotional pain and suffering, however, the answers to our most pressing problems are just out of reach because we get so stuck in our own heads. \nDaniele and I have boiled down the answers and the methods, the strategies and the tactics that we've used time and time again, both with ourselves and countless clients over the past 8 years, and now we are putting them into our book that focuses on three areas of empowerment. \nBOOK SECTION: SET YOUR NEXT LEVEL LIFE VISION AND GOALS\nThe book starts off with the Next Level Life Vision section. You will be guided through an easy to follow, step by step process that will help you decide what you want your life to look like starting now, and moving forward through the next 10 years, all in bite-sized, easy to process increments.    \nNext, we walk you through identifying your major internal motivators that will set you on the path for success, and take you through a priority-focused goal setting process that gives you the clarity necessary to start making \u201cNext Level Decisions.\u201d \nBOOK SECTION: MAKE NEXT LEVEL DECISIONS\nNext Level Decisions are integral in achieving sustainable growth in any area. We all make thousands of decisions every day, most of which are unconscious or automatic and don't serve our overall well being. \nThe key to positive change is to identify the decisions that have the most impact, and then to consciously and intentionally make the right decisions based on your Next Level Life Vision. This book will teach you how to make these distinctions a matter of habit, freeing up your energy to direct towards what matters most to you.\nBOOK SECTION: 33 WAYS TO LOVE, FORGIVE, AND NEVER GIVE UP\nThe book will feature over 33 short, powerful chapters on specific, actionable ways you can practice more love, forgiveness, and perseverance in your life every single day. Each chapter teaches a crucial, in depth lesson, provides example stories and case studies to show you how to apply it, and is complete with and Take Action section that encourages you to get started right away.  \nHere are some of the chapter titles included in the book:  \nIt Starts With Self-Love \nGive The Love You Need \nThe Journey To Self: Why You Need To Journal \nBe For Giving (Selfless Vs Selfish Action) \nForgiveness Is A Gift You Give Yourself (And Others) \nLive Life At The Next Level (AKA Fake It Til You Make It) \nTo Be Great, Start By Being Grateful \nThe Five P\u2019s Of Perseverance: Passion, Purpose, Plan, Persistence, And Persistence \nHow To Find The Strength In A Perceived Weakness\nTo Get Ahead\u2026 Give Back \nLive Your Life\u2019s Purpose: Find, Create, or Copy\nRead the book straight through, or pick out the section you need to work on most in your life. Another massively impactful way to utilize this book is to focus on implementing one lesson in your life for a week at a time, and watch the quality of your thoughts and habits take on an extraordinary new direction.\nBOOK SECTION: PROGRESS TRACKER\nTo ensure you\u2019re making meaningful progress and staying on track with your goals, we\u2019re including a section on how to measure your progress. As a bonus, we\u2019re providing links to bonus materials that will give you access to free online daily progress trackers and checklists to make sure you maximize and sustain your gains!\nBOOK SECTION: 99 EXPERTS AND AUTHORS\nIn this book, we\u2019re not just sharing our experiences, but also the wisdom of 99 experts who have used those three powerful lessons in their own lives time and time again to overcome indomitable challenges and take their lives to places they only dreamed possible including Priya Rana Kapoor, Samara O\u2019Shea, Ron Sparkman, Bershan Shaw, Kip Brooks, Pam Vredevelt, Austin Hill Shaw, Linda Babulic, Andrea Nakayama, Lisa Van Ahn, Joe Donaway, Kelly Standing, Tom Scarda, Kim Julen, Asha Brown, Dr. Jody Stanislaw, Dr. David Anderson, Julie Jacky and many more!\nBACKER REWARDS\nWe have some great rewards we\u2019ve put together for our backers. Together, Daniele and I have backed over 50 Kickstarter campaigns, and created one successfully funded one of our own in the past, so we know the level of value the Kickstarter community has come to expect.\nBackers can receive our self-empowerment book that will help you overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles, or you can gift this book to someone you know who is going through a trying time and is looking for guidance on finding a way out of the dark.\nFor our early bird backers, we\u2019re offering the book at prices lower than suggested retail.\nWe also have a Companion Journal reward level so you can track your progress and growth as you move through the book. \nWe have a couple of exclusive Kickstarter only rewards such as the making of the book, where we meet with you over webinar monthly to follow along with the design and progress of the book's journey.\nWe also have our 10X Bonus level, where we are offering literally 10X the value of what you pledge in the form of online training in the areas of health, fitness, motivation, mindset, optimized entrepreneurialism and much more.\nDaniele and I are fully committed to finishing this book. Your support will help this project be successful by allowing us to get it finished faster, and get it professionally edited, published, and marketed. The most exciting outcome is the massive impact we will have as a community focused on amplifying the message of spreading love, both to ourselves and others.\nTHANK YOU AND THE MOVEMENT TOWARDS LOVE\nThe movement towards living our lives from a place of love has already begun. We are a force multiplier, a focusing lens magnifying the power of love. We\u2019re acting as a catalyst. With your help, we will get the movement going faster. \nWe are infinitely grateful for you. Thanks for watching/reading, thanks for your support and encouragement, thanks for backing us, and thanks for sharing this project with your family, friends, followers and fans. And remember to Love Strongly, Be Forgiving, and Never, Ever Give Up. \nGIVING BACK \u2013 LOVE, FORGIVE, NEVER GIVE UP SCHOLARSHIP\nSadly, some of my classmates from Clearview Regional High School have passed away recently. It made me reflect on how influential my high school years were in shaping who I have become today.   \nDaniele and I have decided to dedicate a portion of future book proceeds towards funding the \u201cLove, Forgive, Never Give Up Scholarship.\u201d  \nThis scholarship will be awarded to selected students who write an essay on how these values have had a positive impact on their life in overcoming tragedy and adversity.  \nWe are starting with Clearview Regional High School and Northeast High School (Philadelphia), and will look to expand to other schools in the future.\n\u201cThe secret to living is giving.\u201d -Tony Robbins.\nABOUT US\n\u201cBill is the real deal. I want my leader with battle wounds. I don\u2019t want any leaders who are polished and unscathed. That leadership ain\u2019t working. This is what leadership looks like. This is what it looks like.\u201d -Bo Eason, Former NFL standout, acclaimed Broadway performer, and story coach  \n\u201cIf every single person living with diabetes could read this book and apply Daniele\u2019s life-changing wisdom, millions of lives would be improved, billions of dollars would be saved, and the face of health in America would be entirely transformed.\u201d  -Dr. Jody Stanislaw, PWD, Naturopathic Doctor, and Author, Hunger\nIn the last nine years, we have spent more money on coaching, training and masterminds then most pay for a college degree. We\u2019ve mentored and trained with the leading business and personal development influencers in the world including Tony Robbins, Brendon Burchard, Jeff Walker, Bo Eason, Roger Love, Ryan Deiss, Rick Frishman, Steve Harrison, Jack Canfield, Les Brown, and many more.     \nWe've honed our strategies and systems with our students, and now we are unbelievably excited to be able to share the best of what we\u2019ve learned with you in Love, Forgive, Never Give Up.\nBill Hargenrader\nBill in Tikrit during Operation Iraqi Freedom III in 2005\nBill Hargenrader is a United States Army Veteran, a Fortune 500 Project Management Professional focusing on cybersecurity and innovation, a space & Mars advocate, and founder of Next Level Life, where he focuses on empowering entrepreneurs and artists so we can massively change the world for the better, together. Bill is the bestselling author of the Mars Journey series.\nHere is the full version of the talk that was shown in the Kickstarter video. \nDaniele Hargenrader\nDaniele giving one of her Interactive Fitness Presentations.\nDaniele Hargenrader, aka the Diabetes Dominator, is a nutritionist, certified health coach and personal trainer, international speaker, and entrepreneur. She helps individuals to think, eat, and move in ways that allow them to create the self-love necessary to build a happy, healthy life. She has been featured in the Philadelphia Inquirer, presented at Fortune 500 companies and top-ranked hospitals and universities, and has dedicated herself to teaching people how to live the life they imagined through optimal health. She is the bestselling author of Unleash Your Inner Diabetes Dominator.\nDANIELE'S STORY\nMy story started over 25 years ago from diagnosis with type 1 diabetes at age 9, the unexpected death of my father 3 years later, battling binge eating and depression while ballooning up to 200 lbs with diabetes out of control, and finally deciding to fight back in order to live the life I desired. Now I get to help others live the life they always dreamed was possible.\nWatch the video to learn more:  \nWHAT THE EXPERTS ARE SAYING\n\u201cDaniele's determination to transform her life to what it is today, despite the hardships she has endured, is infectious. She inspires her clients, friends, and the entire diabetes community to live with strength and passion. Anyone will benefit from reading this book.\u201d \u2014Asha Agar Brown, PWD Founder and Executive Director, We Are Diabetes\n\u201cBill has an amazing, vulnerable and heartfelt story to tell that will make you think twice about how you\u2019re approaching your life and business. He is one of the rare few individuals I know who demonstrates what it is to REALLY walk the walk.\u201d -Michael Rozbruch, Founder at Michael Rozbruch\u2019s Tax and Business Solutions Academy\n\u201cWhen I heard Bill\u2019s story I got choked up. To know where he is now after hearing just a fraction of his journey will help dissolve any doubt you have about your own. Bill has every reason to be bitter and cynical yet he is one of the generous and beautiful souls I\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting. His gratitude for life seems to only be trumped by his passion for helping others. Hearing his story has altered my life in ways that I lack the vocabulary to fully express but I know I am but one of many lives he will change along his journey.\u201d -Kip Brooks, Founder at Rebirth Coaching\n\"Daniele's story of diving headfirst into change with intention and determination is loaded with inspiration. It fills me with hope, courage, and knowledge that I can make positive, lasting changes in my life! You deserve to know Daniele. You need to know Daniele.\" \u2014Scott Johnson, PWD Blogger, Patient Advocate, Board Member, Diabetes Hands Foundation\n\"Bill's story is one of the most incredible examples of perseverance and inner strength there is. His ability to not only overcome, but forgive and move forward is world class.\" - Brent Seal // CEO of Mavrixx // Mountaineer\nThis is a human who has been through the fire and come away from the experience as a phoenix. You can't make a diamond without subjecting carbon to extreme pressure. Bill Hargenrader is one of those diamonds. -Kathleen Starmer, founder of the women's emergency preparedness movement \n\u201cEach time I hear Bill share his story of how he was sent to a mental institution for a crime he did not commit, twice, and how he found the strength to overcome the situation (and his darkest times) to choose to become the hero in his life, I not only get inspired to show up even more in my own life, it makes me even more aware of how I easily judge and blame my own children. It reminds me to listen even more full heartedly, seek the truth and most importantly to be more compassionate, loving, understanding and chose to forgive.\" -Kimberly A. St-Laurent, Founder, KAST Consultation\n\u201cBill Hargenrader is genuine and his zest for life is contagious. You can feel that he is authentic and you want to hear what he has to say. He can show you what it takes to overcome life\u2019s biggest obstacles because he has done it. If you are struggling, don\u2019t miss any opportunity to hear this man speak\u2026 you will be forever impacted by his story.\u201d -Donna Harnett, Owner at Give Send Connect\n\"Sometimes Darkest hours is the best time to see the light within you is the first thing I felt when I read Bill's story. It was truly inspiring and affirmative of Hero's journey through the darkest hours into greatness. His story will surely stir your soul and make you believe in yourself to achieve your greatness.\" Karti Keyan, Creator of Execution Mastery and Founder of Life Hacker's Academy\n\"The thing with Bill's experience is that, at its core, it's a very human story. It shares the same struggle we all face: to make the world notice who we truly are as it tries to convince us we're something we're not. His story of overcoming the odds is one that is sure to inspire and motivate you to make the most out of your life.\" Ron Sparkman, Founder UpportunityU\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always challenges to any project, though with this one, those challenges have been intentionally mitigated. \nI am a Fortune 500 Project Management Professional, and I am managing all the tasks for book creation, reward fulfillment and more. \nDaniele and I have self-published 4 books (all of which have become bestsellers on Amazon), and we have a repeatable, proven system to finish a book from start to finish. \nWe will finish the book no matter what!

We believe that Kickstarter is the ideal platform for this, specifically, because we want to put it in front of a group of people who are willing to help one another - and what better than the Kickstarter community?! We will be doing something that no one has ever done before, kind of like our own social experiment.\n Inner Specs:\nAnnual goal setting guide to help you brainstorm, define, and create actions for your goals your one month, 1 year, 3 year and lifetime goals\nWeekly layouts (Sunday - Monday) that run from the beginning of August 2015 to the beginning of August 2016 \nAnnual and monthly overview calendars \nMonthly check in reflection questions to get you thinking about progress, gratitude and steps for improvement \nAdditional gridded pages\nOuter Specs:\nSoft and durable faux leather cover; animal and vegan friendly! \nSuper smooth high quality 100 gsm thick paper, about twice as thick as a standard sheet of printer paper to resist ink bleeding from fountain pens \n\"Kickstarter green\" bookmarking ribbon \nElastic enclosure strap \nDurable fabric pocket in the back\nAbout 200 pages \nAvailable in Classic (8.5\u201d x 11\u201d) and Compact (5.5\u201d x 8.5\u201d) sizes\nFaux leather embossing!

We are immensely appreciative for your part in helping to make this film a reality. We are humbled by the immense number of people who have joined together, and for each of your contributions. Your enthusiastic notes, posts, and encouragement along the way kept our spirits high, we felt the letterpress love.\nWe are very excited to begin production of the film this Summer!\nAny additional funding we receive past our initial goal will be put to use. Increased funds will enable us to:\nFilm at additional locations across the country documenting more printers, more stories, and additional knowledge of the craft.\nDevelopment of bonus material for the DVD/Blu-Ray including several 3-4 minute bonus featurettes \nCreation of an Educational Multimedia Archive to help share and teach letterpress.\nThank you so much for making the film possible!\nWith gratitude, Erin and the Pressing On Team\nWhy has letterpress printing survived? Pressing On is a documentary examining the relevance of a physical process that is anything but modern! We have faster, cheaper methods to print things now \u2013 so why has this endured?\nAs the individuals who have kept letterpress alive are aging quickly, irreplaceable knowledge and techniques stand in danger of being lost forever. However, there is hope! A dedicated faction of young printers, designers, and hobbyists are on a quest to preserve letterpress.\nWith traditional tools and processes, they push the boundaries of contemporary creativity while sustaining the historic knowledge of the craft. Pressing On will explore the historic culture, the close community, and the remarkable craftsmen who are making letterpress thrive.\nWatch a video about the film, check out our rewards, and get involved below!\nI'm Erin Beckloff, a graphic design educator, historian, letterpress printer and co-director of Pressing On. I teach graphic design at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio where I revitalized the Department of Art's letterpress program. I study letterpress through practical application and the shared knowledge of printers, beginning my journey as an intern at Hatch Show Print.\nReceiving my first press six years ago as a wedding gift led me to discover a community of printers who share a love of the traditional process and who have helped save letterpress printing. Here's why Pressing On is so important:\nI am a part of the new, explorative generation of printers. Some of us are educators, others are shop owners, printmakers, artists, hobbyists and graphic designers. These printers respect the traditional process while using it in innovative ways. We give an old technology new life in a digital age.\nThrough Pressing On we want to show both generations and discover the relationships and passion for the craft that they share. We feel a responsibility to capture the knowledge of these printers.\nLetterpress is a tactile and visual medium. From the presses and ornate type to the imperfectly beautiful prints, it all has a richness that needs to be shown. I've partnered with Bayonet Media, an Emmy Award winning production company with a gift for visual storytelling. Together we will be able to document letterpress in a way that I could never have achieved on my own.\nWe have the letterpress characters (both literal and figurative!), and the skills to create this film, but we need to expand the community supporting this craft. We want to document the entire process including hand-casting type from the time of Gutenberg and the 500 years following, to creating a stunning poster in 19th century wood and metal type.\nThe Pressing On Production Team\nThis summer we will be hitting the road to travel across America to film interviews with our initial cast of characters. We'll visit printers, the annual APA Wayzgoose conference, type-casters, and graphic designers across multiple states. Printing presses and type are unique. The same goes for our list of characters:\nPressing On Cast of Printers\nPaul Aken, The Platen Press Museum\nCelene Aubry, Hatch Show Print\nDave Churchman, Hobby Printer\nJim Daggs, Ackley Publishing Co.\nJennifer Farrell, Starshaped Press\nRichard L.

For information, bios, and more, visit Pressing On's website at www.letterpressfilm.com. \nWhether you have printed, or know someone who did, we want to connect with as many people as we can. Projects like this are only possible with a large number of small backers. Please share this link with your friends and family. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for regular updates and sneak peeks! \nIf you are interested in helping letterpress survive in your community or investing in the project in a deeper way, email info@letterpressfilm.com. We'd love to have a conversation!\nThe money we raise on Kickstarter will allow us to go into production this summer and have a completed film within a year. It's a tight time frame but we are confident we can achieve it. Working with Bayonet Media, a production company based in Indianapolis, we will make the most of our valuable time with both our printers and production team. The funds raised will cover all production filming, rentals, crew, travel costs, and the entire post production process. Together, we will bring this documentary film to life. For the curious, here is where the money will go:\nWithin our budget we plan to hit the road for 27 days traveling to film interviews at 11 print shops across the country: 2 printers in the Chicago area, 1 printer in Nashville, 2 printers and type casters in West Virginia, 3 printers in Iowa, 1 printer in Ohio, 2 printers in Indiana, and the annual APA Wayzgoose in Chicago. \nWe have some incredible...and incredibly rare rewards available! We cannot begin to thank those who have donated their sweat, time, and materials to make this possible. It's your chance to score some limited edition prints, type, and even exclusive experiences.\n$25 - Ladies Bathroom Sign\nFeaturing Dave Churchman's humor, this Ladies Bathroom Sign is sure to please, or at least amuse! 8.5 x 11\" letterpress printed in black ink.\n$30 - Hamilton Wood Type Note Cards\nUsing their historic wood type collection, Hamilton Wood Type & Printing Museum is creating a special set of four (4) folded note cards to support the film and our campaign!

From here, sky's the limit: anything raised beyond the original goal will buy more type from Stern & Faye, fund scholarships for the workshops I'm teaching in the fall, and get the shop fully up and running that much sooner. Thank you for joining me on this trek, every day more beautiful (and useful!) than I imagined.\nHi there! I'm Myrna Knode and I own and operate Expedition Press, a small publishing house and letterpress print shop. I\u2019ve been printing and making books for seven years, from one end of the Puget Sound to the other. I set my first line of type at the Evergreen State College in Olympia, apprenticed to Stern & Faye, Printers in the Skagit Valley, and studied with master bookbinder Carolina Veenstra in Kingston. Two years ago I opened my own studio in my hometown of Indianola, where I\u2019ve been quietly printing, reading, writing, binding, and experimenting.\nThis winter, two once-in-a-lifetime opportunities knocked on my studio door simultaneously: to acquire a full shop\u2019s worth of printing equipment from my teacher and dear friend Jules Faye, and to publish a new collection of poems by Sally Green. I said yes to both. Woke up in shock and excitement a week later, and I\u2019ve been working around the clock ever since to make it all happen.\nWell, I\u2019ve made a lot happen since December. I rented a new shop space in downtown Kingston that can accommodate all the new equipment. It needs some love & sweat, for sure - and a window or two. The landlords are gung-ho, the lease is signed, and renovations are underway. I\u2019ve trekked up to the Skagit every other weekend since January: poured through the shop inventory, measured everything twice, made to-scale drawings for the new shop layout, decided what to buy, and priced everything. We rented the biggest truck we could find, shrink-wrapped everything in sight, hired a forklift, and moved the equipment across the Puget Sound.\nHere\u2019s where you come in:\nThis Kickstarter will pay off the printing equipment ($5000), reimburse moving costs ($750) and basic shop-readying expenses ($750), and cover fees, taxes, and reward fulfillment ($1000).\nI\u2019m campaigning for these funds in the interest of a sustainable venture. The shop is rented and the equipment has been moved, thanks to just enough credit, a lot of helping hands, and a whole lot of faith. Now I am rolling up my sleeves even further, and from the midst of half-opened boxes and half-made books, I am asking you to support me in carrying forward the literary fine press tradition that I have inherited from so many incredible teachers. I am fully committed to this work and excited to share it. You're invited to join in on the awesomeness!\nTHE EQUIPMENT\nHere\u2019s what I\u2019m purchasing to outfit my new shop:\n1901 Golding Jobber No. 6 Platen Press\nChallenge Guillotine Paper Cutter, 23\u201d blade \n3 Type Cabinets with cases (2 Hamilton and one rare Golding cabinet) \n2 Galley Racks with galleys (1 Hamilton and one oversize Challenge)\nBeautiful marble composing stone set in oak frame \nHamilton metal furniture rack with full set of metal furniture \nDouble-wide steel slant top work surface with leading rack \nVarious small tools, ink, paper, and a 3\u2019 x 8\u2019 work table\nOver two tons of metal type \nExciting, isn\u2019t it? All of this equipment has come direct from the heart of Stern & Faye's legendary 'Print Farm.' And it\u2019s come just in the nick of time. Along with the bigger shop space, this equipment is making it possible for me to complete Full Immersion, my first book release as Expedition Press.\nCURRENT BOOK PROJECT\nFull Immersion is a collection of poems by Sally Green. It is a fine press poetry book, to be published in a limited edition of 300. An accomplished printer and publisher herself, Sally is deeply connected and dedicated to the literary community both locally and abroad. After 30 years of publishing other poets' work under the imprint of Brooding Heron Press, this is the well-deserved first book of her own. It\u2019s a great honor to have been entrusted with.\nNews about Full Immersion has spread clear to Ireland, and a lot of support has already been garnered. Right now I\u2019m smack dab in the middle of the publishing process. I\u2019ve accepted the final manuscript, designed the structure of the book, sourced materials, set a budget, funded that budget with a few short-term loans, established an ambitious production timeline, ordered materials, and designed the interior layout of the book. Phew. What\u2019s left to do: design the title page, print the book, and bind it. This Kickstarter will directly make those last two steps possible. Ever tried to bind 300 books at once? Step #1: fold 3000 sheets of paper in half. It takes a lot of table space.\nTHE REWARDS\nNow, the part you\u2019ve been waiting for! I\u2019ve put together a bunch of awesome rewards for you, summed up in three main categories: \nletterpress prints that I\u2019ve already made\ncustom work that I will make for you\nopportunities to come make things with me! \nThis Kickstarter is a chance for you to pick up what\u2019s left of the limited edition prints from my artist portfolio, pre-order a copy of Full Immersion, or commission something new and get your name in a priority place on Expedition Press\u2019 production calendar. Here are a few pics of the prints being offered. See what suits your fancy!\nCONTEXT: HISTORICAL & CONTEMPORARY\nEntranced by type, and more specifically the beauty of letterpress printing, Chris Stern founded the Grey Spider Press in 1986 in order to pursue private interests in typography, printing and hand bookmaking. Grey Spider Press became the literary fine press publishing wing of the work that Jules and Chris did together as Stern and Faye, Printers. Just as in earlier eras, they acted as book designer, compositor, editor, proofreader, printer, publisher & bookseller as well as bookbinder and occasional illustrator.\nGrey Spider Press published the majority of poetry books written by Sam Green, Washington state's first poet laureate and spouse of poet Sally Green. Among many strange and wonderful things, I have the privilege to acquire Stern & Faye\u2019s house run of Perpetua type, and will be using it to print Sally\u2019s first book, some 24 years after Chris Stern used the very same type to make Sam\u2019s first book! I am deeply honored to be part of the next generation of fine press poetry here in the Pacific Northwest. \nNext generation, that\u2019s right! There\u2019s a whole host of folks bolstering and burgeoning the crafts of letterpress printing and hand bookbinding on a daily basis. Mine is just the newest shop on the block. Stern & Faye is sometimes affectionately known as the 'Johnny Appleseed of Northwest Letterpress,' and it\u2019s not just because so many shops have picked up presses and type from their mind-bogglingly expansive collection. It\u2019s because of Chris and Jules\u2019 dedication to the craft, their commitment to printing and to the presses, their high standards and impeccable design, their belief in the long term, and their love of all things literary, typographical, and bookish. This influence permeates shops from Portland to Bellingham. To name a few: Amada Press, Beans 'n Rice, Beautiful Angle, Bison Bookbinding & Letterpress, C.C. Stern Type Foundry, Cornish College of the Arts, Keegan Meegan & Co., Myrtle Alley Press, School of Visual Concepts, Stumptown Printers, and Thirteen Black Press. To see more, take a look at Stern & Faye's community page.\nWHAT THE HECK IS LETTERPRESS?\nJust in case you can't get enough, here are two great places to learn more:\nbriarpress.org\nletterpresscommons.com\nTHANK YOU!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhen all is said and done, the main challenge will be delivering things on time. For any reward that involves custom work, I've set the estimated delivery to December 2014, recognizing that it depends entirely on how many backers choose those rewards. Custom work will be produced on a first come, first serve basis. When the dust settles from the Kickstarter campaign and chapbook binding frenzy, I will set a production timeline for the custom rewards and contact all backers in early June, to let you know exactly what to expect.

You can still find this and other Calamityware plates at BuyCalamityware.com\n________\nI like drawings that make me laugh. When I inherited a traditional Blue Willow-pattern plate, I just had to redraw it and add a dinosaur. As I drew more plates and added more calamities\u2014UFOs, Sasquatch, and volcanoes\u2014folks urged me to produce real dinner plates. A Kickstarter project was born.\nThe first two Kickstarter projects went well (flying monkeys and giant robot), so here is the third project in what might turn out to be a long series. This design includes a hungry sea monster who appears to have escaped from the wild areas of an early Renaissance map. Imagine finding that bad boy behind your fish sticks!\nPreparing prototype for pie test\nThe final production plates will feature a rich blue image on white porcelain. You can hang it on your wall or use it for dinner (food safe, microwave safe, dishwasher safe). Makes a flabbergasting gift.\nIf we get enough sponsors, the craftspeople at Bryan China Company (New Castle, PA, USA) will transfer the drawing to full-size dinner plates and fire them at 1500 degrees to permanently fuse the image to the porcelain. I expect to ship these plates before the end of August 2014. Perhaps sooner.\nSeries continues. I\u2019m committed to producing at least six plate designs in this series. If sponsors remain enthusiastic, I\u2019ll go to 12.\nHere\u2019s the current lineup.\nCalamityware Plate 1: flying monkeys\nCalamityware Plate 2: giant robot \nCalamityware Plate 3: voracious sea monster \nCalamityware Plate 4: UFO invasion?\nCalamityware Plate 5: pirates in the neighborhood?\nCalamityware Plate 6: to be announced. I\u2019m considering a volcano, Sasquatch, mariachis, mimes, pterodactyls, a giant octopus, bats, alligators, and several other themes. But probably not all at once. Stay tuned. \nIf you missed the previous Kickstarter projects and want to address a gap in your Calamityware plate collection, you\u2019ll find a limited number of plates at BuyCalamityware.com\nWill all the plates in this series match? No. The designs of the plate borders and central image will be very different. It\u2019s also possible that the exact size of the plates and the shade of blue will shift slightly because the plates, transfers, and firing are going to be happening at different times, months apart. If you are a perfectionist about color matching, you should order a set of matching dishes with the same design on all. Even then, you might see a little variation. Welcome to the real world.\nHow can I get a set of six plates with different designs? If you want each of your guests to have a different calamity, the best way is to sponsor six or more separate, successive Kickstarter projects. I\u2019m trying to space them 90 days apart. So it is going to take a while. But the wait will be worthwhile, right?\nIf you missed any of these projects, you need to get over to http://BuyCalamityware.com and catch up.\nMore back story. If you want more details about Calamityware plates, take a look at the previous Calamityware kickstarter projects and the weekly updates I shared. Search on the term \u201ccalamityware\u201d or follow this link to the first project... https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/159974695/calamityware-dinner-plate-1\nWant to see more of Don\u2019s drawings?

The world is full of calamities, so why should the world of Calamityware plates be any different? \n\nThe technology of producing porcelain plates is sound. But every other part of the project is vulnerable to calamity, mishap, and fiasco. I\u2019ve already figured out how to cope with delays, broken plates, flawed addresses, and slow-motion couriers. What next?\n\nI give you my word, I will work tirelessly to get everyone their Calamityware 3 plates as soon as possible. It\u2019ll probably be early August\u2014in plenty of time for holiday gift giving if you live in North America. But some international orders will take a very long time to arrive.

You'll naturally sit up straighter, hunch less, and it's a lot more comfortable through the day. \nIf you've looked for a stand, you may have felt our frustration - cheap construction, distracting aesthetics, and they take up a lot of desk space.\nSo we designed our own. Strong unibody construction, seamless design, precision CNC milled, beautiful finish, hidden storage, ultra-secure, minimal, smallest footprint, gorgeous on a desk.\nSeamless. We'll use a 90 million pound press, one of the biggest in North America, to extrude its profile. Tesla uses it to make structures for the Model S.\nSmallest footprint. Elevation Stand takes up less space than any other stand.\nMinimal. No screws or parting lines. It's thick-walled and continuous.\nHides desk clutter. Store your hard drive, USB hub, cables, Field Notes, etc. - out of view with easy access. A chamfered hole in the back lets you run cords straight through.\nMore comfortable. With Elevation Stand raising your monitor 66mm, you'll naturally sit up straighter, shoulders back, and lean over less.\nMade the hard way.  Elevation Stand is made with the same expensive processes Apple uses to make their monitor legs. And they look perfect together. \nGorgeous 20-step finish. Every stand will get glass bead blasted, acid etched, electro-chemically polished, and deep anodized. It's the same finish we apply to Elevation Dock and Apple puts on Macbook Pros.\nExtra Secure. Using our NanoPad\u2122 material, Elevation Stand locks to your monitor with thousands of microscopic air vacuums. It's strong enough to prevent your Mac from getting knocked off, yet easy to peel off.\nPerfect next to a raised laptop.  It's more ergonomic and it brings the base of the screens to the same level. \nExcellent with iMac. They were designed for each other.\nGreat for standing desks. Stand tall - no compensating with a high typing height or bending your neck down. \nMatteBlack finish. A subtle, stealth finish that will reflect little light. Its deeply bead-blasted with a mil-spec finish and looks very cool with monitor on top.\nSpecial Edition Red. Put some fire under your Mac with this Limited Edition finish. Its beautifully textured and bright color anodized. Looks really beautiful paired with a Mac.\nCraftsmanship. This video can give you a taste of the care we put into manufacturing our last project Elevation Dock for iPhone. Made by us in Portland & shipped around the world.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAnd a little bonus: Let's end headphone clutter.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIntroducing Elevation Anchor. Keep your headphones out of sight & easy to reach. You'll get two when you back the project. It's made of solid medical-grade silicone, so it won't hurt if you bump it with your knee and will flex before you can knocked it off. Mounts anywhere under your desk with the same 3M adhesive GoPro uses. Great for hiding your headphones in the living room too. (Watch the super short vid below.)\nProduction Schedule. In June, we'll start building Elevation Stand's 4-part steel extrusion tooling, make fixtures for machining, build custom titanium racks for anodizing, and order tooling for the feet. July, we will extrude the aluminum, begin CNC machining, and order packaging. August, we will continue machining and begin the finishing processes of glass bead blasting, anodizing, and lasering. In August we will start QC and final assembly at our shop in Portland. And start shipping in September.\nSo that's ElevationStand: Apple-level quality, design that gets out of the way, and an investment in your posture. \nThank you. Thanks for taking the time to look at our project & appreciate your support. This will exist because of you.\n-Casey & ElevationLab Team\n--------\nHigh-res images download - here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll steps of manufacturing Elevation Stand are within a 10 mile radius of our shop in Portland, OR - this helps resolve manufacturing issues quickly and keep a high level of quality.\n\nThe two main variables affecting shipping time are building the big steel extrusion tooling and scaling up our 20-step finishing process.

So we paused the production, are inspecting each one, and sanding any that need it. They will then get re-blasted, anodized, and lasered. This means our shipping is out about three weeks.

Please also visit us at halopadinc.com or follow us on facebook.\n\nHi and thanks for checking out our project. We are passionate about design, and work in this field every day. We\u2019re so happy with the way halopad turned out, because we believe it\u2019s the perfect blend of form and function. It\u2019s been a long and winding road to get here, but now with your help, we would love to turn our idea into reality.\nWe designed the halopad with simplicity and ease of use in mind, and we\u2019re sure you will find it just as useful as we have. We have been testing it over the last months, and compared to other stands, we find it is just better in so many ways.\n\nIt is stable: the low center of gravity and the precise off-set of the holding slots mean it will never tip over or wobble around like many other stands. It performs particularly well on soft or uneven surfaces. Because of its round shape, halopad fits better on your lap, on sofa cushions or on top of bed sheets.\n\nIt is beautiful: One of the things that really annoy us about other stands:\nthey are plain ugly. When using the halopad, it\u2019s barely there, doesn't get in the way and almost seems to disappear.\n\nIt is easy to use: A two year old can use it without difficulty, and you can easily switch from one position to another with just one hand. Having 5 different positions, you can adapt the viewing angle depending on what you are doing. For example: 45 degree landscape mode is ideal for typing and won\u2019t strain your wrists, 18 degree portrait mode is perfect for reading a book. What ever you do, the halopad quickly adapts.\n\nIt is light and portable: halopadweighs 10 ounces, that\u00b4s around 280 grams, which is just the right weight to help make it stable, but light enough to carry around. It\u2019s easy to take halopad with you from one room to another, from the kitchen to the pool, or even to the other side of the planet.\n\nIt is virtually indestructible: Made from a high grade composite, the material has a hard-soft feel that gently grips your tablet, so it will never slide out, and it\u2019s soft enough so it doesn't scratch your iPad's surfaces. The halopad logotype is integrated into the bottom of the device and serve as feet that concentrate the downward force to provide anti-slip effect.\n\nNot just for iPad: halopad will work with most current tablets as long as they are less than 0.4 of an inch or 10 mm thick at the edge.\n\nSo now we need your help. We are really excited to get this project into production and with your support we can bring halopad to you worldwide. So far we did all the prototyping and tested various materials, not to forget those countless hours of blood, sweat and tears ;-)\n\nNOW IT\u00b4S READY TO GO.\n\nYour contribution will help us to get the injection moulds made and finance factory production. halopad will be made by an injection moulding process, and though it is a simple shape we need a special sliding mould to make the slots into the device. We have tendered the project for manufacture in the US and with enough backers we would love to produce it here. We also need to factor in all the warehouse, and handling costs which people forget is often one of the most expensive parts of getting a product to market.\n\nAs soon as we reach our goal, we will start production and deliver\nto you this summer, expected early August.\n\nTHANK YOU!\nPlease share with any friends who like well-made products.\nDownload our fantastic halopad posters totally free here.\nView our cool halopad t-shirts designs for BONUS PACK BACKERS here.\nFind our awesome halopad premium packaging for those large pledges here.\n\nIf you need high resolution photos for press: download here.\nFor press inquiries, please contact hello@halopadinc.com\n\n\nThanks to all our friends who supported us making the video:\n\nShana O'Neil general advice, Tina Isabella Hild talent, Nils Brunckhorst talent, composer and musician, Ludek Smelik voice over, Ina Sprinckstub talent, general advice, Frank Rotscholl location, Michael Zimmermann general advice, Karoline Tschurtschenthaler talent, Ulli Maier artwork, Enzo + Romeo Iacono kid sequence, Volker Trucks location, Karl Anton Koenigs camera, studio, Wolfgang Franke turntable, Boris Borynsky lights, Lars Christiansen camera and also thank you to all the others who helped us ... especially Kevin MacLeod for his version of \u00bbAlso sprach Zarathustra\u00ab\n\niPad, Apple logo and Apple are registered trademarks of Apple Inc.\n\nhalopad\u00ae is a registered trademark of Halopad Inc.\nhalopad is protected by one or more U.S. and/or foreign patents or patents pending.\n\nCopyright \u00a92012 Halopad Inc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "MichaelIacono+JohnAndrews+JohnEberstein\nFirst created \u00b7 9 backed\nMichael Iacono has worked as a production designer in the film industry for the last 20 years.

Then we added a small layer of soft rubber to gently cradle your iPad and provide a sound-seal.\nThere are so many applications for this simple, and patent pending design.  It\u2019s infinitely portable.  You can take it with you wherever you go to add flexibility at the office, at home, in the car or on a picnic.

I've spent the last year developing a better case for iPhones.  After nearly 60 cycles of designing, prototyping, and revising, I teamed up with the engineers and industrial designers at Speck Design. With their help, my case is now ready for manufacture. (The cases that you saw in my video are just appearance models.) Your pledge will help me to raise the money I need to pay for the manufacturing tools. By pledging $25 or more, you are essentially pre-ordering your own PopSockets case -- if I reach my $12,000 goal, my project will be funded, and I'll send you one of the very first cases -- for iPhone 4/4S or iPod Touch, your choice -- as soon as they are made (late February / early March for 4/4S; March/April for iTouch).\n[Update: I reached my $12K goal in only 5 days. I'm ecstatic about all the support for PopSockets! What I raise beyond $12K will be used to pay for my initial inventory of PopSockets -- the more I raise, the greater variety of colors and designs I'll be able to offer. So my new goal is $20,000. Thanks for your continued support, and for spreading the word!]\nMy case has two expanding sockets that function as a kickstand, a headset management system, a pocketless clip, a gaming cradle, a shoulder stand, and a one-hand stand (illustrations below). The sockets are replaceable and come in a range of designs, so it's easy and fun to control the look of the case.\nPopSockets cases will come with two solid-colored sockets. I'll offer designer sockets, with graphics, separately. You can help me pick the initial color schemes and socket graphics by answering a survey that I'll send you if you support my project. I'd love to hear what you think. Here are a few candidate color schemes, compliments of my sister, Christine:\nAnd here are some socket graphics, compliments of my friends at BRAINBOWINC):\nBelow are PopSockets with their sockets fully collapsed and fully expanded:\nThanks again for visiting my page!

There will be some newly added features like multi point attachments for strapping Cam Crate down or using a carabiner to hook it to a pack. I'm always up for suggestions so if you have an idea you think would be great send me a message and we will go over all possible additions.\nPress: Click here to download full photos\nHere\u2019s what the press has been saying: \nWired: \"It\u2019s such a smart case...\"\nUncrate: \"giving you the freedom to tote your shooter places you'd never dare before\"\nTechcrunch: \"It even floats, so it can get away from vampires\"\nUbergizmo:  \"you won\u2019t have any issue bringing it across the rapids\"\nPetaPixel: \"it even comes with a lifetime warranty!\"\nGear Patrol: \"it\u2019s dedicated to protecting something near and dear to our gear-loving hearts.\"\nCnet: \"If Indiana Jones was a photographer and he needed a camera case, then the Cam Crate would be it.\"\nThe Phoblographer: \"a truly transportable rugged case\"\nHow do I know what to pledge?\nWhat is Cam Crate?\nCam Crate is a low profile, element proof carrying case for DSLR cameras. The case is design specifically for photographers that want to bring their DSLR with them where ever they go without the fear of breaking their expensive camera. Cam Crate also works great as a secondary emergency shelter for when you know conditions might get bad.\nFeatures of Cam Crate:\n\u2022Lifeproof design: The Cam Crate is water proof, mud proof, crush proof,  drop proof & it floats!\n\u2022One size fits most: The Cam Crate is designed to fit all DSRL cameras without a battery grip installed. A bigger version for cameras with a battery grip will be available at a later date. Cam Crate will fit a full body camera with a telephoto lens.\n\u2022Lifetime warranty: Cam Crate will come with a no questions asked lifetime warranty against anything. I designed it to last so why not?!\n\u2022Virtually indestructible: The outer shell is made out of a composite material that is made to take a beating. Cam Crate is built tough.\n\u2022Quick action door: The door on the Cam Crate is designed for quick opening and closing so you never miss the perfect shot.\nWho would benefit from the Cam Crate?\nCam Crate is perfect for any photographer that takes their camera into nature or anywhere that your camera could be jeopardized. You no longer have to worry about your camera swinging into rocks, or accidentally dropping while hiking. With Cam Crates virtually indestructible, lifeproof design you can confidently photograph in extreme environments without worrying about breaking or damaging your camera.\nWhy do I need funding?\nYou can have the greatest idea in the world but without financial backing it's impossible to get a product off the ground. When I designed Cam Crate, I didn't hold back on any design constraints. This is great for the product but manufacturing a great product takes a lot of funding. With my funding goal, Cam Crate will be able to go into first round production and I will be able to fulfill all pre orders. I have great relationships with a few manufacturers that I've worked with in the past to make sure Cam Crate is made timely and precisely to what we need in the final product.\nWho designed the Cam Crate?\nCam Crate was thought of and designed by Matthew Geyster. My first need for this product was when I was on a small boat on a reservoir in Mass and missed the perfect opportunity to photograph two Bald Eagles. I didn't have my DSLR with me because I didn't want to risk dropping it in water. After that day I worked on Cam Crate and now have a product I am very proud of.\nIf you have any additional questions please feel free to send me a message. \nThanks for the support! -Matt", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Oct. 2012 Project Status", "update_content": "If you missed out on backing Cam Crate and would like to pre order a one, our eCommerce site is now live.\nClick here to go to our site\nAll pre orders through our site will ship after all Kickstarter orders have been shipped out.

Delays yes, but fraud no. After kickstarter and amazon took their cuts it left me with around $22k for the project which is not enough. So the left over costs are on me. I don't want you guys to feel that your the only one out on a limb here.

We are truly all in this together.\nDVD RELEASE - March 11 2012 via Web Order\nQuestions? http://www.facebook.com/chrisnoland or http://www.twitter.com/chris_noland\nAbout the Documentary\nA critical look at how the authorities handled the nuclear crisis and Tsunami relief by an American who volunteered in the clean-up.\nSurviving Japan is a documentary by volunteer and director Chris Noland. It is in short, a documentary of the devastating events in Japan and the after-math that followed.\n\nThe documentary shows the humanitarian and aid crisis that faced the people in the wake of both natural and nuclear disaster. It features true stories from those affected by the disaster, the government and even TEPCO. It highlights the struggle in dealing with: The Tsunami clean-up, lack of Government response to the disaster, radiation plus the future of nuclear power after the accident, a possible Cover-up of the Fukushima Dai-ichi Nuclear disaster, and an uncooperative Government that dismisses legitimate health concerns while providing the citizens with little to no information about the effects the disaster would have on their future.\n \"The continuance of using such finite energy resources will only produce limited results for a limited number, leaving the rest of the world out of the equation.\" - C. Noland\nThis movie is not just for Japan, it is for the world.\nAbout How the Documentary was made\nFilming for this project ended October 2011.  It encompasses the disaster and the following 6 months through volunteer trips to Northeast Japan. \nThe film is in Japanese and English.  It has everyone from the Government, to the people to even Tokyo Electric Power. It features never before told stories about the reality everyone was faced with in this Triple disaster.  It is the only documentary to Cover the entire disaster from the time of the Earthquake by a foreign resident.  This is a once in a lifetime movie, You can never get the footage again, except here.\nWho is the Director?\nThe Director Chris Noland is an award-winning videographer, Originally from America, that moved to Japan a year before the earthquake.  Chris Noland was a volunteer in the Tsunami Clean-up, food and aid delivery when the disaster happened. He was inspired to make a film about the events when it was clear people were not getting enough help or answers. You can read more about his volunteer efforts on the ImaginePeace website here: http://imaginepeace.com/archives/15129\nWhy is this so important?\nWe live in a world where Politicians can be bought and sold by the highest corporate account for special interests. One of the largest is the Energy sector. These politicians that want less regulation in Government produce these disastrous results.  Would Fukushima have exploded if the Government had ensured that TEPCO did its job?\n Because many people are unaware that even today, there is still a major problem with the nuclear power station at Fukushima.  It has dropped from the headlines to be buried.  The people of Japan have been left in the dark only facing opposition when trying to get the truth.  People are still living in contaminated areas without proper education about it. The truth is covered up.\nPeople need to know the truth about how a nuclear accident affects them, because the next accident could be anywhere and the aftermath of a nuclear accident knows no boundaries, no racism and is completely invisible to the human eye.\nI shot over 100 hours of film along with 100s of photos over the course of 6 months in the disaster Zones in Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima prefectures by myself. Making it past the goal will allow me to release all the footage as DVD extras or Online. It is currently in the Post-Production phase and with your help will make it off to Film Festivals and distribution!\nThank you very much for all your support!\n\u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059\uff01\n-Chris Noland, Director and Producer", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #52", "update_userinfo": "3.11 Surviving Japan is now Available on Youtube!", "update_content": "Honor the Fukushima Survivors, Listen and share their stories! \"3.11 Surviving Japan\" is now avail.

Over the past 18 months, we\u2019ve build a global community of mappers who use balloons and kites to take aerial photos, and our browser application MapKnitter to stitch them together.  We've put our experience into a comprehensive balloon mapping kit that only costs $85 (shipping included) and comes with illustrated instructions.\n Follow us at grassrootsmapping.org, and check out our map archive at the Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science .  this is what a small map can look like (by Jaroslav Valuch, Czech Republic):\nWho is the Public Laboratory?\nThe Public Laboratory for Open Technology and Science (PLOTS) is a non-profit and a community of activists, educators, scientists, technologists, community leaders, and organizers that develop and apply open-source tools to environmental exploration and investigation. By democratizing inexpensive and accessible \u201cDo-It-Yourself\u201d techniques, Public Laboratory creates a collaborative network of practitioners who actively re-imagine the human relationship with the environment.\nYou've believed in us before and been a major part of our success. That's why we're coming back to the Kickstarter community that gave us our start.  We need your help to initiate large-scale distribution of our tools.  As a fully funded-non profit, we are only looking to Kickstart our first run of balloon kits, and launch distribution and assembly infrastructure that we can then apply to other tools in development.  All money collected beyond our costs will go towards tool distribution to communities in need.  \nWhy balloon mapping?\nBalloons fly low and can be used to take high-resolution images.  Residents of the Gulf Coast are using balloon mapping to produce their own aerial imagery of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.  For the first weeks of the disaster a restricted flight zone was declared below 4000ft... but not for balloons.\nThe Gowanus Canal Conservancy uses balloons to track their reclamation work and to discover new aspects of their Superfund waterway.\nMore recently, protest mapping has become popular, with video. Fundacion Ciudadano Inteligente started it all.\nWhat is in the balloon kit?\nA 5.5 foot (170cm) reusable balloon made of a latex/chloroprene (neoprene) mix, making it UV resistant, fairly tear resistant, and excellent at retaining helium.  Two-four days of flights can be had with one filling of helium.\n1000 feet (305m) of 110lb test (55 kilo) Dacron line for tying to your balloon, all pre-wound on our favorite 8\" hoop winder. We tracked these back to the factory and are having them custom wound.  No other winder is sold with more than 500' of line.\nProtective rubberized gloves for handling the line.  Thin, high-strength line can cause burns to unprotected hands.  We ship you a pair of rubber-coated cotton gloves.  With rubberized gloves the line is also much easier to pull in.\nThree high-strength swivel clips.  For attaching the balloon and camera, with one extra.\nten rubber bands. for making a camera cradle and a spare.\nten zip ties. for closing the balloon.\none 1\" ring. for attaching the balloon to the line.\nWhat kind of camera works?\nYou will need a camera that can do continuous shooting (or \"continuous drive\")-- there are apps for iPhone and Android.  See if your camera is on this list of continuous drive cameras at Digital Photography Review.\nWhat is Grassroots Mapping Forum?\nGrassroots Mapping Forum is a brand-new quarterly publication produced by the Public Laboratory to support grassroots mappers.  One of our balloon or kite made maps appears on the front side, with notes, how-tos, and interviews on the back.  The first issue is 25\"x35\" and printed on acid-free paper.

The Magnetapult is capable of accelerating a projectile at over 16 g's * to a distance of over 40 times the length of the firing arm. \n(* See FAQ to find how we came up with these values.)\nThe aluminum Magnetapult.

(Hard to find room!):\nThe Standard Magnetapult, locked and loaded with a ping pong ball:\nReward Contents\nThe standard kit will come with everything needed to build and use the Magnetapult, including laser cut parts, supermagnets, chicago screws to hold it together, flux concentrators, an instruction manual, and two projectiles. You supply the (hopefully moving) targets!  I'll update this page when I've finalized the projectiles.\nUnique Kickstarter Version Only Etching!\nShow how cool you are by showing that you backed the Magnetapult on Kickstarter, instead of getting it retail.\nNow with N52 Neodymium Magnets\nI wasn't satisfied with the original N42 Neodymium Magnets so I bumped it up to the strongest currently available N52 Neodymium Magnets to maximize the acceleration and launch distance.  Please see the Strong Magnet warning in the FAQ!\nMetallic Flip Stabilizer and Flux Concentrator\nThis helps prevent the super magnets from somehow pulling out of their cages and flipping around.  As a nice side effect, they act as a magnetic flux concentrator, making the pushing side a bit stronger.  A small extra cost for a big improvement in safety, and slight improvement in acceleration.\nStreamlined construction\nNot only is the Magnetapult precision laser cut, I've decided to use Chicago Screws to give it a nice streamlined look.  As an added bonus, the screws are the same silvery shade as the supermagnets.\nVarying launch angles\nI've played around with launch angles and trajectories, and added a few arm stops so you can vary the launch angle and distance.\nStability Improvements\nRelease the arm without holding down the Magnetapult and the enourmous magnetic forces will flip the Magnetapult around.  Not only does this result in a shorter launch distance, but it can also damage the Magnetapult.  To stabalize the Magnetapult I've added a pair of legs on each side, and a hole underneath the arm to make it easier to hold down the Magnetapult with one hand.\nWhat's left?\nI'm currently waiting for samples from different companies for the projectiles.\nWhat will the money be used for?\nBULK!

Lots of ink. A great deal of that ink we mix ourselves. So we know that mixing & matching color is critical to a good printing. I print everyday. And I wrestled with color matching problems routinely\u2014until I built a tool that solves many of these problems, the Ink Dial\u2122.\nThe Ink Dial cleanly and precisely dispenses any amount of ink, without weighing, \u201ceyeballing\u201d or guesswork. It allows color mixes to be accurately repeated, thus reducing waste, time & money. It's not just a tool but a simple color mixing system that allows more control over this essential part of printing.\nBased on my success with the Ink Dial in my own studio, I want to get it out into the world. Since it is so easy to use, it will prove incredibly useful to the teaching & practice of printmaking & letterpress printing, handy in the classroom, the artist\u2019s studio, and to beginning & experienced printers alike practicing these disappearing crafts.\nThe Rewards & the Artists\nAs a letterpress printer, I particularly enjoy printing the work of lettering artists. It is challenging work and they are often the most demanding, yet interesting clients. \nSo with two simple notions in mind (lettering & color) I approached 15 internationally known artists whose work involves lettering in some form or fashion for help with the rewards portion of this project.\nBased solely on my detailed description of The Ink Dial, the artists offered me original work to print letterpress in a limited edition, each print signed by the artist.

Toast was a success because of you!\nIf you came to this page after fundraising has ended, please visit www.toastmade.com to place orders.\nThank you so much!  Matias\nCUSTOM WOOD VENEERS TO PROTECT AND ENHANCE YOUR IPHONE\nWith real wood veneers from Toast you can add both grip and protection to the iPhone 4 and 4S without adding to the phone\u2019s size or covering up the elegant design.  The texture of the wood grain makes it much less slippery and you can toss your iPhone on a table without worrying about scratching the back glass.\nAnd, just as importantly, the veneer enhances the look of the iPhone by adding warm natural materials and allowing you to personalize your phone.  Who wants their iPhone to look exactly like the other 50 million of them out there?\nBy combining computer controlled laser cutting, high quality veneers and hand finishing, Toast brings style, protection and customization to you at a very affordable price. \nThe best way to support Toast is to pre-order your custom veneer.  Pledges of $20 and up are essentially pre-orders of custom veneers at a special Kickstarter-only price (saving you at least $5 off the retail price).  You can choose from two different woods, either a rich, chocolaty walnut or a whitewashed, quarter-cut ash.  \nKeep it simple or add one of eight cool etched designs, some of which feature cutouts that let the silver of the apple logo show through.\nThen personalize your veneer further by adding custom text that will be laser etched into the wood.  Add your name or contact information, or perhaps a favorite quote or poem.\nAll pre-orders also get the option of including an exclusive Kickstarter Sponsor logo etched into your veneer, so you can flaunt the fact that you were part of making Toast possible.\nIf you like this project but don't have an iPhone, you can still support us.  For a $5 pledge you will receive two wood stickers, etched with the Toast and Kickstarter Sponsor logos.\nToast veneers fit perfectly with the Apple bumper.\nShipping is free in the USA.  International shipping cost is $5 to any country outside the USA.  International backers please add $5 to your pledge to cover shipping.\nPlease help us spread the word and make sure we get funded!\nwww.facebook.com/toastmade\nOur Twitter feed is @Toastmade.\nFollow us on Instagram: Toastmade\nYou can also find more information on toast\u2019s website www.toastmade.com\nThank you so much for your support!\nMatias", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Toast Cyber Monday Sale", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "Toast's 1st Anniversary Party", "update_content": "Wow!

No worries, head to http://studioneat.com/cosmo/ to sign up to be notified when the Cosmonaut becomes available for sale. You can also follow us on twitter (@studioneat) to receive project updates. Thanks!\nHello friends! Thanks for visiting our Kickstarter page for the Cosmonaut, a minimal, wide-grip capacitive stylus for touch screen devices.\nThe Cosmonaut was born out of our desire to have a really great stylus for our iPads. We love to sketch out quick ideas or doodle on our tablets, and using a stylus is much better than a finger for such tasks. We bought several different models currently available on the market but they all suffered the same problem: they were designed to look and feel like a pen. But why? Writing or drawing on the iPad feels nothing like using a pen or pencil. For one, tablets are ideal for low fidelity sketching. Also, it is pretty awkward to rest your palm on the screen of the device because it throws off the capacitive detection. Writing on a tablet feels like writing on a dry erase board: fast, simple, low fidelity. The perfect tablet stylus is one that feels like a dry erase marker.\nDan created a blog post about this very idea right after our first Kickstarter campaign ended, and quite a few people seemed to be keen on it, so we decided to start designing a solution. After immersing ourselves in research, prototyping, and design iteration, we\u2019ve arrived at something that we think is pretty great. It\u2019s comfortable to hold and effortlessly glides over the glass surface of the tablet. It just feels right.\nIn returning to Kickstarter for our second project, we wanted to try something different. You may notice that there is only one pricing tier to the right, for $1. That is not a mistake. Inspired by Radiohead, we wanted to try out a pay-as-you-wish pricing model. Pledge whatever value you feel the Cosmonaut is worth to you. A few things to keep in mind:\nThere are only 3000 pledging slots available. So, if everyone only pledges $1, the funding goal of $50,000 will obviously not be met.\nThe funding goal of $50,000 was arrived at after getting quotes from our manufacturer (in the USA).\nIf we meet our funding goal (which would be awesome!) it means we will be able to sell the Cosmonaut in our online store later on. We are thinking it will retail for $25. Perhaps this price can be used as a guide for your own contribution.\nGet them while they\u2019re hot! Once the 3000 slots run out, you won\u2019t be able to get a Cosmonaut until they become available in our online store. Consider it a limited edition run to test the feasibility of a full scale run.\nBased on the timetable our manufacturer gave us, we should begin shipping the Cosmonauts in June.\nThere are two prototypes featured in the video above: a \"look and feel\" prototype and a functional prototype. We are continuing to refine / improve the design (including the tip) but the final design will have that same form and spirit of the prototypes.\nThe Cosmonaut is compatible with any capacitive touch screen device. Eg. iPad, iPhone, iPod Touch, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Motorola Xoom, etc.\nThis is the first we are aware of a pay-as-you-wish pricing model for a physical, tangible product.

Of the 38,000 presses that were made, very few exist in operable condition. The lucky ones have been forgotten in barns, basements and backrooms. Countless others were carted off by scrap metal collectors and destroyed.\nThey are large and heavy machines, and they are beautiful. Each press has a personality and quirks, which is why they are often given a name. My objective is to purchase a Vandercook press and set it up in a functional studio here in Chicago. It will be restored and fully operational so that it can be used for many years to come. I plan to set up shop in the historic Pilsen neighborhood and have found a great studio space in an old warehouse by the Chicago River.\nThe studio will be named Pilsenette Press and will be available for use by members. Their rental fees will help maintain the press and cover the costs of rent and supplies. There are very few facilities in Chicago that offer letterpress instruction and rental to artists. I want to promote the art by making it accessible. Furthermore, I want to provide beginning artists with a place to print their own art.\nThis is where we need you! The press will need to be moved by professionals familiar with heavy equipment. I have identified a shared studio space where the press can be operated and stored. Your backing helps move the press, set it up and purchase essential printing supplies like quoins, a Boxcar base and inks. I have located a press for sale and it will be $7500 delivered.\nI fell in love when I made my first print and I want to share that with others.

We can't believe we wrote this. Really. I mean who gets up one day, brews a pot of coffee, and says, \"Gee, I have a good idea. Why don't I think of all the embarrassing, awkward stories I have with the opposite sex, write them down, and then distribute them worldwide for everyone to point, laugh and leave in bathroom stalls?\"\nWell, apparently we do. And we need your help to embarrass ourselves.\nIn Fall 2011, we\u2019ll be launching our new book Awkward Moments with Men: Stories About the Sex We Can't Live Without. It\u2019s a coveted selection of humor essays that ventures into highly charted territory and documents the strange moments, unexpected fears, and over analysis that occurs when opposite sexes brush elbows and unmentionables.\nAll the stories are true, and all the men are anonymous. In a matter of 200 self-proclaimed pages of dazzling wit and humor, you can read about The Man Who Pees Sitting Down, the condom-swallowing dog, a highly unfortunate instance with a period and a guest bed, visiting a boyfriend in prison, and cancerous trips to the lady doctor, among others. The stories are honest and thoughtful and probably nothing you'll want to discuss with your grandmother. Get a glimpse of the contents here: http://awkwardmomentswithmen.tumblr.com/excerpts.\nEqually as important as the contents is the way we're publishing. Rather than go the traditional route with lots of red tape and boring book signings that smell of unused sharpies, we\u2019re going custom.\nAWKWARD MOMENTS ART GALLERY To launch the book, we\u2019ll be headed to ten cities (Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, Nashville, New York, Seattle, and Toronto) where we\u2019ll be partnering with local artists to create an innovative book launch. All participating artists will submit and exhibit one piece of visual art that centers on the theme \u2018Awkward Moments with Men.\u2019\nOn opening night, attendees will see the exhibit, vote on the piece they think best represents the theme, receive a free copy of the book, indulge in a little vino, and have an opportunity to share their own awkward moments in an interactive booth that they might or might not regret later. Ultimately the winning art pieces in each city will travel to the final gallery where they will stay on exhibit for a handful of months and continue to share awkward stories with the masses.\nHOW YOUR INVESTMENT WILL HELP At minimum, we're looking at a $15,000 price tag to make this happen.Our goal is to do a major book release, which requires a quality product with quality exposure. Thankfully, we have the know-how, desire, and obscenely talented friends to pull this off. What we don't have is the large bank account of someone like our dear friend Mr. Harper Collins. Which is where you (and everyone you know) comes in.\nRight now our $15,000 is breaking down as follows: * Editing ($1,000) * Cover Design/Typesetting ($2,000) * Printing and eBook Conversion ($7,000) * Creating an Interactive Website ($1,500) * Hiring a Publicist / Developing and Implementing a Creative Marketing Campaign ($2,500) * Making the Awkward Moments Art Gallery Tour a Reality ($1,000)\nIF YOU CAN'T TELL, WE LOVE EVERYONE We know we're not famous. We know you could spend $100 getting hammered tonight or you could choose to spend it helping us. And we're prematurely going to thank you for picking one-night sobriety and awkwardness because we believe that A) you're a genuinely good person, and B) you'll be genuinely happy with your decision once you crack the spine of our awkward, if not a-little-too-close-to-home stories.\nPlease, please, please email us if you have any questions at all or simply want to say hi.

You will be able to create unlimited designs, with multiple colors, using authentic vintage wood type and art cuts. And you can print your design directly from LetterMpress or save it as an image for import it into other applications.\nSo why bother re-creating what\u2019s considered to be an obsolete process for the new technology of the iPad?\nActually, a letterpress and an iPad operate similarly when it comes to manipulating objects in a composition. Just like placing blocks of wood type on a surface, you drag the type images across the iPad, and then move them around to create your design. This is why the iPad would make an ideal platform for people to experience the creative aspects of letterpress and typography.\nA growing interest in letterpress\u2014but difficult to access\nIn fact, letterpress has had a growing interest over the past decade amongst designers, artists, and printmakers. Call it a reaction to the \u201cperfect\u201d look of laser-printing. Letterpress\u2014especially wood type\u2014evokes a handcrafted appearance that accompanies thoughtful, visual, and literal expression.\nBut unfortunately, much of the letterpress\u2019s traditional technology was sold for scrap metal and replaced with computers over the last 30 years. Wood type was burned, thrown in a landfill, or divided up as knick-knacks in antique and craft shops. The destruction of manual presses and thousands of type collections has made the tools of letterpress a scarce resource these days. What\u2019s left of traditional letterpress machines, wood type, and printing paraphernalia now fetch premium collector prices because of the growing interest in this art. And complete sets of wood type are rare\u2014bidding wars drive up the prices to several hundreds of dollars.\nOur goal: Our goal is to give designers, artists, students, lovers of type\u2014anyone\u2014the ability to produce their own authentic letterpress designs and artwork. And that\u2019s where this project starts and where we need your help!\nCurrent feedback: We\u2019ve shown our prototype to letterpress printers, designers, and artists, and they are just as excited as we are about this project!\nNEEDED: Beautiful wood type\u2014for everyone\nBut to make LetterMpress truly beneficial to a creative audience, we need to offer an outstanding collection of authentic wood type and vintage \u201ccuts.\u201d We have a supporter who\u2019s willing to part with a substantial portion of a historic collection purchased from type foundries and print shops when they closed in the \u201970s and \u201980s.\nThe amount we need and how we will use the funds: To acquire this collection, we need to raise at least $15,000. Along with these rare, complete collections of wood type, additional funds will also allow us to get help creating the high-resolution photos and scans of the wood type and their corresponding impressions.\nThe type that we aquire will be housed at a new letterpress co-op called the \"Living Letter Press.\" This co-op will be a resource to designers, artists, students, and anyone interested in learning letterpress.\nThe end product is just the start\nPricing LetterMpress: We want to make LetterMpress accessible to all, and plan to price it at $5.99 for the base iPad version. We plan to include at least 12 typefaces, and about 50 art \"cuts,\" to which we will add to as we update the app. Pricing for other platforms will be determined by the amount of functionality and size of files generated. Why we need the physical type: Having access to the physical types is a critical part of a later stage* of the LetterMpress venture, which will be to offer authentic letterpress prints from the designs submitted by LetterMpress users. Think about it: Wouldn't it be great to get -real- letterpress prints from your own designs?\nHelp us make this happen!\nWith your support, we hope to make LetterMpress a creative resource for designers, artists, students, and anyone who wants to experience the art, craft, and tradition of letterpress.\nWhat you get in return: To show our appreciation for your pledge, we\u2019re offering some great rewards including participation in our beta program, limited edition letterpress art prints, wood type, and the opportunity to name your own typeface in the LetterMpress App.\nCheck out the list of rewards to see what best suits you.

I would also call this a public service and a good analogy would be music. There is so much recorded music on vinyl out there which the public will never hear because it's on, well, vinyl. If you take all that music, rip MP3's of it, you suddenly make it accessible and save it from certain doom. This is also true with this project in regards to letterpress type. I thank you for this! And other things could spin out of this, too. How about a working museum which archives and continues to print with letterpress type. The museum could operate as a printer and fund itself through its services. People would also have a place to donate their old \"vinyl\". Everyone can enjoy it, and it won't be lost. The Virtual Letterpress is a great idea, but the old letterpress will never die either. When we lose our electricity and our petrol we will we also lose our iPads, laser printers, cell phones, cars, and you name it, It will be the 1770's all over again.

In order for us to deliver the quality documentary film that we would like to produce, we need funding.\nThe Status The film is currently in the pre-production stage. We have recently joined forces with an award-winning Danish filmmaker, Lars Oxfeldt Mortensen (www.mortensenfilm.dk). Once we have pre-production financing, we can move forward with the promotional trailer to seek broadcaster financing for the feature-length film we are set out to create.\nFunds Monies raised will go to the pre-production budget for the film. This includes equipment, research, trips to conduct interviews and collect footage, editing costs for promotional trailer, and miscellaneous financing. All funds will be used for the film.
