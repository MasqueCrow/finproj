[{"backer": "Oliver Mertz", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "BIG PROGRESSIVE IDEAS AND GORGEOUS, GONZO, GENRE COMICS\nI'm Aubrey Sitterson and if you read my previous Kickstarted comic \u2013 Tyrell Cannon and my instant classic BEEF BROS \u2013 you know what I'm all about: Joining forces with the best artists around to use outrageous, bombastic concepts to explore and ruminate on world-changing, community-based ideas. That's why, when Chris Moreno (Zombie Dickheads, World War Hulk: Front Line) decided to follow up our beloved The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling, we developed Stoned Master, a blend of stoner comedy, kung fu action, and sun-drenched Los Angeles vibes chockablock with anti-gentrification rumination.\nStoned Master #1 is a 32-page, full-color comic book, the first of a planned five-part series cocreated by Chris and me, with letters by Taylor Esposito and logo by Tim Daniel. You can find out more below, but first and foremost\u2026CHECK OUT HOW DOPE THIS THING LOOKS!\nTHC chocolate in your peanut butter\nBlazed Fist vs Drunken Fist\nWelcome to Chavez Heights\nHonestly: What's better than this?\n Keep on scrolling to check out our rewards, including stickers, prints,  and original art and commissions by Chris!\nGIMME THOSE DEETZ\nStoned Master is set in the fictional Los Angeles neighborhood of Chavez Heights, where the rapacious conglomerate RepCor is corporatizing and gentrifying everything in sight. And the only ones standing in their way? Burnout kung fu savant Frankie Wong, his drunken master, and his pals from the local cannabis dispensary. \nImagine Kung Fu Hustle meets Pineapple Express. Or, for the old heads, Drunken Master meets Cheech & Chong. It's all the intense, artful fight scenes you expect from a martial arts epic, combined with gut-busting stoner comedy laughs, then fully baked in the Southern California sun.\nWhile working together on The Comic Book Story of Professional Wrestling, Chris and I found ourselves jonesing for an opportunity to cut loose, free of the restrictions that come with nonfiction work. We wanted space and freedom for big, intense, outlandish action and hilarious visual comedy.\nStoned Master is our opportunity to show off, demonstrating all our strengths on a truly gonzo comic, all in service of actual good politics. With your help, we're going to make it happen, with any additional money raised spent how it rightfully should be: Paying the team more.\nCHARACTER DESIGNS\nAs part of his efforts to make Stoned Master's Chavez Heights setting feel real, authentic, and lived in, Chris put in a ton of design work, creating characters that feel unique and visually distinct while remaining authentic and familiar.\nREWARDS!\nSlap it on your bong\nDare you to hang it up at work\nSample Chris Moreno commission\nSample Chris Moreno commission\nWHAT IF YOU RAISE MORE MONEY?\n$25,000: Everybody gets raises\nIn order to make Stoned Master happen, everyone's agreed to a lower rate; Aubrey isn\u2019t taking a page rate at all! If we hit our first stretch goal, that changes, with Chris and Taylor getting raises and Aubrey getting a page rate.\n$35,000: Stoned Master #2\nThe entire five-issue Stoned Master series is outlined and we yearn to make it happen. If we pull in enough cash on this campaign, we\u2019ll be able to get a head start by funding the creative costs of issue #2!\n$45,000: Everybody gets raises\nSame as before, if we make $45,000, the entire team gets their increased rates on Stoned Master #2!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAubrey's previous Kickstarter campaign \u2013 for the leftist superhero comic BEEF BROS \u2013 saw rewards delivered safely and on time to all backers. In addition, not only is Aubrey an experienced comic book writer, but he's also a former editor at Marvel (Punisher War Journal, Ghost Rider, etc.) and Image (The Walking Dead, Invincible), so he knows a thing or two about putting together great-looking books.\n\nChris is a seasoned, 20-year comic book and animation pro, well-versed in the world of self-publishing, having written, drawn, colored, lettered and published two printings of his comic Zombie Dickheads.\n\nWe have confirmed that our printer is operating at full capacity despite the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have also researched multiple shipping options in order to have back-up delivery plans in place. While additional challenges may arise, we will always be communicative and upfront with our backers about the status of our project.\n\nInternational backers: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant delays in international shipping and customs clearance.

In her mind, only a Great House has the right to such power, but who will listen to a poor Irish woman? House Lowell will. For Alice Lowell has inherited an old Puritan journal which describes how to find and enslave a demon, but she needs a psychic to do it. Kidnapping Caitlin is the first step in a plan to rid her husband\u2019s House of debt. But with a demon to do their bidding, her ambitions will be limitless.\nThe Book of Demons can be read as a standalone, but it is a continuation of Ghosts and Demons.\nFirst Three Pages:\nNEW TO BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY?\nIf you are new to the series, the original six issue mini-series is about an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who battle supernatural forces in late 1800\u2019s Boston. They  live in an alternate steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the Great Houses control the economy of the Great States of America while the middle class and lower classes sole purpose are to serve the Great Houses.\nThe original trade paperback is available in several reward tiers.\nWHAT'S IN THE TRADE?\nI'm glad you asked. Not only does it include all six issues from the  original mini-series as well as the cover art, but it also contains a  ten page  short story called, Hunter-Killer,  and additional bonus pages.

I introduce three new characters: Gwen Warrick - Captain;  Emmet Rochester - Navigator; and Joaquin Medina - Engineer.\nThe complete sequential art version of Hunter-Killer will ONLY be available in the trade.\nWHAT ELSE IS THERE?\nOur three previous standalone sequels will be available as well. And they are:\nTHE SCOURGE OF THE MECHANICAL MEN \nSTORY: Granville and Tesla are in a race for time to save Boston from a mysterious disease that turns human beings into machines.\n\nTHE SPIRIT OF REBELLION \n STORY: Caitlin flees to Philadelphia only to discover a ghost, a rebellion, and perhaps, her destiny.\n\nGHOSTS AND DEMONS \n STORY:  A disturbing dream leads Caitlin and the team to face off with a new enemy.\nTHE BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY COLORING BOOK:\nTwenty (20) gorgeous illustrations for you to relax  and color away to your heart's content.

Inspired by fantasy and the art of storytelling,   Holly-Rosing uses her imagination to create a fantastic story that is   both well-written and fearless.\" - Valerie Complex (Fansided)\n\"If you have a taste for an intelligent, well written, elegantly   illustrated award winning independent book, you can't go wrong with   Boston Metaphysical Society!\" - Alex Yarde (The Good Man Project)\n\"This very inventive series posits a totally believable Steampunk   world that is populated by appealing characters who act (and react) in   believable manners to the extraordinary events that swirl around them.\"  -  Robert Sodaro (Comic Reviewer at Examiner.com)\nTHE STORY BEHIND THE STORY\nI love writing BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY.  Not only does it bring my  love of science fiction and history  together, (which by the way, equals  steampunk), the steampunk time  period allows me to address the themes  of classism, sexism, and racism  in America in a thoughtful and engaging  way. For at its very core,  BOSTON METAPHYSICAL SOCIETY is an American  story.

This campaign is aiming to fund these two issues in order to complete what we hope will be only the first arc of a much longer series. \nPage 36 of Young Offenders! #1\nIn issue two, it's time for this make-shift team to figure out where they stand before the attack reaches earth. We'll see the urban vigilante and knife aficionado Jane teaching that spoiled rich boy Colin how to actually throw a punch, Victor stepping into the role of reluctant \"team dad\" even as his own personal life and music career is in danger of falling apart, and Elaine and Esperanza unexpectedly bonding as investigating a \"routine\" power outage puts all of them right in the villainous Hun-Came's crosshairs.\nIssue #2, page 2\nIssue three is where everything explodes after the shocking events of issue two. Villains will be confronted, reality will be altered, and our self-involved young adults... might actually take a big step into growing into their more realized selves.\nAlong the way, each issue will have a back-up dedicated to exploring the background of one of our central characters. Issue two will feature a back-up focused on armored super-teen Elaine aka Whiz Kid, and issue three will have a back-up focused on that master of caustic arts, Esperanza aka Bruja!\nIssue #2, Page 3\nCreative Team!\nWriter Mark O. Stack is a Chicano comics writer based in New Jersey who has been self-publishing comics since 2016. His work includes editing and writing the lead feature for the inclusive superhero comics magazine Weekend Warrior Comics (successfully funded on Kickstarter!) and scripting the critically acclaimed graphic novella The Scent of May Rain, the latter of which Scott Snyder (Undiscovered Country, Dark Nights: Death Metal) praised for Stack's \"ability to create a whole superhero mythology.\" He is currently writing an unannounced middle-grade graphic novel. \nIssue #2, page 4\n Artist Mike Becker is a cartoonist based in Philadelphia. After graduating from the Savannah College of Art and Design with an MFA in sequential art, Mike has been working as an independent illustrator since 2016, and recently began self-publishing his creator owned superhero webcomic, Empyrex Adventures on Instagram (@Empyrex_Adventures).\nH.E.R.C. on page 30 of #1, and page 1 of #2\nLetterer and designer Jodie Troutman is a comics creator based in Arizona.

Stack to create your own teen superhero character. You'll be able to provide Mike with your character's name and description, and he'll sketch various design possibilities. After up to three rounds of notes, you'll finalize the design with Mike and you'll get to work with Mark to create a one-page origin/introduction for your new hero!\nMike Becker's early Demon Boy sketches\nWhen you're happy with the script, Mike will draw the page traditionally and finish it digitally. You'll receive the original art for the page, sign an agreement stating your ownership of the character, and receive a high resolution file of the completed (colors and letters) page for your own personal or professional use.\nIf you'd like, we can also include the final page in Young Offenders! #3 and discuss a future appearance in a later issue with your consultation on the writing of the character. Ultimately, this character will be entirely yours! The Create Your Own Young Offender! is limited to two backers at the $1000 level.\nMike with a page of original art from Young Offenders! #1\nCreating a character that a backer will own entirely is a lot of work, but you've seen how much work we've put into this book from Mike's design work to the characterization we both strive for so we think the cost of this tier (which comes with all our other amazing rewards) will be worth it to anyone who selects it. This is a chance to create something that you'll be proud of and, if you want, spin-off into your own comic!\nAdd-On's!\nPrint copies of The Scent of May Rain, Weekend Warrior Comics #1, and Young Offenders #1.\nIn addition to the rewards offered above, you can also add-on a limited number of items after you select your pledge: \nprint copies of issues one through three! \nprint copies of The Scent of May Rain, praised by superstar comics writer Scott Snyder (Nocterra, Batman): \"The Scent of May Rain is a stunning debut.

All the scripts are written, so now we just need the funds to make sure Mike has the space to comfortably complete the work on these two issues.\nOur goal of $10,000 is largely made up of production costs (art, lettering, design, etc.) as well as printing and shipping these books to our backers.\nStretch Goals!\n $12,000: Print copies of the ongoing spin-off web serial, The Lark: Birthday Wishes by Colt Hoskins and Mark O. Stack, will be collected in print and made available to backers as an add-on as well as added to the Digital Archive tier.\n$15,000: TO BE ANNOUNCED\nShipping Schedule!\nTo clarify the release schedule of these issues, all PDF copies of Young Offenders #1 along with the Digital Archive will be sent out to backers immediately once the campaign is funded and charges have cleared. PDFs of issues two and three will be sent out to backers as they are completed in July and September, respectively. \nTo keep shipping costs down for our backers, we are planning to mail out the print copies of all issues together once #3 has been printed (with a goal of shipping no later than November), but backers can message us about paying an additional shipping charge to receive print copies of #2 (and whatever additional books/items they've selected) once they are finalized.\nI have personally run three successful Kickstarter campaigns in the last two years with very fast fulfillments. My latest campaign to reprint The Scent of May Rain was printed and shipped to backers within weeks of me receiving the Kickstarter funds.

Well here's a chance to see all the nuts and bolts of how one is put together...\n My name is Declan Shalvey, an award winning artist/writer from Ireland. I've been a freelance artist for over 10 years working for publishers such as Marvel and DC Comics on characters such as Moon Knight, Wolverine, Batman, Hulk and many more. I have also developed creator owned projects at Image comics, on books such as Injection, Savage Town and Bog Bodies.\n\nTIME BEFORE TIME is my latest creator owned series, debuting May 12th. The series begins in the year 2140, and to escape that world with no future, many turn to the  Syndicate, a criminal organization who, for the right price, will  smuggle you back in time to a better life. After working for the  Syndicate for years, out main characters Tatsuo and Oscar decide to steal one of their  boss\u2019s time machines\u2014but soon find that the one thing you can\u2019t run from  is your past.\n\nThis series is a new ongoing image series from myself and the creative team behind the recent and excellent WRITE IT IN BLOOD graphic novel. The Final Order Cutoff (FOC) to order #1 is soon; April 19th. To celebrate this new project, I'm doing something a little different... I want to pull back the curtain on the creation of an original series, for process junkies everywhere.      \n TIME BEFORE TIME: Process Edition is a 48 page process book, about making the new Image series, revealing the creative process behind developing the first issue of the series.  This is not the Image comic book that will be in comic stores; this is a book about how the comic was made. It's a rare opportunity to see all the raw elements of a comic develop into a finished piece of work.\nWhy Kickstarter? Well, this is an experiment for me, I've often been told that I should make some process projects though I haven't been sure how to release them. I also felt a companion process book would be a great way to dig deep into process material in a way that wouldn't be possible in a regular comic or trade collection.

The bodies will mount, loyalties will be tested and no one will come out of the bush unscathed.\nCreative duo Matthew Soall (Weird Crap in Australia Vol. 1) and Ignacio Di Meglio (Hyper Epics: The Ace, Body and Soule, The Last Battle, Graphic Mundi: Covid Chronicles and Critical Role sizzle reel: Strength) offers a forty-eight page, full-colour comic telling one complete story. Matthew has incorporated real-world locations informed by research conducted for the Weird Crap in Australia podcast to give the book a conspiratorial flare, while Ignacio breathes new life into the Australian bush and presents KILLEROO like you have never seen him before.\nThere's also a definite influence of the classic film PREDATOR, which is one of our favourite films.\nKILLEROO: SEMPER FI will reward long-time readers with a brand new adventure, while introducing new readers to Australia's favourite indie comic marsupial in all his brutal glory.\n\n\nNot only do we have a great cover for the book by Ignacio, but we're very lucky to have an awesome alternate cover by one of my mentors, Jason Badower (fresh off his run on JOKER/HARLEY: CRIMINAL SANITY from DC Comics!) - how cool is that!\n\nIgnacio has made a solid start on the book, having drawn the first 5 pages and several key battle sequences already. He has also adapted his style for this book, adopting a heavy blacks and texture style with a strong colour palette. Take a look:\n\nIf you've never heard of Killeroo before, he is an Australian comics character, created by myself (Darren Close) way back in 1995. \nI have since published over a dozen comic books about him, working with some of the best writers and artists in Australia and abroad.\nHe is a kangaroo/human hybrid created by the Australian military in a secret facility back in the 1970s. Bred to be the ultimate soldier for the harsh Australian outback, for a war that never happened. Since he escaped that facility (and termination), he has formed a bond with the Aboriginal community, and is often found fighting for them and the environment against the destructive encroachment of industry and corporations.\nTo the general public, he is a myth - something akin to Bigfoot or the Loch Ness monster. This is because few of those who encounter him live to tell about it.\n\n\nWe're looking to finance a brand new 48-page full colour comic book.\nGetting an artist of Ignacio's calibre for a project like this isn't easy, and can't really be done without some assistance to pay his page rates. So while he was gracious enough to produce the sample pages you can see here, payment is needed to complete the rest of the book. That's why this project has a larger goal than I've sought for previous campaigns, to make sure both the artist (and the writer) are properly compensated for the work they've done.\nI've also structured the campaign so that they will receive a significant percentage of the funds raised if we exceed our target. So the more funds I can generate, the better the deal for them as creators. Because they deserve it.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe've partnered with some other great kickstarter campaigns running right now, which means if you back both this campaign and theirs, you get some extra goodies!\n\nDustin Brunell's GREED\n\nBen Slabak's AHMOSE Book 1 \nOur second double-backer print comes with the newly launched GORILLA MY DREAMS campaign from Big Tim Stiles. This one gets you two DIFFERENT prints - a colour one by Ignacio, and a B&W piece by Samir Simao!\n\nAdd-ons are a new feature to Kickstarter, and they work by enabling you to choose some extra items to add to your pledge, after you've selected the reward you want. \nYou can add other Killeroo comic books, t-shirts, and even slabbed and graded editions of this comic. Take a look at the full selection below:\nDIGITAL ADD-ONS:\nPHYSICAL ADD-ONS:\n\n One of the signature components of my Kickstarter campaigns is the extra goodies you get, for the more funding generated! So if you help to spread the word about this campaign, you'll reap the extra rewards!\n There's a bunch more physical rewards to be unlocked over the next few weeks! \n\n\nMATTHEW SOALL / WRITER\nMatthew is a co-host of the Weird Crap in Australia podcast and co-author of the companion novels Weird Crap in Australia Vol.1 and Vol. 2 (Vol. 2 releasing in September 2021). Raised on a healthy diet of aliens, superheroes, and serial killers, he developed an undying passion for all things pop-culture, paranormal and macabre.\nMatt currently lives in Queanbeyan, New South Wales, writing, working, and producing podcasts with his creative partner and wife, Holly Soall, while executive cat producers Talia and Joker constantly mock him for procrastinating.\n\nIGNACIO DI MEGLIO / ARTIST\nIgnacio Di Meglio has been a freelance cartoonist for more than a decade and has been drawing and telling stories for as long as he can remember. He has made comics, illustrations, and character designs for a variety of projects.

He has also produced several autobiographical stories to critical acclaim, his Ledger Award-nominated STRUGGLE book was named Best Original Comic Book of 2015 by ComicOz.\nHOLLY SOALL / SCRIPT EDITOR\nButcher by day, author by night, Holly spends her days off writing, playing in her garden and watching superhero cartoons. Holly lives with her husband Matthew and her cats Talia al-Kitty and The Joker, in a two-bedroom flat crammed with comics, video games, books and movie memorabilia.\nHolly is the researcher and co-host on the Weird Crap in Australia podcast, which releases every Monday on all good podcasting platforms. \n\n\nThe Kickstarter Campaign: 30 Days (April 1 - April 30)\nRemaining 30 pages completed (May 1 - September 1)\nShipping Survey Goes Out (September)\nBook Goes to Printer: (mid-September)\nDigital Rewards Released: (mid-September)\nShipping & Delivery to Australian Backers (October)\nExpected delivery to International Backers - (late October)\n\n\nNothing is more important than getting your goods to you in perfect condition!\nWe've been making comics and doing mail orders for decades, so we make sure to make our packaging just about bullet-proof. Not only do we bag and board our books, but we also make use of bubble-wrap, hard cardboard backing and waterproof envelopes.\nThe shipping costs are a little more expensive because we also insist on parcel tracking, so we can make sure that your books are delivered as quickly and safely as possible.\n\nFor those who are looking for a more technical outlook on where their money is going when backing this project, here is a pie graph and percentage breakdown. The second graph shows how funds generated after reaching target goal will be distributed.\n\n\nThis is the third Kickstarter campaign I've run, the first being just a few months ago, which was frankly a HUGE success - hitting almost $17k in total, a staggering 676% of the $2500 I was asking for.\nNot only that, but it took less than two months for everyone to receive their kickstarter pledges and rewards. And when I say rewards, there was a LOT of swag thanks to all the unlocked stretch goals!\nBut don't take my word for it, hear it from Corey Wyer who backed it:\nThe second Kickstarter campaign I ran was a full colour edition of the Killeroo origin story. While a smaller campaign, it still reached a total of over $6.2k in total, being 249% of the target goal.\nI've just completed fulfilment for that second campaign last month, getting books to backers several weeks earlier than I had originally planned.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the third Kickstarter campaign that I have run, and I have been self-publishing comic books for over 20 years - so I know what I'm doing.

I won't see any money myself until the target goal has been surpassed, so I'm not looking to make this a big money-making exercise - I just want to get the book printed and into the hands of Killeroo fans. There's also a generous royalty payment built into the campaign, so once it surpasses the target goal, an extra 50% will go to the creators onboard.\n\nI've also included enough to cover the Kickstarter fees and any other transactional fees and charges.\n\nLastly, I have made sure that all shipping costs include individual item tracking, to ensure that when the book leaves my hands, this will make sure that it gets into yours as soon as possible.\n\nThank you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 9 or more", "title": "DIGITAL COMIC", "descp": "Get the digital version of the comic, emailed to you upon completion.\nINCLUDES:\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}], "stat": ["90 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 20 or more", "title": "COMIC", "descp": "Get the comic book (your choice of cover), the digital PDF, and all unlocked stretch goal rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nComic (choice of cover)\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["137 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 40 or more", "title": "COMIC COMBO", "descp": "Get both covers for the book, the digital PDF, and all unlocked stretch goal rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nComic (cover A)\nComic (cover B)\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["36 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 55 or more", "title": "TRIPLE COMBO", "descp": "Get all 3 covers for the book (including the new homage cover), the digital PDF, and all unlocked stretch goal rewards.\nINCLUDES:\nComic (cover A)\nComic (cover B)\nCOMIC (homage cover)\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["10 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 75 or more", "title": "T-SHIRT COMBO", "descp": "Get yourself a Kickstarter exclusive t-shirt (your choice of size and colour) and a copy of the comic book (your choice of cover).\nINCLUDES:\nT-shirt\nComic (choice of cover)\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["20 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 75 or more", "title": "QUAD COMBO", "descp": "Get all FOUR covers A, B, C & D.\nAlso gets you the PDF Bundle of 12 bonus comics (an extra $11 in value), and the Digital PDF\nINCLUDES:\nComic (cover A)\nComic (cover B)\nCOMIC (homage cover)\nComic (cover D homage)\nPDF Bundle (12 DIGITAL COMICS)\nComic (digital PDF)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 90 or more", "title": "COMIC & SKETCH", "descp": "Get yourself an A5 original sketch, all the way from Argentina!

Her writing has a Neil Gaiman quality,  storytelling infused with a playful whimsy overlying a deeper sadness  that begs for a resolution...\" -Newsarama\nIf you're a fan of cult Halloween classics like Coraline or The Nightmare Before Christmas, you will fall in love with the hauntingly lovely Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits.\nThis graphic novel is a Limited Edition Exclusive and it will collect all 4 completed issues + extra art in a beautiful hardcover book, with an all-new cover by our precious and talented Laura M\u00fcller. The book will be 8in x 11in (quite a bit larger than the original issues), 92 full-color pages printed on a lithograph, and if the stretch goal is achieved, it will sport a UV spot lamination on the cover! After this Kickstarter is finished and the books are sold out, Second Edition will have fewer special features, so if you're a collector this Kickstarter is the only way to get this edition of Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits!\nNenetl of the Forgotten Spirits is a spirited horror story about a ghost searching for her family during the festival of the Day of the Dead, while dodging ambitious young exorcists. Vera Greentea (Grimoire Noir, My Parallel Life) and artist Laura M\u00fcller create an autumn-friendly tale of skulls and hope.\nEvery year, Mexican families gather to celebrate and welcome back the souls of the dead. They decorate graveyards with marigolds and introduce their beloved spirits to their children. But when the dead ones are forgotten, their spirits are never seen again. Until one early morning on the Day of the Dead, the shroud between our worlds were opened long enough to let one forgotten spirit out\u2026\nWhen the lost forgotten soul of Nena discovers that she is out in the Living Realm, she makes it her mission to find a single living person who might remember her and invite her to the festival of the Day of the Dead every year. But things aren't so simple, and while she has a full day to find that person (the span of the festival), she is also hunted by several ambitious exorcists who know that she shouldn't be in the Living Realm. \na page from Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits\nVera Greentea writes spooky fantasies for kids and grown-ups. She's best known for GRIMOIRE NOIR (a YALSA Great Graphic Novel of 2020) and her Victorianpunk series Recipes for the Dead. You can find her comics at her website greenteapublishing.com.\nLaura M\u00fcller (aka Laumii) is a fulltime concept artist from Germany with a passion for visual development and children's books. She is currently developing her gorgeous work on the German fairy tale MOTHER HULDA. You can find more of her art at https://www.artstation.com/laumii/profile. \nOur lively Kickstarter campaign will be up from March to April, during which time  we hope to collect enough money to pay Laura for her marvelous comics and cover work, print the book and ship it to you cheery Halloween and spooky fans, as well as the usual heres-and-theres (aka Kickstarter fees, buying  packaging supplies, all relevant merchandise, ISBN &  barcodes, etc.). This is going to be Greentea Publishing's first Hardcover graphic novel, of beautiful quality in full-color and large font format. We are spending everything we make on this beautiful book! As always, we will certainly and proudly be using an American printer to save on any damages to the environment. \nWhile we are concentrating on making the most beautiful book we can, we are adding some adorable extras that will be only available with this Kickstarter!\nEveryone who orders the hardcover will also receive 2 special gifts; a beautiful Greentea Publishing/Nenetl bookmark and a Kickstarter exclusive Ex Libris sticker, onto which you can write your name and stick to the book. This way, unlike our dear little Nena, your book will never be lost or forgotten.\nA Note for Acknowledgements: If you've been acknowledged in one of the previous issues of Nenetl, there will be a page for \"those who have helped us along the way.\".

Don\u2019t let its  self-published status fool you; this book is as good as any published by  a larger press, and has a ton of heart behind it...\" -Hidden Gems:  Panels on Pages\n\n\"...Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits fits right in  with independents like Yi Soon Shin, the works coming out of India that  focus on the Hindu Gods, and some of the more interesting comic books  coming out of Denmark and Finland. There is a large tradition to uphold  here, and Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits does so brilliantly.\" -Comics  Forge\n\"...Cute characters interact in a world of magic tinged with  just a little darkness, capturing the playfulness of Halloween... I  admire anybody that can create this kind of dark material in a package  that children can also enjoy, and there\u2019s something decadent and creepy  about Nenetl of the Forgotten Spirits.\" -Starbust Magazine\n\n\"...Laura  and Vera have also really worked on a stylistic flair to her characters  who are individual, quirky and have a dash of cheekiness in each panel.  It\u2019s got sequential motion that\u2019s ever whirling through from panel to  panel. Just darn cute as well.\" -downthetubes\n\"...I absolutely  loved the artwork in this book, which reminded me of an excellently  animated film and really immerses the reader in a world of magical  realism.\" -Whatcha Reading?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGreentea Publishing has now been creating projects on Kickstarter for over 7 years.

Especially C\u00e1ssia Costa.\nAn ancient cult and their army of demons have stolen C\u00e1ssia\u2019s home, Apex City.  When a magical dragon bracelet rockets into her life and affixes itself to her arm, C\u00e1ssia\u2019s the only person equipped to stop the cult from offering the entire city to their dark lord.\nThere's just one catch...\nInferno Girl Red by Nicola Scott (w/ Annette Kwok), left, and Valeria Favoccia, right\nThe magical bracelet is powered by belief, and C\u00e1ssia \u2014 an intensely pragmatic, rational girl \u2013 doesn\u2019t have much to spare. She\u2019ll have to find something to kindle her faith, though, and fast \u2014because she has a secret legacy to live up to. Because her mother's life is on the line. And because Apex City needs Inferno Girl Red.\nHi! My name's Mat Groom. And this story, INFERNO GIRL RED, is one I\u2019ve been working on for about three years now. I\u2019ve always thought it was worthwhile, but I was never certain it would work\u2026 until I met Erica D\u2019Urso. Erica is just wickedly talented. You can see that in her work on JAMES BOND, CAPTAIN MARVEL and XENA: WARRIOR PRINCESS. But it was her energy, her tremendous passion, that made me believe. Erica loves C\u00e1ssia, and C\u00e1ssia\u2019s world\u2026 and that love infuses every part of this project. There\u2019s nobody I would rather be co-creating this world with.\n\nInferno Girl Red Character Design\nTogether with colorist Igor Monti (who has a ultra-modern and vibrant style you'll recognise if you read MEGA MAN: FULLY CHARGED), letterer Becca Carey (a real star-in-the-making) and design agency For The People (a Top 10 Global Agency, according to D&AD), Erica and I are so excited to bring you this all-new 100-page superhero graphic novel.\nINFERNO GIRL RED Creative Team\nKyle Higgins is editing this book. Kyle and I have been friends for half a decade, at this point. He has mentored me, in many ways (he edited my first comics series SELF/MADE), and more recently we\u2019ve worked as a writing team on ULTRAMAN for Marvel Comics. We share a passion for the Japanese tokusatsu genre (which was a big influence here, along with British boarding school dramas and American superhero comics). And there\u2019s little coincidence that C\u00e1ssia was first introduced to the world in the back of the first issue of Kyle\u2019s series, RADIANT BLACK. In fact, the connections between RADIANT BLACK and INFERNO GIRL RED may run deeper than you think\u2026\nC\u00e1ssia\u2019s not shy\u2013 but bouncing around from city-to-city as her Mom bounced from job-to-job meant it was hard to make friends... and any friends she did make disappeared pretty quickly once they found out who C\u00e1ssia\u2019s mother was. So instead of socialising, she focused on learning\u2013 showing a particular aptitude for science.\n\nC\u00e1ssia Costa Character Design\n \n                     Now C\u00e1ssia has a chance for a fresh start in Apex City. Her impressive test scores have earned her an invitation to the world-famous entrepreneur Doctor Janine Caro\u2019s prestigious boarding school for promising young minds. There, C\u00e1ssia starts to settle in. She starts to make friends. She starts to see a future for herself.\nBut when a magical bracelet blasts through a window while C\u00e1ssia is studying late one night, everything changes. C\u00e1ssia's quickly drawn into a strange war that she previously only heard about from her mother... \nConcept Art \u2013 The Griffin and Other Manifestations of Darkness\nConcept Art \u2013 C\u00e1ssia's Mom, and Other Mentors\nConcept Art \u2013 New Friends\n\nReady to experience some of the story?

Winter Solstice. \nBefore the soda drinking bears, before the bright red suit, and before the litany of saccharine films & music that saturate every holiday season, there was cold and night and fear.  \nCover Image by Donna Black, Yule Logo by LetterSquids\nThis collection of short horror comics will examine Yule, Winter Solstice, Saturnalia, and a slew of other terrifying folklore from around the world, from well-known tales of Krampus to the lesser-known Mari Lwyd, and all the bizarre traditions in between. \nArt by Meredith McClaren\nTHE TEAMS\nContributing to this book is an all-star lineup of talent, with each team producing tight-and-terrorizing tales based on 14 different pieces of worldwide folklore:\nMARI LWYD from Justin Jordan and Val Halhovorson \nKRAMPUS from Umar Ditta, Elliot Balson, Mike Maynard, and Rob Jones \nKARANKONCOLOS from Frankee White, Fell Hound, and DC Hopkins \nBELSNICKEL from Dillon Gilbertson and Matt Battaglia \nCAGA TIOS from Heather Vaughan and Jason Piperberg \nSMEE from Malissa White and Anastasia Longoria \nELF ON THE SHELF from Kacey Flynn and J Schiek \nHANS TRAPP from Alex Schlitz and Grant Stoye \nMIDNIGHT SPEECH from Meredith McClaren \nTOES from Jack Foster \nGRYLA from Ian Mondrick and Kam White  \nHUITZILOPOCHTILI from Jarred Lujan and Gregery Miller \nSATURNALIA from Joe Corallo and Elena Gogou \nPERCHTEN from Jenn St Onge \nLogo Design by LetterSquids \nCover Art by Donna Black \nLettering and Book Design by Toben Racicot \nForeword by Heather Antos \nWe'll also have incredible pin-up pieces from Minerva Fox, Marie Wolf, and Marie Enger.\n\nBUDGETING\nThe $15,000 goal is the largest I've ever pursued, but it is to meet the compensation that each creator involved deserves: $9,000 will be going directly to the teams that made this book, with around $4,500 going to printing and shipping.

We're honored and humbled by your support, and can not wait to put this groovy tale in your hands. \nFor the latest please follow:\nHeroTomorrow.com\nHero Tomorrow Facebook\nInstagram.com/tedsikora \nTwitter.com/tedsikora\nThe year is 1969. Ramsey is an aspiring comic book artist who is trying to find inspiration for his femme fatale. When he meets wild dancer, Regina, at a street fair he invites her into the woods for a character photoshoot where she begins to break on through to the other side. Witness the psycho-delic origin of the most powerful character in the Hero Tomorrow Comics universe. A mind-bending 4 issue journey to reshape your reality!\nSecond issue 32 pages full color, glossy paper.\nAll physical orders will include a signed Regina print by Ted Sikora. This is the second of four to accompany each release created in an Andy Warhol homage style.\nShipping in June 2021.\nSurvey will give you option to have them signed for FREE.\nExclusive Publisher variants not available elsewhere.\nAll four issues of this series will release in 2021.\nTed Sikora (writer/creator/colorist/letterer) is a Cleveland/Akron based comic book writer and filmmaker. He is the president of Hero Tomorrow Comics, and the creator/writer/letterer of Tap Dance Killer andPunchline & the Vaude-Villains, and creator/co-writer/colorist/letterer of Apama The Undiscovered Animal. As a filmmaker he directed the indie feature Hero Tomorrow and  hundreds of shorts in realms of documentary, music videos, and  education. He wrote the libretto, principle music and lyrics for the  horror show musical Nothing Like Vaudeville. \nButch Mapa (artist) is a professional illustrator and graphic novelist with a decade of experience, currently illustrating Marvel's Action Avengers through IDW, He's done work for Zenescope, Top Shelf, Image, Upper Deck, and many others.\nWhy Crowdfunding?\nFirst, there's nothing better than having a direct connection to  readers. I'm honored to have had that experience through conventions and  Kickstarter over the past decade. Some of the most touching moments in  my life have come from people telling me they see themselves in a  character that I created. Also the interaction online with you helps  shape these campaigns. It undoubtedly makes me a better creator, which  hopefully  enhances the experience for you with each go 'round.\nSecondly, BLOOM was actually solicited in the Previews Guide catalog in April of 2020, but due to the massive covid shutdown, that  particular catalog was barely distributed. We had to pull it because it  would have had no chance. Our business model relies heavily on comic  conventions, and without cons we would simply lose money on every  release. The Kickstarter platform is like a virtual comic con, and we can do things on it we can't even do at conventions. (like pick your shirt color and CGCs.)\nAs the industry changes we're trying to change with it.  I heartily  thank you for supporting the indies and making this moment possible.\nThank you so much for checking out our campaign.\nTed Sikora \n PREVIEW PAGES\nThe Bloom #1 campaign has a preview of the first eight pages of the series. I'm still coloring issue #2. Here's some new ones: \n\nSTRETCH & MILESTONE REWARDS\n $5000 Unlocked (Interior pinup by Pietro)\n 200 Backers (Unlocked) Super #6 PDF from Unlikely Heroes & Oxymoron The Loveliest Nightmare #1 PDF from Comix Tribe)\n $7000  (Unlocked} Interior Pinup by Fabio Nahan \n 250 Backers (Unlocked) Apama #9 PDF (Featuring a certain psychedelic guest star)\n $9000 (Unlocked) Staunch Ambition #1 PDF \n 300 Backers (Unlocked) Regina #1 4\" Sticker Bong Dazo \nBong Dazo Issue #1 four Inch Sticker Unlocked\n $10,000 (Locked) Regina #2 4# Sticker Benito Gallego \nBenito Gallego Four Inch Sticker Locked\n 393 Backers (Locked) Why 393? This would break our previous Kickstarter backer record. If we do that, ALL physical backers will receive a bonus PHYSICAL surprise comic back issue from the Hero Tomorrow Comics library. Digital backers will get a digital surprise back issue too.\nDigital stretch and milestone rewards will be given to all backers ($5 and over) at campaign's conclusion.

So, essentially, you're now getting about 16+ comics for this one pledge.\nTHE JUMP is a comic book series from screenwriter Rylend Grant, artist Fabio Alves, colorist Edson Ferriera, and letterer HdE... the same twisted team that brought you Action Lab: Danger Zone's critically-lauded superhero noir BANJAX. Banjax was nominated for FOUR Mike Wieringo Comic Book Industry Awards in 2020 including BEST SERIES (along-side BITTER ROOT, SOMETHING'S KILLING THE CHILDREN, & BLACK HAMMER: AGE OF DOOM).\nThe first Issue of THE JUMP - launched via Kickstarter last year - received RAVE reviews. This campaign will fund the pulse-pounding second issue and hopefully we'll hit a few stretch goals along the way so we can give you more bang for your Kickstarter buck.\nAfter a series of crippling personal tragedies, Thomas Northrope retreats from his everyday life and finds comfort in an online community dedicated to the art of astral projection. When he demonstrates a unique aptitude for the practice, Thomas becomes the target of a mysterious corporate/political machine \u2013 known as AJAX \u2013 bent on using promising young practitioners to win a centuries-old war on the astral plane.\nAstral projection is the process of willfully separating one's consciousness from his or her physical body and moving it freely through the universe/the astral plane. A key philosophical concept in many Eastern cultures and religions, astral projection is regularly practiced by yogis and by devotees of certain Hindu & Buddhist sects.\nAstral projection can happen spontaneously \u2013 like in near-death experiences \u2013 or it can be made to occur with practiced conscious effort. During projection, people have reported flying, passing through solid objects, seeing into the past and future, communicating with the deceased, and visiting far away planets.\nThe astral plane is a division of existence postulated by classical (particularly neo-Platonic), medieval, oriental, and esoteric philosophies and mystery religions. It is a dimension beyond the physical\u2026 the realm of dreams, spirits, and psychic phenomena, the substance and vehicle for contact between the material and the mystical. Some writers/philosophers conflate this realm with heaven and/or hell, with union with God itself.\nIn the world of The Jump, the astral plane amounts to psychic real estate\u2026 another proverbial mound of dirt to be carved up, claimed, and fought over by politicians, influential businessmen, and the cultural & religious elite.\nFROM RYLEND: I\u2019m a screenwriter by trade. For over a decade, I\u2019ve made my living writing smart psychological thrillers for directors like JJ Abrams, Ridley Scott, Justin Lin, John Woo, Luc Besson, and F. Gary Gray, so I can\u2019t help but think of things in cinematic terms. The Jump is a smart, high-concept sci-fi thriller full of meaty twists and turns. It is Inception meets The Bourne Identity\u2026 if it were dripping with macabre and directed by David Fincher. Now tell me that doesn\u2019t sound cool?\nNot ready to make THE JUMP with us just yet? Well, then check out this free preview of Issue 2:\nI know what you're all thinking now. \"That was BADASS, but what do we get if we pledge?\" Well, I'm glad you asked. First, there's--\nWe print THE JUMP on a heavy 80 lb paper stock with a 100 lb glossy cover. Top quality, all the way. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the difference. This is very much a Cadillac. A heavier stock also makes the comic less likely to be damaged in transit.\n\nTHE REGULAR COVER - ALVES & FERREIRA\nWe're also offering three UBER-limited variant covers you'll only be able to procure here on Kickstarter. Feast your eyes on these:\n\nB2TF HOMAGE VARIANT - ALVES & FERREIRA\nTrust us... this one's heavy... and if our calculations are correct, when this baby hits 88 mph, you're gonna see some serious shit.\n\nMANDO HOMAGE VARIANT - ALVES & FERREIRA \nYou can run from this cover... but you'll only die tired.\n\nMAGNUM P.I. VARIANT - ALVES & FERREIRA \nBetter snatch this pretty little thing up before Higgins releases the Dobermans.\n\nGREAT covers, right? Having trouble choosing just one? Well, why not GRAB THEM ALL?!\nDid you miss out on Issue 1 of THE JUMP? No worries! We've got you! All four Issue 1 covers are still available (Regular cover and the Ghostbusters, Ice Cube/\"Good Day,\" & Risque variants) RIGHT HERE!\nFor more info on the Issue 1 covers, check out the ISSUE 1 KICKSTARTER PAGE.\nNOTE: Special \"Early Bird\" tiers are available for ONLY the first 48 HOURS of the campaign.

ALL backers of this Kickstarter will essentially receive THREE badass comic issues for the price of one AND...\nA MEATY PREVIEW OF THE PEACEKEEPERS #1\nAgain, we're still getting to know each other here... so why not check out our last book/the book that just took Kickstarter by storm?

These are A5 format (roughly 6x8 inches) and feature characters from THE JUMP. \n\nORIGINAL ART - B&W COMMISSION FROM FABIO ALVES \nGot something you want drawn? Well, then why not commission JUMP/BANJAX artist Fabio Alves (2020 Ringo Nominee for BEST COVER ARTIST) to draw you an original B&W pin up? You pick the subject matter.\n\nORIGINAL ART - FULL COLOR COMMISSION\nGot something you want drawn? Fabio will still do it, but why not go the extra mile and have your piece rendered in full, beautiful color by JUMP/BANJAX Colorist Edson Ferreira (2020 Ringo Nominee for BEST COLORIST)?

We starting building out this set (we made cards 1-3) during the Peacekeepers 1 & 2 campaign and they were a big hit. Score three more bonkers (cards 4-6) here!.\n-STRETCH GOAL #2 - $16,000 - (to be revealed)\nTHE JUMP has sprung from the wicked minds of Hollywood screenwriter/Ringo Award-winning comic creator Rylend Grant, artist Fabio Alves, colorist Edson Ferreira, and letterer HdE... the very same team that brought you the dark and decidedly wicked superhero noir BANJAX (published Action Lab: Danger Zone).\nBANJAX made over a dozen ten-best lists in 2019, it was nominated for FOUR Mike Weiringo Comic Book Industry Awards (including BEST SERIES) and the critics raved:\n\u201cThis is the most amazingly well done first issue of a series I have ever seen. Point blank. Period\u2026 You cannot read this and come out if the same way you went into it\u2026 So effin\u2019 good.\u201d (Steven Leitman, Reading with a Flight Ring)\n\u201cBanjax has all the action, violence, grit, and heart of a classic.\u201d (David Pepose, Creator of Spencer & Locke)\n\u201cQuality, engrossing material embedded with a cinematic feel. Gifted storytelling and breathtaking artwork. Banjax will instantly have you screaming for more!\u201d (Jason Bennett, PopCultHQ)\n\u201cBanjax hits incredibly hard. Intense, thought-provoking, wildly entertaining. It\u2019s near perfect. For those looking for something unique, Issue #1 is a must-read.\u201d (Charlie Chipman, The Brazen Bull)\n\u201cRiveting. Refreshing. Heart-breaking. Ultra-violent. Honestly, a bit unsettling. The artwork of F\u00e1bio Alves is everything a dark and gritty comic should embody. Edson Ferreira\u2019s color work adds an extra punch to really emotional panels. Don\u2019t miss out on this bloody good time! A+\u201d (Andrew Huard, You Don\u2019t Read Comics)\n\u201cHoly crap this is good. This book hits all the right notes. It\u2019s marvelously done, such a compelling story. It\u2019s the best comic I\u2019ve read in a long time. Honestly? Bendis could take some notes here.\u201d (ComicCast Podcast)\n\nAnd Rylend's previous book - ABERRANT - won a prestigious Mike Wieringo Comic Book Award (\"Ringo Award\") in 2019 for BEST VILLAIN and was nominated for two others... BEST SINGLE ISSUE and BEST WRITER (alongside Jeff Lemire, Scott Snyder, Brian K. Vaughn, and Brian Michael Bendis).\nAnd here's what the critics had to say about ABERRANT:\n\u201cGo home, other comics people. Rylend Grant and Zsombor Huszka just killed the game\u2026\u201d (Charles Pulliam-Moore \u2013 i09)\n\u201cABERRANT offers an intense, near-cinematic reading experience that incites excitement and inspires interest for issues to come.\u201d (The Brazen Bull)\n\u201cAberrant flat-out works. You have visceral action scenes. Personalities practically ooze out of the page. Honestly, this is the kind of storytelling that the big publishers are missing.\u201d (Big Comic Page)\n\u201c\u2026a bleak, dangerous and serious story with a lot at stake\u2026. If you like revenge tales, military thrillers, and superheroes, \u2018Aberrant\u2019 has it all.\u201d (Spartantown)\n\u201cABERRANT #1 is a game-changer at Action Lab: Danger Zone. You\u2019ll become captivated almost immediately\u2026 The creative team put together one of the most seamless, cohesive, and dynamic collaborations I\u2019ve seen this year on the indie scene.\u201d (PopCultHQ)\n And ABERRANT was quickly optioned for television by 24 & FELICITY Executive Producer Tony Krantz! \nAnd our last Kickstarter effort, THE PEACEKEEPERS, took the site by storm... \n\"THE PEACEKEEPERS is going to make everyone on the indie scene step up their game. This is some next-level s*** that is destined to be snagged by Hollywood. The theatrical feel, the brilliant delivery, the character development, and the remarkable comic book experience you\u2019ll get \u2013 THE PEACEKEEPERS is going to make a lot of new fans, impress current fans, and is destined for a lot more than we can possibly know. You want greatness, look no further.\" (Jason Bennett - PopCultHQ)\nMUCH MORE LOVE TO COME ON THE JUMP!\n\nAs you can see THE JUMP was put together by one hell of a team, guys whom have already been around the block a few times together... joining us this go round, though, is an army of astral projectionist gurus \u2013 shepherds of the real-life communities upon which the one in our book is modeled. While we work to make sure The Jump appeals to a hungry American action thriller audience, these folks will be making sure we keep things authentic, grounded, and true to the astral traveler\u2019s experience.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHE JUMP is brought to you by a team of steadily working professionals that has collaborated previously and delivered an exceptional, critically-acclaimed, Ringo Award-nominated book.

This book is a full color 36 page story and the black & white artwork without word bubbles or other distractions. There will also be back-matter explaining the world of War Priest and more!\nThis story is a love letter to every creator and story that has ever excited me. You may see something that reminds you of something you love too!\n\nChapter 1:\nWar Priest is a story for anyone who likes swords and sorcery, monster hunting, dystopian futures or anything action packed with a little thought provocation.\nIn the distant future, North America has changed in every conceivable way. Several separate nations have been formed and Kingsland is one of them. Kingsland is a Theocratic/martial nation ruled by High Father Solomon III. King Solomon was divinely chosen to rule and has taken Solomon as his name. The nation is divided into 12 Wards and each is ruled by a War Priest who answers directly to the High Father. Each War Priest is chosen by the High Father and takes the name of an Apostle of Jesus.\nMatthias is the War Priest this story focuses on. (Matthias was the Disciple chosen by the other 11 after Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus.)\nHe is sent to the 9th Ward in search of its War Priest, Thomas.\nWhat he finds may change everything...\n\nWar Priest: Enhanced Edition Chapter One\nPage 1\nPage 2\nPage 3\nPage 4\nPage 5\nWhat are people saying?\n\"It\u2019s a gruesome, bloody brawl from beginning to end, and it\u2019s wondrous to read. It falls somewhere between a manga and a western comic: more visual, moving quickly without much dialog or exposition. Kemp gives you everything you need and plenty of blood to dirty your blade.\" - Blake Morgan\nhttps://blaketmorgan.wixsite.com/blakesbuzz-1/post/war-priest\n\"The world-building was fantastic, as Kemp thought of some great ways to show some unique magics. For instance, Mathias faces off against a demon that can control the properties of the plane around him. With such a popular, time-worn genre like fantasy, new and unique magic is a must.\" - Ryan Shimek\nhttps://www.comicbookyeti.com/post/war-priest\n\"In the end, we get an epic showdown between good and evil, where both sides of the coin question the virtue of their foe\u2019s actions. Across the 9 page battle spread, we see an epic combination of fight dialogue, multi-environmental battles, and bloodshed.  There is a big cliffhanger at the end of the book that leaves me with so many questions hoping that War Priest #2 comes out quickly! What does the outcome of the battle in the 9th ward mean for Kingsland? What are other War Priests doing at this time? Are there scarier and more powerful magic users we have yet to be introduced to?

Their mother, Jasmine, was the daughter of Nazi hunters, and indoctrinated into La R\u00e9sistance after WW2. After moving to the U.S., Jasmine settled down and had three daughters, but her hard-lived past caught up with her. \nThe Deadliest Bouquet explores what happens when Rose, Poppy, and Violet have to put their resentment toward each other aside in order to find Jasmine's killer.

She resents her sisters for leaving and having lives of their own.

ABYSSAL ALBION takes place in a GREAT BRITAIN where both cosmic and folk terrors are a commonplace and chilling truth.  \nRavaged by death and madness, the series follows the continuing journey of two siblings, SISTER and BROTHER, as they try to survive a world teeming with savage cults and sanity shattering beasts.\n If you are a fan of nightmarish post-apocalypses, doom-laden horror,  and mind bending cosmic dread, this is the series for you! Where our first issue dove head-first into the nightmare filled depths of the British woodlands, the second takes us to its now less than idyllic coastlines.\nThough it\u2019s not only overly aggressive seagulls, and the unpredictable British weather our pair will have to contend with.  In their search for Sisters estranged partner the pair face the horrifying and  grotesque -  DEEP ONES.\nHalf-man, half-fish hybrid,  worshippers of the colossal ancient deity DAGON, Deep Ones now inhabit and control the worlds coastal towns and ports.\nContinuing on from our previous 28 Page issue, we shall continue to deliver a unique look at a very weird apocalypse, stunningly drawn in B&W.  \nWith your support we are set to deliver another quality issue, delving even further into the unknown world of ABYSSAL ALBION.\nWritten by cosmic horror aficionado, screenwriter, and creative producer for the DEADBOLT Films, THOMAS J CAMPBELL (BEYOND, AND NOTHING HURT) and with artwork by accomplished artist WAYNE LOWDEN (PLAINER JANE, NOCTURNE), lettering by KEN REYNOLDS (COGNITION, HERE AND THERE) and cover colours by TRILBY BLACK.\nABYSSAL ALBION is filled with exciting and spine-chilling homages to the CTHULHU MYTHOS and hopes to continue the tradition of the originators of weird fiction, H.P Lovecraft, Ambrose Bierce, Robert W. Chambers, Charlotte Gilman Perkins, Arthur Machen, amongst others.\nDrawn in striking and suitably atmospheric Black and White by WAYNE LOWDEN, with art that perfectly captures the strange and chaotic world our protagonists now find themselves in.\nThe book itself will be printed on 120gsm uncoated paper to give the pages a slightly rough, more visceral texture, and will feature a 200gsm full colour gloss laminate cover.\n\n\nBIG COMIC PAGE\n\"Imagine if you will a story that is similar to The Walking Dead, but instead of zombies shambling across the pages, you have the creeping, insidious horrors spawned by Cthulhu and the rest of his star-spawned family. Okay, I\u2019m not saying that this is another Walking Dead, but it definitely has a similar vibe, and the same potential to be an epic saga given half a chance.\"\n3 MILLION YEARS\n\"This is a real page turner, with some excellent scenes, art, lettering and storytelling. Hopefully, there is more to come from this world \u2013 those with little knowledge of the Lovecraft mythos will enjoy this as much as those who have more.\"\nCOMIC BOOK NEWS UK \n\"Wayne Lowden  really delivers something special here. It\u2019s art that oozes with unsettling qualities, encapsulating the darkness literally and metaphorically. I like it, I like it a lot. There\u2019s a tangible menace that leaked off the pages for me. Panel after panel delivers incredible detail and emotional weight. It\u2019s a heavy sketch style of monochrome brilliance, rich in shading that just sets a wonderfully dark atmosphere.\"\nTHE CONVENTION COLLECTIVE \n\"As can be expected, a story in the horror genre deserves some parental discretion. There is cursing and some violence as well as some scary imagery that skews this title towards older readers.\"\n MIDLIFEGAMERGEEK.COM \n\"The intriguing events of the issue set us up nicely to learn more about the siblings and their surroundings as we continue to follow their struggle for survival. With the first issue having come to life with the aid of a successful crowdfunding campaign, I shall be keeping a very keen eye out for the second issue\u2019s launch on Kickstarter.\"\n Of course you'll need supplies if you're to survive in the harsh world of ABYSSAL ALBION - so by backing us here is just some of what you can get!\n25mm CTHULHU Pin Badge\n25mm ABYSSAL ALBION Pin Badge\nBookmark\nFull Colour Cover Art Print\nLogo T-Shirt (Limited!)\nOriginal Art Prints\n\n As we hit our target and issue two becomes a reality, we'll be releasing a bunch of stretch goals. \nFirst of which being a unique A4 Mythos Inspired art print commissioned specially for ABYSSAL ALBION from the fantastic Davey Jebadiah Sewell - A master of occult and gothic horror imagery, a couple examples of his beautiful work can be seen below below.\nShould we go beyond even further then we have an art  variant by Canadian horror artist and illustrator Trevor Henderson.\nKnown most famously for his unsettling \u201cSIRENHEAD\u201d creature,  as well as a myriad of other terrifyingly creepy cryptids and weird imagery. As anyone who is aware of Trevor's incredible work will attest, expect something truly uncanny and horrifying.\nKeeping with the tradition of a unique campaign video that gives a glimpse into the setting wider ABYSSAL ALBION setting via short film,  SOLITUDE was shot alone during lockdown to serve as further worldbuilding into the world of ABYSSAL ALBION. \nDirected & Written by Thomas J Campbell\nScreenplay by Thomas J Campbell\nProduced & Edited by Jon Payne\nSound by Gav Chuckie Steel\nFemale Voice \u2013 Corinna Jane\nMale Voice -

Thanks for taking a look at \u201cTales of the 399.\u201d \nWe\u2019re students at Moravian College, a small liberal arts school in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. We are a class of English majors and minors, and we all have passion for writing. Some of us have made comics before, while others have not. Throughout this semester, we\u2019ve learned a lot about the creative process of comic-making in our Comics and Graphic Storytelling class, or English 399. This collection showcases our new skills.\n\u201cTales of the 399\u201d is a collection of memoirs, each written by one of us. When choosing a personal experience to illustrate, we focused on the theme of family. Some of our stories are lighthearted, while others are more serious, but each of our unique views of family bind them together.\nWe\u2019ve never attempted to publish a book on this scale before, and we\u2019re excited for others to see and read our work! We\u2019d greatly appreciate your support, as this means a lot to us as students and as authors. Our ultimate goal is to be able to print full-color copies of our collection, to distribute copies directly to you, and to gain meaningful experience in promoting and publishing our creative labors. Putting our work out into the world for the first time is scary and exciting at the same time, and we would greatly appreciate your contribution to our journey.\nPreviews\nHere's a look at some of the eight stories included in this inaugural issue:\n\"The Art Kids\" by Grace Gilbert\n\"Luke 15:20\" by Sam Riley\n\"The Half-Beating Heart\" by Evan Yandrisovitz\n\"Same Old New Year's\" by Anna Litofsky\nRewards\nOur best reward, we hope, is the book itself!

Well I spoke with F-Stop the Visionary today to come up with a fair price to create a stand alone add-on backers can add and have officially created the add-on.

In other words, it would be a whole lot like... \nWHAT IS THE SOLAVORE?\nThe Eater of Dawns\nLike a vampire needs blood, so the ancient evil known as THE SOLAVORE needs the energy of a sun. Absent for centuries from the far-off galaxy of the Morrigen people, the Solavore had disappeared into the realm of myth. But now, with one of their solar systems facing a cosmic loss, the Morrigen are learning that the Solavore is not only real... but hungry.\n\n WHO IS HUNTING IT? \nFor years, the Galactic Kingdom of the Morrigen had been protected by its latest ruler, the brave and brilliant KING THEOSIS. Committed to the freedom and safety of his people, King Theosis has lead the Morrigen through decades of darkness, striving toward a future of progress and peace. But after so many battles, Theosis's beard has gone white; the grip on his sword has grown weaker.  And after a devastating personal loss, Theosis must summon a strength he's never known to defeat the worst threat the Morrigen have ever seen.\nFortunately for Theosis, his husband ABBINOIR will be there to help. Wise and compassionate as any ruler his people have served, Abbinoir is Theosis's personal strength. While the king is looking out for the kingdom, Abbinoir looks out for its king. And though he's been doing it for all of Theosis's reign, every new threat weighs more on his mind, none more so than the Solavore. After all, how can you protect a man who must protect a kingdom?\nNot that he won't have help. In facing this unheard-of crisis, Theosis will have at his command some of the best warriors in the entire galaxy: his own royal guard and the elite female warriors known as the VALKINAE. Together, they make up the best defense the Morrigen have.\nBut will they be enough?\n\nSNEAK PREVIEW\nCheck out some of the (not finalized) pages of HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE.\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n(Pages not final)\n WHO IS CREATING HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE? \nLANE LLOYD - Creator of the weird and zany, Lane is an up and coming artist with an energetic, off the wall style. After being featured on Comic Book Yeti, Outright Geekery, and The Driving Creators Network, Lane's comic GOD-PUNCHER smashed its way onto Kickstarter, receiving more than double the projected amount of funding.  With HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE, Lane uses their skill of designing strange, larger-than-life characters to tell a story that's both firmly planted in the horror genre and stretched to the outer limits of science fiction.\nGRANT DeARMITT - Grant's tales of the sinister and strange have been published at Haw Creek Horror, Crystal Lake Publishing, and Black Hole Entertainment.  A lifelong fan of weird fiction and fantasy epics, Grant hopes HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE will present the human side of cosmic terror; an otherworldly story that hits home.\n\nWHY ARE THEY CREATING IT?\nKing Theosis's ship. For interplanetary travel... and beyond.\nLane and Grant have spent two years developing the shocking showdown of Theosis and the Solavore. They made this Kickstarter to bring that story to life in the form it deserves: the comic book format.  But there is another reason. \nHUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE is just one story of thousands set in this all-new universe that Lane and Grant have cooked up. Getting it created, printed, and into the hands of readers like yourself is the first step in telling those tales. We believe that comic fans are hungry for new worlds and new terrors, and we believe we have some great ones to offer.\nSo by backing this project, you're not just helping us make a comic. You're opening a door to another galaxy, and all the heroes and horrors that live there.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt takes time and a whole lot of effort to put together a story as ambitious as HUNT FOR THE SOLAVORE, which is why we're making sure our creative team gets funding to do so! $4200 will go to Lane for his brilliant work drawing, inking, coloring, AND lettering each gorgeous and terrifying page of HFTS, while $2100 will go to Grant for his plotting, several edits, and writing of the script.

So, once we hit the goal, the book can hit the presses, and be in your hands post-haste.\n\n\nWHAT FOLKS ARE SAYING ABOUT THOUGHTSCAPE...\n\"ThoughtScape Comics is the quintessential, beautifully packaged and expertly made serialized sci-fi anthology that comics needs right now.\" -Liana Kangas: Trve Kvlt, She Said Destroy, Black AF: Devil's Dye\n\"Fantastic, artistically diverse and engaging stories of a cool far future world, all tied together with prodigious panache by writer Matt Mair Lowery.

She uses her magic to be a hero, to fight the good fight, and to defend humanity from the world\u2019s greatest evils\u2026 or does she?\nThe story begins as a mysterious figure collapses at her door in fear. The figure begs Occulus for her help, claiming that he is being chased by a terrifying hound larger than any dog he has ever seen, with eyes that burn like fire.\nWill our hero be able to protect the weary traveler from the nightmarish hellhound that pursues him? Or will the monster prove too formidable of a foe? Will Occulus live up to her moniker as London\u2019s greatest magician, or will her arcane power reveal that there is far more to this tale than even she may have expected?\nOcculus #1 follows our protagonist, Esme Eldritch. The self-proclaimed master of mystery and sovereign of sorcery known as Occulus, who has been fighting monsters and evil forces for millennia. The first issue of the series focuses on how she became such an iconic name in the world of magic, and what sorts of threats hide in the darkness waiting to be unleashed.\n The action pact first issue deals with the character's origins, how she obtained her powers and how she uses them for good. But as time goes on, it becomes apparent that the stranger is not the man he says he is, but rather, a powerful warlock. But why the disguise? Why the decoy? Why Occulus? All these questions and more will be answered in the pages of Occulus #1.\nOcculus is A 28-page comic book featuring a modern twist on one of storytelling\u2019s most ancient genres, Magic. Our new Sci-Fi / Fantasy / Superhero comic series is set in the bustling heart of London. The Big Smoke has seen its fair share of heroes and villains, but on one fateful night, a storm tears its way through the city, unleashing a monster straight from the depths of hell.\nWe're thrilled to be offering art prints by three different artists for this campaign! So if you select our Art Print pledge level then you will be receiving all three of these amazing designs, or on our standard physical pledge level, you will get one of your choosing! \nPrint A - Guillermo Villarreal\nPrint B - Domenico Pagano\nPrint C - Kevin Bouchard\nOcculus is the second series in Broadcast Comic's 'Superhuman Universe', following on from Diamond #1 that launched on Kickstarter in 2020. \n\nWhile both series are set within the same universe, their stories run parallel, meaning that if you haven't had the chance to check out Diamond #1, you can still start right here with Occulus.\n\nHowever - If we have piqued your interest, both Physical and Digital copies of Diamond #1 are available as pledge rewards, meaning you can get caught up in all of the superhuman madness that is rocking our fictional London. \n Matthew Hardy makes his writing debut for Broadcast Comics with Occulus #1, but those familiar with the UK Indie Comics scene are sure to recognize him from his amazing work over at Mad Robot Comics.\nKieren Stevens returns to Broadcast Comics as the co-writer of Occulus #1, after a successful Kickstarter campaign for Diamond #1 in late 2020. \nAnother new face to the Broadcast Comics team is Guillermo Villareal. This hugely talented artist has done an incredible job of bringing the world of Occulus to life, and we can't wait for you to see everything that he has been working on.  \nRob Jones also makes his return to Broadcast Comics reprising his role as Letterer Supreme. Those familiar with Rob's work will know how much impact his work adds to a story, and if you haven't seen him in action, then this book will blow your socks off!

The doctor readily accepts the position, but goes about the work with much trial and error. \n\nDoctor Caim encounters patients from all walks of life, experimenting with treatments while monitoring his own health and watching the stars for omens...\n\nInterior Pages\nResearch is the integral foundation of both the script and design of The Plague and Doctor Caim. Each medical treatment Doctor Caim tries and every situation Doctor Caim finds himself in is based on historical facts. \n\nWith the aesthetic of a medieval illuminated manuscript, this graphic novel finds macabre comedy within the history of the bubonic plague.\nThe plague doctor has fascinated all sorts of people with his instantly recognisable costume and beak mask, but many are unfamiliar with the history behind them. The plague doctor appears in many supernatural-themed comics, is a favorite among numerous cosplayers, and can be found adorning many bodies as tattoos\u2026 but none of these glimpses of the sinister silhouette delves into the reality of the plague doctor\u2019s life, as The Plague and Doctor Caim does.\nThe Plague and Doctor Caim Hardback Book\nG.

Since I began working on my graphic novel trilogy The Poet and the Flea, about the poet-painter William Blake (1757 \u2013 1827), I have often thought of Blake\u2019s illuminated manuscripts (his illustrated poems) as a precursor to today\u2019s comics in their uniquely Blakean combination of word and image.\nWhile working on The Plague and Doctor Caim, which takes place 100 years or so before Blake\u2019s time, I hit upon a connection between Doctor Caim and the illuminated manuscripts that must have inspired Blake. Illuminated manuscripts date as far back as the year 400 up through the 1600s (and perhaps beyond, if we include Blake and other artists). The quintessential illuminated manuscript is a book from Europe during the Middle Ages handwritten in blackletter and painted with vibrant pigments by monks. These books were mostly Christian texts such as the bible or a book of hours."}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "263 backers pledged \u00a36,594"}]}], "comments": []}}, {"backer": "Oliver Mertz", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Down below the abandoned skyscrapers and crumbling colonial architecture, beneath the buzzing lights and ragged billboards, is a fading, floundering city propped up by vice, extortion, and fear.

There\u2019s magic, mystery, personal drama, and an accidentally carnivorous plant.\nWitches have been a part of the political fabric of Washington D.C. since it was founded. It\u2019s only since the 1960s that witches stood together and fought to take back the word \u201cHexed\u201d. A movement was ignited when witches came out of the shadows and proudly showed off their broomsticks.\nThe witch-hunt for Charlie, Jaya and Florence continues as they find themselves on the run from malevolent forces both inside and outside the government. The three witches must harness their powers to defend themselves, while unraveling a mystery that could save the entire witching community.\n\nKirsten Thompson is a comic writer and editor based in the Pacific Northwest.

That being said, some of the things that rely on external production (The manufacture of rewards, logistics of packing & shipping individual rewards) may cause some delays. \n\nDepending on the print quantity, we may choose to print our books in Canada or overseas. If so, there could be problems such as our books being held in customs, and longer shipping times. \n\nI have spent the past eight months planning and refining this project. I have accounted for these potential problems and worked them into our schedule. \n\nEveryone will be updated every step of the way, throughout the entire production process.

Jaded after millenia of destruction and death, Xolotl hid away and watched his family sacrifice themselves in the name of hope for life beyond themselves.\nXolotl, alone and ashamed, became racked with guilt, causing him to weep so intensely that his eyes fell from his head and descended to the center of the newly forged universe: the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.\nSeeing an opportunity to redeem himself, to honor the sacrifice of his family, Xolotl guided the Aztecs to forge two macahuitl, imbued with a piece of his own godhood. The Left and Right Eye of Xolotl, entrusted to twin siblings to wield together in defense of the Fifth Sun, became known as...The Twin Blades.\nArt by Julio Suarez and Rocco Langg, logo by Andrea Rosales\nNow in the year 2108, the blades are entrusted to twins Xiomara and Basilio Gutierrez who inherited them as children. Xiomara is strong willed, determined, and believes in herself. She's committed to her role as wielder and her sworn purpose of defending the Fifth Sun...but Basilio? Well, there isn't exactly a bunch of threats to the Sun running around and he's ready to move on with his life. Leaving his role as Wielder behind to pursue his goal of becoming a teacher, Basilio strains his relationship with his sister. \n\nUnfortunately, things are rarely so simple. The Lord of the North himself TEZCATLIPOCA sees a distracted pantheon and a set of divided Wielders as an opportunity to mobilize his pawn YAOTL: a resurrected traitorous Jaguar Warrior now obsessed with never returning to Mictl\u0101n, the land of the dead. Yaotl is bestowed with a blade forged from the primordial Black itself and sets out to destroy the Fifth Sun and create a new universe for Lord Tezcatlipoca.\n\nCan Xiomara and Basilio stop arguing long enough to stop Tezcatlipoca's champion? Even if they can...will it be enough?\n\nTHE TEAM\nThe Twin Blades is a latine story and is proudly produced by an entirely latine team of creators:\nWritten by Jarred Luj\u00e1n: Jarred is a Mexican-American comic writer from the promised land of Texas. A 2019 Mad Cave Studios winner, he broke onto the comics scene with the four-issue mini-series Dry Foot. He likes the Wu-Tang Clan and existentialism. \n\nArt by Julio Suarez: Julio Suarez is a Mexican illustrator, having worked his whole life towards becoming a comic book artist, his passion for drawing has allowed him to work for companies such as Upperdeck Ent. and Cryptozoic Ent. as a sketch card artist, working with licenses such as Marvel and DC Comics, as well as freelance illustration work the last couple of years, now making his debut in the comic industry with \u201cThe Twin Blades\u201d as an artist, he is ready to show the world what he can do!\n\nColors by Rocco Langg: Based in Mexico City, she has worked on several comics ranging from commercial work for Mexican companies to her interactive IG comic Goodbye and Fuck You! She has a passion for sci fi and vibrant colors.\n\nLetters by Gabriela Downie: From California, Gabriela has been in the comic industry for 7 years. She's done a little bit of everything including production art, cover art, and lettering. Her work includes Harleen, Beast Boy Loves Raven, Punchline, and Batman '89.\n\nTHE SWORDS\nThe LEFT EYE of XOLOTL, wielded by main character XIOMARA\nThe RIGHT EYE of XOLOTL - Wielded by main character Basilio\nThe blades of THE TWIN BLADES\nTHE PREVIEW PAGES \nTHE PRONUNCIATIONS\nWhile you wait for THE TWIN BLADES to hit your eyeballs, learn to pronounce some of the more intimidating words for English speakers:\nXolotl\nTezcatlipoca\nMacuahuitl\nXiomara", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks are minimal.

Dance is something that is seen as beautiful, but many don\u2019t think about the pain that is done to one\u2019s body to truly be a dancer. Martial arts are thought of as violent because it\u2019s a form of \u201cfighting\u201d, but there\u2019s also a dance like quality to this work of art.\nBut once you dig deeper, the reader will quickly realize that The Dancer is actually a story about mental health. Mia is forced to face her own childhood trauma of witnessing her parents\u2019 murder when she becomes the enemy that she once dedicated her life to fight against. The Dancer is a morally gray story that shows that good and evil aren\u2019t so black and white.\nWith They Call Her...The Dancer #1, you get...\nA 22-page, stapled, standard sized comic book printed by Comic Impressions,\nincluding a Black & White edition\nand FOR THE FIRST TIME also in COLOR! \n 5 Covers to choose from, including a limited Kickstarter Exclusive FOIL cover!\n Here's what comic book critics and pros are saying about THE DANCER:\nKat at comic conventions way back when those were a thing...\nThey Call Her...The Dancer #1 COVER A\nCover B - Perfect Blue Homage - Saw Nai Mon\nWhen brainstorming variants for The Dancer, I knew I wanted something to showcase the shattering of 2 identities.

The anime film Perfect Blue goes through similar themes of identity, and its movie poster was a perfect homage for our premiere issue.\nSaw Nai Mon is an Animator/Illustrator and has graduated from LASALLE College of the Arts (Singapore) with a Diploma in Animation.

Unfortunately, he's been reincarnated as this guy...\nVictor's an unemployed millennial slacker who can't even get his life together much less slay a dragon.\nCan Mooney and Hazel prepare Victor for the battle of a lifetime?\nBeowulf is an epic tale that spans centuries, with heroes and villains fighting across time itself. Characters who are heroes in one lifetime may end up villains over the centuries. Lovers in one lifetime may become sworn enemies in the next.\nIf this all sounds overwhelming. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 there\u2019s also a lot of humor.\nSample pages below.

In a world where most animals have been hunted to extinction, technology now allows people to create whatever monster they want for their bloody entertainment. Hunters from all over the world rise to the challenge to earn a spot in the world finals of The Preserve! For the former champion, Winston Abara, and his artist, Rachel Lin, their journey to victory will for more than glory and riches, but the chance to save their home. Yet the primal allure of the game is powerful, and despite going against Winston's belief in the natural order of life, will he succumb to the evil influence of...The Preserve.\"\nCharacter Designs by Taylor Keith\nThe Preserve is a 5 Issue mini-series, starting with this first one being 28 pages. Set in the not so distant future, where the largest sporting event in the world has become The Preserve, a live game where hunters enter a prepared terrain to hunt a creature designed by the \u201cArtist\u201d of the other team, which then gets brought to life and released into the stadium. The game is controlled by the biggest corporation on the planet, Packard Industries, whose CEO runs the game. Our heroes (Winston and Rachel) enter the game to win the world finals and save their home from becoming the next Preserve! \nThe story explores the gentrification of these major sporting events, as well as the sanctity of life while criticizing hunting as a sport and the disrespect society has for animals. Tone-wise, this is like Running Man meets the Hunger Games in a sports movie with the feel of Jurassic Park. Those who love those movies, as well as science-fiction, action, and deep characters fighting for what's right will enjoy this comic!\nPage 1 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nPage 2 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nPage 3 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nPage 4 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nPage 5 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nPage 6 (Art & Lettering by Taylor Keith, Coloring by Crystal Pandita)\nL.A. Chavez is the writer of The Preserve! His first project was Frontier-0, a self-funded space opera comic with an animated pilot! Then recently, he funded the first issue of his fantasy comic, Santa Fae, right here on Kickstarter! Now he's looking to expand into new territory with a more grounded sci-fi story, which became this comic.  When not writing, he enjoys reading, cooking, and talking with his friends online. Check out his work at:  www.wickedsuitproductions.com\nTaylor Keith is the amazing artist bringing this comic to life! Based in North Carolina, US, she is an illustrator and comic artist with a passion for sci-fi, fantasy, and all things horror. \nCrystal Pandita is the colorist and cover artist for The Preserve! Hailing from Jakarta, she began her artistic career 2 years ago, honing her craft and working on comics like String, which you can find on Tapas. She loves horror and has a fondness for sci-fi technology.\nLettersquids is a letterer and graphic designer who has worked on several amazing indie comics, including projects with Scout, Action Lab, Advent Comics, Insight Comics, and many others. His comic Antares Finest (with art by ErrorBound) won the titles of \"Best Comic\" and \"Best Lettering\" on r/comicbookcollabs' 2019 Untold Worlds Anthology. He's jumping in as the official letter for The Preserve and doing the entire comic with his unique skills!\nSwamp Monster Design\nThis whole endeavor is so that we can fund the rest of the comic, we keep none for ourselves.  All our costs go into the project, to the artist, colorist, and letterer, as well the printer and the shipping costs, so we need your help to help us finish it and see it become a reality! ^^\nBy just pledging $6, you can get the digital PDF of the entire first issue of The Preserve! And for $12, you can hold the physical copy in your hands! However you choose to read this story, we know you'll enjoy it! It's 28 pages of top-quality work by the amazing team of artists we've assembled to tell this tale, rooted in our main characters coming together. I really like to think of it as a slice-of-life sports movie that meets a John Wick-style horror story about monsters! ^^ \nAlternate Version of Cover\nAnd for $20, on top of those, you'll also get the 36-page digital PDF of the first issue of my previous comic, SANTA FAE (complete with bonus short)! A fantasy crime drama about two elves knights looking to solve the murder that could shake the entire city of Santa Fae to its core! I like to describe it as Batman meets Lord Of The Rings, and if you're a fan of either (or both), you will LOVE this comic! ^^\nSanta Fae # 1 Cover by Kal Huset\nAnd for those of you who like to collect really cool art pieces, we offer one of the two awesome exclusive posters for The Preserve for those who pick the $30 tier! Each done by a different and talented artist, showcasing our two protagonists in their element. Winston Abara (The Hunter) by Ahmed Raafat and Rachel Lin (The Artist) by Lindsy Silva.\nWinston (The Hunter) Exclusive Print by Ahmed Raafat\nRachel (Artist) Exclusive Print by Lindsy Silva\nAnd finally, for those who are generous enough to donate $50 or more, we will give you a special producer credit and put your name at the end of the comic for your contribution. And for those who pledge $100, our amazing artist will draw you a special monster commission of your choosing designed to your specifications like the official ones you see below, which you can name! We'll make a special offer to the first 5 who pledge, to include their monster somewhere in the comic itself if they want!\nNOTE: All our shipping rewards are limited to the U.S., Canada, and the U.K, but if you are from somewhere else in the world and are interested, message us directly and we could work around it.\nMonster Designs by Taylor Keith\nMonster Design by Taylor Keith\nAs much as we'd be happy with simply reaching our goal, if you guys want to see more content from us, then if we can cross the goal by an extra 600$ over the amount we set, we'll make a short bonus comic expanding on the world of The Preserve and my favorite supporting character, Contessa Francesca \"La Benelli\" Urbina! A badass hunter from Italian nobility looking to prove herself on the world stage of The Preserve!  It will be drawn by the amazing artist Jenny Odio, and I'd love to be able to include this short at the end of Issue 1!

Badass, am I right?! ^^"}, {"status": [{"Project funds successfully": "313 backers pledged $5,449"}, {"Project launches": "MARCH 10, 2021"}]}], "comments": []}}, {"backer": "Oliver Mertz", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Follow the continuing exploits of the Next Generation of Great Detectives. See the new stretch goals in the Rewards section below!\nLondon, 1914 - Major Sheffield Holmes, nephew to the great detective, and his mysterious American partner Capt. Imogen Watson have uncovered a secret society known as \"The Moriarty,\" a dark cabal that has vowed revenge on the Holmes family. Joined by the gruff Det. Inspector Agamemmnon J. Brick of Scotland Yard and the resourceful mechanic Juliette McKinnon, the new Holmes and Watson must defeat the zealot known only as \"The Scholar\" and prevent Europe from descending into war!\nMAJOR HOLMES & CAPTAIN WATSON #3-4 picks up right where we left off and completes the first arc of the series, known as \"The Adventure of the Vengeful Scholar.\" Having discovered the existence of the villainous cabal known as \"The Moriarty,\" fanatical followers of the long-dead Napolean of Crime, the new Holmes and Watson must rely on their friends and their skills to uncover their nefarious plan and rescue someone very important to Sheffield Holmes.  But will the dark secrets in each of their pasts unravel the nascent 6th Special Intelligence Service? Issue 3 is a 24-page thriller that continues the tale, and the jam-packed 36 page Issue #4 brings the shocking conclusion to life. That's 60 pages of comics, what a deal!\n\nMajor Holmes & Captain Watson is a true labor of love for me, as a writer. I've wanted to tell this story since I was 9 years old when my Grandmother gave me a copy of The Complete Sherlock Holmes. I fell in love with the Great Detective then, and have reread his adventures over and over.  When (most of) the Holmes canon became public domain, I decided I wanted to put a new twist on the old tales, to create a new Holmes and Watson that shook up old ideas. Sheffield Holmes and Imogen Watson are equals, more than anything else, real partners and friends who rely on each other. They are both great detectives and skilled spies as well, and England will soon need them. They also each old dark secrets about themselves...\nCheck out a preview of Issue #3 below. \n\u201cI could tell from the first page of the preview art that I'd be into this\u2026 take(s) well-worn characters and remix(es) them in surprising ways\u201d - SYFY Wire.\n\n\"Stepping out from the shadow of giants is hard, but Jeff and Ismael have done a tremendous job in doing just that. A story that feels Sherlockian, but steps onto its own path with its own characters in its own story\" - Jarred Luj\u00e1n, writer - DRY FOOT (Mad Cave Comics)\n\n\u201cMajor Sheffield Holmes is not the Holmes you\u2019re expecting\u2026 Like his famous uncle he\u2019s intelligent, inquisitive, and quick-witted. Also like his Uncle his secrets run deep\u2026 Ismael Canales makes excellent choices regarding character expressions and level of detail.\u201d - WhatchaReading.com \nissue #3 cover by Ismael Caneles and Roger Sorruca\nIssue #4 cover, by Ismael Canales and Roger Sorruca\nSTRETCH GOALS ADDED!\nWe breezed past the goal so quickly we barely got time to tease these, but they have been added now! \nTHIRD STICKER DESIGN / PHONE CALENDAR WALLPAPERS ADDED!\n We'll be adding the third sticker to every tier that gets the pack. Every physical tier that doesn't include the whole pack will get at least one random sticker! And the digital tiers will be getting very cool digital phone wallpapers as well.\nThe NEW Major Holmes Sticker pack. Check out that Brick sticker!\n\nTHIRD NEW INTELLIGENCE PRINT ADDED, ALL PRINTS INCREASED TO FULL 8\"X10\"\nIn addition to intel on the villain known as \"The Scholar\" and Holmes & Watson's famous motorcycles, we'll add the detailed file on the Armaments of the 6th S.I.S. to the Special Dossier.  We're also increasing the size of these prints to full 8x10!\nWe're adding two VERY LIMITED EDITION Artists COMMISSION TIERS to the campaign. \nSeries artist Ismael Canales will provide FOUR one-of-a-kind 8x10 Commissions for lucky collectors! Each will feature one character of the backers choosing, be it a favorite from Major Holmes & Captain Watson, or any other character you're a fan of. Each Commission will feature ONLY a single character and, to quote Ismael \"I always add something in the background, to add context; I don\u00b4t like the character to be \"floating\" in the blank of the paper.\" Check out the image below to see something similar Ismael did for me personally!\nClick the image to see a higher-resolution version. It's really quite something.\nThese tiers have a slightly higher shipping cost, as all the commissions have to be shipped from Spain to Florida to be added to packages and then shipped on to backers. They will also deliver a little more slowly, as Ismael will wait to ship them to me until they are all complete. We'll keep backers updated on shipping dates, we think we've overestimated so as not to disappoint.\nAt this level, we're upgrading all the physical books to an upgraded 80# Premium Covers Stock. This will give every issue a premium look and feel beyond a typical floppy comic and make these Kickstarter Editions true collector's items. This is the same grade cover stock we upgraded to for #1-2, but we MAY go with a less glossy page and more of a matte to make them easier to sign! THESE BOOKS WILL ONLY BE AVAILABLE in this format from us!\n This is really something special. At this level, we're unlocking PHYSICAL printing of the 2nd Major Holmes & Captain Watson prose short story available in our top TWO tier sets. This will come in a collectible 5.25\" x 8\" booklet with a 10pt gloss cover with special cover! But we're not just giving cool things to the top-tier folks. The DIGITAL PDF of the short story, written by series writer Jeff Rider, will now also be available in EVERY DIGITAL REWARDS PACKAGE. That's right, every single backer will get some version of this story now! In addition, every package that includes all 4 issues will get the digital version of the FIRST Sheffield Holmes prose short \"The Adventure of the Errant Slipper\" by Jeff Rider. \nCheck out our latest update for all the details on Add-Ons, now available directly on the Kickstarter platform!\nNew Swag!\nWe've got some really great stuff planned, both for folks who've already read our first two issues and newcomers who want to get hold of the entire first arc.  There are also early bird tiers and some special add-ons and new stretch goals coming.  Here's a quick peek at the prototype 6th S.I.S. pocket notebooks! \nThe 6th S.I.S. Officers Field Notebook, lined on the inside (pen for scale only, final product may vary)\n The \"Brick Series\" alt-covers return!\nWe're excited to have two new alt-covers featuring fan-favorite character Agamemnon J. Brick, Scotland Yards biggest, baddest Detective Inspector! With art once again by Michael Dorman, these rare editions will feature colors by Anthony Lee. They'll be previewed here and added as stretch goals and add-ons once the campaign is live. Here's a  preview of the Alt Cover for #3, it's a work in progress, and we'll update this as it develops, but this is pretty close to the final version!\nBrick got SHOT, and he is NOT happy about it!\n Check out the Special Dossier packaging and print sets, with new prints for this campaign.\nPLAY\n\n Here's the full list of Rewards! Plus we'll open the Add-On store with more awesome stuff like the Alt-covers once the campaign has funded!\nJeff Rider - is a writer living in Orlando who publishes his comics in print and digitally at CloudwranglerComics.com and on ComiXology. Jeff has been telling stories since he could talk and loves collaborative art in all its forms. In addition to Major Holmes & Captain Watson he\u2019s the writer of the urban fantasy series The Arcane Cocktail Enthusiast with artist Davide Puppo (successfully funded via Kickstarter), the sci-fi adventure Gravity Matters with Sean Dillon (also a successful Kickstarter), and many more comics to be collected in an anthology of shorts coming this year.\nIsmael Canales - Ismael has worked with independent publishers both from the USA and Spain (ECV Press, Diabolo Ediciones, NowEvolution, Marauder Film), mainly in comic book anthologies with short stories. He started collaborating with Butxido Agency, and since then he has worked in the comics Athena Voltaire (ActionLab) and The Catch (Kickstarter) and is also currently working on a graphic novel for Dolmen Editorial (Spain). He lives in his hometown with his lovely girlfriend and their little (and evil) bunny, Guantes.\nRoger Sorruca - Roger Sorruca is an Illustrator, digital artist, and comics colorist living and working in Barcelona, Spain. In addition to Major Holmes & Captain Watson, he is the colorist for Athena Voltaire (Action Lab.)\nJustin Birch - Justin Birch is a  2018 Ringo Award-nominated letterer born and raised in the hills of West Virginia. Lettering comics since 2015, he is a member of the lettering studio AndWorld Design and has worked with DC, IDW, Dynamite, Lion Forge Comics, Mad Cave Studios, Action Lab Comics, DMC Comics, Source Point Press, Z2 Comics, and numerous indy publishers. Justin still lives in West Virginia, only now it\u2019s with his loving wife, daughter, and their dog, Kirby.\nEveryone knows that comics don't get made cheaply. When I created these books, I wanted to make sure that the artists got paid for their work upfront, and at a fair market rate. The majority of the money raised during this campaign goes to cover those artistic costs, cash that goes straight to Ismael, Roger, and Justin plus all the talented artists making art for Alt-Covers and stretch goals. They're the folks who made this story so awesome to read and look at. The rest are costs associated with the physical production of the books and other rewards like packaging, prints, etc. As the creator of Major Holmes & Captain Watson,  I don't take a page rate for myself on these books. Rather, as with every other campaign, any money raised beyond our goal goes to fund future issues of Major Holmes & Captain Watson! Rest assured, while these books are the end of this story arc, this is only the beginning of their adventures. \n (This is subject to change, and we'll update this section as the campaign progresses.)\nFeb 16\n\u2022 The campaign launches, with issue #3 already complete. \n\u2022 Issue #4 writing and line art also already complete.\nGoal reached\n\u2022 Orders for swag and other non-book rewards go out to suppliers as SOON as we hit our funding goal! These are sometimes slower than printing, so we don't want to wait.\nBeginning of March\n\u2022 Coloring work on issue #4 begins.\nBeginning of April\n\u2022 Issue #4 lettering begins.\nMid-April\n\u2022 Issue #3 and #4 go to the printers.\nEarly-Mid May\n\u2022 Rewards begin shipping!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo far the risk and challenges to Major Holmes & Captain Watson #'s 3-4 are very few. As you can see from the timeline above, the books are already very nearly complete. Coloring and lettering of issue #4, back matter creation, and layout are the only things left to complete before the books go to the printer. Some additional digital and comics perks like prints, custom packaging, and stretch goal rewards will be the only items to be created after the project ends, due to needing to know the total number of backers and so forth.\n\nThese orders will come while we're still in the throes of the COVID-19 pandemic, but we're working with a printer we trust, and they assure us delays are unlikely. This is our second time with this particular printer and they were great back in Nov 2020, so we expect more of the same.\n\nThis is also my fifth Kickstarter and the second for the Major Holmes series and is similar in scope to our previous projects. Those projects funded quickly, and all digital and physical rewards were shipped within the promised deadlines, less than three months after the end of the campaign. I've learned the value of making sure that the comic is almost entirely complete before launching a campaign means a really quick turnaround time and rapid rewards delivery. The few hiccups from our earlier endeavors became teachable moments for this one, so I expect even more smooth sailing. As always, should the unexpected happen, we'll keep everyone updated.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 8 or more", "title": "See, and Observe", "descp": "Get a DRM free PDF of Major Holmes & Captain Watson #3 and #4.

I have a largely volunteer team of incredible creators working with me to record all aspects of Daniels\u2019 life, and we\u2019ve received permission to capture some of the most amazing things you\u2019ll ever see on film. We're talking everything from SWAT courses to one-on-one armored combat trials in a literal ring of fire.\nI've also gathered - and am working with a team to professionally scan - thousands of pictures, along with archiving countless hours of old footage of Daniel's life and travels. \nDaniel's favorite photograph.\nThis is a story that deserves to be told. \nI've spent almost half a year building the team, outlining the 2021 schedule and shooting tests for SOLDIER... and we are ready to launch! Our budget includes everything to make the film I want to make: multiple field and interview days, storage drives for an extraordinary amount of 4K footage, archival still and video clean-up, editing, audio mixing, an original score, color correction sessions... and even an initial round of film festival submissions. It ALSO includes the 10% that goes to Kickstarter and charge fees, as well as taxes. Come join us on this adventure. We can't do it without you.\nPrototype t-shirts tested for maximum softness by my kitty, Miyazaki.\nSpeaking of you...\nI've prepared a number of reward tiers that reflect my commitment to local businesses. From hand-illustrated silkscreen t-shirts (with Endgame Clothing) to Portland printed DVD covers, post cards and poetry sheets (with StevensIS), you'll not only be backing an important film, you'll be backing family owned shops and receiving exclusive items. And as far as the t-shirts go, you'll get multiple design options. (Kitty not included.)\nThe team.  \nJustin, Jordan and Scott.

Each issue features complete, stand-alone stories that are always exciting, sometimes humorous, and occasionally downright scary.\n(Okay,  it's not that scary. There are no nightmares here. But we've learned that young readers love the idea of reading comics their parents think are too scary for them.) \nWe're using this Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to print the 33-page issue, House of Fear: Rubber & Glue, and hopefully, we'll hit a couple of Stretch Goals along the way for some additional items. \nWhat's it About?\nOur first story, \"Rubber & Glue,\" introduces us to a couple of students from Savini Middle School.\nCaden and Isaac aren't exactly friends. \nAnd everything is most certainly not okay here. \nCaden thinks he has the upper hand, as always. But this time, he's in for a shock. Isaac isn't just repeating a childish retort...\n...but instead is casting a curse. One that will force Caden to live a day in the life of the bullied. \nThis story isn't the Monster-of-the-Month fare you've come to expect from House of Fear, but instead, examines the roles we play in middle school, and shines light on just how easy a harmless prank becomes something worse. It's as if Stephen King wrote an after-school special. \nThis issue also features a backup story, \"The Trees Have Eyes.\" This one starts peacefully enough, with Tosh and his dad out for a pleasant hike in the woods. \nWell, maybe not so peaceful or pleasant for Dad. And when they venture off the trail...\n...and into a copse of aspen trees, things take a turn for the worse.\nTrust me, you'll never look at Aspen trees the same again. \nWhat to Expect\nHere's what you can expect when you back our latest campaign:\nOne issue featuring two complete, stand-alone stories.\n33 pages of full-color thrills.\nFun, exciting comics suitable for (almost) all ages.\nBagged/boarded comics shipped in sturdy packaging.\nWe print House of Fear domestically, which means a faster turn around time (within 2 months of the campaign end).  \nWe're now printing on a heavy 70 lb paper stock with a 100 lb cover stock.  A heavier stock means the comics stand up to multiple reads and make the book more suitable for sharing. \nStretch and Milestone Goals\nWe recently had our 175th backer, which means every backer gets a set of print-at-home activity pages. This set includes prompts for kids to draw their own monsters and comics, and of course, also includes coloring pages. \nIf we reach 200 backers, all backers will receive a PDF of the B&W version of The Trees Have Eyes. See Jethro's line work in all its glory in this special version of the story. \nIf we reach 225 backers, I'll upgrade the Digital Deluxe PDF to a full, behind-the-scenes, making of book. I received lots of feedback after our last campaign for this style of book, and I'm excited for the opportunity to do it again for Rubber & Glue.\nOur First Kickstarter Exclusive Variant\nWe're big fans of the old EC comics, so for this campaign, we created our first variant cover as an homage to those horror comics from the 50s. Those are James Hislope's lines, and Josh Jensen's colors, with Matt Krotzer on letters and design. They absolutely nailed it, didn't they?\nAs a way to reward backers with a piece of House of Fear history, the variant is an exclusive to Kickstarter. We'll print to order (with an overage of 10% to cover possible damage during transit), so don't expect too many of these to make it to my online shop or to convention tables. \nThe Rare, Serialized Variant\nWe've also got a rare variant for this campaign. This one features art by Jethro Morales and colors by Josh Jensen. There will be no House of Fear trade dress on the cover. Just the frightful artwork. \nEach copy will be individually serialized to only 31 copies. \nBoyle Minifig\nWe've partnered with Justin at Saber-Scorpion to produce a limited-edition Boyle minifig. The look and accessories are specific to this issue and will only be made available during this campaign. \nThe image below is a prototype of what you can expect.\nExclusive, Crossover Print\nOur first House of Fear crossover is here! Anyone who backs a physical reward for this campaign and the one for Phil Falco's Haunting 1-3 will receive this exclusive print, signed by the writers on both books. (Digital backers who back both will receive a digital version of the art.)\nStunning art by Jethro Morales and Josh Jensen\nHaunting is a solid, supernatural horror comic for teens and adults. So if you have older kids in your house or if you like to sample new horror for yourself, now's the time to try something new!  \n The Rewards \nAdd Ons\nIf you've backed a print tier, you can add additional print copies of House of Fear: Rubber & Glue. You can also catch up on all of the House of Fear comics with the Digital Catch Up add on. We have stickers, too!\nAfter you select a tier to back, Kickstarter will take you to the Add-On page. If you see another issue you'd like to have, simple select it from the Add-On page. \nOther print issues of House of Fear will be available as add-on options after the campaign has ended.\nPreview Pages\nBelow are pages from House of Fear: Rubber & Glue.\nShipping and Delivery\nOur young readers aren't overly concerned with mint comics. All they care about is reading the story....and rereading it as many times as possible. \nBut there are a lot of collectors reading House of Fear, too. We know true horror is getting a Kickstarter package in the mail and finding a crumpled comic inside.\nWith that in mind, we pack our books with the same care we used in making the book and the love that we have for our backers.\nAll comics come bagged and boarded. \nAny order that consists of 1 or 2 comics will be shipped in a sturdy, oversize envelope (stay flat mailers from Pratt Plus). \nAll orders of 3 or more comics will be shipped in a Gemini Mailer for added protection. \nAll packages will be sent via USPS Media Mail, First Class, or Priority Mail, depending on weight.\nTimeline and Budget\nThe comic is 100% complete, so all we need to do is send the issue and sticker sheet to the printers. After 2-3 weeks, I'll start shipping everything to backers. \nBut where do the funds go?\nAbout half of the funds we earn through Kickstarter will be used to print the comic and other rewards. Shipping will take approximately 40% of the funds we receive, and 10% goes to Kickstarter for hosting the campaign.\nAny extra money we earn from the campaign will help pay for future issues of House of Fear.\n Meet the Creators \nWill You Help Us Make Comics for Kids?\nIt's simple: We love making fun, exciting comics, and we want to get them to as many readers as I possibly can. We can't do that without support from readers like you.\nThank you for checking out our latest project. We hope you find a reward that suits you well, and when you do, that you back the campaign and help us continue making exciting, action-packed comics for kids.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my FIFTH Kickstarter campaign! The comic is already complete, and all we have left to do is print the comic and other rewards. \n\nWe're big fans of the Kickstarter platform, and we know how important it is for backers to get their rewards in a timely manner.

Details below. ]\n This week's cover story in Comic Shop News! \n The year is 1969. Ramsey is an aspiring comic book artist who is trying to find inspiration for his femme fatale. When he meets wild dancer, Regina, at a street fair he invites her into the woods for a character photoshoot where she begins to break on through to the other side. Witness the psycho-delic origin of the most powerful character in the Hero Tomorrow Comics universe. Issue 1 of a mind-bending 4 issue journey to reshape your reality!\nDouble sized first issue with 48 pages (40 story pages) full color, glossy paper.\nAll physical orders will include a signed print by Ted Sikora.\nPage production is complete - Shipping in Late March 2021.\nSurvey will give you option to have them signed for FREE.\n Exclusive Cover variants only available through this campaign.\nAll four issues of this series will come out in 2021.\n\nTed Sikora (writer/creator/colorist/letterer) is a Cleveland/Akron based comic book writer and filmmaker. He is the president of Hero Tomorrow Comics, and the creator/writer/letterer of Tap Dance Killer andPunchline & the Vaude-Villains, and creator/co-writer/colorist/letterer of Apama The Undiscovered Animal. As a filmmaker he directed the indie feature Hero Tomorrow and hundreds of shorts in realms of documentary, music videos, and education. He wrote the libretto, principle music and lyrics for the horror show musical Nothing Like Vaudeville. \nButch Mapa (artist) is a professional illustrator and graphic novelist with a decade of experience, currently illustrating Marvel's Action Avengers through IDW, He's done work for Zenescope, Top Shelf, Image, Upper Deck, and many others.  \nWhy Crowdfunding?\nFirst, there's nothing better than having a direct connection to readers. I'm honored to have had that experience through conventions and Kickstarter over the past decade. Some of the most touching moments in my life have come from people telling me they see themselves in a character that I created. Also the interaction online with you helps shape these campaigns. It undoubtedly makes me a better creator, which hopefully  enhances the experience for you with each go 'round.\nSecondly, BLOOM was actually solicited in the Previews Guide catalog in April of 2020, but due to the massive covid shutdown, that particular catalog was barely distributed. We had to pull it because it would have had no chance. Our business model relies heavily on comic conventions, and without cons we would simply lose money on every release. The Kickstarter platform is like a virtual comic con, and we can do things on it we can't even do at conventions. (like pick your shirt color and CGCs.)\nAs the industry changes we're trying to change with it.  I heartily thank you for supporting the indies and making this moment possible.  \n\n PREVIEW PAGES\nThank you so much for checking out our campaign. \nTed Sikora\nSTRETCH & MILESTONE REWARDS\n $5000 [Unlocked] - Holy Waters (song MP3) by Captain Future \n 100 Backers [Unlocked] - Deadskins #1 PDF \n$7000 [Unlocked] - Eder Messias interior Pinup Page\n 200 Backers [Unlocked] - Nook #1 PDF \n $8000 [Unlocked] - Apama The Undiscovered Animal #1 PDF (With Hero Tomorrow Comics Cover Gallery) \n$9000 [Unlocked] Up From The Skies #1 PDF\n $10,000 [Unlocked] Tap Dance Killer #1 and #2 PDF Origin of Punchline \n 300 Backers [Unlocked]  Voodoo Nations #1 Deluxe PDF \n $11,000 [UnLocked] Neil Zaza MP3 \n $12,500 [UnLocked] Photocover Variant will have a second cover image of Alicia Lynn as Regina on the back!

My name's Jeff McClelland, and I write books like The Tick and the Kickstarter-funded Black Terror: Social Insecurity. In 2020, I funded the just-shipped Planet Comics #1 right here on Kickstarter.

You can order just the regular cover, or both at the same time.\nIn addition, everyone who pledges at the $8 level or above will get a copy of an electronic \"making of\" publication, with a behind-the-scenes look a the creation of this issue.

It tells the story of high school senior Elliot Morgan: a massive comic fan with graduation and Major Voltage Adventures on his mind, when he's astonished to discover he has superhuman abilities of his own. \nWhen he almost immediately goes out and makes a public display of his new superheroic abilities, he's amazed to be confronted by his favourite comic book characters staring him down in the real world. As if that wasn't crazy enough, they reveal the truth about themselves - they're his parents and they reveal that they are refugees from the world of his favourite comic book escaped to this world when he was just a baby. \nWhat follows is revelation after revelation, after more and more of the family's secrets come to light. Just how many secrets can one family be keeping?\nThe Miracle Family by Luciano Vecchio\nElliot Morgan aka Miracle design by Vince Underwood\nElliot Morgan a.k.a. Miracle - Elliot is an average teen boy, and a bit of a geek. He\u2019s an outward optimist but harbours within him some anger. Elliot's anger seems to revolve around the idea that so much about himself was kept secret from him, but there's more that he's keeping inside himself. He is a believer in taking a responsibility for his home with his new capabilities, and with those newfound reality-warping abilities, there's little that he can't do.\nAyden Morgan a.k.a. Empath design by Vince Underwood\nAyden Morgan a.k.a. Empath - Elliot\u2019s younger in age but bigger in size brother, Ayden is much more quiet, introverted and sullen than Elliot. Ayden has been dealing with intense mental health issues, that may be connected to his empathic abilities, and he has to learn to come to terms and learn to live with them.\nEvan Morgan a.k.a. Major Voltage design by Vince Underwood\nEvan Morgan a.k.a. Major Voltage - Elliot\u2019s father, Evan was his world\u2019s leading superhero. Proud, tough, but with a warm, open heart, he\u2019s always been troubled by the fact he and his wife kept their kids\u2019 true nature from them. Defending his family has been his sole purpose since taking refuge in this world, so he now has a less ostentatious profession than 'superhero' to help stay hidden. However, he holds some pride in his son taking up his old line of work.\nKate Morgan a.k.a. Ms Phantom design by Vince Underwood\nKate Morgan a.k.a. Ms. Phantom - Kate is Elliot and Ayden\u2019s mother, and is the one responsible for hiding their true natures from them using her telepathy. She\u2019s almost the opposite of Evan in that she\u2019s quieter, seems sadder, and the escape to their new home and what it led to took its toll. However, she is fiercely protective of her family, and would go to any length for them.\nJessica Lectron a.k.a. Superia design by Vince Underwood\nJessica Morgan a.k.a. Superia - Elliot\u2019s cousin, Evan\u2019s niece, Superia was another great hero of their home reality. She was bright, bushy tailed and brash, but in the \u2018real\u2019 world has become more serious, grimmer and reserved. Much of this comes from the trauma of the move over to the new world, and she has withdrawn from the main family significantly, implying there might be more to her pull away from both the family and from her previous life as a superhero than is known.\nElliot Morgan is your average teenage outcast, keeping his head down as best he can to get through High School. One thing that's been a source of comfort to him all his life has been his love of comic books, particularly one comic book: the mysterious final issue of Major Voltage Adventures. An issue written by a reclusive British comics writer, that sees the heroes in a tense stand-off with their arch-nemesis Maestro during a reality-shattering Catastrophe. The story is left unresolved and is a major topic of debate and theorising for decades. Elliot doesn't know why he's so obsessed with it, but it's the one comic he comes back to read again and again. \nThen one day, the strangest thing happens: Elliot starts exhibiting unnatural, superhuman abilities. From there, Elliot's world is turned upside down, with revelation after revelation, not least of which being his parents are Major Voltage and Ms Phantom, and his family came to this world from the fictional world of his favourite comic book. \nSuperia designs by Andrew Sebastien Kwan\nNow deciding to use his great gifts for good in the 'real' world, just how will that work for a superhuman refugee from a comic book? And what other skeletons are the Morgans keeping in their closet?\nWe're going for a mix of soap opera drama and large scale superhero action adventure. Think The OC crossed with The Incredibles. Fantastic Four mixed with 13 Reasons Why. This Is Us meets X-Men, by way of Invincible. \nEmpath/Ayden design by Zoe Thorogood\nThe Miracles is a story I've been working on and wanting to tell since I started writing The Pride. The Miracles has been a comic series, a book, a mini-series, and over the years I've worked with numerous artists to develop the idea including Gavin Mitchell, Kris Anka, Zoe Thorogood and Andrew Sebastian Kwan. Now, having found the perfect team to finally make this project a reality, we'll bring it out as an Original Graphic Novel so everyone can finally have this tale of families, broken realities and the secrets we keep. While we touch on a number of issues including refugees, the role of a hero in the world, personal responsibility to one's home, whether born there or found, the main core remains family and secrets. \nOriginal Character Designs/Sketch by Kris Anka\nJoe Glass - Writer\nJOE GLASS - Writer - Joe is the writer and creator of LGBTQ+ superhero team series, The Pride. Originally self-published, The Pride was the first ComiXology Submit title that got upgraded and continued as a ComiXology Originals series. He's also released superhero political thriller Acceptable Losses and glitter noir, queer grindhouse revenge fantasy, Glitter Vipers. A staunch advocate for inclusion and representation in comics, Joe does whatever he can to make that happen. Joe lives in South Wales, UK with a belligerent cat named Oliver. You can follow him on twitter and YouTube. \n\nVince Underwood - Artist\nVINCE UNDERWOOD - Artist - Vince is an American comic book artist. His credits include Elk Mountain and Page Turn (both available on Comixology). He has also done comics work for transmedia horror company Cold Room Entertainment and illustrated for NBC Sports and the San Francisco Giants. Vince lives with and by the grace of his wonderful wife Hannah, their two dogs Cassie and Millie, and their cat Derek. You can follow him on twitter. \n\nHARRY SAXON - Colours - Harry is an illustrator and comics colourist from Greece. He is currently 38 years old and irreversibly trans. You might know his work from titles such as Vault Comics\u2019 Vagrant Queen and its successor Vagrant Queen: A Planet Called Doom and Test and Black Mask\u2019s Sex Death Revolution. If you don\u2019t know his work, this is an excellent way of getting started. You can check his website and follow him on twitter. Friendship and discounts offered if you\u2019re into Doctor Who.\nHASSAN OTSMANE-ELHAOU - Letters - Hassan is a British/Algerian letterer of comics. He's worked on things like Quantum & Woody, Undone by Blood and First Knife. He's also the voice behind Strip Panel Naked, and the editor of the Eisner-winning PanelxPanel magazine. You can follow him on twitter and YouTube. \n\nWe'll also have a cover by amazing artist, the fabulous Kevin Wada, and the logo has been designed by the incomparable Dominic Xavier Crewe.\nCover Artwork by Kevin Wada\nThe book is still being made as we speak and raise funds, and we are planning/expecting to have it ready for release and posting to backers for the third quarter of 2021, looking at October 2021. We're about 10% complete as of now, and are on schedule to hit this goal. \nWe want as many people as possible to be able to get and read The Miracles. As such, we are keeping a cheaper digital option available for those on a budget who still want to read our action-packed, amazing superhero family story. \nMock-up for the Kickstarter Exclusive Hardcover edition\nWe also want collectors to feel like there's something extra special for them too. As such, there'll be a very limited edition hardcover version of the book, for those that want something a bit more special to sit on their shelves, that will be exclusively available to Kickstarter backers. Containing the 120 pages of story, plus further behind the scenes pages and designs, creating an overall book size of 160 pages!\nSPECS:- 282 x 185mm hardcover, 160 pages plus end pages and cover, matt lamination outer cover, 170GSM uncoated endpapers, 130GSM silk main pages, full colour throughout\nMock-up for trade paperback edition\nOn a larger print run, we'll have a trade paperback version available too, filled with the 120 page story, plus extras and more, such as design work and sketches making for a 140 page book. \nSPECS:- 282 x 185mm trade paperback, 140 pages, 300GSM silk and matt laminated cover, 130GSM silk internal pages, full colour throughout\nSticker\nWe'll also be making a sticker of the main The Miracles logo, so this will be available on a number of rewards tiers.\nEnamel Pin\nThere's also an enamel pin, of a stylised version of the series' emblem. A nice, shiny little mark of being in The Miracles Family. \nThere are also a couple of retailer tiers too, so if you are a store and would like five or even ten copies at a discount price, please check out those tiers! NB: It will be the TPB version of the book in those tiers, the hardcover is Exclusive to the Kickstarter only. \nWe even have been given access by Kickstarter to allow ADD ONS, which will include some of my back catalogue of titles, including superhero political thriller Acceptable Losses; glitter noir queer grindhouse revenge fantasy Glitter Vipers; and the last few copies of the original, limited edition self-published The Pride collection, collecting the first ten comics made before the series was picked up by ComiXology Originals. \nThis is a BIG project, possibly one of the biggest I've ever done, and so we need all the help we can get to cover this. The total of this campaign goes to paying the creative team to make the art and design, and to cover printing costs and delivery. It's a high goal, but with enough support, we can do it.\nWe're also teaming with a fulfilment company in the US to help bring down costs for international backers, and speed up fulfilment too! White Squirrel will be helping us deliver speedily and cost effectively, handling the US backers. I've found that the largest part of my audience is based in America, so I've taken this measure to help keep postage costs as low as possible for the region, as well as helping me keep costs down for all other regions too.\nA rough breakdown of how the funds are distributed\n\nMost of the money raised is going on production on the book, specifically the art team. The next biggest chunk will be for printing and postage. These are big expenses, and always increasing, but with your help, we can do it. \nIf we manage to surpass our goal, we'll look into Stretch Goals too, but for now, our main focus is hitting our goal. \nI am so excited about this story and bringing it to you all, I think it's one of the strongest stories I've ever created. \nBut don't just take my word for it! Check out some early pages below!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be my third campaign run during the pandemic, as well as my ninth campaign overall, so by now I have a lot of experience with running these things. \n\nThat being said, postage/shipping is something that can often catch people out, myself included in the past. So, for this campaign, being my biggest campaign to date, I've partnered with a fulfilment company to handle the US backers, which will also mean we can keep the price down for those international backers that are the most expensive to ship from the UK too. \n\nLife factors can sometimes delay production, even in the midst of lockdowns and the like.

Were you into college radio? Were you even born? Were you a college DJ, or a student station manager? Experience the era that ignited a new music revolution thanks to the blood, spit, and bravado of college radio. Post-Punk! Synth Pop! New Wave! & Indie/Alternative get the 4-color comic book treatment in HEAVY ROTATION, a love letter to '80s college radio.\nPOWER. CORRUPTION. COLLEGE RADIO!\nIn the mid \u201880s, a group of reckless teenagers converged on an upstate New York college town to study the fine art of Communications. These shy social misfits & miscreants became DJs at the perfect moment in college radio history: when album-oriented Top 40 rock was kicked to the curb. \ncover art & logo by Philip Bond (not final)\n Armed with neon rubber bracelets, exploding tubes of black eyeliner, and big hair, this cadre of culture vultures ushered in \u201cNew Music,\u201d a combination of punk, new wave, new romantic, goth, and indie/alternative. They played the hell out of Adam and the Ants, Violent Femmes, The Clash, The Smiths, New Order, and The Cure. Their lives -- and the upstate NY college town of Ithaca -- were forever changed.  \nDJs Heather, Brother Mike (animated), Glenn and Barbra circa 1985.\n30+ years later these college DJs (still music-obsessed but, strangely, not much older) have reconvened to celebrate '80s college radio in HEAVY ROTATION, a 48-page anthology of short comics, prose & single illustrations, essays and interviews with an impressive lineup of comic book artists.\nPage 1 of a 5-page short story written by Shelly Bond and illustrated by Mark Stafford.\nYou'll find out the answers to these burning questions and more:  \n+ What\u2019s up with the ancient analog tech like reel-to-reel machines and promo carts?\n+ What is the FCC and how did it impact our fun on college radio?\n+ What's the perfect segue?\n+ Why do audio majors run around campus with razor blades?\n+ What is this \"dot\" rotation system and who determined these maddening rules?\n+ Does \"Dead Air\" actually kill you?\n+ What does a college DJ actually do?\n+ How did we find out about cool new bands \u2013 and old ones who had a huge catalog that was an undiscovered planet waiting to be explored?\n\nA lot of the time, the answer was college radio.\n92 WICB ITHACA, THE STATION FOR INNOVATION\nIt was, and is, the FCC licensed radio station operated by students from Ithaca College, broadcasting 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nDJ Mike Sauter and an illustration of Brother Mike Cohen by Rodd Perry.\nProse story in progress written by Barbra Baker with illustrations by A.D. Puchalski.\nIt was indeed an aural adventure to have access to a local college radio station, where you could hear British punk & new wave, '70s era Bowie, Kate Bush, Heaven 17, and local bands you couldn\u2019t see live if you were underage.\nBut even better: being a DJ on a college radio station during the golden era of college radio--when indie was truly indie and before \u201calternative\u201d was a cash cow.\nCollege DJ Glenn Raucher showing off a favorite album on his specialty show, The Musical Box.\n\u2019There was something reassuring about placing a needle on a record,\" says college DJ Glenn Raucher. \"And, if you did your job right, hearing sound, even with the pops, clicks, and hisses that it often entailed.\"\n\nTHE REWARDS\nTHE COMIC BOOK\nChock-full of short comics, single illustration and prose, essays, and other illuminating tales, this anthology comic is 48 full-color pages.\nAvailable digitally and in print.\n\nTHE SWAG BAG\n2 pin badges! 2 postcards! 2 vinyl stickers! \nArtwork not final.\nTHE BREAKDOWN\nIf we go beyond our modest target goal, we'll be able to add and unlock stretch goals and hopefully pay our contributors what they're worth.\nHere's how the funds will be allocated:\nWhere the money goes...\nTHE FADE OUT\nHEAVY ROTATION is a 48-page love letter to '80s college radio, collecting the shared experiences of a group of people who grew up together left of the dial \u2014 and are still connected three decades later. It will appeal to anyone whose favorite band eluded the mainstream, anyone who loved the \u201980s, and everyone who loves someone who loved the \u201880s.\n\nSpearheaded by veteran DC/Vertigo and Black Crown comic book editor and former college DJ Shelly Bond, HEAVY ROTATION is brought to you by former WICB DJs/current professional writers, DJs, tech ops directors, teachers, home schoolers, and an all-star lineup of artists including Philip Bond (Kill Your Boyfriend, Eve Stranger), Michael Allred (Bowie: Stardust, Rayguns & Moonage Daydreams, Silver Surfer), Kitty Curran (Taylor Swift: Girl Detective), A.D. Puchalski (Insider Art),  Mark Stafford (Lip Hook), and Rachael Smith (Quarantine Comix), who are connected by one thing: \nA mutual admiration for cool music and the power, corruption and glory of being an FCC-license toting college DJ.\nPage 2 work-in-progress of \"Seventh Dream of Heavy Rotation\" by Shelly Bond & Mark Stafford.\n\"I've spent my life caught in a tumultuous war between my love for comics and music,\" said editor Shelly Bond, \"Which is why my indie work often combines the two. I hope you'll join us in creating this 4-color sequential portal back to the mid \u201880s, when the only music that mattered was the music we played on our radio shifts.\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAssembling a comic during COVID isn\u2019t difficult if you know how it\u2019s done.

Most tend to be concerned not with creating a better world but merely defending the status quo, not to mention all the flat-out reactionary takes on the genre!\nThe solution? BEEF BROS, an eye-searing, gonzo comic about Huey and Ajax Beef, a pair of neighborhood heroes willing to brawl with sadistic police, cruel landlords, and predatory corporations not because of any complicated college-boy theorizing, but because helping people out is simply the right thing to do. \nImagine Noam Chomsky\u2019s Heroes for Hire meeting Peter Kropotkin\u2019s Jojo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure.

Wild adventures I could get lost in as I followed the heroes along on their journey. Middle Earth, Hyboria, The Young Kingdoms, The Dying Earth. To me, it's not escapism to want to dwell in worlds like that for a little while. The wonderful thing about fiction, especially genre fiction is that it gives you a taste of the impossible - a window into another world. And that feeling, that exhilarating feeling of cracking open a book and getting lost in it, even for a moment, is something that I've always wanted to create for someone else. And I believe that Wailing Blade is a book that will.\nIt's often said that you should make the comics that you want to see in the world. In that respect, Wailing Blade is everything we've ever wanted to see in a comic. It's got action, it's got adventure. Compelling characters, and a lush, vibrant world for them to inhabit.

Now, there seems to a cult dedicated to following the killer's methods and believing that the killer is some kind of messiah meant to free them and bring judgment to others. \n\nWhat's the story?\nDON'T EVER BLINK Chapter 2 is the second issue of a 5-issue limited horror comic book series about a woman who survives a harrowing and horrific ordeal, the massacre of her fiance and his family, but not without her being scarred for life in more than one way; Tinsley Marissa Grace is found alive but her eyelids have been sewn shut -- a calling card of a killer that has eluded authorities before and now has returned. \nThe Second Chapter is about Tinsley looking for answers and the lengths that she will go to find them. However, the small town of Billesbrooke, VA is less than giving, and the detectives on the case may no more than their letting on as the killer's cult becomes more of a problem. \nWho will like this?\nHorror comic book fans.\nHorror/Slasher/Psychological thriller movie fans.\nB-movie enthusiasts.\nBefore you back DON'T EVER BLINK Chapter 2, check out some of the rewards that we have to offer.

Murder books typically include crime scene photographs and sketches, autopsy and forensic reports, transcripts of investigator\u2019s notes and witness interviews. They chronicle the life of a case, from the time the murder is reported until an arrest is made.\nCATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is an original graphic novel about crime and consequence. It\u2019s written by me, Ed Brisson (Old Man Logan, Uncanny X-Men), and lusciously illustrated by Lisandro Estherren (Redneck, Strange Skies of East Berlin). This stand-alone graphic novel will be published in an exclusive hardcover edition for Kickstarter backers.\nCover by Lisandro Estherren\nAfter nearly half a decade away from writing crime comics -- a genre I love more than any other -- I\u2019m making a return with the Kickstarter Exclusive Hardcover edition of CATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY. This book is near and dear to my heart, and probably the most pure distillation of the kind of book that I want to write.\n\nCATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is about a thief who concocts a plan to sell a stolen car not once, but several times, by luring unsuspecting buyers to a remote location and robbing them at gunpoint. His plan hits a snag when he encounters a student, who needs a fresh set of wheels to travel to his new life out West. When things go south, they go south hard, and now our car thief stands on a precipice where he has to make a choice that will affect not only his life, but that of his co-conspirator and their two victims. The story is an examination of one man\u2019s guilt and how far he\u2019s willing to go to stay out of jail. \nArt by Lisandro Estherren\nWhen I started writing the script -- the longest MURDER BOOK story to date -- I knew that there was only one artist who could do it justice: Lisandro Estherren. He and I had previously worked together on THE LAST CONTRACT for BOOM! Studios and have been looking for an excuse to team up once again. Thankfully, he was into the story and happy to come aboard to breathe life into this story about a deception and redemption.\nArt by Lisandro Estherren\n\nTHE TEAM\nEd Brisson has been creating comics in one form or another since 1994. He\u2019s best known for his work at Marvel on books such as UNCANNY X-MEN, IRON FIST, GHOST RIDER, OLD MAN LOGAN and X-FORCE. He also has a long history of writing creator-owned books such as COMEBACK (Image), SHELTERED (Image), THE LAST CONTRACT (BOOM!) and THE VIOLENT (Image).\n\nEd first started to gain recognition from his self-published series MURDER BOOK, which was collected and released by Dark Horse in 2015.\nLisandro Estherren is a comic artist based in Argentina. His work includes graphic novels, series, and illustration for publishers and magazines such as Editorial Pictus (Argentina), Aurea Editoriale (Italy) Di\u00e1bolo (Spain) and Mojito (Uruguay). In the US, he has produced series for Red5 Comics (Spook) and BOOM! Studios (The Last Contract). He is currently working on REDNECK for Skybound Comics.\nHassan Otsmane-Elhaou makes Strip Panel Naked, a YouTube series focusing on breaking down comic art. He also does this a lot on his twitter (@HassanOE). He might make films that you'd like.\nLinney Incorporated is run by editor/writer/producer Nate Cosby, who's worked on Cow Boy, Thor The Mighty Avenger, Red Sonja, Jim Henson's The Storyteller, World War Hulk, Spider-Man Loves Mary Jane, James Bond, The Wonderful World Of Oz, Flash Gordon and sooooooooo many more books.\n\nWHY KICKSTARTER\nI\u2019ve been a fan of the Kickstarter publishing method for years now and have always wanted to bring a project here, where we can cut out the middleman and create a book for readers, backed by readers.\n\nKickstarter allows Lisandro and I to maintain complete control over the story and production of the book, creating a work that is as purely a product of our love for the genre and medium.\n\nThe money raised through this campaign will be used to pay the creative team and for printing of the hardcover book.\n\nWHAT YOU CAN GET\nWe are delighted to print this stand alone story in a Kickstarter exclusive deluxe hardcover, as well as a digital edition of the book. CATCH & RELEASE: A MURDER BOOK STORY is a 72 page book, printed at standard comic size (6.625 x 10.25 inches).\n\nAside from the book itself, we have plenty of fun rewards including commissions from Declan Shalvey and Micheal Walsh; script reviews from Matthew Rosenberg and Kelly Thompson; original artwork; and even a chance to appear in the book yourself!\n\nA NOTE ON SHIPPING\nBecause of how quickly shipping rates can change and the unexpected nature of the world, shipping costs will be added on later, when we ship the book out to you in 2021. You will get a survey from BackerKit where you will be asked for your address, and shipping costs will be calculated at that point. We will do the best we can to make shipping as affordable as possible. Our current shipping estimates are as follows (but these may change if shipping rates increase): $4 US  / $10 Canada / $25 EU, GB and elsewhere. \nCanadian orders will ship from Canada, all other orders will ship from the US.\nTHANK YOU!\nThank you to our families and readers for getting us this far!\nKickstarter Campaign Manager: \nLaser Malena-Webber lasercampaigns.com\nMusic credit for video:\nDoomsday Clock by Rafael Krux\nLink: https://filmmusic.io/song/5402-doomsday-clock-\nLicense: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny project has its risks in creation, manufacturing delays, and the unexpectedness of the world.

My name is Jeff McComsey! I am a cartoonist, writer and educator making comics for the past 13 years. \nYou fine backers have always helped me print a mess of these Thumb Books for a lot of cartoonists, designers, students... and, well I ran out of them... again.  \nWith your help I hope to finance a new run of Thumb Books and share them with OG backers and new backers alike.\n\nWHERE IT ALL STARTED:\nLike most cartoonists and comic artists, I did my thumbnails on loose paper and I would inevitably lose them in the sea of paper in my studio. My initial solution was an improvised thumbnail template stapled together. I\u2019ve been refining Thumb Book over the years and this will be the fourth official printing.\nSPECS:\nThe THUMB BOOK is 4\u201dx 5.5\u201dand is currently 60 pages.\n-Designed to be a pocket sized sketch book with a template on each page that corresponds to the layout of a standard comic page, but one that is adaptable to other formats as well.\n Originally created to help me keep all my preliminary work in one spot, I also like them because I can grab a script, pencil, Thumb Book and hit a coffee shop if I need a change of scenery.\nHOW I USE THEM:\n Some of my finished pages I ink and pencil digitally, but I always start with a pencil and Thumb Book.\n BREAKDOWNS \nOnce I have a script in hand I do small breakdowns four up on the Thumb Book page. Here I'm mostly focusing on leaving enough room for lettering and making sure speaking order is reflected in layout.\nTHUMBNAILS\n After that each breakdown gets taken to a full (Thumb Book) page layout. I try and make those thumbnails as tight as possible. I then scan those thumbnails and enlarge them to begin the penciling stage.\nSCANS\nOnce I scan in my thumbs and make a spread out of them, I'll share them with editorial or any other creative partners on the project. This also let's me look at stories as a whole and see if I'm repeating a layout too much.\n\nWHO ELSE USES THESE?\nThe Thumb Book is pocket size and perfect for anyone that needs a handy sketch book for that crucial design stage where you brainstorm with a pencil. \n-3D piece concepts\n-Storyboards (there's board/ratio conversion specs in the back of the Thumb Book)\n-Landscaping concepts\n-Good for comic writers to help visualize pages while scripting.\n\n\n REWARDS:\nI've added some of my original art and signed books to help make this a successful campaign.\n **NOTE: Backers will select their book via the survey section after funding.\n FRIENDS OF THE CAMPAIGN!\n\nCLICK HERE TO CHECK IT OUT!\nWailing Blade is high-adrenaline fantasy adventure, set in the dark future of mankind.

He hit skid row, but was starting to make a comeback when he was kidnapped by a bizarre troupe of scoundrels calling themselves the Vaude-Villains.

For the entire year he was in prison, I sent him postcards where I talked about the weather, being free to go outside whenever I liked, how nice New York was in the Spring, and sometimes snarked at him for how bad things were going in the country - but the one thing I always included were movie and TV spoilers, knowing he probably didn't have access to new movies and premium TV shows (everything from HBO to Netflix to Amazon Prime.)  And I decided to put them all together in a book for you to see.\nTruth be told, I took pictures of the cards before I even decided I'd collect them into a book for you fine folks.  When I showed them to Sean Von Gorman, my longtime friend in comics, he decided we should probably imagine how Michael was probably reacting to the spoilers, hence the artist renderings.  This added a whole new element of humor to the idea for the book, and schadenfreude, in general.\nSo, obviously, spoiler alerts abound for everyone (except Michael Cohen.)\nsample page from the book\nIn retrospect, maybe I did him a favor by spoiling the God-awful rushed ending of Game of Thrones.\nWhy this?  \nFor years, I did prisoner support for folks arrested for political activism, and what I learned is this:  by far the main drawbacks of US prison life are the boredom and the loneliness; and I learned mail is cherished as a lifeline to the outside world.  So I figured there was a better than average chance Mike was reading my cards, despite the spoilers.\nWhat do you have against Michael Cohen?\nI know he's trying to clean up his reputation now that he's been caught, but Michael Cohen is a big part of why we are where we are now in the United States.  I land on the political spectrum somewhere around \"polar opposite of Donald Trump\", and I saw Cohen lie, cheat, and bully his way for Trump during the 2016 campaign cycle.  He's no friend of ours - but because his attempts to throw Trump under the bus were admirable (and backfired spectacularly) I went a gentle-trolling route, rather than invoking the churning cauldron of anger in my gut I have for this administration.\nsample page from the book\nThis is so dumb.\nI know.  But it helped me cope a little with what's going on in the country, and I think it's more dumb fun than just dumb.  In fact, I think it's a lot of fun.  I hope you agree.\nWho are you people?\nI'm a comic book writer and animal rescuer based out of NYC.  Sean is a comic book artist, also from NYC, and Matt Krotzer is a graphic designer and comic letterer who lives out in Amish country in PA.\nI've run several successful Kickstarters both solo and as collaborations with others - between us all, we've run and fulfilled over 10 book Kickstarters, so pledge with confidence.\nsample page from the book\nWhat can I get?!  I want to spoil myself (and/or others!)\nimage for example purpose only - everyone's \"Sad Michael Cohen\" art will be a one-of-a-kind imagining, original piece of art.\nWhat'll the money be used for?\nThe money will be used for paying everyone who worked on the book, like artists, editors, and designers - plus printing, shipping, and more.  It's all broken down below in the chart.\n* Thanks to Stella Marrs (stellamarrs.com) for allowing me to use her postcards in this project, and to Bensound (bensound.com) for the royalty-free background music for the video.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBetween Matt Miner and Sean Von Gorman, we have over 10 successful book Kickstarter projects that were funded and then fulfilled to backers.
