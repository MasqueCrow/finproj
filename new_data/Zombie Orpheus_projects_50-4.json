Featuring a built in Character Builder, with beautiful hand-drawn options so you can create your heroes, villains, and NPCs how you see them. \nWhether you play Dungeons & Dragons 5E, Pathfinder 2E, Call of Cthulhu, Savage Worlds, Cyberpunk, or another game, we have something for you!\nIntroducing TWO New body options plus FOURTEEN additional armor options!\nWith this Kickstarter we\u2019re expanding our body options, and giving you more fantasy clothing options, plus so many amazing new weapons to choose from.\nThere's even MORE New weapons an shields we're adding! More than 50 new options in total!\nTell us what other options you'd like us to add in the comments!\n The Beta is Live at https://www.beneverending.app/ and already has loads of options.\n\nYou can also capture your character\u2019s backstory and personality by adding a bio.\n Tokens. \nExpected release May 2021\nWant to use your character in a virtual tabletop like Roll20 or Fantasy Grounds? We're making it easy! You'll be able to choose from loads of unique and interesting token frames with just a click.\nPoses.\nExpected release July 2021\nOur programmers are hard at work making it so you can change your character's pose with a single click! With this addition we'll be one big step forward in helping you turn your adventures into webcomics and animated videos.\nWebcomics and Animated Videos.\nExpected BETA July 2021 and October 2021\nWe're focusing on the Character Builder today, but eventually you'll be able to import your characters into our Scene Creator and Story Animator tools to create and publish party portraits, webcomics, and even animated videos of your adventures and story ideas.\n Late Addition Stretch Goal!\n(April 9 update) We're really excited to have unlocked Wolfborn and Kitsune options, but someone reminded us we forgot my favorite of them all. MOUSEFOLK!\nIf you can help us get to $7,000 by April 10 at 11:59 pm (EDT), we'll include Mousefolk options, even though they weren't part of the original plan. \n(How could we not have included them? Help us fix this oversight!)\nSo, if the Character Builder App is already live in Beta... why back it now?\nDon't wait. Support us because you want more options faster. \nDon't pay for expansions. Unlock stretch goals to include those features for YOU for free!\n\n1. We want to introduce these two new body types, 14 armor options, 50+ new weapon and shield options, PLUS even more if you back us and unlock stretch goals. Even though we've drawn these new bodies, there's a lot of work still to render the different armor and other options, so they can be included in the builder. If you back us, it'll give us the boost we need to secure additional time from our artists make these and more character options available to you.\n\n2. Other than the new body choices, most of the options we're including in this Kickstarter will be available only as specific purchases, achievements, or as \"Hero Tier\" member items. Hero Tier members are those who purchase a full year membership - OR Back Us On Kickstarter (that's you). By backing us today - you get access to premium features for 18 months (that's *counts fingers and toes* way more than 12)! And you never loose your saved characters, even if you don't renew.\n\n***We can't say this enough: you ALWAYS have access to all your created characters, plus free tools even if you don't renew your membership.***\n\n3. Finally, supporting us by backing the Kickstarter tells us that there are people who want to use the character builder and that we should continue investing in expanding and improving both features and options.\n\nHow We'll Use The Funds\nNow that we've successfully launched a robust Beta of our Character Builder, and are approaching 2,000 members - it's time to give you MORE! We're raising funds to add new bigger heroic body types to our character builder, more armor, and more weapons.\n\nFunds will be used to pay for additional time from our team of amazing artists, so they can create all of these hand drawn options for you and make them work in our Character Builder.\nGo to https://beneverending.com/about-us/ to see our full team. \nWe're all counting on your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile there's always a risk of something catastrophic or unexpected, we're well positioned to deliver. This is our second Kickstarter. And we've been delivering on those rewards (like the Character Builder). The Beta is live and the bodies drawn. It's not that much more work - we just need some help from you to get us across the finish line.\n\nWe have learned a LOT! While we're still building out the full story animation platform, the Character Builder was a key component. That is live in Beta already. We're approaching 2,000 people using the Character Builder to create their D&D characters, social media avatars, Roll20 tokens and more. \n\nWe add new character options every week and have done a good job streamlining the art pipeline process.\n\nWe have the new character models created. It's just a matter of adjusting all of the components to fit the new models, and some of that work has already been done. We need the funds to pay for additional art and programming time from our artists and developers, without slowing down the development of the rest of the platform.\n\nOur big lift was the posing of the characters.

Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow.

Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

A very kind person pointed out that our icon for the Warrior was almost identical to the modern icon used in Black Power messaging. This was entirely an error on my part. I used a placeholder mock-up instead of our final icon and we've since remedied that. You can see the actual icon for the Warrior in the current image on the Campaign page. The icon that was there previously was an internal use only illustration that was meant as a developmental reference and was never intended for print.  I apologize to anyone who was confused or concerned, and I truly hope there was no offense caused.  We have the deepest respect for our Black allies and our icon was always meant as a nod to them.

Simply pick a theme, start drawing, and Dungeon Alchemist creates high-quality maps you can print, share, or use in your favourite Virtual Tabletop Application.\nDungeon Alchemist is a standalone software app for Windows, Mac (including ARM) and Linux, which will be distributed through the Steam platform. We plan to release Dungeon Alchemist near the end of 2021, but the exact timeline depends on how much money is pledged in this campaign. If you choose to opt for an Adventurer (\u20ac45) or higher pledge, you'll get access to the beta program a few months before release.\nWe will unveil new features as we progress further in the campaign. If we surpass our funding goal, we will add even more content and features to Dungeon Alchemist for everyone to enjoy! Check out the stretch goals below.  \nDungeon Alchemist was created by Wim De Hert and Karel Crombecq, both longtime roleplayers. This project came from a personal need for an easy-to-use, convenient tool for making dungeon maps. Both working a fulltime job, we just don\u2019t have the time to design each map in excruciating detail, but we still want cool-looking tailor-made encounters for our campaigns. That\u2019s why we believe Dungeon Alchemist can really make a difference, and we are incredibly passionate about making it.\nWe would love to make Dungeon Alchemist available to everyone at a low price and with amazing content from the start. But the reality is that we have bills to pay, and to make this project as good as we want it to be, we need money to fund development. We truly believe it has the potential to be a game-changer, and we created this Kickstarter because we simply cannot build it without your help.\nWim De Hert is owner and founder of BlueJay Design Consultancy, and has over 20 years of experience in illustration and graphic design. While being an avid Pathfinder and Dungeon&Dragons player for as long as he can remember, creating Dungeon Alchemist has been an ambition ever since getting a fantasy game at the age of 7. Wim will be working on Dungeon Alchemist\u2019s lead visuals, concept design and modelling.\nKarel is an experienced game developer and senior graphics programmer. Karel has been in the game industry for over 10 years and has released games on mobile platforms and consoles. Before that, he earned a PhD at the University of Antwerp on machine learning and computer simulation. With a passion for video games and RPG\u2019s in particular and lots of experience programming games and AI algorithms, Karel is the perfect person to tackle this job! \nWe are a two-man team and we do everything ourselves. This means that we can use all the help we can get to spread the love! The more money we collect in this Kickstarter, the more time we can spend on developing Dungeon Alchemist and adding cool new features, and the quicker our app will be finished. Everybody wins!\nIf you want to help us fulfil our dream, you can do so in several ways:\nJoin our Discord Server and engage with the community.\nTell everyone about us on Facebook.\nFollow, retweet and engage with Dungeon Alchemist on Twitter.\nTalk about us on your favourite subreddit:  /r/battlemaps, /r/dnd, /r/dndmaps, /r/Pathfinder_RPG, /r/Roll20, /r/FoundryVTT,  /r/FantasyGrounds, ...\nThis campaign is promoted by Backercamp.

After receiving a call informing her that her estranged mother is dying, Danielle leaves the tour, hopefully in time patch things up with her mom before the end. Driving through the desert in her Panther Pink 1971 Dodge Demon, she notices some unsettling visual cues. Thinking it's because she's running on too little sleep, she pulls into a roadside motel for the night. In the middle of the night, the clerk turns into a demon and invades her room.\nAfter that things get weird. \nOver the course of the series, 1 - 4, Danielle learns that Satan himself has trapped her in Hell so she can help him reclaim his stolen throne from a usurper, another fallen angel. It's got something to do with a mysterious object in a blue case, a dead gun-runner, Aleister Crowley, a cursed weapon imbued with the trauma of a million murders, and one super cool Panther Pink 1971 Demon powered by Chrysler's infamous \"Slant 6\" engine, a motor renown for its durability.\nPure grindhouse pulp-horror, Hellbound Slant 6 combines a few of my favorite things; cool cars, heavy metal, the devil, and bad-ass women. The whole aesthetic is White Zombie, I'm talking La Sexorcisto: Devil Music Volume 1 and Astro-Creep vibes, all the way down.

They teamed up with a likeminded DoP and put all their worldly money towards a fantasy feature film [pictured below], made with goodwill and steep learning curves... this formed the first steps into their world of Myrlan. Following their first taste of filmmaking, the team formed Pale Raven Pictures and dove into writing the 126-page draft for the sequel - for some time, that's as far as this world got.\nA few short films and award-winning music videos later, the fantasy world of Myrlan calls again - this time with 4 years of training and experience in writing and directing, not to mention a rich research into medieval combat techniques. Now, with our incredible cast and devoted team all working for the love of the project, we can bring life to Myrlan like never before. How much of the world we can show... is up to you.\nFrom \"Blessed\" - Pale Raven Pictures, 2016\n This is a standalone short film.\nThere are no hidden secrets or references to past manifestations, this is the standalone first chapter of Myrlan's story. We have chewed over many imaginings of the land and its narratives: our world-building has spanned the 6 years since our first film, resulting in two feature screenplays, five short screenplays and a short story - these build a deep reference for the vivid world we present now, in Myrlan.\nWhere we go next is untold... a feature film? Series? We have plans that will lead us to those conversations, with this film as our credentials. You can be sure you're playing a hand in the birth of a grand story.\n\"Myrlan\" development - background to the story and inspiration references for people and costume.\n All funds for this project go straight into production and distribution.\nAny funds we receive will be visible in the film: a costume, an axe, a shield, a tankard... Or be used for the film's visibility, by entry into film festivals - a commitment we make to promote all artists involved in Myrlan.\nOur pitch is simple: everyone working on this project is a volunteer in their professional role. Many will be balancing this against day jobs and other professional work in acting or filmmaking and we are overwhelmed with the devotion and support we've already received from our team. We do not expect artists to work for exposure on feature productions, however, short films don't make money, they cost money. They are an investment in the careers of the artists involved. As the production company we have the responsibility to deliver our actors, stunt performers, camera persons, composer, make-up artists, costume designers and art department a career milestone that is worthy of their dedication and time.\nThe duty of Pale Raven Pictures is to \"springboard artists into the arts industry\". We are working with keen and incredibly talented artists breaking into one of the world's toughest industries (especially after the events of 2020!) - backing this project is investing in the careers of over 40 independent artists.\nFrom \"Alone\" - Pale Raven Pictures, 2018 [click to view]\nAbout the Director and Co-writer, Cieran.\nPart of the co-writing duo behind all Pale Raven's fantasy projects, Cieran writes non-stop. As an independent writer, he has a feature screenplay and 10 shorts under his belt - one recently selected as Semi-Finalist in a screenwriting award.\nHe's fascinated with world-building and loves actors to be able to work in a day-dream where the film world becomes their reality... From his own training in acting, he has an eye for performance and a good hunch for casting, which proved useful when considering over 300 applications for parts in Myrlan..!\nCieran [right] on the set of a Viking combat showcase, 2019 [click to view]\nAbout the Producer and Co-writer, Dale.\nDale has written, directed and performed in independent theatre productions, as well as producing and co-writing a number of films for Pale Raven Pictures. He trained for 4 years in acting, honing transformative character performances. He has worked professionally as an actor for scare attractions, adverts, educational videos and even hosts a pub quiz or two.\nDale's passion is historical combat. He trained for 5 years in HEMA (Historical European Martial Arts) and 1 year with the Viking Society, choreographing numerous fight scenes. Dale's goal in Myrlan is to make the combat scenes as realistic and as adrenaline-fuelled as possible.\nDale on the set of our award-winning music video \"Big Noise\" which he produced and co-directed [click to view]\nWe have already started shooting.\nProduction has commenced on test shoots and some preliminary scenes. We aim to shoot the majority of the film in MARCH 2021 and have a finished film by AUGUST 2021.\nAs 2020 has taught us, things have been hard to set in stone. Cieran has trained extensively in Covid-compliance filmmaking, and is a qualified Covid Co-ordinator with First Option Ltd. He has already shot a short film during national lockdown, following health & safety guidelines to the letter and imagining creative solutions for transmission-prevention beyond just using PPE.\nBeer tent, on the set of \"Myrlan\", 2020\nHave a look at how backing can build our story...\nWe have the tenacity to go ahead with production no matter what funds we have. Whether we exceed our goal or fall short, we'll still deliver you a great film - but you can bring it to life. With each goal achieved, we will curate the content of every frame to fit our budget and fully immerse you in Myrlan.\n Current goal: \u00a32750 | Unlocks Special Previously Unreleased Fantasy Origin Story...\n*To make budgets more fun, special content is unlocked in each level. Reaching the current goal of \u00a32750 unlocks a special, unreleased origin story that we shot back in 2018... We never found the right time to share this story, so step with us into the glades of Serpent's Head and a young lord's past...This will include thanks to all our new backers at the time of reaching that goal.\nIf you wish to back us anonymously and you're using a Kickstarter account, you can do this by changing your name in your profile settings. If we reach our goal and you backed using a guest account, we will contact you via the email you provide to request the name you wish to use.\nIt can be hard to imagine the effects of budgets, so we've expanded on it below:\nWith Cuts - \u00a3 Goal Not Reached At this level we would cut larger scenes from the film and re-write around these sections with less demanding sequences. We would lose a major fight scene and re-shoot a dialogue section to condense two scenes into one.\nPerformance Focused - \u00a3450 At this level we would focus intimately on the performances of our great cast. The film would be shot closer in, to avoid focus on set dressing, costume and location, and would have smaller fight scenes. It may play closer to a drama and explore inter-character relationships further.\nCharacter Focused - \u00a3800 Here we would have the liberty to explore the characters in Myrlan in more depth, creating unique costume items and props for them as well as additional supporting cast.\nStory Focused - \u00a31500 At the heart of Myrlan is its story. With this kind of support we would be able to access and dress bigger, bolder locations - showcasing Yorkshire's finest heritage sites. These will include long art department days, building the best environments for our actors to immerse themselves in Myrlan.\nWorld Focused - \u00a32750 Welcome to Myrlan. This backing will create the world of Myrlan as fully formed as it is in our script. If battle-ready swords and castles weren't enough, we'd also have the capacity to expand some scenes - including grander fights and an introduction to our capital city, Heim.\nExpanding Horizons - \u00a32750+ This support puts Myrlan into a whole different conversation. What we've set out to achieve with modest budgets can be imagined on a grander scale and make an unforgettable impression. We can go down paths we thought inaccessible, exploring visual effects, specialist equipment and admissions to prestigious film festivals. \nThe heart of our efforts is to support all artists involved in Myrlan and put them in the spotlight for their incredible work.\n\"Myrlan\" budget breakdown - we will update regularly on how we are distributing your support.\nThanks for taking the time to read.\nWe appreciate any support you may be able to give, from backing us to simply watching the film we create. By sharing this project online, by word of mouth or sending a raven to anyone you think might be interested, you are already supporting us, and we will raise a mug of mead in your honour when wrap night (\"wrap-narok\") comes!\nWe look forward to welcoming you to Myrlan in 2021\nDale in a camera test for \"Myrlan\", 2020", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will go ahead with production no matter what funds we have.

They rocket through the stars to safeguard diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and share shy glances at the corner cafe with their old classmates and comrades. Even when swords are crossed, they have the potential to connect more deeply than anyone expects.\nA sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around vagabond matchmakers piloting their sentient gay spaceship from system to system.\nIf you love angsty disaster lesbians with swords, you have come to the right place.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians by April Kit Walsh is a roleplaying game that celebrates the love, power, and existence of queer people\u2014specifically queer people with swords and a lot of feelings. Flirting, sword-fighting, and barbed zingers all mix together in a system designed for both narrative drama and player safety. This innovative take on the Powered by the Apocalypse engine is a breeze to learn and ensures that no matter how the dice fall, something interesting happens to move the story forward.\nIn this game, you will solve problems with wit, empathy, and style, fight when something is worth fighting for, and redeem (or seduce) at least a few of your adversaries. You\u2019re part of a community that embodies important ideals and you\u2019ll strive to protect it and make your world better.\nPlay as one of nine character types: Beast, Chosen, Devoted, Infamous, Nature Witch, Scoundrel, Seeker, Spooky Witch, and Trickster. Each explores a particular emotional conflict that drives the drama and shapes your character\u2019s story. Are you a Beast, faced with the dilemma of expressing your inner truth versus fitting in to a society that demands you conform? A Devoted, who sacrifices for others while struggling to care for yourself? A Trickster, who craves closeness but fears vulnerability? In long-term play, you may even resolve your initial arc and advance into a different playbook as you continue to change and grow, facing new challenges.\nBackers get immediate access to the playbooks too. They're form fillable!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians provides clear, robust guidance and support for running the game, including how to make appealing adversaries, set the tone, structure play, and create a safe environment at the table. Handy reference sheets help you narrate appropriate twists and drama on the fly, depending on the feelings and character types you have in play.\nWant to jump into a one-shot? The game includes six adventures that can stand alone or kick off a longer series: Sword Lesbians of the Three Houses, Best Day of Their Lives, Constellation Festival, Gal Paladins, and Monster Queers of Castle Gayskull. For even more inspiration, it features The Starcross Galaxy campaign setting along with five more settings from these contributing authors:\n Lesbeans Coffehouse by Dominique Dickey\n Neon City 2099 by Jamila Nedjadi\n The Three Orders of Ardor by Whitney Delaglio\n Les Violettes Dangereuses by Jonaya Kemper\n Yuisa Revolution by Alexis Sara\nWe also provide ample guidance on how to create your own tales of fighting with swords and falling in love, along with a world building worksheet, variant rules, and a set of starting scenario seeds to play with. Because the game focuses on feelings and relationships, it\u2019s a lens you can use to play in a variety of genres. If you like slashfic of characters with swords, you\u2019ll love this game.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians is explicitly designed to tell melodramatic and queer stories; tales fraught with relationship triangles, mystery, intrigue, relationship anarchy, celebration, and revolution. It includes rules to highlight different identities, emotional connections, and setting elements.\nThis game is not for fascists, TERFs, or other bigots. The team behind Thirsty Sword Lesbians supports racial liberation, intersectional feminism, and queer liberation. We love and respect transgender people, nonbinary people, intersex people, and women. This game is a joyous celebration of lives and identities otherwise marginalized. If you don\u2019t agree, fix your heart before sharing a table with other people.\nWhat if... not Thirsty? The game fundamentally assumes that the characters crave connection, but that connection doesn\u2019t need to be sexual or romantic. We offer you options for changing how the game addresses connection in our variant rules section.\nWhat if... not Swords? It\u2019s simple enough to swap out a different hand-to-hand combat option. Your campaign or your character can use a labrys, the double-bladed axe that became a lesbian icon in the late 20th century. You can use different styles of unarmed combat or even grapple using telepathic self-projections. It\u2019s also possible to replace the swords with mecha, starships, or guns, but it requires some thought and the book will help you think about how to ensure that it stays intimate and relationship-focused. The conflict doesn\u2019t have to be physically violent, either; you can use any kind of conflict that\u2019s adrenaline-inducing and close-quarters.\nWhat if... not Lesbians? We\u2019ll let you in on a secret: you don\u2019t have to play a lesbian. The game plays with themes that are common for all sorts of people who are marginalized on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as feelings that go beyond the queer experience. If you want to play thirsty sword cishets, we\u2019re not going to stop you\u2014just don\u2019t be surprised if the game turns them queer.\nWhat if... I\u2019m not good at flirting or zingers? You don\u2019t have to be witty or good at flirting in real life to play a character with those skills, and not every character in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is good with words. Shy and awkward sword lesbians find love, too. You\u2019ll find them well-represented in this game.\nReady? Let\u2019s Go!\nClick for a PDF of this graph!\nWondering what\u2019s involved in all those delicious bullet-points on that reward tier you\u2019ve been flirting with? Here are your answers (scroll further down to find out about the many stretch goals already unlocked\u2014look for the big glass)!\n\n\n\nAngsty disaster lesbians, here and now! You can find details about the production timeline in the project's FAQ.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up your rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would.\nBased on our average shipping scenario in the USA, we're charging a flat $10 fee (media mail + handling costs) for book shipments to USA addresses.\nBIG NEWS as of October 19th! Thanks to a big show of support from our friends at the UK-based Mongoose Publishing, we are now able to offer shipping outside the USA for this Kickstarter. Right now we have the Smitten (all flavors) and Nice tiers set up to offer shipping for $15 to destinations in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. We would be happy to add your location as well! \nPlease contact us at feedback@evilhat.com if it looks like your destination is not yet covered, and we'll add it as an option as soon as we confirm the shipping rate for that country/region.\nIf you end up ordering multiple books for international shipment, we will bill an additional $5 per additional item in BackerKit well after the campaign is done.\nApril Kit Walsh (she/her or ze/zir) writes queer games about feelings, vulnerability, and caring for one another.

We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years.\n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Thirsty Sword Lesbians is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket or otherwise introduce problems getting the books from the printer to us.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Thirsty Sword Lesbians to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run a couple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 14+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

Los escritores pueden enviar sus cuentos en cualquiera de los dos idiomas. Cincuenta porciento de las historias que publicamos en cada edici\u00f3n ser\u00e1 de autores del Caribe, Latinoam\u00e9rica y sus di\u00e1sporas.\nIt was a cold autumn night in Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, and a grey spring afternoon in Washington State. Dream Foundry was hosting its first online convention, and Coral spent the day working on running the convention spaces, hosting the meetings, and moderating channels. Eliana kept screaming internally about how happy she was to be able to attend an online SFF convention. After a long day of great panels and a lot of coffee for Coral, the two happened to be in one of the voice chats and they began to talk. \nA few weeks later, an anonymous person sponsored Eliana for SFWA's Nebulas. The two met again in one of the breakout rooms where the Nebula winners were celebrating. The conversation steered towards the topic of SFF and Spanish, and how there were very few online spaces where people who wrote in Spanish could publish short fiction (and get paid for it!)  \nCoral contacted Eliana the following week and asked her what she thought about doing an online bilingual magazine, one that would publish stories in both English and Spanish. Eliana had already toyed with the idea before, so she immediately said yes. \nThe kindness of strangers, a little luck, and the amazing people who brought up the topic led to the creation of Constelaci\u00f3n Magazine, a bilingual speculative fiction magazine. \nEra una noche fr\u00eda de oto\u00f1o en Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, y una tarde gris de primavera en el estado de Washington. Dream Foundry llevaba acabo su primera convenci\u00f3n online, y Coral se pas\u00f3 el d\u00eda trabajando. Eliana no paraba de gritar internamente por lo feliz que estaba de participar en una convenci\u00f3n de SFF online. Tras un largo d\u00eda de paneles geniales, y mucho caf\u00e9 para Coral, las dos se encontraron en uno de los canales de voz y empezaron a charlar. \nUnas semanas despu\u00e9s, una persona an\u00f3nima sponsoreo a Eliana para que asista a los Nebulas, organizado por SFWA. Las dos volvieron a encontrarse en una de las salas de Zoom donde los ganadores del premio estaban celebrando. La conversaci\u00f3n gir\u00f3 en torno al tema de SFF en espa\u00f1ol, y c\u00f3mo hab\u00eda pocos lugares online donde la gente que escribe en el idioma pudiera publicar cuentos (\u00a1y recibir remuneraci\u00f3n por ello!). \nCoral le escribi\u00f3 a Eliana la siguiente semana, y le pregunt\u00f3 qu\u00e9 pensaba de la idea de hacer una revista online biling\u00fce que publicara historias en ingl\u00e9s y espa\u00f1ol. Eliana ya hab\u00eda tenido una idea similar, as\u00ed que inmediatamente dijo que s\u00ed. \nUn buen gesto an\u00f3nimo, un poco de suerte, y las personas geniales que hablaron del tema llevaron a que nazca Constelaci\u00f3n Magazine, una revista de ficci\u00f3n especulativa biling\u00fce. \nConstelaci\u00f3n Magazine will be published quarterly, and all its stories will be in English and Spanish. Authors will be able to submit their stories in either language.\nWe will pay authors $0.08 per word (SFWA rates) and open up for submissions several times a year.\nWe will pay translators $0.04 per word, and raise the pay to $0.06 if we reach one of our stretch goals.\nWe will pay our cover artists $1000 for the cover art.\nConstelaci\u00f3n Magazine ser\u00e1 cuatrimestral y todos los cuentos estar\u00e1n en ingl\u00e9s y espa\u00f1ol.

After finishing school and never finishing college, I decided I would be a writer when I won my first short story contest in 2011. I didn't even consider writing my stories in English because I didn't feel anyone would want to read the stories I wanted to write. \nAfter reading about #DignidadLiteraria, I realized that much like I approach my own writing, if I wanted a place like this to exist, I'd have to create it myself. I want Constelaci\u00f3n to be the place I yearned for back then, a place that actively says: bring me your stories with names that I don't know, open the windows for me to get to know where you come from and your dreams and your struggles, and even better if it's from a small country I don't know much of. So maybe, another little girl from Paraguay, Zambia, the Philippines, Nicaragua, Guyana, Qatar, or Malaysia, or anywhere in the world, will grow up knowing that her stories are valid regardless of the language they're written in. That they matter and that there's an enormous world out there waiting to read them. \nEn sus palabras, Eliana Gonz\u00e1lez Ugarte\nEncontrar libros de ficci\u00f3n especulativa en Paraguay era dif\u00edcil antes de la era del internet, as\u00ed que crec\u00ed leyendo lo que hab\u00eda disponible en la biblioteca de mi colegio. Tras graduarme y nunca terminar la universidad, decid\u00ed que ser\u00eda una escritora despu\u00e9s de ganar mi primer concurso de cuentos cortos en 2011. Ni siquiera consider\u00e9 escribir mis cuentos en Ingl\u00e9s porque no pens\u00e9 que alguien querr\u00eda leer las historias que yo quer\u00eda escribir.\nDespu\u00e9s de leer sobre #DignidadLiteraria, me di cuenta que as\u00ed como encaro mi escritura, si quer\u00eda que exista un lugar como este, tendr\u00eda que crearlo yo. Quiero que Constelaci\u00f3n sea el lugar que yo anhelaba en aquel entonces, un lugar que dice: tr\u00e1iganme sus historias con nombres que no conozco, abran las ventanas para que pueda aprender de d\u00f3nde ven\u00eds, tus sue\u00f1os y tus luchas, y mejor todav\u00eda si es de un lugar que no conozco mucho. Entonces, quiz\u00e1, otra ni\u00f1a de Paraguay, Zambia, Filipinas, Nicaragua, Guyana, Qatar o Malasia, o cualquier lugar del mundo, crecer\u00e1 sabiendo que sus historias son importantes, y que hay un mundo enorme all\u00e1 afuera que quiere leerlas. \n In her words, Coral Alejandra Moore\nAfter the Nebula Awards in 2020, I happened to be sitting in a Zoom room with a handful of people. The conversation wound back and forth, as they usually do, and I some point Mary Robinette Kowal asked a perfectly innocent question. \"I wonder if there's a market for Spanish speculative fiction in this country?\" \"Absolutely!\" was out of my mouth so quickly it could never be taken back, and just like that, my brain was already moving pieces around to figure out if I knew how to make that happen. So my answer to the question of \"Why now?\" is quite simple: Because it's about time.\nEn sus palabras, Coral Alejandra Moore\nDespu\u00e9s de los premios Nebulas de este a\u00f1o, ocurri\u00f3 que estaba sentada en una sala de Zoom con un grupo de gente. La conversaci\u00f3n iba de tema en tema, como suele ocurrir, y en un momento Mary Robinette Kowal hizo una pregunta inocente. \"\u00bfMe pregunto si en este pa\u00eds hay mercado para historias de ficci\u00f3n especulativa en espa\u00f1ol?\" \"\u00a1Absolutamente!\" sali\u00f3 de mi boca tan r\u00e1pido que nunca podr\u00eda retractarme, y as\u00ed, mi cerebro ya empez\u00f3 a mover las piezas para ver si podr\u00eda hacerlo. Entonces mi respuesta a \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 no? es bastante simple: porque ya era hora. \n\n\n\nAround the world, in various cultures, constellations have often been linked to the practice of astrology. So, for a little bit of extra fun, we thought we'd make a zodiac of our own, with each year being a different animal. Our first year, 2021 will be the Year of the Capybara! Capybaras are the embodiment of serenity.

I'm a tabletop game designer you may know from games and books like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Betrayal at House on the Hill, The Maze of Games, Apocrypha, and Lords of Vegas. Once the latter game was off to the printer, I went part time at Lone Shark for a few months to try to do something positive in the last months of this election cycle. \nSo I wrote, edited, and designed a massive new edition of my essay book Game Theory in the Age of Chaos, alongside my mathematician co-author Rich Malena-Webber. It's a strategy guide on how to fight fascism. My team and I are raising funds to print the book here on Kickstarter. We're doing this because game theory suggests this is our last chance to save America.\nGame Theory in the Age of Chaos is a 532-page book of 65 essays about game theory and politics. Every day since Donald Trump got elected, I've fought the urge to scream at the internet. Instead, I channeled that howling into a series of essays showing how game theory explains and justifies the behavior of all the actors in the system: Trump, the Democrats, the Republicans, the Supreme Court, and most of all, people like us. By taking a deep breath, remaining level-headed, and letting my grasp of game science do its work, I've connected with my readers on Medium, and had my essays shared all over the world. Alongside my Basket of Adorables colleague Gaby Weidling, we made a small edition of some of those essays a couple years ago, supported by scholarly essays by Rich, who teaches game theory to raise funds for Democrats. We also sent copies to every Democratic Senator and Congressperson, with your help.\nNow, as we count down the last weeks of this election, I've compiled a massive new omnibus edition, with forty new essays by me and supporting pieces from Rich, plus an all-new foreword from game enthusiast and Washington senator Steve Hobbs. It's quite the book, I think.\nAs with our last campaign like this, we're also giving U.S. backers the option to send a copy to every Democratic member of the incoming Congress. If you're feeling particularly generous, you can get the book sent to ten Congresspeople. Based on the letters we got from them, some of them actually read it and applied its tactics to help beat back the autocrats and restore democracy in America. If you select that option, we'll cover the shipping to a Congress member. Because we don't actually know who these members will be, we're going to do this in one batch, rather than have individual backers select Congresspeople. We'll also send them a note which has your name on it (if you want).\nFor readers in the United States, we have another option for you. This Kickstarter is about raising funds for the book; it is NOT a political fundraiser. \nBut we also care deeply about winning this election. So, you can go to our site at SHARK.VOTE and back the book there instead, and we'll give you the book for free if you do some critical election integrity tasks like volunteering. You'll be treated as if you had backed the campaign when we send the information to our pledge manager after this campaign ends. Again, you don't have to back here if you select this option. If you do want to back here as well, we'll send you a book for each campaign you back.\nThis is just for Americans, since soliciting foreign interference in campaigns is still illegal last time we checked. If you're from outside the U.S., please back the book here!\nThe book is done. We sent it to the printer last week. They're putting the finishing touches on it now. In fact, you can read all of it right now, because it's right here. Go ahead, flip through it. If you like it, get yourself a copy.\nIf you order a physical book for $25, you'll not only get it in softcover, but also as a PDF. You can add it in ebook form (.epub and .mobi) for an additional $5. Or you can just get all three digital versions for $15.\nContents pages\nEssay pages\nHere are some of the essays in the book.\nGame Theory and the Two Magic Words that will Impeach Trump\nCo-op Mode: Why Trump Sees \u201cMany Sides\u201d to Nazi Murder\nAbortion Rights and the Game Theory of Armor\nGood Guys, Bad Guys, and the End of an Armed Society\nThe Kap Trap: Why No Team will Call in Kaepernick\nThe GOP Is Living in a Fantasy World on Taxes\u2014Specifically, Star Wars\n#MPRraccoon and the Puzzle of Hope\nSeizing Children Is Good Policy (If You\u2019re a Complete Monster)\nMike Pence is the Werewolf\nGame-Changer: How the Democrats Won the Kavanaugh War by Losing the Battle\nPlaying Diplomacy with Nancy Pelosi is a Dangerous Game\nBarr Sinister: How to Beat a Corrupt Referee\nI Don\u2019t Think She Knows About Second Brexit, Pip: How Theresa May\u2019s War of Attrition Killed Everyone\nYou Don\u2019t Have to Want to Save the Planet. You Just Have To.\nThe Butt Fumble: Rudy Giuliani and the Incompetence Gambit\nThe Progressive Voltron: How to Buy an Election\n\u201cI Don\u2019t Take Responsibility at All\u201d: Trump Fails the Trolley Problem\nWhen the Social Contract Dies, It\u2019s Time to Riot\nSouthern Discomfort: Lose the Confederacy or Lose Billions\n2020 Vision: What to Do When Everything Is Life-or-Death\nA Wargame Designer Defines Our Four Possible Civil Wars\nHere's the size of the book itself. It's solid.\nPLAY\n\nSome of these essays are pretty heavy, it's true. For me, it helps to crank up the volume on my favorite thematically appropriate tunes. So, I've assembled some of these songs, with the artists' kind permission. Because they want to fight fascism too. Each book comes with a digital copy of the album Music to Doomscroll By.\nThe songs include:\n Austin Wintory\u2019s \u201cThe Storm\u201d\n The Doubleclicks\u2019 \u201cPanic\u201d\n Jim Boggia\u2019s \u201cNothing\u2019s Changed\u201d\n Jonathan Coulton\u2019s \u201cSolid State\u201d\n Jonathan Mann\u2019s \u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s Dissent\u201d\n Kid Beyond\u2019s \u201cCEASEFIRE\u201d\n Kirby Krackle\u2019s \u201cQuaransheen\u201d\n Marian Call and the Guttersnipes\u2019 \u201cConsequence\u201d\n Mega Ran\u2019s \u201cDo Better\u201d\n Molly Lewis\u2019s \u201cPantsuit Sasquatch\u201d\n Quelle Chris and Chris Keys\u2019 \u201cSudden Death\u201d\n Sidecar Astronauts\u2019 \u201cNazi Puncher\u201d\nAnd maybe more when we get done with it. It's music for your brain and your tapping toes. The music comes with the PDF of every copy of the book. Free.\nHere's a slice from Meg, whose music you can also hear in our Kickstarter video above.\nGame Theory in the Age of Chaos isn't my first political project. My best known bit of outreach is The Ghastlytrump Tinies, a parody of Edward Gorey's The Gashlycrumb Tinies that Gaby and I did with approval of the Edward Gorey House. The initial run of the book raised about $10,000 for Democrats and the Southern Poverty Law Center. You can add on a copy of The Ghastlytrump Tinies to your pledge by adding $10 to your pledge. You'll get the booklet plus a PDF of The Annotated Ghastlytrump Tinies, which contains 26 more longform poems by me.\nThe Ghastlytrump Tinies is an alphabet primer of all the things we stood to lose in a Trump administration. From \"A is for Arctic, drilled by wells so tall\" to \"Z is for Zeitgeist, cuz it's the apocalypse,\" we got our favorite artists and cartoonists\u2014John Kovalic, David Malki!, Satine Phoenix, Heather Hudson, Kris Straub, Lar deSousa, Nate Taylor, and so many others\u2014to illustrate one of the impending disasters as seen by a child. Over the last four years, it's become a tragic checklist, as the Trump administration has found a way to ruin just about everything good.\nIt's a poignant, funny, troubling work. I encourage you to watch the Doubleclicks' audiobook below.\nLone Shark's games are played by people of every political and social background, and we're thankful for that. But we're people too, and we all agree that trampling human rights and undermining democracy are bad things. We've never been shy of saying to people \"This is what we think\" as loudly as possible. Through our charity and social work, we've championed the rights of marginalized people since we started this company 18 years ago. In 2016, when we wanted to do more overtly political work, Gaby and I made a side group called Basket of Adorables. As Lone Shark's personnel decided they wanted to be a part of those efforts, we decided to fold that into our company. Everybody knows our opinions. If they're gonna hate on us for expressing them, we don't want them as customers anyway.\nWe're all game and puzzle creators, but trust us, you don't have to tell us to \"stick to game design.\" Honestly, we'd much rather be sticking to game design. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and so we're devoting our free time to helping restore the rule of democracy in America. Most of us contribute our time, writing, and illustration out of the hope that we'll have a positive effect on the national dialogue.\nI'm thrilled to be joined, as usual, by Richard Malena-Webber an academic, puzzle and game designer, and presenter. He's designed puzzles for everything from the launch of the Tomb Raider movie to live interactive crime-solving mysteries. Rich created and hosts Atomic Game Theory, a video series devoted to game analysis, and he created the Puzzle Keyring, an educational decryption tool for codes and ciphers. His recent project was a D&D summer camp for kids that was wildly successful.\nAs usual, I'm helped here by editors Gaby Weidling and F. Wesley Schneider, cover designer Liz Spain and Skylar Woodies, artists John Kovalic and Pat Race, and store and website manager Shane Steed. Plus everyone at Lone Shark. I appreciate their help, and of course yours as well. Thanks for helping restore democracy in America.

You can increase the width of the Level Up by buying extra Centre Tiles \u2013 but make sure you buy enough extra side pieces to finish your table.  You can purchase extras by viewing the Add On Menu on the page below.  \nSome common sizes\nThe 2x4 Level Up (A 24 inch by 48 inch rectangle)\nThe 3x3 Level Up (A 36 inch square)\nThe 3x4 Level Up (A 36 inch by 48 inch rectangle)\nThe 4x6 Level Up (A 48 inch by 72 inch rectangle \u2013 for wargamers)\nReady To Level Up Your Game Night?\nAs fans of board, card and role-playing games, we often struggled on game nights to fit everything we needed onto our table. How do you fit character sheets, game cards, the main board, figures, dice and tokens on to a table that is also playing host to drinks, snacks, the compulsory game night pizza and a myriad of other items?\nWe have found the solution to your board game frustrations... the Level Up - a lightweight, portable, tabletop extension that raises the main playing surface, whilst still allowing plenty of space underneath for all your game night necessities!\nDimensions\nLevel Up is made up of 6 tiles which each measure 12\" square (30.48cm). The whole platform, when constructed, measures 24\" (60.96 cm) by 36\" (91.44cm) and stands at just over 6 inches from the table (16cm) \u2013 when complete, the playing area is just a little over A1 in size - further extension pieces are available in the stretch goals.\nEach 12\" square tile has been designed with reinforced rib supports to enable the level up to carry weight up to even the heaviest game pieces or the odd rogue cat. The Level Up has been tested by our engineers to 5kg (11lbs).\n\nWe have chosen metal for the legs for durability and strength but also so that they can be made as thin as possible, so as not to interrupt your view of the items underneath the Level Up. To ensure durability, threaded metal inserts have been added to the underside of each tile to provide proper thread engagement for the legs to be inserted into.\nThe design of the Level Up allows for the legs to be attached as close to the center of the surface as possible. This clears the underneath space for your character sheets and attached cards, dice, pencils as well as the ever-present danger of drinks. If stability is a worry, each tile will have three threaded metal inserts so that the legs can be attached as close in or as far out as you require.\n\nHow Sturdy Is It?\nThere have been a lot of questions regarding the question of stability of the Level Up.  We're pleased to say it's been tested to hold 5kg (11lbs)!  If you want to make it even sturdier you can add extra legs by adding to your pledge.  Please see the \"Add On Menu\" below!  \nPLAY\n\n\n  Every Level Up Comes With: \n(6) Board Tiles \n(6) Legs \n(1) Canvas Tote bag\nWhere table space is at a real premium and the games are competing for the same space with all the yummy fare that you are selling. Well, now your customers can have their cake and eat it whilst still playing their favorite game (other food items are available).\nWhether you are interested in level Up to use in the cafe or for your shop, please get in touch and we will send you a retail price list.\nAs well as creating the Level Up as a 6-piece, standalone product, we have some great add ons that will enhance the product.  Most came about as a direct response to suggestions supplied by you during our pre-launch campaign so thank you for that!\n\n Here's how add ons work.  Pick out your add on below.  Add that amount to your pledge.  For example.  Let's say you want the map clips and the upgraded bag.  Before we ship the product we will email you a survey and confirm your add ons and give you the opportunity to add more if you like.  \nAdd \u00a34 / $5 to your pledge and get a set of 6 plastic board clips.  Perfect for anyone using a battle mat or any rolled up surface.  Say goodbye to the days of having to weigh down the edges for a flat and smooth playing surface.\n Add \u00a34 / $5 to your pledge and receive a set of 6 extra legs.  Perfect for those who want to add extra stability to their board.  \nAdd \u00a312 / $15 to your pledge and get a set of 2 middle extension pieces and 2 extra legs.

We are ready to begin the manufacture of Level Up, all we need now is you to help us make this concept a real success.\n\nThis project has real potential to be massive. That being said, the bigger the project, the more links there are in the chain. With every additional link, there could be additional problems waiting to ambush the smooth planning of this project.\n\nWhilst we hope no problems will occur IF something was to happen, we can assure you that we will do all we can to mitigate any delay. Some difficulties, however much we might want to help, will be outside of our control. Industrial action, acts of god, fire and flood, ash clouds from volcanoes as well as plague and pestilence are just some of the issues and problems that might occur that we have no control over. \n\nWe have, however, already added in \u2018stretch\u2019 room, additional time for each section of the project to be completed and will keep the delivery dates and other deadlines updated on the KS page as well as through our development blog and social media channels. We will work hard to ensure all your queries are answered in a timely fashion.\n\nTo be honest and upfront is at the core of our Kickstarter Project. We have chosen a superb team to support us in this project who want this game to become as much a reality as we do. This being said many of our team are sub-contractors working for several clients at the same time. Sometimes this leads to parts of our production process working slower than we had planned or forecast.

The brainchild of Kate Madison, known for her phenomenally popular Lord of the Rings fan film Born of Hope, and award winning actor Christopher Dane, the first season was released on YouTube in 2016.\nNow, Ren is back to fund new episodes and continue the story, with the help of a global audience of fans and supporters.\n\nWith 8 million YouTube views, 14 international awards and over 60 nominations, Ren: The Girl with the Mark is one of the most successful genre web series in the world. Season One is available to watch on YouTube, Starbaby TV, Amazon Prime (US, UK and Germany), The Fantasy Network and Seed & Spark.\nWe plan to continue from where we left off, following Ren as she\u2019s pursued by the Kah\u2019Nath while also dealing with being wrenched from everything familiar. Ren was torn away from her friends and family at the end of last season and thrown together with the outlaw Hunter. Ren desperately wants to find Karn and her brother, she needs answers and cannot abandon Baynon like she feels her parents did to her. Hunter joins her on her quest, he wants to help her, or is there more to it than that? Does he have his own agenda? \nThe pair don't have much time to figure out a plan before the pursuing Kah'Nath catch up to them. Ren's new bond with the Mahri spirit starts to grant her memories from those Nuh'Mahri who came before but will she be able to figure out the powers that now start to develop without a guide to show her the way? \nMany of the main characters in Season One play an important role in Ren\u2019s journey so although we will be focusing on Ren we will also learn the fates of others as we move forward. We even have some new characters to introduce as the story continues, some may be fleeting but others may become significant players in Ren\u2019s story.\nAs Ren begins to come to terms with the circumstances she finds herself in, she will start to explore not only the physical world around her but the very fabric of society and the truths she has always been taught.\nRen is fan supported, creator distributed. There is no network behind it, no Hollywood studio. It lives or dies based on YOUR support. Season One could never have been made if it wasn't for the hundreds of people who backed it financially or volunteered their time to work on it.\nYes, Season One has been staggeringly successful on YouTube, but YouTube isn't a paid platform, so revenue is limited, and there's no public funding for web series in the UK. So we rely on our fans to help support the show, as Patrons and through crowdfunding campaigns like this. This way we can keep our creative vision and remain independent, and you get to keep watching the series you love with no risk of a big studio cancelling it.\nCONTRIBUTE if you have the means to do so. You can pledge as little as \u00a31, or the equivalent in you local currency (Kickstarter automatically converts it). Backers will get updates along the way, they can grab some awesome rewards, and they'll be the first to know when the episodes are ready to watch.\nSHARE with your friends and family. Tell people how much you love the show and how you want to see more. If your loved ones don\u2019t know what Ren is, sit down and binge the first season with them. Share the love! #RenewRen #MakeYourMark \nCHEERLEAD: Crowdfunding can be exhausting for everyone. Helping us keep a positive and friendly community around this shared goal is essential. Everyone is here to have a great time collectively, bringing a story that we love to life for new episodes.\nWe want to make all five of our Season Two episodes for you, so as soon as we hit our initial target we'll start working on our stretch goals to fund new episodes. Watch this space for details.\n We\u2019re excited to offer you a selection of unique perks as a thank you for supporting us. Have a browse and remember you can change your reward pledge at any time, so if we add a new item you can always upgrade later.  \nWe\u2019ve worked hard to include rewards tailored to all members of our community, whether you\u2019re a filmmaker, gamer, collector or fantasy fan, and as the campaign runs we will be on the hunt for new items to add as well.  \nThe Fantasy Network, our campaign partner, is a community-owned network that funds and streams independent fantasy and science fiction from around the world. When our second season premieres, you\u2019ll get access to watch not just the new Ren episodes, but to discover other incredible shows from our global producers too. TFN is available on the web, iOS, Android, and Roku.\nThe Boar\nThere are five main coins in the currency of Ren's country, Alathia.  Ren was born during the 'Time of Dragons' and each coin has the dragon on its reverse, representing the current era, which changes every one hundred years. On the other side of the coin there is an image representing an admired human quality.  This quality is written in runes above the image with the name below.\nAs this trailer for the Season One videos shows,  the vlogs are a great way to learn about filmmaking as well as sharing in the fun of being on set.\nExample round\nDohl'Leg is a two-player fantasy betting game designed for the series by co-creator Christopher Dane. A roll of the letter die determines the live column for each round, and players place one bet each in the live column and one elsewhere on the board. The number die is then rolled, and the player with bets in the corresponding square scoop all the chips in that column. As the game goes on and the board fills up with chips, strategise where to hedge your bets and where to double down. Roll the Eye for a double payout, or roll the Mouth for an automatic win. Be the first to bag all of your opponent's chips, and don't forget to cheat when their back is turned!\nSeason One photo book\nRen\u2019s director of photography Neil Oseman has 20 years\u2019 experience of shooting independent films. In this course, he shares his knowledge across 4x hour-long modules that will take your cinematography to the next level. Each module sees Neil block, light and shoot a scene inspired by Ren, with real actors, on real locations, while explaining every creative and practical decision he makes. This course is aimed at students, budding gaffers, camera operators looking to step up to DP, content DPs looking to move into drama, and filmmakers looking to increase their production values through cinematic lighting. The course will be released in May 2020. \nOriginal clay sculpt for the Hunter miniature, by Hans Goosen\nNOTE: VAT/sales tax and shipping costs are not included in your pledge.  Actual VAT and shipping costs will be calculated and charged in  BackerKit after the campaign, based on your location. See the Shipping and VAT section for more information. \n\nWill Sophie Skelton return for Season Two?\nDue to her commitments on Outlander and other projects, Sophie is unable to return to the role of Ren. We're sad to see her go, but we're so grateful to her for bringing our title character to life, and we wish her all the very best. We're also super-excited to have discovered a gifted young actor who can take the character forward into her future adventures! \nWhat is Kickstarter?\nKickstarter lets the community decide if a project deserves to succeed. Pledges are ONLY collected if we reach our minimum funding goal. If we don\u2019t reach our goal, no money is collected and the project fails. This helps reduce your risk, knowing that you will only be charged if we raise enough funds to make the project properly.\nRather than relying on the whims of network or studio executives, we empower you the community to renew the shows that you love.\nWhile pledge rewards on Kickstarter are exciting \u2014 and a great way for us to say thank you! \u2014 the most important reward is that together we get to continue the story of Ren: The Girl with the Mark. Thank you for making a pledge that helps us put as much of our fundraise as possible straight into the production and what you see on screen.\nAs such, our policy for funds pledged in excess of pledge levels is that they are considered bonus funds for production. Please do not add any additional money during the Kickstarter for BackerKit shipping, VAT, or extras \u2014 it will not carry over to BackerKit. It will turn into costumes, set decoration, hiring cast and crew, and making Ren: The Girl with the Mark the best possible thank you for the support that you\u2019ve given us.\nWhat is BackerKit?\nWhen the campaign ends, we will use BackerKit to send surveys, calculate and charge accurate shipping and VAT, and allow you to make address changes. You\u2019ll receive a link to the survey when it's ready, which you can use at any time to check on the status of your order.\nTo avoid unforeseen issues, not over or undercharge you, and to better let you manage your pledges, we have decided to not include shipping in the reward costs but to calculate it properly after the campaign in our BackerKit pledge manager.\nAs well as removing items you don't want from your reward to save on shipping, you will also be able to add extra items from the BackerKit store once the campaign on Kickstarter has ended, allowing you to tailor your reward to exactly what you want.\nFor similar reasons we have not included any sales TAX or VAT costs to the rewards. This will also be added, if needed, later in BackerKit.\nAs a company based in the UK, we recognize that changing political situations may affect our ability to ship \u201cin-zone\u201d for the EU. We will work with our fulfilment partners to make sure that VAT (or other duties) are handled properly up front so that packages within the EU will ship domestically, and to your door, whenever possible, from warehouses in Germany and/or the UK. Similarly, our fulfilment partners in North America will ship directly from a warehouse in the USA.\nFulfilment Partners\nThe Fantasy Network and Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, both experienced crowdfunding companies, are helping us source and manage rewards fulfilment. Rewards in North America will ship via Funagain from their Indianapolis warehouse. Rewards in the EU will ship from UK and German warehouses. Digital downloads will be served via Vimeo, Gumroad, and BackerKit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we work hard to mitigate our risks, the unforeseen can always throw a curve ball. We are always prepared to adapt and adjust with circumstances outside our control. We will have production insurance, contingency plans, and an experienced production team to guide the production through any rough water.\n\nWe have learnt a lot from our previous campaigns. We are working with Ben Dobyns from Zombie Orpheus Entertainment so we also have their nine-year track record of crowdfunding success to help us through any problems. \n\nThe project will be submitted to IMDb. Backers listed as getting an IMDb credit please be aware that although submitted these credits are subject to IMDb approval.\n\nWe are building relationships with a number of partners like the team at BackerKit, manufacturers, fulfilment partners and everyone else we need to make sure that our campaign is completed to your satisfaction.\n\nOur pledge to you is that we will always do our utmost to deliver on our commitment to excellence.\n\nNOTE: We have budgeted for rewards and production based on current treaties, exchange rates, and tariffs. With the final form of Brexit still unknown, we want to make special note that our plans may require significant revision should Brexit or any domestic or global turbulence affect the production of Ren or delivery of your rewards.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Kate Madison: Mythica Entertainment\n2 created \u00b7 31 backed\nMythica Entertainment is a team of independent filmmakers in the UK committed to providing high-quality entertainment, specialising in the...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "TIP JAR", "descp": "Receive the backer-only updates and access to the post-campaign BackerKit store.\nNOTE: VAT/sales tax is not included in your pledge.

Ten (10) generic bases will be provided as part of rewards that include a Gameboard-1 unit. Games can also be played with purely digital pieces. \nOur display refresh rate allows fast-paced gameplay with low latency, from multiple contact points, when using physical or digital objects. \nWe've also designed the Gameboard-1 to connect to your personal electronic device for private screen game play or augmented reality applications.\nWIFI and Bluetooth integration allows personal electronic devices to create virtual interactions with the board environment, with or without internet access.\nTo increase screen real estate, the Gameboard-1 can even connect multiple gameboards for a multi-screen gaming experience, using NFC sensors and internal antenna arrays to make wireless connection seamless and fast.\nConnecting multiple Gameboard-1 units is a snap! (This image is a render to illustrate multiple-board functions.)\nGorgeous hardware isn't enough. We're gamers and we know what we want: more games! \nThis campaign will help us finish building a single marketplace that will offer thousands of individual titles a la carte and an optional monthly subscription service for unlimited access to that vast library of games and gaming tools. \nIt's like Netflix for games, including everything from classics like chess and checkers to modern strategy games to interactive and original creations from partner game creators, with networked game play similar to PSN or Xbox Live.\nWe are building partnerships with some of the biggest names in the hobby and gaming industry to create a robust library... and we're excited to reveal more partners over the course of this campaign.  \nWe want anyone to be able to bring their games to the platform. Our open developer SDK means that it is simple for developers to add and update their games in the ever-expanding games library.The Last Gameboard marketplace isn't restricted to board games. Developers can make any game or content they want: from purely digital board games to games that interact with physical pieces, cards, and dice in ways we haven't even imagined yet.\nWe don't take the term \"Partners\" lightly.  We provide GitHub, Architect and Engineer access to help drive innovation and product roadmap.  We are building a community. We are the community.   \nThe Last Gameboard technology is fully compatible with Unity and Unreal.\nThe Developer Edition includes everything you need to start creating your own games, programs, and innovations for this platform.   \nGameboard-1 is beautifully designed from the inside out. It's a sleek console with real world game play informing every element of design. \nWe have our prototype in the lab right now and cannot wait to share the first unit from the manufacturer in the coming weeks!    \nHere are just some of the hardware features we plan to include with every Gameboard-1 unit we ship:\nThe Gameboard-1 is designed with thin edges to maximize playable surface area, chemically strengthened glass and a plastic housing designed for durability.\nThe 1920x1920 LCD display exceeds the specification for high-definition, so that every detail is crisp and clear.\nPlus, at only five pounds, the device remains lightweight and portable. The on-board battery allows up to four hours of game play, so the game can continue by candlelight if the power goes out.\n Two USB-C ports support not only peripheral devices, but with a USB-C to HDMI adapter you can output the contents of the screen to another device, making Gameboard-1 perfect for Twitch and YouTube streamers who want to embed or overlay the game within Wirecast or OBS.\nPlay online with networked play, or download your game and enable the Gameboard-1 local WIFI network to connect private screens and peripherals when offline.\nFour speakers and microphones let sound become an integral part of your game play, while WIFI and Bluetooth connectivity makes syncing with your personal mobile device a breeze.\nAn onboard 64 GB eMMC hard drive stores your key files locally, while a 64-bit CPU and 4GB of RAM keep everything running smoothly on our custom-built The Last Gameboard OS (TLGOS).\nFAMILIES:  From your living room to visiting grandparents, now your entire game library can travel with you. Enjoy a family game with the kids, then stay up late with the latest strategy game.\nGAMERS: Thanks to full compatibility with D20Pro, now included in your subscription, gamemasters can direct the action with every tool available in a multi-player virtual tabletop... on a real tabletop! Interactive maps, combat management, and access to tabletop systems\u2014from Dungeons & Dragons to Pathfinder and beyond\u2014make Gameboard-1 a crucial part of your weekly campaign.\nGAME STORES: Immediately demo many of the games on your shelves for customers, helping to increase sales, then bring out Gameboard-1 again for open game night. Game stores are all about community and The Last Gameboard helps you focus on creating the extraordinary experiences that keep bringing regulars back to the table.\nSTREAMERS: An essential tool for tabletop streamers, Gameboard-1 lets you bring the details straight to your online audience. Forget trying to set up an extra camera above the table and lighting the board properly: now you can display partial or full game AV output right inside your favorite streaming software, while you focus on the interactive play that your audience loves.\nDEVELOPERS: Whether you're adapting your classic board game for TLGOS or creating an innovative new experience that merges tabletop with the unique capabilities of Gameboard-1, you're at the cutting edge of new technology, bringing games to a new generation of gamers.    \nWe've designed Gameboard-1 with the following technical specifications that we intend to meet or exceed in manufacturing:   \nA successful Kickstarter is just the first step in the process of bringing the Gameboard-1 to your door! \nFollowing the Kickstarter we will prepare and launch surveys on BackerKit, where you will be able to manage your pledge, update your shipping address, and where we will charge market prices for shipping and fulfillment. Please DO NOT add money for shipping during the Kickstarter, so that we can keep those costs as accurate as possible for each pledge level prior to shipping.\nWe are excited to use BackerKit for pledge management, where you will be able to select add-ons, update your shipping address, pay fair market prices for shipping, and track the status of your rewards.  \n The initial development of Gameboard-1 was funded thanks to a seed round of private capital, which allowed us to complete design of our prototype and finalize our manufacturing partnerships. Now we're bringing Gameboard-1 to Kickstarter to raise money to fund:\nManufacturing Testing (including beta boards)\nThe Manufacturing Run\nPackaging\nGameboard-1 Case Development\nWith your help we'll be able to transition our product from prototype to retail-ready.\nMost importantly, this limited-edition Kickstarter helps bring together the core community of gamers, streamers, and developers who will receive first access to the Gameboard-1.  \nAbout the Company\nIn 2018, avid hobby gamer Shail Mehta met with hardware guru Rob Wyatt over beer to discuss the fundamental flaw with touchscreen devices: why couldn\u2019t any digital device recognize physical objects for varying shapes and sizes, especially the types of objects that are needed for hobby gaming.\nGameboard-1 was born out of the need to address the analog problems of hobby games while maintaining the essence of why gamers love to play. Gameboard-1 solves the problems of set-up/take down, learning/teaching new games, inability to explore games before buying, games that cannot be easily saved, finding someone to play with and much more.\nIn January 2019, The Last Gameboard, Inc., was formed. They began to establish relationships with game makers all around the world, incorporating both Unity & Unreal to bring the best hobby gaming content to TLG\u2019s upcoming platform.  \nShail Metha - CEO / Co-Founder\nShail has a passion for gaming. When she immigrated to the US in the 90s, Shail encountered a group of children in her apartment that were playing chutes and ladders. Shail, not knowing English, just began to play. The role of gameplay in creating community and fostering human connection has been central to Shail\u2019s work at The Last Gameboard.\nIn her professional life, Shail has a financial background working for hedge funds and venture capital funds. She has consulted for the Nuclear Regulatory Committee, City University of New York, City & County of Denver \u2018s projects, and Triunity Engineering. Has managed teams and executed projects throughout her career. Shail is the driving force for the vision and future for The Last Gameboard.\nRob Wyatt - CTO / Co-Founder\nRob moved from the UK to the US nearly 20 years ago. Known as the \u201cGuru of Hardware\u201d in the industry, Rob loves creating new technologies in gaming and is an avid skydiver. He was the system architect of Microsoft\u2019s Xbox console and went on to work at Playstation, Atari and Magic Leap. Ron owns several patents in AR/VR including a patent on multiple app sparse pixel time warp in AR headsets and processing. He is a visionary, designer and maker of The Last Gameboard\u2019s incredible technology.\n Dustin Hatchett - Business Development\nDustin has been an avid gamer since he first played TSR\u2019s Boot Hill and FASA\u2019s Star Trek RPG in 1983. In his 25 years in the gaming industry, Dustin has managed multiple retail game stores in Denver, Colorado and owns a production company producing live action role-playing games and multiple game conventions. For the past 20 years, he has worked in technical and project management roles for large telecommunications companies.\nDustin will bring his extensive game industry knowledge and background in project management as co-owner of Rocky Mountain Games (a pre-visualization and development company) to The Last Gameboard as Business Development Coordinator.\nMike Horn - Advisor\nMike is a recent inductee into the Pop Culture Hall of Fame who grew up in the collectibles business. After college, his first job was as a buyer for Diamond Comic Distributors, the world\u2019s largest wholesaler of comic books and supplier to thousands of comics and hobby shops. His job was to line up and buy trading cards (initially) and later all licensed merchandise.\nIn 1994, he left Diamond to form his first company, Palisades Marketing. Originally a marketing consulting agency, he evolved it to become a leading manufacturer of licensed collectibles. By 2005, Mike had grown Palisades to nearly $7 Million in annual revenue with 20 full time employees. Afterwards, Mike formed SwagDog and Power Up Factory, two successful ventures in the collectibles industry, before returning to consulting with the formation of Golden Strategic Development in 2019.\n Lys Galati - Marketing\nElysabeth \u201cLys\u201d Galati was seven years old when she finished reading the leather-bound silver foil edition of Frank Miller\u2019s The Dark Knight Returns. Still overwhelmed by the book, her mother asked \u201cLys, your math is getting better. Do you want to come up with the adults and play D&D?\u201d. Nothing was the same after that. A simple game night became an origin story.\nAfter a stint with Diamond Comics doing everything from customer service to buyer, Lys saw a gap in the industry. Lots of incredibly creative people who put their heart and soul into products who often didn\u2019t have the time and (sometimes) skills to promote themselves properly. Sphinx Public Relations started in 2000 and has been an ongoing business ever since. The company was founded on the idea that all geek voices, regardless of budget, deserved a chance at the spotlight.  \nGet Your Project Funded Today!\nADDITIONAL PARTNERS\nBackerKit\nZombie Orpheus Crowdfunding Management\nArrow Electronics\nWant to stay on top of all the latest news about Gameboard-1?

During a game you engineer and play out stupid, disastrous situations, usually at the intersection of greed, fear, and lust. It\u2019s like making your own Coen brothers movie, in about the same amount of time it\u2019d take to watch one.\nFiasco is inspired by cinematic tales of small time capers gone disastrously wrong \u2013 inspired by films like Blood Simple, Fargo, The Way of the Gun, Burn After Reading, and A Simple Plan. You play ordinary people with powerful ambition and poor impulse control. \nSo what's in the box? \nThe new Fiasco retains all the features familiar to old friends, while being much more welcoming to new ones. \nWe\u2019ve tossed out all the dice and index cards and replaced them with playing cards. Setup elements? On cards. Tilt, Aftermath and positive and negative Outcomes? On cards. It speeds up play, adds intuitive, strong visual appeal, and just plain improves the play experience. \nAs an added bonus, it\u2019s now possible to \u201ctune\u201d playsets, combining elements from your favorite Fiasco settings old and new. Since playsets are now decks of cards, we\u2019re committed to rolling out old favorites and new surprises regularly, and we\u2019re looking into how we can share the tools you need to make you own. \nThe game has been playtested thoroughly and is ready to go. We\u2019ve taken great pains to make it beginner friendly - everything you need is in the box.\nThe start of any Fiasco is in the Setup. You and your friends (3-5 players) will choose one of the playset decks that sounds fun and put it on the table with the Engine deck. That's all you need to play the game, but we'll also include a game board and player aid cards to guide you and make sure everyone is on the same page. \nInside the box you'll get three playsets- Dragonslayers, Poppleton Mall, and Tales From Suburbia. These are some of the most popular and well-loved playsets for classic Fiasco and we think you'll have a great time with them! You can also back at reward tiers that include Expansion Packs- more info on those in the What's Included section below.\nThe prototype deck for the Poppleton Mall playset\nTo create the Setup, you'll shuffle the playset deck and hand out all the cards to the players. The players will then take turns choosing Relationships from their hand and placing them between any two players, establishing connections between characters. \nOnce you have the Relationships chosen, you'll add details to each relationship, including Needs, Locations, and Objects that will all help to drive your story. \nOnce these connections are in place, each player looks at the relationships on either side of them and determines what sort of person their character must be. The last step is putting together a name from the options on the back of each playset card. \nPoppleton Mall all set up and ready to play\nOnce the setup is done, you'll use the Engine Deck to begin playing Scenes in two Acts. Each player will take a turn framing a scene about their character, choosing the setting and determining what their character wants. Other players will join in, offering suggestions and playing their characters. After a minute or two, the other players at the table will decide whether the scene has a Positive or Negative Outcome and give you a card. \nThe Fiasco Engine Deck prototype\nEach player will get two spotlight scenes in the first act and two in the second. In between you do the Tilt, which uses elements on the Outcome cards to determine some crazy new twists in your story. At the end of the game, you'll use the Aftermath cards to determine how your characters' stories end up, before you describe your final epilogue.\n Praise\n\"Damn this Fiasco game is ingenious.\" \u2013 John Rogers, TV and film writer for Leverage and The Librarians\n\"Fiasco is unique among RPGs because it encourages us to actively reach for that moment we all dread in most games, that moment when something truly awful is going to happen, with possibly dire results for our characters.\" \u2013 Wil Wheaton, Actor and Writer\n\"I think, for me, there\u2019s a kind of non-Aristotelian catharsis in that active rehearsal of everything I fear and dread and also pine for; it\u2019s a chance to dance with Poe\u2019s Imp of the Perverse, to give in, to make the dangerous choice\u2014it\u2019s the same thing release I get from the act of writing. But writing is a solitary discipline for the most part and Fiasco\u2026 Fiasco is so gloriously communal.\" \u2013 Kelly Sue DeConnick, Writer of Captain Marvel, Pretty Deadly, and Bitch Planet\n\"The joy of Fiasco comes when the line between game and story blurs and suddenly you\u2019re sitting around a table with the brilliant and wonderful souls you allow into your home and you all try to make the perfect Big Black Box. Impose logic, reason, design, over the chaotic horror of existence because in story-space, in a game-space, because here we CAN. We aren\u2019t just allowed but it\u2019s ENCOURAGED. Draw this map of hell, we tell ourselves. Later on we can find our way out.\" \u2013 Matt Fraction, Writer of Hawkeye and Sex Criminals\n\"Fiasco is roleplaying stripped down to sheer elegance, to virtually zero ramp-up time. The notion of playing ambitious crooks with poor impulse control \u2014 inspired by a host of movies like Fargo or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels \u2014 is both inspiring and immensely replayable. But the real genius of Fiasco... is that now you can enjoy it in almost any setting you like.\" \u2013 the 2011 Diana Jones Award Committee\nAwards and Honors\nFiasco \u2013 Winner, 2011 Diana Jones Award for Excellence in Gaming\nFiasco \u2013 Winner, Best Support, 2009 Indie RPG Awards \nFiasco \u2013 Judge\u2019s Spotlight Award, 2009 ENnie Awards\nFiasco \u2013 Finalist, RPG of the Year, 2010 Indie RPG Awards Boardgamegeek.com \nActual Play Videos\nPodcasts\nCatastrophic - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/catastrophic-a-fiasco-podcast/id1063907406\nFandible - http://www.fandible.com/fiasco-with-great-power/\nGosh Darn Fiasco - https://goshdarnfiasco.simplecast.fm/ \nOne Shot - http://oneshotpodcast.com/tag/fiasco/ \nThe Tilt - http://thetilt.libsyn.com/podcast \n Please Note!

If you prefer to share it with the world, we will format the game for printing and release it so anyone in the world can get it. We hope you choose the latter option because it will invariably be a work of genius, but it's up to you.\nCaveats: We reserve the right to workshop your playset idea, or to reject it entirely.

We\u2019re cautious about the possibility of overcharging some of you, so rather than set flat rates by country, we\u2019ll be adding shipping costs when your package is ready, though BackerKit. This will get you the most accurate rate based on the time we send and your location.\nPrices do not include shipping or customs!\nPlease keep in mind that these are estimates, and with things as they  are in the UK/EU, these numbers could change. We're continuing to work  with our shipping partners and will adjust as needed as we get closer to  charging for shipping.\nAlso, while we say \"the rest of the world\" there are some  restrictions imposed by our partners- shipping to Russia, Brazil, China,  Israel, and Saudi Arabia may incur additional charges, due to increased  difficulties shipping to there. We'll continue to look for affordable  options.\nIf shipping charges turn out to be too expensive for you, you will be  able to request a refund of your pledge amount after the campaign  through BackerKit, either by sending us a Kickstarter message or email  to info@bullypulpitgames.com. \n This Kickstarter campaign is designed to be very lean and straightforward - our goal is to get the word out to as many people as we can, so that more people can find out how much fun the game is. If you back this Kickstarter at any level you\u2019ll get immediate access to the pre-release draft of the rules, and we\u2019re pretty sure you\u2019ll love them. Please play, and tell your friends! \nThe primary reward for jumping on board now is the chance to help us explore this new direction for the game and to get access to the upcoming playsets before they're publicly released.\n Fiasco was created by Jason Morningstar and Steve Segedy. Together, we run Bully Pulpit Games, and we've been creating and publishing award-winning games such as Star Crossed, Night Witches, The Warren, and the original Fiasco since 2006. This is our sixth Kickstarter campaign.\nBrennen Reece created the layout and visual design for Fiasco.

That said, while we don't expect any problems, shipping from overseas means that there is always a slight risk that a cargo ship will be late and things will be delayed by a month or so. We will keep you informed!\n\nFULFILLMENT\nWe'll be using the same local fulfillment service as we have for all of our previous campaigns to handle U.S. customers. We're also looking to expand our options for overseas fulfillment so that we can offer customs-free shipping to more international backers.

They handcraft twenty-sided dice, build their own campaigns from scratch, even wage legal battles against the United States prison system to assert their right to play.\nFor decades, role-playing games like D&D and Pathfinder have been banned in many United States prisons. Some wardens claim these games are demonic and foster fantasies of escape.\nYet even when books and dice are banned, incarcerated players have found creative workarounds. They band together to battle monsters and overcome obstacles, in virtual worlds as well as real life.\nInmates say these games are rehabilitative and are helping them prepare for life on the outside.  Recent research studies agree: Cooperative gaming builds skills like teamwork, critical thinking, and creativity.  Even more importantly, games like D&D bridge racial divides. In California, the gaming table is one of the only places where prisoners of different races and gang affiliations set aside their differences to do something cooperatively.\nLET'S PLAY is told primarily from the perspective of inmates who have waged legal battles for the right to engage in gaming rehab. Some lost; others--like Kevin--changed the system forever.\nHandmade prison D20\nFor eight years, Kevin battled the California Department of Corrections. It all started when he returned to his cell to discover that his gaming materials had disappeared, including hundreds of pages of handwritten campaigns and elaborate maps that adorned his cell from floor-to-ceiling. \nDuring Kevin's jury trial, the legendary creator of Dungeons & Dragons, Gary Gygax himself, flew out to testify on his behalf.\nExcerpt from Gary Gygax's letter to Kevin after the trial.\nThanks to Kevin's lawsuit, role-playing games are now an official activity at several California prisons. But the battle is not yet over. Though Kevin won the lawsuit and the right to play, his novels, maps, and campaigns were never returned to him. Do they still exist in the basement of some courthouse? We want to find out.\nThrough the story of the lawsuit and the players, like Kevin, who were impacted by it, LET\u2019S PLAY aims to get to the root of the national controversy around role-playing games in America\u2019s prisons and explore philosophical questions around inmates rights, the rehabilitative potential of role-playing games, and the purpose of the criminal justice system.\nFinally, LET'S PLAY is a film about perspective and identity\u2026 about using role-playing to see the world through the perspective of different characters and building empathy.\n                                                                           >>>-<<<\nPERSPECTIVES FROM THE PLAYERS ON WHY ROLE-PLAYING GAMES ARE SO IMPORTANT IN PRISON...\n\"We were hardcore. We\u2019d play from soon as we got back from breakfast to lockup. Saturday or Sunday\u2014all day long.\" - Mark, former inmate, California \n\"We used to run underground games with no books or anything. It was pretty L33t.\" - Melvin, Inmate, Colorado\n\"Rehabilitation in the Department of Corrections is structured in a way that gives no alternatives. Not everybody is built the same. Dungeons & Dragons is my rehabilitation that I can deal with to escape into my own reality to solve my own problems.\" - Aaron, former inmate, Colorado\n\"Our rules are no evil characters, no leaving the team behind. Selfish players will usually die.\" - Carlos, Inmate, California\n\"Prisons are the most segregated places in the world. The D&D table is one of the few places where you can have blacks and whites playing together without fear of reprisal.\" - Jared, Founder, Prisoner Reentry Network\n\"It became more than just Dungeons & Dragons at that point. It started that way, but it became about the first amendment in prisons.\" - Kevin, former inmate, California\n                                                                        >>>-<<<\nA.K.A... HOW MY CAREER DEVELOPING CRIME SHOWS CAME TO INTERSECT WITH MY LOVE OF D&D\nThe creator and brainchild of LET'S PLAY, Elisabeth de Kleer, brings to the table(top) over ten years of production experience in the 'true crime' genre. While directing shows for CBS, Netflix, National Geographic, the BBC, VICE, and the Discovery Channel, Elisabeth has interviewed hundreds of inmates in prisons across the united states.\nAn interview at a maximum security prison in Texas.\nWhen not investigating cold cases or interviewing inmates, Elisabeth can be found at the gaming table or writing articles about the rehabilitative impact of role-playing. Some of you may have already come across one of her articles in VICE:\nDragons in the Department of Corrections\nHow Inmates Play Tabletop RPG's in Prison where Dice are Contraband\nOr the following award-winning documentary she produced for VICE in 2017 about a couple cellmates in Colorado who played together both inside and outside of prison.\nElisabeth has also partnered with a San Francisco-based organization called the Prisoner Reentery Network that is using gaming as tool to help recently-released inmates reintegrate into society. This is where she met Kevin and uncovered the story of his lawsuit against the Department of Corrections. \nA beautiful piece that was filmed by ABC News on this group.\nHowever, while her articles and short film have brought attention to the topic, Elisabeth believes a longer form documentary is the best way to do justice to this controversial topic.\nOver the last couple years, Elisabeth and her team have filmed dozens of interviews with inmates and former inmates who have played role-playing games at prisons across the country. So far this film has been self-funded, which is why we need your support. Here are some of the ways your money will be used to help us finish the film:\n Fees for accessing and copying legal materials related to D&D cases. This will allow us to take a deep dive into some of the most interesting lawsuits, like Kevin's, and attempt to  track down the gaming materials that were confiscated from him.\n Cost of putting together a professional camera crew so we can film gaming groups inside prison. (We've already done the most difficult part, which is getting soft approval to film in the first place. Now we just need funding to make the most of this special opportunity.)\n Funds for hiring an animator to breathe life into hand-drawn inmate fantasy art and to create a visual style for the film. The art will be used to illustrate the story in a way that weaves together magical elements with real life. For example, the warden of the prison might be depicted as a dragon or \u201cboss\u201d and the prison itself, a dragon\u2019s lair. These visual intersections of gameplay and real life show how the game becomes a platform to express and explore their inner struggles and demons.\nCreating a marketing and distribution plan that will promote both the film as well as recreational therapy behind bars.\nWith $60,000, we believe we can create a short film that takes a deep dive into one of the most interesting prisoner rights cases in history, but it will be tight. Each additional dollar we raise makes it possible to include additional content and improve the production quality of the film so that it can compete against the Hollywood heavy-hitters at film festivals around the world. If necessary, film grants (which are very difficult to obtain during pre-production but much easier when the film is nearing completion) are also an option we're considering for down the road if expenses surpass the money we raise through crowdfunding.\nTo bring this project to life, we've put together an awesome team of filmmakers, gamers, and experts.\nAnd we're partnering with the following organizations...\n Hawke Robinson, a Department of Health Registered Recreational Therapist, founder of RPG Therapeutics LLC http://www.rpgtherapy.com/ and RPG Research  https://www.rpgresearch.com/, uses role-playing games like Dungeons & Dragons, Doctor Who, No Thank You Evil, and others as tools for rehabilitation.  He has been researching the effects of RPGs on participants since around 1985, and developing programs using RPGs in all formats (tabletop, LARP, computer-based, and solo) to achieve educational and therapeutic goals for various populations since 2004. When he's not lecturing and teaching workshops on gaming-as-therapy, you can find Hawke driving around the country in an RPG gaming bus.\nHawke Robinson will serve as an on-camera expert and advisor to the film.\nThe Prisoner Reentry Network, founded by attorney Jared Rudolph, is an Oakland-based nonprofit that supports successful transitions from incarceration to the community. Jared works as a trial lawyer at the San Francisco Office of the Public Defender, and regularly speaks about mass incarceration and its history. Every other weekend, he runs a Dungeons & Dragons game called \u201cSecond Life\u201d to help recently released inmates build community and reintegrate into society.\nJared Rudolph and the Prisoner Reentry Network will be featured on-camera, and Jared Rudolph will serve as a criminal justice advisor to the film.\nA PRN-facilitated \"Second Life\" game in San Francisco.\nKanaka Endeavors is a 2D20 gaming system developed by Danny, an inmate in the California Department of Corrections. Danny has been testing the system with his gaming group behind bars as well as players on the outside and hopes to roll it out when he's released from prison in 2019. \nDanny will be featured on-camera and Kanaka Endeavors will help fulfill some of the crowdfunding rewards.\nDanny and the other D&D players pictured in an article entitled \"Nerds United\" that Danny wrote for the prison newspaper.\nMusic for the Kickstarter video was provided by: https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music \nFINALLY...\nIf you can't help us monetarily, please help us by spreading the word through social media. The more people know about this documentary, the better we can get the word out about the rehabilitative potential of role-playing games in prison.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy far, our biggest hurdle is getting on-going access to film games behind bars.\n\nGetting IN to prison is harder than one might expect. Both state and federal facilities have extensive rules for media visits. Additional staff must be brought in to accompany the production crew. Some states prohibit cameras entirely.\n\nFortunately, Elisabeth de Kleer has extensive experience navigating prison media rules. Over the last 10 years, she has filmed at dozens of maximum security prisons around the country (primarily for Discovery Channel shows) and developed relationships with the administrative staff that approve filming requests.\n\nWhile we've received soft permission to film games we've been following at a couple different prisons, where we ultimately film will depend on how much access we are given. The ideal scenario would be one where we'd film a game over the course of many months, following the trials and tribulations of the inmates both as characters inside the game and in real life. To do that, we need to show the administrators that we have enough of an audience to warrant the additional time and effort on their end to host us, as well as to pay our professional film crew for their time.\n\nPut simply, the more backers and funding we have, the better our chances of getting prolonged access to some of the subjects of our film.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Kleer Creative\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nKleer Creative was founded by Elisabeth de Kleer, an award-winning documentary filmmaker with expertise in interviewing and crafting...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Public Shout Out", "descp": "Welcome to the game!

There are documentaries about motocross riders out there, but they are mostly about men. We are always treated like the sideshow despite the fact that many women can totally hold their own when riding with guys,\u201d says Eline. \nEline was blown away to receive letters and emails of support from women all over the world with similar stories in motocross, following the pilot\u2019s release. We'll be sharing their pictures, videos, and stories throughout the campaign.\nOriginally from Estonia, Eline is a motocross champion and the first woman in Canada to jump her dirt bike onto an airbag. Passionate about motorcycles and filmmaking, Eline is dedicated to telling stories of badass women.\nThe completed pilot episode is 8 minutes long and now we are raising money on Kickstarter to add FIVE more 8-10 minute episodes to complete SEASON 1 of Diaries of Badass Chicks. These episodes will be filmed over two weeks in Lower Mainland, BC Canada in the summer of 2020, involving as many awesome racers and riders as possible. It will be one hell of an epic shoot!\nThe 2020 Calendar will have its own shoot in August/September 2019 with the release of the calendar planned for November 2019, making it a perfect Christmas present!\nHaving the principal photography for the series in 2020 enables us to maximize the budget and really hone in on the production value. Plus, whoever has visited Vancouver, BC in the fall, knows why it is labelled \"Raincouver\", so we want to avoid the challenges of dealing with heavy rain\u2014especially since one of our episodes involve a freestyle motocross airbag! \nWe are so excited to have all of you on board to bring this EPIC, BADASS and GROUNDBREAKING series to life!\n#WEAREBADASSCHICKS\nDIARIES OF BADASS CHICKS is Fan-Supported and Creator-Distributed.

You take on the role of a Wanderer\u2014someone who died, but didn\u2019t end up in Heaven, Hell, or any other traditional afterlife.  Devoid of any memories of your life on earth, you find yourself in an endless desert filled with gateways. Search different planes of existence for clues of your former life - or a semblance of one. Along the way you'll encounter strange inhabitants, alien cultures, and other humans who\u2019ve lost all hope and are bent on destroying you. \nAfterlife is Alice in Wonderland meets What Dreams May Come set in a world inspired by the works of Guillermo del Torro, Hayao Miyazaki, and surrealist artists. \nFind lost memories, come to terms with how you died, and discover who you truly are. \nStepping onto the Tenebris for the first time you realize you're in an outlandish world full of creatures, cities, and customs you don't recognize. A city built atop a giant skeleton, a roadside diner in the middle of the desert, a vast dark pool of inky water. Nothing here is truly human and you're the alien here, far from home with no hopes of return. Salvation lies in the memories you've lost so you travel and search - you are a Wanderer. \nAs a Wanderer your ultimate goal is to regain your memories and find your Requiem\u2014a true end in a place known as the Beyond. In order to do this, a Wanderer must do what their title implies and travel. By travelling into different Limbos\u2014different gateways to the Beyond\u2014you find memory fragments. These glimpses of memories summoned forth by your unconscious give you Resonance. Gain enough Resonance to experience a Break, a full blown memory of your past life, bringing you closer to your Requiem. Each Break creates an opportunity to heal, to strive to remember, to fight for your personality - and your soul. \nLimbos may be cities, forests, or even entire worlds. Each Limbo is populated with its own unique inhabitants who have no idea of any realm beyond their own, much like humans on earth. Wanderers enter (and exit) Limbos through the Tenebris, but consider Limbos their own realms. A Limbo may appear like a person\u2019s version of Heaven, or it may appear totally alien\u2014it all depends on the Limbo.  \nWanderers don't travel the Tenebris alone, it is far too dangerous for that. Instead, you travel with a Crew, a group of lost souls who you met on the boat ride from the world of the living to the world of the dead. A Crew travels together for protection and companionship, personalities may differ or even clash, but these people are the only ones who truly understand what you're going through.\nMechanics in Afterlife: Wandering Souls center on player's action and GMs do not roll any dice. Instead, GMs set scenes, develop plots, and present their players with obstacles. Players decide how they want to overcome these obstacles.\nYou make checks to determine whether your chosen action is a success or not - to make a check you roll a pool of six-sided dice (d6s). A die face of a 4-6 is a success and you must gain enough successes to meet the Challenge set by the game master (GM). \nIf your check is a success - you do what you set out to do. If your check is a failure - things get worse. When things get worse you take damage to one of your Concept pools - Health, Hunger, or Will. Or the GM escalates the scene by pulling in a plot twist, more enemies, or other surprises.\nTo prevent things getting worse you may spend points from your Vitality pools, which is an in game currency representing extra resources a Wanderer has to throw at a problem.\nDuring character creation, the GM takes on the role of the Boatman, guiding your Wanderer on a boat ride from their mortal life to the Tenebris. They will ask you a series of questions based on a variety of dice rolls, and how you answer gives your Wanderer different stats. \nThe memories your Wanderer retains during character creation are vague and highlighted by one brilliant feature your Wanderer refuses to forget. Throughout play you\u2019ll experience more concrete memories during Breaks illuminating the shadows of your lost memories. Things may not always happen as you remember them and part of the journey is the surprise.\nWanderers have many tools, which you may use to make checks easier and perform fantastic feats. \nDuring character creation, the Boatman gives each Wanderer a martial item - a Bow, Sword, or Shield - which reflects how they deal with conflicts. This mystical item, called an Approach, grows as they grow and stays with your Wanderer until they die. Your Approach isn\u2019t limited by earthly limits places on the concepts of a sword, shield, and bow; bows can deflect, shields can slice, and swords can be missiles. \nWanderers use Talents to mold and manipulate the world around them. They can be anything from summoning a mythical beast to reading someone\u2019s mind. Your Talent is a gift bestowed upon your by the Boatman on your ride to the Tenebris. You may learn new Talents as you advance. Depending if your Approach is the Bow, Shield, or Sword your Talent will be different than those with a different Approach, but same Talent. \nAfterlife is a game about a Wanderer's personal journey to recovering their memories. Wanderers recover memories when they see something or someone that reminds them of their past life while exploring a Limbo. This is called a Fragment, and the GM uses it to create a Break - a private scene where your Wanderer re-lives a memory. When the Break concludes the Wanderer has a newfound sense of self, for good or bad, and you get to unlock a Death Mark.\nDeath Marks are tattoo-like markings that  are constantly shifting, flirting on the edge of imperceptibility, whispering forgotten secrets in Wanderer's ears. Each Death Mark is linked to a specific memory and grants Wanderers special abilities to use in game. Death Marks are predetermined in character creation by your Wanderer\u2019s ride with the Boatman. \n\nCheck out the exciting rewards you can get through backing our Kickstarter.

A Wanderer's Guide to Mirages & Limbos is a brand new setting book. It introduces new Limbos and Mirages for GMs to use in their game along with player focused information on how to interact with Limbos and Mirages. We'll also take a deeper look into the different species you can meet within the Tenebris and give each of them an in depth write-up.

Legends are born, friendships are forged, and they begin to experience real-world personal growth.\nFor the past seven years, we have been using tabletop games as therapy to help kids become more confident, creative and socially empowered. We're ready to help thousands of children around the world, but we need your help! \nCritical Core is a tabletop role-playing game designed to help kids on the autism spectrum build social skills and confidence. It's a great way for parents to engage with their children at home, and for professionals and experienced gamers to use as a group social skills tool.\nCritical Core is brought to you by Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization, and co-developed with autism advocates, parents, therapists, and educators.\nPLAY\n\nSuitable for cognitive age 9+, including teens and adults.\n2 to 4 players recommended, plus one adult that acts as the facilitator. (Game Master)\nPlayers must have basic listening and verbalization skills.\nWhen running games with young players on the spectrum, parent or certified therapist should be present.\nExperienced gamers will be able to integrate Critical Core into their favorite platform: Ruleset is adapted and streamlined from D&D's 5th Edition OpenSRD.\nA great introduction to tabletop role-playing games for everyone.\nThe Critical Core Starter Set has everything you need to play. The game has been tuned to be as easy as possible to get started and stay engaged. \nPLAY\n\n Facilitator's Guide - For parents, therapists, and Game Masters, our best practices on running fun and effective therapeutic gaming groups.\n Player & Game Master Guides - Quick-start rules and playing guides for players and Game Masters.\n Adventure Modules - Tested and tuned to be challenging and fun.\n Dice (4 sets) - One for each player, one for the Game Master. Enough to run a 3 player game out-of-the-box.\n Character Sheets - 4 popular hero archetypes, each with their own unique abilities.\n Game Cards - Not required for play, but helpful aids for both players and Game Masters - Visualization, quick-reference rules, and spell cards.\n Game Tokens - Visualization aids for working with the included map.\n Reusable map - whiteboard marker friendly. \nPlease note: Artwork shown is work-in-progress and may be subject to change!\nWe believe that Stretch Goals should improve and enhance the usefulness of Critical Core, so we're planning a steady stream of new adventures, characters, cards and tokens that you can use at home or in therapeutic settings. Plus a few extra surprises that will unlock at higher levels!\nCritical Core is fit-for-purpose, designed to help neurodiverse players get started and stay engaged. At the same time, facilitators are provided with the right tools to make the experience effective without it 'feeling like therapy'.\nEach encounter the players face is targeted to help build strength in areas that are related to challenges associated with autism spectrum disorder.\nCritical Core is scaffolded around the DIR/Floortime model, and game encounters map to the FEDC framework. (Function Emotional Developmental Capacities)\nBut all of this is under the hood. At its heart, Critical Core is simply FUN.\nPLAY\n\nWhen kids engage in a world of fantasy play they are free to explore new ideas and relationships in a safe and fun sandbox. Skills learned while playing Critical Core can last a lifetime.\n Although designed for kids on the autism spectrum, Critical Core is just as beneficial (and fun) for all kids. It's an easy stepping stone into the fantastic world of tabletop role-playing games.\nCritical Core is built on established developmental frameworks and distills seven years of practical gaming therapy experience into an easy-to-use format. It is an amazing tool that can be used at home, at school, in a therapist\u2019s office, or out in the community. And above all, it's great fun.\nPLAY\n\n\nGame to Grow - Adam Davis (MA Ed) and Adam Johns (LMFT)\nCritical Core is brought to you by Game to Grow, a 501(c)(3) organization that runs tabletop RPG therapy gaming groups every week. Founders Adam Johns and Adam Davis are distilling 7 years of experience and best practices into the Critical Core project so that the benefits of intentional gaming can be spread to an even wider audience.\n\nVirginia Spielmann (MSOT) - Executive Director of STAR Institute for Sensory Processing Disorder in Denver, Colorado.\nVirginia is a British trained Occupational Therapist with more than 20 years experience working in pediatrics. Virginia co-leads the development of the Critical Core Project, defining the system within the established DIR Floortime\u2122 framework of developmental intervention.\nmcgarrybowen Greater China - creative agency\nThe Critical Core project was initiated and co-created by creative agency mcgarrybowen Greater China as part of an ongoing program to provide creative solutions for social good.\nICDL - The Interdisciplinary Council on Development and Learning\nA not-for-profit organization dedicated to promoting each person's development to their fullest potential. ICDL was formed over 20 years ago to be the official home of DIR\u00ae and DIRFloortime, recognized as the next generation of evidence-based intervention for autism and other developmental challenges.\n \n \nYour passion and support can make Critical Core a reality. Please, pledge now and then get a friend to do the same. Together we can bring the incredible benefits of intentional gaming to those who need it most.\n  We're committed to getting this right. The majority of our time will be spent improving and refining the Critical Core Starter Set with the feedback from beta testers and testing groups. We also have some final artwork and design work to take care of, and of course there is the physical production. We'll be keeping you informed throughout the process, and probably asking for some help and advice along the way! \nGame to Grow is a not-for profit 501(c) company, and our donations are allocated to helping run game groups for kids across the Seattle region. Kickstarter is important for two reasons:\n First, you are an amazing community, and if anyone can help spread the word about the incredible benefits of role-playing games, it's you!\n  Second, there are costs involved in developing and manufacturing Critical Core, so Kickstarter helps us to produce this amazing project!\nPerhaps you already have a favorite role-playing game and are wondering how Critical Core can fit into your gaming life. Like many of you, we are avid gamers and have many games we\u2019ve loved for years. \nCritical Core can improve the games you\u2019re already playing.\nIf you\u2019re already playing an established RPG with your kids, your students, or your community, Critical Core can still help you improve your game and boost your outcomes. \nCritical Core contains a rule system, designed to be easily accessible to a neuro-diverse population as well as new facilitators, but that\u2019s not all! If you are already established using a game that you enjoy and find effective, you\u2019ll be able to use the other components of Critical Core that are designed to support a game facilitator in helping their players learn and grow.\nCritical Core contains a unique module design where in-game scenarios are targeted to real-world development outcomes. This can be translated to most established role-playing games. Additionally, the Critical Core kit includes a facilitator\u2019s guide which contains the learnings of the past seven years of facilitating role-playing games for social growth.\n  Do I need prior experience with role-playing games to run Critical Core?\n                          No. Critical Core is a 'rules-light' tabletop RPG, and the instructions will be designed to help brand new Game Masters quickly learn how to facilitate games that are enriching and fun. We are also planning to release video guides and tutorials to help you out! \nI'm already playing tabletop RPGs with my kids!\nAwesome! You already know the amazing benefits we're talking about. You also know from experience, that tabletop RPGs can be easy to pick up and play, but learning how to be a great Game Master can be challenging, especially for new players.\nWhy not use an established role-playing game platform?\nCritical Core's rule set is adapted from D&D's 5th Edition Open SRD. We have taken out some of the complexity for new players and Game Masters. Think of Critical Core as an entry-level platform: easier for parents, schools, and clinics to pick up and play.\nAre you trying to replace my favorite game?\nNo way! We see Critical Core as a stepping stone to the wide world of RPG gaming. Actually, we hope that as kids grow familiar and comfortable with the system, they can move on to your favorite platform. If you're already using some of the great games out there, then more power to you!\nSo how is Critical Core different?\nWe have applied our experience and best practices to help children (and caregivers) have the most effective and fun experience possible.\nMeticulously designed adventure content to help empower kids with social and problem-solving challenges.\nGame encounters, guidebooks, mechanics heavily influenced by established developmental frameworks (DIR/Floortime).\nRules have been adapted to be easier for new players and Game Masters to pick up.\nAdventures divided into 'one-shot' chapters that can be completed in 90 minutes.\nGoldilocks Content'  -  not too complex/scary and not too easy/cartoony. Just right.\nI've been GM'ing for years, what's in this for me?\nFor starters, you'll be able to pick up the Critical Core system in minutes. We have had inquiries from organizations from across the globe who want to start using Critical Core. You could be a great mentor or GM partner for Critical Core games. Please contact us for more info on how you can help!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCritical Core is based on our learnings in using tabletop RPGs over the years as a therapy, and we're confident that we have a solid system in place.

Over the last few years, I invited 30 award-winning authors to write in response to my art.THEN AGAIN: Vintage Photography Reimagined by One Artist and Thirty Writers is the singular anthology that assembles these richly imagined stories and poems with the captivating images that inspired them.\nImagining possibilities and forging new worlds, the stories and poems amplify the art. The artworks intensify the writings. Throughout the collection images evolve, characters re-appear, plots reveal, symbols come alive. We dream together. \nOnce I thought I might spend eternity with you, before I knew what it was or what it felt like. Instead there is this skulking fellow, who disappears whenever I turn around. (from Paul Park's \"Memory Tower\" in THEN AGAIN)\nTHEN AGAIN is a collector's edition of limited quantity and abundant quality. The professionally designed book will feature over 30 full-color images, each paired with its corresponding story or poem, all printed on heavyweight premium paper stock bound in sturdy softcover.  \nThe Booklet will be a shorter, seven or eight chapter version of THEN AGAIN.\nLike all Kickstarter campaigns, this one is all or nothing. To fund this project, we need to reach our goal of $30,000 by April 30. If we do not, no one's credit card is charged and the project is unfunded.\nThis campaign is your opportunity to get a copy of the book and to join in the fantastic community that's bringing this project to life!\nBraiding them into her hair would never work, even ignoring the smooth skin where her human ears no longer were. No, her rabbit ears had their own ideas. (from Andrea Martinez Corbin's \"A Lullaby from Long Ago\" in THEN AGAIN)\nAbout the Art\nYou can find vintage photographs languishing in attics, basements \u2013 perhaps even your own - and in antiques stores. I rescue them, but I do not preserve them like a conservator. Instead, I collaborate with each image to create something new with the old. \nOver the last couple decades, I\u2019ve developed a technique for painting on vintage photographs. These rediscovered portraits and snapshots are the basis of my art: both canvas and inspiration for my painting. By the time I find them, the original chains of personal connection have broken. Subjects are freed to become characters cast and costumed, players in another story that forms fresh bonds with new audiences.  \nPearl was the first Cephalopod Ambassador to the Dry Lands. They did not realize that no one would listen to her. Eight is a very great age for a squid, though, as it happens, not for a human. Plus, she\u2019s a girl, and who knew that would make a difference? (from Kij Johnson's \"Tool-Using Mimics\" in THEN AGAIN)\nContributing Writers\nTHEN AGAIN presents original stories and poems, each written in response to my artwork, by some of the freshest and most accomplished voices in literary and speculative fiction and poetry, including recipient of a 2018 Arab American Book Award, poet Safia Elhillo, author and essayist Akiko Busch, young speculative fiction writer Erin Roberts, best-selling author and multiple award winner Elizabeth Hand, Guggenheim and NEA fellow Mary Ruefle, another NEA fellow and short story writer Renee Simms, World Fantasy Awardee Sofia Samatar, and recipient of the World Fantasy Award - Life Achievement John Crowley... \nAnd many more top-notch authors:\nUnoma Azuah,  Tina Connolly,  Andrea Martinez Corbin, Paul Di Filippo,  Jeffrey Ford,  Shawn Frazier,  Kij Johnson,  Kirsten Imani Kasai,  Karin Lowachee,  Simone Muench,  Paul Park,  Christine Poreba,  Jennifer Rapaport,  Gregory Scheckler,  Hollis Seamon,  John Seven,  Jim Shepard,  Karen Shepard,  Hasanthika Sirisena,  Sara St. Antoine,  Marjorie Thomsen,  Sarena Ulibarri, and Izzy Wasserstein.\nPlus reprints of poems by Pulitzer Prize winner Jorie Graham and 2018 Wallace Stevens Awardee Sonia Sanchez, to which I made a artworks in response (please note, the Sonia Sanchez poem will appear only on the printed full version of THEN AGAIN, available at the $90 reward level and above).  And an introduction by curator Judie Gilmore.  \nYou'll find more information about each author below. \nCollision of Tomorrows (after Self-Portrait as Apollo and Daphne, by Jorie Graham)\nLimited Edition\nThe funding goal of $30,000 affords an edition of 500 beautifully designed books. I\u2019ll be delighted to make more if there's demand, but there are no plans for broad distribution beyond this Kickstarter campaign. I plan to produce only a couple hundred more than the quantity of book rewards chosen here. \nTHIS is the place to get your book and be part of this effort!\na quick breakdown of where your dollars will go\nHow the Project Came To Be\nFive years ago, curator Judie Gilmore invited me to participate in an exhibit for which authors wrote in response to the art. Inspired by one of my artworks, Hollis Seamon wrote a stunning short story, so thoughtful and potent on its own. Her story further re-created the already transformed photograph. \nTogether the art and writing generated a third radiant thing.\nI was hooked, and wanted more. So, I studied hundreds of poems and stories, and invited authors whose style could enhance the growing collection of art and writing. Each author chose which artwork to write on, and I offered some of them character prompts from other stories in the anthology. \nThe culmination is a treasury of distinct, but intertwined tales and pictures to spark your imagination and wonder.   \nThe book itself is a collaborative work of art.\nAt this moment, 90% of the writers have finished their stories and poems, receiving an honorarium for their work. All the art is ready, and the designer is set to go. We\u2019re connecting art, writing, and now you. \nWe are getting this done together!  \n\u201cI want to be a Flowerhead!\u201d cried Erik Von. \u201cI want to be a Flowerhead when I grow up!\u201d But Father wouldn\u2019t have it, and he yanked Erik Von away... (from John Seven's \"Flowerheads\" in THEN AGAIN)\nHow You Can Join In\nBecome a Backer: Please consider backing this project at a level you\u2019re comfortable with.

Our puzzle novel The Maze of Games has been no exception. Years after we ran two fantastic Maze campaigns on Kickstarter, we're still finding new pathways and puzzles within the Gatekeeper's domain. We wanted to take everything we have for The Maze of Games and put it into one massive omnibus package, supplementing it with fun new material. But to do that we had to send author Mike Selinker and developer Gaby Weidling into their own maze. As you may have guessed from the video above, things went a bit awry. The two are now stuck in the maze.\nOn the upside, before the Gatekeeper trapped Mike and Gaby, they were able to gather quite a bit of stuff. For the first time, you can get everything for The Maze of Games in one place, including a bunch of new items for fans who thought they had it all. Fresh off the book being solved for the first time, we're Kickstarting a new answer guide handwritten by characters Colleen and Samuel Quaice entitled The Keymaster's Tome. There's The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour audio puzzle suite and a new audiobook for The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze. If we're very clever and very lucky, we can help Mike and Gaby escape the room and add a few more goodies to our cache. \nAll the digital and physical rewards. Well, most of them, anyway.\nAlong with the puzzle creations we've lined up for you, we have a unique adventure. The Maze of Games Escape Room by Epic Team Adventures opens its doors today, March 14th. You can book your experience today at epicteamadventures.com! Designed by Gaby, Mike, and ETA's Jesse McGatha and Richard Thames Rowan, this intense experience is the first of several mind-bending puzzle rooms set in the Gatekeeper's world. When you book, you can use the escape room discount code we've added to every backer level so you can experience what Mike and Gaby are going through. Hopefully you'll have an easier time getting through the maze than they are.\nBelow you'll find all the details on The Maze of Games Omnibus and Escape Room Experience, including descriptions of all the items, backer levels, stretch goals, and the Maze of Games Escape Room. And what would a Maze of Games Kickstarter be without puzzles? Make sure to come back as we update. Mike and Gaby will send us messages from inside the room, and we'll need your help to decipher them. See below for details, and keep an eye on @LoneSharkGames on Twitter for all the puzzling info. Mike and Gaby have assured us there are secret badges along the way for everyone who can help them escape the maze. \nThe Maze of Games hardback, The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze, and the Maze Map.\nThe Maze of Games is a puzzle novel Mike had trapped in his head for 18 years prior to 2013, when we took the unique book to Kickstarter. It's the story of two British children from 1897, Colleen and Samuel Quaice, who get trapped in a series of increasingly deadly mazes by a skeletal guardian called the Gatekeeper. What makes the book unique\u2014other than its strange story and dynamic art by Magic: The Gathering artist Pete Venters\u2014is that the pages are in the wrong order. You must solve the puzzles and restore the narrative in order to help the children escape the maze. A 40-page section called the Conundrucopia features all of the best modern-day puzzlemakers writing puzzles in the style of the 1890s. It's cool. \nThe Two of Diamonds spread in The Maze of Games.\nIf you pledge to this Kickstarter campaign, you can get access to:\nThe hardback of The Maze of Games, its PDF, and its audiobook narrated by Wil Wheaton.\nThe softcover of The Theseus Guide to Guide to the Final Maze and its PDF.\nThe recently updated second edition of the Maze Map poster and PDF, a unique 20\"x30\" story maze by Mike, Eric Harshbarger, and Corey Macourek.\nAudio albums of The Maze of Games Soundtrack by composer Austin Wintory and the Songs in the Key of Maze EP by Marian Call, Kirby Krackle, and Paul & Storm.\nA discount code for the solvable ebook for iPhone and iPad by Puzzazz. \nThe covers for the Maze of Games Audiobook, Songs in the Key of Maze, and the Maze of Games Soundtrack. Art by Pete Venters, graphic design by Elisa Teague.\nEach backer who receives physical goods will pay the actual cost of shipping their rewards. Final shipping rates and costs will be loaded into our PledgeManager, and you will pay for your shipping via the PledgeManager as well.  We'll charge backers as close to our actual shipping costs for their shipping address as we can for each order. Lone Shark is not making any profit on shipping and handling. FYI: The Maze of Games hardback is a heavy book. See the FAQ for our current shipping estimates.\nPlus there's a lot of brand new stuff you've never seen. Including this amazing project. \nPLAY\n\nFor years, we've imagined a live experience where you get thrown into the Gatekeeper's maze and have to solve your way out. We knew of only one team who could bring this vision to life: downtown Seattle's Epic Team Adventures. Our friends at ETA have made some of our favorite rooms: the film noir-themed The Sparrow Files, the Poe-inspired The Raven and the Red Death, and many more. ETA's team includes some of the Maze's biggest fans, and so we collaborated with them to make The Maze of Games Escape Rooms.\nSome of the sights in the Maze of Games escape room. This image is spoiler-free and not used in any puzzles in this campaign.\nFar from being satisfied with making  one Maze of Games escape room, ETA concocted an adventurous plan to make four rooms in the same space, all themed around authors trapped in the maze. Gaby and Mike worked with ETA designers Rich Rowan and Jesse McGatha to craft these escape rooms, and we got our Gatekeeper Wil Wheaton to narrate the whole thing. It's a tremendously cool experience that you can see in the video above.\nWe hope that you can all make it to Seattle and match wits with the Gatekeeper. To encourage you to visit us, all reward levels of this Kickstarter campaign include a discount code good for $35 off the cost of a full room booking of The Maze of Games Escape Room at Epic Team Adventures. If you pledge, click this link to get access to the code, allowing you to book your room experience on the ETA site today. The code can be used any time in the next year. Remember: Pledge, get the code, book the room.\nFor those who just want to buy it all now, look at the level called Everything Maze Plus A Full Room, which lets you pledge for an entire room plus all the physical and digital rewards. We can't send out individual codes until after the campaign closes, so if you're in a hurry to book, get your $35 code here today and then pay the rest on the ETA site.\nThe Keymaster's Tome mockup cover (not final art). Designed by Skylar Woodies with handwriting by Gaby and Mike.\nThe Keymaster\u2019s Tome is a new physical book made for this Kickstarter, available in both printed and PDF form. People have been asking us since the dawn of this project when we were going to have a Keymaster to go with our Gatekeeper. The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze was the closest we could get to an answer booklet without divulging the Maze's secrets to everyone, and it was fun to add more puzzles too. But just this past month, a group of puzzle solvers finished the final puzzle in The Maze of Games. With that done, we felt that the time was right for an answer book, so Mike and Gaby hand-crafted The Keymaster's Tome, a version of The Maze of Games puzzles (not the story) with answers, conversations, and tidbits hand-written in the margins by the Quaice siblings as they make their way through the maze. Here's as much of a look as we can show you. \nPage spread from The Keymaster's Tome. Spoiler hands not included.\nThe book is available as a PDF in the Just The New Digitals level, as well as a softcover in the Just The New Book & The New Digitals level. \nStretch Goals\nWhen we started the campaign, The Keymaster's Tome was 60 pages detailing answers for the main puzzle section of The Maze of Games. Now that the campaign has exceeded our funding goal, we're adding hand-written and annotated answers to more puzzles.\nUNLOCKED: $13,500 - We added 24 pages of Conundrucopia answers in our hand-written, story-based style. That raised the Tome from 60 pages to 84 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $15,000 -  We added 8 pages of extras: the endpapers, the library card, the credits, and so on. Everyone who pledges to this campaign will have their name in The Keymaster\u2019s Tome. This got the Tome from 84 pages to 92 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $17,500 - We added 8 pages of The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze answers. This got the Tome from 92 pages to 100 pages. \nUNLOCKED: $20,000 - We added 8 pages of soundtrack and Maze Map answers. This got the Tome from 100 to 108 pages.\nUNLOCKED: $25,000 - We added an audio answer key to The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour, recorded by Mike and Gaby! \nUNLOCKED: $30,000 - We've begun the creation of a new Maze of Games website with The Keymaster's Tome content for backers to access!\nUNLOCKED: $35,000 - We're including cool Maze of Games wallpaper (in black and white and color) in every digital bundle!\nUPCOMING GOAL: $40,000 - We'll include the Maze of Games escape room 2-page spread from Puzzlecraft in every digital bundle and add the handwritten answers to The Keymaster's Tome!\nCovers for The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze audiobook and The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour. Art and graphics by Pete Venters and Elisa Teague.\nWe\u2019re introducing two new audio products as part of this campaign. First,The Theseus Guide to the Final Maze now has its own audiobook, which adds a new chapter to the existing one for The Maze of Games. Both star Wil Wheaton doing all the voices.\nThe second audio project is The Gatekeeper's Variety Hour (originally named The Audiophonic Conundrucopia), a radio show hosted by Wil alongside us and our puzzlemaker and musician friends Kid Beyond, Molly Lewis, Austin Wintory, Francis Heaney, Eric Chaikin, Greg Pliska, and Wil Zambole. It's easy to turn it on. You must solve the puzzles to turn it off.  \nMike and Molly Lewis record something old-timey for the Variety Hour. Photo by Gaby.\nBoth of these new audio experiences supplement The Maze of Games audiobook, created by Skyboat Media. If you've only got the physical books, open up your ears for a whole new way to play. \nThe Gatekeeper's Edition. Created by Elisa Teague and Regent Publishing, ambigram by Scott Kim.\nOK, we swear this story is true. When we first made The Maze of Games, we made 250 copies of a black and silver leatherette-bound in-world book called The Gatekeeper's Edition. It has deckled pages, a library card, a ribbon, and other boss features. We fulfilled all of those and agreed never to make that edition again. Done and done.\nBut ... our guy Shane was cleaning up the warehouse in preparation for a move last month and literally tripped over a box of Gatekeeper's Editions. We assume we kept them in case some didn't reach their destinations, and everyone forgot about them. Now that we found this treasure trove, we couldn't just keep it locked up. So we're making a mere ten absolutely, positively, very last ever copies of The Maze of Games Gatekeeper's Edition available at the Keymaster's Trove level, along with a signed copy of the Keymaster's Tome. If you're interested in owning a piece of history, take a look at that level. \nMike Selinker is the president of the Seattle design studio Lone Shark Games. He's the co-designer of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Lords of Vegas, Unspeakable Words, Apocrypha, The Ninth World, Thornwatch, and many other games, as well as the author of other books like Puzzlecraft, The Kobold Guide to Board Game Design, and Game Theory in the Age of Chaos. While at Wizards, he helped design and develop games like Betrayal at House on the Hill, Risk Godstorm, and Axis & Allies, and was a creative director on 3rd edition Dungeons & Dragons. He\u2019s also the executive director of the political advocacy group Basket of Adorables. He can be found at @mikeselinker. \nPete Venters is the book's illustrator, and one of the most popular game artists around. He is best known for his nearly 300 pieces of trading card art for Magic: The Gathering, but has also worked in concept art, comic books, and book design. He is the illustrator for the Gothic Charm School trade paperback, written by his wife, Jillian Venters. He and Mike have collaborated on projects for Disney and Wizards of the Coast.\nElisa Teague is the book's graphic designer. She is a game and puzzle designer, her latest titles including Geek Out!, Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow's Walk, Lions and Tigers and Bears - Oh My, various Dungeons & Dragons and other RPG modules, and the upcoming Kingdom Hearts Talisman. She has also been an art director, developer, and production manager on over 100 titles in the industry, including Lone Shark Games' monster hit (pun intended) Apocrypha Adventure Card Game.\nGaby Weidling is the book's developer. She's a game, puzzle, and event designer whose  handiwork can be found in games like the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Betrayal at House on the Hill: Widow\u2019s Walk, Apocrypha, and more. Some of her favorite puzzle projects include developing The Maze of Games and Puzzlecraft, designing a series of escape rooms set in the world of Magic: the Gathering\u2019s Innistrad, and teaching puzzle design at DigiPen. She spends her spare time trying new things, cuddling her cats, and just generally being a sunshine cannon. Someday she\u2019ll quit the game industry to become a detective or reboot Matlock. Maybe both. She can be found at @ermahgerdgerby.\nTanis O'Connor is the book's editor. Her past work includes design, development, and editing on Dungeons & Dragons with Wizards of the Coast, the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game at Paizo Publishing, many other game and puzzle events, and 5 (!) MIT Mystery Hunts. Do not try this at home. \nOh, right, we nearly forgot. Gaby and Mike are trapped in the Maze of Games escape room for the entire length of this campaign. We'd go and let them out, but it's more fun to let you figure out how to free them. We're going to give you daily puzzles of several types, all of which combine to figure out how to get them out. It'll all end in a final campaign-end livestream, but before we get there, you better get cracking on these puzzles. \nHere's what you got:\nIn the campaign video above and six later update videos are seven rebus puzzles. Those are visual addition puzzles like the kind you see on the show Concentration. Each leads to an answer, which will get you one of seven badges. The first one contains this image. Another hidden puzzle across all the videos will get you the eighth badge.\nIf you follow our Twitter account @lonesharkgames, you'll see a set of 20 daily Tom Swifties. Those are puzzles where Tom says a sentence in a particularly punny manner such as \"'I'd like to stop by the mausoleum,' Tom said cryptically.\" In our Gatekeeper Swifties, the answers are all names of authors the Gatekeeper has trapped in the Maze. Answering all of them will lead to a final instruction which gives you a ninth badge. The first ten such puzzles are gathered here.\nAt five geek-themed events\u2014the MIT Mystery Hunt, the JoCo Cruise, Emerald City Comic Con, the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and this week's PAX East\u2014we'll be there giving out postcards. All five puzzles' answers combine together in a specific way to get you a tenth badge. \nThe first event postcard. We'll post the rest after each event ends.\nFinally, getting Mike and Gaby out of the Maze of Games escape room will get you the eleventh badge. That's only available when the campaign comes to an end.\nWhen you have an answer for any of these puzzles, submit it on our answer site. You'll get a response from us that will let you continue your quest and maybe give you a badge. When you get one, use it as your Kickstarter, Facebook, or Twitter icon. That'll show off how smart a puzzler you are, and maybe even that you care if Mike and Gaby get out alive. Regardless, we'll see you in the Maze. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe don't have a lot of risks on this campaign. The Maze of Games Escape Room is ready for opening, the audiobooks are recorded and formatted for download, and the third-printing books are getting ready for shipment. All the digital rewards and most of the physical rewards are ready to go.\n\nThe only physical object that isn't finished is The Keymaster's Tome, because we hope the campaign lets us make a larger version of it. When the campaign is over, we'll finish up work on that and send it to press in the United States. When all that's ready, we'll get it all to our fulfiller for shipping in the US. It may take longer to get our non-US orders done, but we'll get them fulfilled as quickly as we can.\n\nThis is the first of TWO puzzle book campaigns we'll be doing fairly close to back-to-back.

Please give us a shout through the 'Ask a Question\u2019 button on our Kickstarter campaign FAQ page.\nWe can\u2019t wait to bring the entire 10-episode The Legend of Vox Machina animated series to life!\n<3\nCritical Role\nCritical Role is a weekly livestreamed tabletop roleplaying game featuring a group of prominent voice actors, who happen to be best friends. Each week, veteran Game Master Matthew Mercer leads the cast through epic adventures set in the world of Exandria! Trust us \u2014 it\u2019s rad.  \nOur original storyline centered on a group of heroes known as Vox Machina \u2014 Pike Trickfoot (gnome cleric, Ashley Johnson), Keyleth (half-elf druid, Marisha Ray), Percival \u201cPercy\u201d Fredrickstein Von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III (human gunslinger, Taliesin Jaffe), Grog Strongjaw (goliath barbarian, Travis Willingham), Scanlan Shorthalt (gnome bard, Sam Riegel), Vex\u2019ahlia (half-elf ranger, Laura Bailey), and Vax\u2019ildan (half-elf rogue, Liam O\u2019Brien) \u2014 as they battled the forces of evil and learned to work as a team. Their epic tale concluded in November, 2017 after 115 episodes and 373 hours of gameplay.\nThe show is still going strong, now over 50 episodes in to our second season, which tracks the misfits known as the Mighty Nein. Critical Role reaches a wide, international audience called Critters, who are just about the greatest fans in history. \n Titmouse is an Emmy award-winning animation production company behind the hits Big Mouth, The Venture Bros., Metalocalypse, Niko and the Sword of Light and Star Wars: Galaxy of Adventures. One of the largest 2D animation studios in America with studios in Los Angeles, New York and Vancouver, B.C., it employs more than 400 of the most talented people in the industry (all guaranteed to be 100% human). Its fresh styles can be seen on major networks such as Disney, Adult Swim, Cartoon Network and streaming services like Amazon and Netflix.  \nVox Machina is back, baby \u2014 but this time they\u2019re cartoons! Here\u2019s the amazing creative team that\u2019s gonna take our tale from imagination to animation...  \nArt by Critter Hunter Bonyun (@deerlordhunter)\nWRITING TEAM\nA brand new story was crafted by the cast of Critical Role and scripted by our good friend and talented TV writer, Jennifer Muro (Star Wars: Forces of Destiny, Spider-Man, Justice League: Action). Muro is one of the most sought-after writers in the industry and she\u2019s written an in-canon adventure that takes place before the events of the streaming show. \nANIMATION TEAM\nTo bring the magic and mayhem of Exandria to life, we\u2019re sinking the vast majority of our resources into the animation budget. As Titmouse has proven again and again, they pride themselves on top notch quality and attention to detail, ensuring this story will be told with visceral, action-packed visuals. It\u2019ll be bloody gorgeous.\nVOICEOVER\nThe voice acting for The Legend of Vox Machina will (of course) be provided by the cast of Critical Role, who bring decades of experience to the table. You\u2019ve no doubt heard their voices in some of your favorite cartoons \u2014 Teen Titans Go!, Ben 10, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Attack on Titan, Dragon Ball Z, Sofia the First, Avengers Assemble, DuckTales, Transformers, and many, many more. And to round out the main cast, we\u2019ll bring in some extra special celebrity cameos, as well as voice over industry legends. \nOTHER DETAILS\nIn The Legend of Vox Machina, our adventuring group is right around Level 7 \u2014 fledgling adventurers, but still powerful enough to fire off exciting spells and brutal attacks.\nSo, what will this campaign allow us to create? A bitchin\u2019 high-quality, fantasy cartoon set in a world created by one of the most accomplished storytellers, Matthew Mercer. With heart-stopping action and side-splitting comedy, it will have something for everyone. \nIf we smash through our crowdfunding goal, The Legend of Vox Machina will be released in Fall 2020. But we can\u2019t do it without your help funding this campaign \u2014 which ends on Thursday, April 18th at 11:59pm Pacific.\nUPDATE (MARCH 7TH):\nDue to the overwhelming love and support of our amazing backers, we're creating an animated series!\nAs a quick refresher: the first few episodes of our animation will focus on a brand new Vox Machina adventure, which takes place before our show began streaming live on Twitch. But because of your incredible generosity, we\u2019re following your lead and going for it, diving right into a series that begins the retelling of the saga of Vox Machina. We can\u2019t wait to show you how the story shapes up!\nWe're excited to share new episode offerings as part of our new stretch goals for our campaign: The Briarwoods are coming to animated life in The Legend of Vox Machina!\nThe Briarwoods arc is one of the most exciting and popular storylines of the Vox Machina streaming campaign. When we were brainstorming about what might come next, the clear winner was introducing the Briarwoods into The Legend of Vox Machina.\nThe Briarwoods arc story so far\u2026 Vox Machina arrive in Percy's hometown, Whitestone, to avenge the murder of his family and the corruption of his city at the hands of the evil Briarwoods. Danger and betrayal lurk around every corner, and it will take all of Vox Machina's abilities to combat this deadly threat. The Briarwoods arc began in episode 24 of our first streamed campaign, and remains one of our absolute favorites.\nFor the last batch of stretch goals that we crush, we\u2019ll be able to create two additional 22-minute Briarwoods arc episodes.\nSo, to recap, here\u2019s what you can expect episode-wise from The Legend of Vox Machina animated SERIES:\n Episodes 1 & 2: A brand new story centered around Vox Machina at level 7 (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 3, 4, 5, 6: Briarwoods arc! (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 7 & 8: Continuation of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\n Episodes 9 & 10: Continuation and conclusion of Briarwoods arc (FUNDED!)\nBe sure to check out our backer updates tab at the top of this page for the full download.\nUPDATE (APRIL 5TH):\nWe have unlocked our final stretch goal and now, we\u2019ll make the entire 10-episode The Legends of Vox Machina series for you AND a one-shot GMed by our very own Ashley Johnson! \nAt the moment, we\u2019re not planning on adding additional stretch goals -- every dollar that we raise after this point will be allocated directly into making an even more kick ass animation. This means more animators, more music, and more awesomeness. Of course, if that changes, we\u2019ll be sure to let everyone know as soon as possible.\nIn our wildest dreams, we never thought that we\u2019d be able to bring an entire Vox Machina SERIES to life. But, time and time again, you all continue to challenge our expectations in the best way. We cannot thank you enough and we cannot wait to roll up our sleeves and get started. \nTravis & Sam went on dozens of Hollywood pitch meetings, and found some interest \u2014 but we ultimately decided to create our first animated special on our own. By doing so, we can continue to stay true to our beloved characters and tell the stories you want to see. With an ever-burning desire to bring a Vox Machina animation to the masses, we decided to give the power back to our amazing community, roll up our sleeves, and make this special with YOU instead. \nEvery dollar you contribute allows us to embark on this animated adventure together, with the ultimate goal of producing a full-blown animated series. We\u2019ll keep you posted on how the project is going \u2014 with behind-the-scenes looks at the animation process, recording sessions, reward product creation, and everything in-between. As a backer, you are part of our team and we guarantee you\u2019ll feel empowered and informed every step of the way.   \nCONTRIBUTE if you have the means to do so! Backers will get updates along the way, receive awesome rewards, and be the first to know when the show is ready for prime time.\nSHARE with your friends and family. Even if your loved ones don\u2019t know Critical Role yet, a super badass cartoon is a perfect way to introduce them to it. Help us spread the good word! \nAlong with making the 22-minute animated series of our dreams, the money raised through this campaign will allow us to provide cool rewards and administer our crowdfunding project. \nIt\u2019s incredibly important that we remain transparent, so we created this handy chart to show you exactly where your hard-earned money will go. \nThe overwhelming majority of our funds raised will support the production of our animated special \u2014 from our incredible animation team to voiceover studio time, soundtrack composition, music, effects, sound design, etc.\nOf course, we have accounted for some boring (but important!) stuff too \u2014 like credit card processing fees, accounting, and additional staff to keep this project running at full steam. \nWe wanted to give you the coolest and most high-quality rewards, all of which are exclusive to this crowdfunding campaign, which means you won\u2019t be able to find this swag anywhere else! \n We\u2019re thrilled to offer you a selection of campaign-exclusive perks as a thank you for supporting The Legend of Vox Machina. We\u2019ve set it up this way to guarantee that most of your funds go towards creating the best damn cartoon possible. After countless creative meetings, we created this set of sweet products that we would be proud to own ourselves.    \nEach time we hit a new goal together, we'll share our new crowdfunding goal with you! This means more swag and some bad ass Vox Machina one-shots that will unlock for everyone (backers or not!).   \nFirst, check out our Kickstarter FAQ on our campaign page. We will update this page as often as possible to ensure that the answers that you seek are readily available. \nIf your question isn\u2019t covered in the FAQ, feel free to drop us a note by hitting the \u2018Ask a question\u2019 button on the FAQ page. \nSpecial thanks to Critter Jessica Mahon (@my2k) for creating the portrait art for our campaign headings.

It was where some of the greatest writers of the 20th Century got their start and some of the most iconic characters made their debut, from Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan and John Carter to Maxwell Grant's The Shadow to Robert E. Howard's Conan the Barbarian. \nWithout the pulps, comic books may never have introduced the super-hero...and then where would we be today?\nThe pulp magazine era was bristling with brawny men and statuesque women globetrotting, and getting into and out of danger. Their exploits quickened the pulses of their readers, young and old alike. They gave rise to some of the most enduring heroes known the world 'round.\nTo honor and celebrate a bygone era, I have partnered with most of my Crazy 8 Press team. If you've loved Aaron Rosenberg's work on ReDeus or From this is Hell or Paul Kupperberg's super-hero comics and adventure stories or the intergalactic adventures from Mary Fan or the noirish stylings of Russ Colchamiro, then you know what you're in for. Aaron, Paul, Mary, the late Glenn Hauman, and Michael Jan Friedman are all signed on for the project. \nAdditionally, I have assembled a stellar line-up of other writers \u2013 Derek Tyler Attico, Jim & Becky Beard, Paige Daniels, Kathleen O'Shea David, Robert T. Jeschonek, Amy Lewanski, Karissa Laurel, and Jenifer Purcell Rosenberg \u2013 to produce new thrills and chills, spanning the traditional pulp realms of mystery, sword and sorcery, horror, science fiction, romance, and high adventure, in a volume appropriately titled...Thrilling Adventure Yarns!\nMeet Professor Ironheart! The Blue Mask! The Green Lady! Cannon Belle! And many more brand-new heroes that would have made pulp-era creators proud.\nAn Historic Coup!\nWe have also secured the rights to a true relic of the glory days of the pulps: A previously unpublished World War I aviator tale by none other than Lester Dent, the creator of Doc Savage! This is a milestone in the history of the pulp magazines, available only to the backers of this campaign. \nWe're really excited about Thrilling Adventure Yarns -- in part, at least, because of this great cover by the inestimable British artist Alex Ronald. Feast your eyes on this image and you can see for yourself that the days of yore will be treated with deep affection.\nOur goal!\nThis isn't the kind of publishing project in which the publisher takes the lion's share of the profits and doles out the scraps to those who've done all the work. All funds that remain after the expenses of acquiring the Lester Dent story, commissioning the cover, designing the book, funding a print run, and sending out rewards to our backers will be divvied up by our editor and our writers in equal amounts. If we reach our goal of at least $4,500, we'll be able to accomplish all that.\nBut it's our hope to earn enough to add some other authors as well, and maybe, just maybe, to reach a stretch goal that will enable us to add interior illustrations.\nIt all comes down to you.\nA la carte!\nThis handy-dandy a la carte menu enables you to customize your reward package--to receive all the things you want and none of the things you don't.

Vancouver, British Columbia found out after a breakout of White Sun, a virus capable of bringing back the dead in a viciously primal state. Panic turned into destruction as corpses marched through the streets, tearing at the flesh of anyone in their wake. \nHope was fleeting. \nGlobal superpowers came together and formed the International Bio-disaster Response Agency (IBRA). Cleaner Squads were dispatched into the unfolding crisis. Their mission: extract the living and clear out any dead that stands in their way.\nBruce Deacon, fireteam leader of CS-42, was among the first wave to arrive. Entering the besieged city only to discover\u2026\nIn Vancouver, when it rains it pours.  \nWhat is Vancity Outbreak?\nVancity Outbreak is a graphic novel about a deadly virus that turns victims into ravenous undead cannibals. Bruce Deacon, the squad leader of a bio-disaster response team, is sent to rescue the survivors trapped within the city. He meets a student nurse named Jane Riley and together they work to escape the quarantine zone. Only to discover that they bit off more than they could chew.\nWhiplash Comics uses real actors and real locations. We tell stories through the medium of a camera and create stunning visuals through composting the photographs. The result is a truly unique style that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. \nOur cast includes real models, actors, makeup artist, musicians, and other creatives. Together, with very small budget, we put together TWO action-packed issues. Reid Lucier tailored each photo using graphic compositing to add the effects while working with Cale Boudreau to input the story. \nWe've had a booth at Vancouver\u2019s zombie walk, comic conventions and met with successful creators to learn everything we can. It paid off and we want to continue going forward! With your help we can pay for the printing costs, shipping fees, and begin working on future comics!\n\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 1 - Bullet or a Bite\nSamples of Issue 2 - Crossings\nIssue 2 - Crossroads\nIssue 2 - Crossroads\nIssue 2 - Crossroads\n\nReward Tiers\nTier 1 - Bite\nTier 2 - Infection\nTier 3 - Viral Spread\nTier 4 - Outbreak\nTier 5 - Pandemic\nTier 6 - Apocalypse\nTier 7 - Annihilation\nOur Vision\nWhiplash Comics brings graphic novels to life through photography. With a successful Kickstarter, we can bring both issues of Vancity Outbreak to market, tainted with our blood, sweat and tears.\nAnd we don't plan on stopping there! \nWe have more stories in the works including: issue #3 of Vancity Outbreak, a spy comic, a VR short movie based on Vancity Outbreak, and even branching off into illustrated comics.\nWith enough support we can deliver more jaw-dropping visual storytelling. We made Vancity Outbreak with a budget of $200, having a group of creatives from all walks of life come together through nothing but passion. \nOur goal moving forward, however, is to offer compensation to the actors, extras, make-up artists, and everyone else that contributes. This is an important step if we want to maintain our cast for continuity sake. The photoshoots last anywhere from 10-12 hours and often require re-shoots. Tons of work pours into each comic which requires intricate planning to put together. \nWHO ARE WE?\nReid\nCale\nWhat's the backstory? How did Vancity Outbreak come about?\nReid Lucier had the idea for Vancity Outbreak after finishing a zombie themed photoshoot with our resident Bruce (Roberto Lanzas) and Jane (Yu Sarah Matsushita). After editing the first photo, he noticed how cinematic the shots were and found the inspiration to make a comic. Reid created a short PDF comic book with the photos he had.  A year later Reid decided he wanted to continue Vancity Outbreak and really do it right with a full graphic novel in mind.  After bringing up the idea to the original cast and receiving a lot of enthusiasm from them to do more, Reid sat down to write a full graphic novel.  It took all about 10 mins to realize writing was not his speciality.\nThat\u2019s when he met Cale Boudreau, a creative writer and zombie fanatic, online. Together, with couple cold ones and some poutine they created the vision for the comic.  They began casting actors, makeup artist, and looking for props and locations to shoot.  Shedding their blood, sweat, and tears to make it happen. \nTwo full issues were shot, and Reid went to work on editing, and layout, special effects etc. Now finally we are thrilled to get these issues into your hands!\nWhy back us?\nBecause we know where you live, and the next time you open your front door we'll have our undead associate waiting for you...\nOur associate :)\n Just kidding...maybe? \n\nPrinting\nSize: 6.6 by 10.25 inches\nCover:  10pt paper stock, Matte anti-scratch, green foil stamping\nInside paper stock:  85lbs matte\nBinding: Perfect Softcover\nWe shopped around and did our research.  We walked a few indie comic events and 8/10 books we picked up, flipped through and impressed us were from Print Ninja.  We contacted Print Ninja and they sent us a few samples. The one style of graphic novel sent over was perfect.  The look, the feel, the fantastic quality...we knew we had to have it. Pricier than other places we contacted, but will be well worth it. We want top quality for us and most of all, our fans! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any creation process there are challenges. With a photographic comic these problems become more complex.\n\nHere's the good news: All the work is done and the first two comics are 100% complete! We simply need help to fund our first printing run and to bring forth all the great rewards with it. \n\nWe have a TON of interest from actors wanting to join future projects.

These are working professionals in the industry so their schedules are often hard to align. \n\nOur contingency here is find a day that works for everyone. We can also break up shoots into two smaller days.

In the ancient forest of Soza, a fighter, a thief and a hermit go searching for a magical sword that can control minds!\nIt was shot in the woods by the Yoghurt Rooms in East Grinstead with some scenes in Ashdown Forest.\nWe are hosting a MOVIE PREMIERE in the East Grinstead Cinema on Sunday the 9th of December. In order to do this screening, and hopefully more in the future, we need a BBFC certificate, and they're very expensive!\nWith your support, we hope to screen this film, not only for this story, but on behalf of all micro-budget film makers. We want to bring big independent features into the cinema, where they should be!\nThe film stars Xander Phillips as Tias, Seth Easterbrook as Ulysses, and Martyn Eade as Mars. It's a more classic style fantasy, with a fully original classical score, which I have written myself.\nWe recommend arriving at the event at 6:30 PM\nThe doors will open at 7:00 PM and there will be one intermission in the middle of the film. The cast and crew will be there, handing out awards to pledgers, answering questions, and trying our best to hide our nerves (me in particular!)\nYour pledge will help us to cover the costs of this release. Not the film cost itself. We paid for that for the love of making film. The budget was probably around \u00a32000 in total, mainly due to old style clothing and you guessed it - swords! This funding will help mostly with the certificate, the theatre rental, and if we overshoot our goal, it will begin to help cover costs of printing, ink, paper, cases, posters and rewards.\nAbove all, your pledge will - quite honestly - give us a little more hope in this field of art. To make something that people give a chance, to give their time and money to experience something new, whether good or bad, gives us the ability to learn from the experience, and a little more confidence in putting the time and money into future films.\nUPDATE ON THE RATING: It is now a 12A, confirmed!\nIf your kids like classic fantasy adventure, bring them! :D\nThis is a \"fantasy epic\" so it's not short. It has been cut down, so it's faster-paced, but after debating for a long time, I could not bring myself to divide this film into two halves. Although it was almost possible, it would have spoiled the structure of the script, and the way it was intended to be. But as promised, a 15-minute intermission, and some possible surprises during :) Like the way cinema used to be!\nPlease pass this link to anyone who you think it might appeal to. We're always looking to build relationships with backers who may also be trying to get into the film-making game. That's the whole idea!\nThank you for your time in looking at our film, and I look forward to meeting you and posting all those rewards.

I ask for help at the last minute, well after I've done everything I can. (Although one day, I hope to try new methods!) Therefore there are practically no risks for backers.\n\nThe film has already been written, shot, edited and scored. We are in the absolute final stages of audio mixing, which will probably be done by the time this kick-starter is launched. I will then test it with Chris on the projector, make any adjustments, test again (I usually aim for first or second test to be the final one), then it's done. If I die, the show goes on. If the cinema gets fried by a dragon, then we might have a problem.\n\nSince the campaign ends the day before the premiere, the film is scheduled to be tested within a week from now. The only risks are technical ones, computers deciding to fight me, which I am pretty used to by now! If some horrific freak technical problem happens and the Premiere can't go on, then I would know well before the kick-starter would end, and would not allow it to take the money from its backers in the first place. I have already started production on the rewards, which are relatively easy to complete at this stage from previous experience.\nVHS is a bit of a tricky one, but we reckon we've solved it doing some tests.\nWhen the film is on that projector, tested and given the nod, it stays there.

My name is A. M. Paulson.  I am a dyslexic writer with a few stories published and am writing a comic book series through Oneshi Press.  I had lots of issues in school with spelling and reading with the letter 'c' being a true enemy of mine for my early grade school years.  Later in life I learned a rule to spell with the letter 'c'.  The letter 'c' sounds like a 'k' before a, o, and u as in cat, cot, and cut.  The letter 'c' sounds like an 's' before e, i, and y as in cent, city, and cyst.  Now I am inspired to write a picture book to teach this rule to help other kids like myself.  I sent it to many publishers, but they had no idea what to do with it and rejected it on the grounds they didn't know who would buy it.  I know this story can help many kids, so I got together with a friend, and we planing to put it on Amazon Kindle.  We need $100 for art supplies  and to pay the artist.  We have other goals as well.  \nThose goals are...\n$200 for an audio book\n$300 for a paperback printed edition\n$500 for a hardback printed edition\n$1000 for an animated short of the story\nI am not one to ask you to give money without seeing the manuscript.  So, the rest of this post is the story 'Mary and the Letter C.'  I hope you enjoy it ;)\nMary and the Letter C\nBy: A. M. Paulson\nMary was very sad. She had failed her spelling test, and her parents said it was because she did not try hard enough to learn to spell the words.\n\u201cHow can you spell the word \u2018cat\u2019 k-a-t?\u201d her dad had asked.\n\u201cThe word \u2018city\u2019 begins with a \u2018c\u2019 not a \u2018s\u2019,\u201d her mother had said. \u201cEveryone knows that.\u201d\nMary had tried to tell her parents she spelled the words the way they sounded just like her teacher told her to do, but they wouldn\u2019t listen. Instead they sent her to her room without any dinner.\nAs she sat on her bed, Mary decided the only reason she failed the test was because of the letter \u201cc.\u201d She wondered why the letter \u201cc\u201d sounded like the letter \u201cs\u201d when you sang the alphabet song, but when used in words, it sometimes sounded like a \u201ck,\u201d for example in \u201ccat.\u201d For hours, she thought and thought. \nMary thought about how the letter \u201cc\u201d doesn\u2019t really have a sound of its own.\nMary thought about how the letter \u201cc\u201d steals spelling jobs from \u201cs\u2019s\u201d and \u201ck\u2019s.\u201d\nMary thought about how much better the world would be without the letter \u201cc.\u201d\nMary thought about hammering out the letter \u201cc\u201d into the letter \u201cI\u201d or squeezing it into the letter \u201co,\u201d or bending it into the letter \u201cv.\u201d \nUntil at last, she fell asleep. \nIn middle of the night, a sound woke Mary up. Jumping up and down on her bed was a fairy. The fairy had the wings of a honeybee and a dress made of letters.\n\u201cHello,\u201d said the fairy. \u201cI\u2019m Spella, the fairy of spelling and grammar. I\u2019m here to teach you about the letter \u2018c\u2019.\u201d\nMary closed her eyes to go back to sleep. \n\u201cI don\u2019t want to learn about the letter \u2018c\u2019.\u201d Mary said. \u201cGo away, so I can go back to sleep.\u201d\nSpella flew over to Mary and whispered in her ear, \u201cLearning about \u2018c\u2019 will help you pass your next spelling test.\u201d\nMary opened one eye. \u201cIt will?\u201d\nSpella nodded. \u201cI promise.\u201d\nMary sat up.\nSpella flew to the middle of the room and clapped her hands, and the letters \u201cc,\u201d \u201cs,\u201d and \u201ck\u201d appeared. \n\u201cYou are right about the letter \u2018c\u2019 being troublesome,\u201d Spella said. \u201cLots of children your age have trouble knowing which of these three letters to use at the beginning of a word.\u201d\n\u201cBut my parents said no one had trouble with it,\u201d Mary said, remembering what her mom and dad had said before they sent her to her room.\nSpella shrugged. \u201cSome people have no problem with it. Everyone is different.\u201d\nSpella clapped her hands again. The letters \u201ck\u201d and \u201cs\u201d vanished in a puff, and the letters \u201ca,\u201d \u201ce,\u201d \u201ci,\u201d \u201co,\u201d \u201cu,\u201d and \u201cy\u201d appeared. These letters made two rows. \u201cA,\u201d \u201co,\u201d and \u201cu\u201d were in one, and the letters \u201ce,\u201d \u201ci\u201d and \u201cy\u201d were the another. \nThe fairy pointed at the two rows of letters and said, \u201cBelieve it or not, it is really these letters that determine in words that begin with a \u2018c,\u2019 if that \u2018c\u2019 sounds like a \u2018k,\u2019 or an \u2018s\u2019.\u201d\nMary did not believe Spella. She wondered how vowels had anything to do with how the letter \u201cc\u201d sounded. However, instead of asking, Mary waited for Spella to go on.\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Spella, as the letters \u201ca,\u201d \u201cc,\u201d \u201co,\u201d and \u201cu\u201d began to glow. \u201cThe letter \u2018c\u2019 has the hard sound \u2018k\u2019 before \u2018a\u2019, \u2018o\u2019 and \u2018u\u2019 as in the words cat, cot, and cut.\u201d\nThe letters \u2018a\u2019, \u2018o\u2019, and \u2018u\u2019 stopped glowing. Spella pointed to the other row of letters, and that started glowing.\nSpella then said, \u201cThe letter \u2018c\u2019 has the soft sound \u2018s\u2019 before \u2018e\u2019, \u2018i\u2019, and \u2018y\u2019 as in the words cent, city, and cyst.\u201d\nSpella clapped her hands and the letters vanished in a puff. The fairy looked at Mary with a large smile on its face. \nMary scratched her head. \u201cThat is kind of confusing.\u201d\n\u201cYes it is sort of confusing,\u201d Spella agreed. \u201cBut English is a hard language with over one-hundred different spelling and grammar rules. For example, the \u2018k\u2019 sound can also be spelled with a \u2018c\u2019, \u2018k\u2019, \u2018ck,\u2019 \u2018ch,\u2019 or \u2018que.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m so stupid!\u201d Mary groaned. \u201cI\u2019m never going to be good at spelling.\u201d\nSpella hovered in front of Mary. \u201cBeing good or bad at spelling has nothing to with being smart or dumb. Now will you let me help you learn to use the letter \u2018C\u2019?\u201d\nMary nodded her head. Through out the night Spella helped Mary understand the rule about using the letter \u2018C\u2019 in the begging of a word. It was not long before the Mary was able to spell words with the letter \u2018C\u2019.\nSpella asked, \u201c How do you spell the word \u2018cart\u2019?\nMary spelled. \u201c C-a-r-t\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Spella cheered. \u201cNow how do you spell the word \u2018city\u2019?\n\u201cC-i-t-y\u201d Mary spelled.\nSpella gave Mary a thumbs-up. \u201cThere see you got it.\u201d\nMary gave Spella a hug. \u201cThank you so much for all of your help, Spella.\u201d\n\u201cThanks are not needed,\u201d Spella said. \u201cI\u2019m a fairy after all, and fairies help people.\u201d  \nSpella signed sadly. \u201cNow I\u2019m sorry to say that I have to go.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure how I\u2019m going to get through school without you. No one has ever tried to help me like you did,\u201d Mary said with tears forming in her eyes. \u201cI wish you could stay and be my friend forever.\u201d\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Spella said. \nSpella clapped her hands again and a card appeared in Mary\u2019s hands.\n\u201cWe will always be friends.\u201d Spella flew in front of Mary\u2019s nose. \u201cIf you ever need any help in spelling or grammar, just do what the card says, and I\u2019ll come.\u201d\nSpella vanished in a puff of smoke and letters. Mary put the card on a table next her bed, lay back down on her bed, and fell a sleep.\nThe next day, Mary woke up thinking the whole thing had been a dream. Then she saw Spella\u2019s card on the table and knew it had happened. She also knew it would not be the last time she would meet her fairy friend Spella, the spelling and grammar fairy.

Now imagine that same near future demands you have the trendiest dating app which requires you to upload your... DNA? A bit intrusive, right? What are the ethical guidelines when it comes to advancement in technology? Where do we draw the line between right vs. wrong? Who\u2019s to say we haven\u2019t crossed it? \nXYXX explores a near future in which one technological innovation alters the lives of lonely singles everywhere. Technology. Reality. Privacy. Identity. Love. These five themes are the backbone of XYXX -- and our team can't wait to tell more of these stories!\nElle (Meredith Shank) downloading XYXX for the first time\nThe Origins\nBack in the fall of 2015, Conor Patrick Hogan and Cory McConnell came up with the idea for XYXX over a case of PBR in a Silver Lake backyard. Conor provided the PBR, Cory provided the Silver Lake backyard. Below you'll find a segment of the original pitch that was drafted from this brainstorming. It's remarkable how little was altered from its core inception. \nA segment of Conor and Cory's first story area, 10/12/15\nOnce the pilot was written, Conor and Cory invited four other writers (Andy Holt, Samantha Levy, Lyz May and Kim Ndombe) into the world of XYXX and fleshed out an entire first season  together. Producers Scott Sullivan, Maija Gustin and Daniel Marks provided instrumental feedback during this period too. Black Mirror was an obvious inspiration in early meetups, with Orphan Black's tonal fluidity and High Maintenance's structural ingenuity providing further assistance with our own series' blueprint. Once the entire first season was written, Conor and Cory reached out to directors and casting directors -- purposefully searching for new, unknown (to them!) accomplices who would challenge their storytelling process and collaborate on ways to make the world of the series even more grand. \nXYXX Casting Session, Spring 2016 [From L to R: Chris Redondo (Casting Director), Morgan Dameron (Director), Cory McConnell (Editor) and Conor Patrick Hogan's fingers (Writer)]\nOnce Morgan Dameron (director) and Chris Redondo (casting director) were aboard, the next few months blurred. Casting bled into VFX trials which bled into production meetings and, finally, 3 days of filming. From the first setup, everyone was aware that our premiere episode's leads -- Meredith Shank and Jim Cummings -- possessed an uncanny chemistry. \nElle (Meredith Shank) first meets Harry (Jim Cummings)\nXYXX was finally a living, breathing thing.\nThen 2 years flew by. Sadly, no one seemed interested in XYXX. So we're moving ahead solo!\nThe Near Future\nXYXX is a near future anthology series that aims to be pro-reality, not anti-technology. By using a black and white tableau for \u2018reality\u2019 and bright, bold colors for \u2018technology\u2019, we plan to ask our audience: just what is truly revered in society now that our screens have become so ubiquitous \u2013 is it true human connection or merely the appearance of said connection? \nHarry (Jim Cummings) previews the XYXX profile of Elle (Meredith Shank)\nWhile this aim may appear grandiose, it\u2019s the subtleties of the separate romances our team plan to delve into that will make this series stand out from any counterparts. Episode 1, a true world-building introduction, delves into what transpires when you begin online dating (for the first time ever!) in our near future world. Episode 2 explores the repercussions when one spouse in a relationship won\u2019t upload their DNA to the questionably invasive app. Finally, Episode 3 tackles a high school senior's blossoming sexuality when it doesn\u2019t necessarily match that of heteronormativity in this brave, new world.\nAs long as XYXX engages an audience enough to make them simply consider the moral quandaries almost on our doorstep -- while also (hopefully!) making them laugh -- the cast and crew will have accomplished their goal. \nElle (Meredith Shank) receives a rather unwelcome text\nThe Plan & Crew\nWith your crowdfunding contribution, the team behind XYXX will shoot Episodes 2 and 3 in the Winter of 2018 and then release all three episodes as Season 1 in the first half of 2019. We're excited to have some new teammates -- Brandon Smithson (director, ep 103) and Leslie Wasserman (casting director) -- with many of our first episode's crew returning too.\nCONOR PATRICK HOGAN (Co-creator / Writer / EP )\nConor Patrick Hogan stayed in the closet way past his expiration date. During his early twenties (while still closeted!) he produced a feature film, Trailerpark, based on the collection of short stories by award-winning author Russell Banks. Once he departed from Ohio (and finally came out!), he moved to LA and worked on various TV shows including Modern Family, Covert Affairs, Banshee, SIX and Chicago Med, where he is currently the script coordinator. Conor's super worried about people casually uploading their DNA to random apps, but that's why he appreciates Cory's perspective on the whole sitch.\nCORY McCONNELL (Co-creator / Editor / EP)\nCory McConnell is a producer and editor living in Los Angeles. XYXX has been a labor of love during time off from his day jobs, including stints at CollegeHumor and The Ringer. He is ambivalent about uploading his DNA to phone apps, but vehemently against the proliferation of electric scooter startups.\nMORGAN DAMERON (Director 101 & 102 / EP)\nMorgan Dameron is an award-winning writer, director and producer who has always blazed her own path. Born in Kansas City, MO, Dameron was awarded the Women in Film and Television in Kansas City\u2019s \u201cTrailblazer Award\u201d for Up and Coming Women in Film while still in high school. She received a full scholarship to the University of Southern California\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts, where she graduated summa cum laude. She has been supported by prestigious programs such as the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, The Caucus for Producers, and Ryan Murphy\u2019s HALF Initiative. Dameron has directed groundbreaking digital series and branded content garnering tens of millions of views. Her first feature film, Different Flowers, received rave reviews during its national theatrical release and can currently be seen on Showtime. Kansas City Women in Film and Television recently bestowed her with the \u201cSpirit of Kansas City\u201d award for her work bringing film production to her hometown and Duke University\u2019s Talent Identification Program recently honored her with the Early Achievement Award. She lives in Los Angeles.\nBRANDON SMITHSON (Director 103)\nBrandon Smithson is a LA-based filmmaker who got his start in entertainment by shooting music videos and fashion shorts in NYC. Some of his previous work includes two music videos for Bob the Drag Queen and a behind-the-scenes short with recording artist Brandy.  In 2016, his digital series Inner Circle garnered international press and was featured in Gay Times. More recently, Brandon serves as creator of the episodic series Fish Tank which takes you on a comedic adventure into the dating lives of two trans women.\nLESLIE WASSERMAN (Casting Director)\nLeslie Wasserman is a casting professional for film and TV. She was recently the Casting Director for Dekkoo Series I\u2019m Fine and Del Close documentary For Madmen Only. Her work includes Cameron Crowe\u2019s Roadies, Strangers 2: Prey at Night and Of Kings and Prophets. Upcoming films include Lady and the Tramp, Mustang, The Devil Has a Name, City of Lies, Four Kids and It, and TV series Shark Lords. Wasserman is also a proud member of The Casting Society of America and has worked with the feature film program at Sundance Labs.\nMore crew announcements to follow during our campaign...!\nElle's ex Dan (Sachin Bhatt) and Elle (Meredith Shank) on a near future photo frame projector\n\u2022 Have any further questions?

Where the story about the time that the wood elf cavalry saved the day, or how the onslaught of the orc hordes could not be stopped. We wanted to create a history with our friends.\"\n  \u2013 Ron Newcomb\nThe Rangers: Rise of War game has been years in the making. This game\u2019s journey began back in 2014 as The Rangers film was being developed. Since 2015 it has been play tested by the creators and gamers to develop and refine the most diverse game play we could provide, a game that we would want to play. Each army offers a diverse makeup and features that add depth and create unique outcomes in game play. The game is set in the high-fantasy world of The Rangers, Adrasil. The Rangers franchise includes several films, as seen on The Fantasy Network, a comic book, and a live-action role playing event, \"Weekend Warrior\u201d.  \nFACTIONS\nHUMANS\nBased in the Kingdom of Olaran, the humans are a young race, divided into the Landwards, who hold power and the Rangers, who are an elite group of warriors that are the eyes and blade of the king. The Human faction is allied to the Wood Elves. Veteran Human units can be upgraded to a Ranger. Human Heroes may inspire the populace of a region to double their production output.\nWOOD ELVES\nThe Elven Lords like to stay to themselves, but during this time of war, the ancients must join the age of man and emerge from the depths of their hidden palaces in the Green Wood or fall under the weight of the Shadow Elves and their Orc hordes to the north. Their alliance with the Humans is tenuous and fraught with suspicion. Wood Elf units possess \u201cswiftness\u201d and may move 2 spaces during their turn. Wood Elf Heroes have a +1 movement and may engage enemy troops at long range with their bow in an adjacent territory during their turn.\nSHADOW ELVES\nThe Elven Lords of the North, known as the Umbran, are an ancient and noble people. Adept in the arts of war and magic, they are fierce in battle though small in number. Their subjugated allies, the Orc hordes, make up for their lack of numbers. Shadow Elf s possess \u201cstealth\u201d and may move 2 spaces during their turn and a +1 initiative to the opening die roll at the start of the game. Umbran can hold +1 additional spell card. Umbran Heroes may strike and retreat in the same turn too on a die roll of 1, 2 or 3. They may also choose to attack with an Orc Horde they are adjacent to.\nORCS\nThe Orc Warlords and their hordes are brutal and vicious in battle. Hordes overrun and crush their enemies by tenacity and sheer weight of their numbers. The Orcs are allied to their masters, the Shadow Elves. Orc warriors cost half as much as all other units. Orcs may choose to pillage a building for half its resources in return. Individual Orc troops may also \u201cberserk\u201d, sacrificing themselves and tripling their attack value for one turn of combat + max unit/region ratio.\nCREATURES\nShould you choose to quest with your Hero, you may find yourself face-to-face with a beast from ancient days. These ancient creatures are difficult to kill and dangerous in a fight.\nSHIPPING\nWe will be handling shipping cost after the campaign. Our goal is for Friendly Shipping worldwide with fulfillment centers and local publishers. Each of these countries (US, Canada, Europe, Australia/NZ, Asia) we plan to send bulk shipments to fulfillment partners paying VAT and fulfilling more directly.

Forget diplomacy\u2014humanity\u2019s presence in space is focused solely on seizing exoplants and extracting their resources. The ships of the Coalition are interstellar company towns, run by indifferent AIs and designed to keep their crews in constant debt. Inequality is rampant\u2014if you\u2019re wearing a red crew shirt, life sucks: you\u2019re overworked in hazardous conditions while under constant surveillance and living on top of one another. And you have to pay for your own health care. And the whole time, the smirking officers are telling you the only reason you\u2019re not enjoying the good life is because you\u2019ve chosen to stay poor. So, nothing at all like the world today.\nAfter surviving fifteen years in a red shirt, Webb is nearly burned out. She joined up like any starry-eyed kid did: to get her own ship. But that\u2019s never going to happen\u2014not now that the officers loathe her for being the crew\u2019s elected (and powerless) representative, even as she\u2019s trying to break out of the enlisted ranks herself. But rank has little to do with leadership, and hers will be put to the test when the starship Independence collides saucer-first with with a threat they\u2019re completely unprepared for: aliens that don\u2019t look like us.* When the ship\u2019s social order breaks down from a truly alien threat, it\u2019s falls to Webb to save the crew, the ship\u2014and herself.\n*You can have sex with most aliens.

A lot of the art in these rules is placeholders and we're still tinkering with fonts and backdrops for legibility purposes, but the content is the current iteration of the rules.\nJuly 5 - The first review is in! In German. However, you can read the somewhat amusing Google translation of it here.\nKilling Lee Garvin? Huh?\nKilling Lee Garvin (KLG for short) is a game with a mission. To make fun of the improbable yet inevitable mortality of game designer Lee Garvin (Tales from the Floating Vagabond, Badass Zombie Killers, etc.), which hopefully is quite a few years off. And also because on his way there he has racked up a lot of medical bills that he feels honor-bound to pay while simultaneously faced with the problem of doing so on what you can make as an indie game designer. And the minor distraction of being evicted and living in his car for the past several months. So, with the assistance of cartoonist Ron Leishman (co-creator of Captain Canuck), I'm trying to help Lee out a bit.\nGreg: Being a board/card/rpg game designer is creatively wonderful, but sucks in a lot of other respects. Publishing is already a low-income zone with no job security and negligible benefits, and game design is a ghetto within that zone.\nAnd if you are an independent game designer, it can be even tougher. Lee Garvin is a friend and like me, an indie, but unlike me, life has not been kind to him. In the sense that \"being in an accident, going into a coma and waking up medically bankrupt\" is \"not been kind\".\nAmong other things. Lee has endured a laundry list of improbable bad luck events that would make a good script for a slapstick version of Final Destination.\nBecause I'm a game designer, I see everything as having game potential, so I humorously told Lee I should make a game about killing him off. And the more I thought about it, the more it actually started to make sense...\nAnd so, Killing Lee Garvin was born... At the time I started work on this, Lee still had a roof over his head and the project was meant to just help with his medical bills, but as his life circumstances took a more...outdoors turn, the focus has turned to helping him first get that roof (any roof) back, so that he can try to do all the things those of us with roofs take for granted.\nLee: I wasn't entirely sure Greg was serious about doing this at first, but I should have guessed; he made a game about stalking slasher victims (which I have played quite a bit). And for the record, It wasn't an accident that put me into the coma; it was the doctors who were trying to get me to breathe after I got pneumonia. The accident was a different time.\nBut to give an example of where the cards are coming from, long ago, in an age known as \"The '80s\", I was a Boy Scout (Go Troop 35!). While at one of our troop cookouts, the guys were spread out all over the grounds of the church that served as the host for most of our events. Being Scouts, we were naturally very curious about nature. Being Boys, we were reckless and quite foolish in our endeavors. Being the '80s, safety had not yet been invented. Some of my fellow scouts were expressing their curiosity towards nature by whacking a wasps' nest in a tree with a long stick. I was walking from around the other side of the building at the time, so naturally, I turned the corner just as they knocked the nest out of the tree, and it hit the ground, and all the wasps in the world flew into my open mouth. I really, really wish I could say that was the worst pain I have ever experienced.\nIf one accepts the \"many worlds\" theory of alternate realities, I died in 437 of them. But this being the 1980s, and my father being from Texas, as long as the kid could breathe and no bones were visible, he saw no reason to get medical professionals involved.  \nBut I did get ice cream.\nLife-threatening calamities and ice cream. The Lee Garvin story...\nGoals?\nGreg: KLG has a few simple goals. Be a good, hilarious game. Help out Lee. The latter part is simple. After the production costs are taken into account, Lee gets half. And this is not Hollywood accounting. Lee gets most of his projected cut as fast as I can cut the check after the Kickstarter ends. And if it is funded with time to spare, I'll write as much as I can out of my own account, just to give him a head start. And the more people we get on board, the lower the production cost is per game. So, the more people that want to kill Lee, the better off he ends up. I'm not exactly sure how the karma math works on that one, however...\nLee: One thing I want to make crystal clear is that, yes, I am in a bad way (hell, I'm sleeping in my car right now), but I am not alone, and there are others who have it worse than me. So yes, I will be using some of the money from this project to dig myself out of the hole I'm in, but a full 50% of it, I intend to donate to the Jack Vasel Memorial Fund. This is an organization that has already helped me quite a bit, so I just want to return the favor. They exist to do nothing but help Gaming Professionals who have hit hard times.\nAbout the game\nKLG is a simple 3-6 player game that hides a significant amount of strategy and backstabbing. There are two ways to win. First, you can \"heal\" Lee and you win. Second, you can manipulate someone else into killing Lee and if you have the best game position at that time, you win. So, you can be a good guy and save him, or a bastard who engineers and then takes advantage of his untimely demise...\nIt's a single-deck game, with 54 cards and a bunch of tokens in three colors for representing Lee's health. Cards are simple. They have a number, a color and a type (Harm or Help). Every round you choose from a selection of face-up cards to add to your hand, play cards secretly and reveal them. Harm cards give Health tokens to other players, Help cards put tokens back in the common pool. If you get too many tokens of a particular color, Lee becomes an ex-game designer and it will all be your fault. You are a bad person and Lee's ghost will haunt you. Even if it was another player who gave you the tokens that made you lose. It's pretty easy to end the game by bringing about Lee's untimely demise, but to win you also have to have the best board position when that happens. Not so easy. So you may have to work very hard to keep him healthy...right up to the moment where you push him in front of a bus.\nBut you can also make deals involving the cards. And break them. You do not know exactly what other players are holding, but you do know who has what tokens and what will trigger the end of the game. So, the deals you make and the order in which they resolve is an important part of each round. So, cards are revealed and the round leader (player 1) says \u201cHey player 4, I won't hit you with the Squirrels if you don't Mug me\u201d, and player 4 says \u201cSure thing!\u201d Of course, since player 1 does their action first, player 4 does not have to abide by the deal, but they will. This time. \nAnd whoever is the current round leader has to narrate Lee's life events using the revealed cards for that round. So player 1 looks at the cards and says: \n\"Lee compensated for the stresses of GenCon with a regular cardio workout. But while jogging in the park one morning he was mugged and beaten. And then the squirrels found him...\u201d\nKLG gameplay video\nPLAY\n\nA game of KLG takes ten to thirty minutes to play, and strategy really depends on who you are playing with. People who are trying to win by healing Lee will have a different strategy than those trying to bring about his premature end, and how you play depends on how many of each type of player are in your game. But you are simultaneously playing against the table (the state of tokens and their distribution) and against the other players (what are they trying to do, and to whom?). \nStretch Goals \n$15,000: The basic game\nNot really a stretch goal. This covers the production, art, the Kickstarter cut and enough room to get Lee some money. The base funding level is not low-balling it in expectation we will blow through it. It is a realistic number so that if we reach, Lee gets some help. Given the fixed costs like art (most of the cards are custom caricatures of Lee), this is the minimum level to make the game happen.\n$20,000: Custom meeple\nThe \"first player\" meeple in KLG denotes who gets first pick of cards and deal-making opportunities each round. If we get $20,000 in pledges, we will have a custom meeple made that is an embarrassing caricature of Lee Garvin. My personal preference would be him looking like an out-of-shape Bane (admit it, he's meeple-shaped), but if we reach this goal, Lee will be browbeaten into supplying some pictures and people can vote on their favorite in the comments section.\n$35,000: Quality upgrade \nThe base level of the project turns a profit, but is a short run game and much of the cost is the artwork and the higher cost per game for short run printing. The $35,000 level is the minimum for getting a large print run from China. The lower cost per unit means we can upgrade the quality of everything. Cards, box, tray liner, rules, the works.\nIt's a big jump from $15,000 to $35,000, but depending on the printer I'm pretty sure we will be able to get a useful \"printed in China\" price for some level of pledges north of $15k but less than $35k. We are going to provide the best quality available for whatever level of pledges we do get, but this stretch goal guarantees we can go for the best. You're spending $25 on the game, we want it to look and feel like a good value for the money (in addition to repeat play value for the money).\n$50,000: Organ tokens. Instead of the normal colored bits that are the health tokens, we will spring for the cost of custom blue brain, green lung and red heart tokens to represent Lee's health.\nLaser-guided Chainsaw Add-on!\nOne of Lee's game designs is a cheesy little non-collectable card game called Badass Zombie Killers (or BZK), where the game is about preparing for the zombie apocalypse, having the coolest and most vicious gear, and the game ends when the zombies actually show up. You can download an image of the rules cards from this link.\nNow, unlike Lee who is living in his car in Colorado, the irony is that the remaining stock of BZK actually has a roof over its head in Virginia, close enough to where I am to go get them. So, if you've every wanted a copy of BZK and saw that it is out of stock on Amazon and ThinkGeek, this is your way to get one. So, with the cooperation of Reality Cheque and Skortch'd Urf, this game of prepper one-upmanship can now be yours! Just add $17 to your (US-only) pledge for KLG and we will ship them both at the same time. The $17 covers the BZK and the extra cost for shipping, since we will have to go from a First Class 12oz box to a flat rate Priority Mail box.\nHobo Capitalism Add-On!\nMatt Vancil suggested something to Lee after the \"hobo knife\" picture was posted in Update #23, and the following is entirely Lee's doing. I claim no credit for it. There is now a \"Hobo Capitalism\" add-on in this campaign. For US$10, a US backer will get an official Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 (as seen in Update #23), an autographed picture of Lee holding a knife that is probably not yours (much nicer than the picture below but no guarantee he will look any more sane), and in a hat-tip to Munchkin, a special rule for Badass Zombie Killers that can only be utilized by the rightful owner of said knife. This add-on price includes postage in the US. So, you can add this to any game pledge and it will be sent to you directly from Lee's high-tech manufacturing facility, which will probably be the front seat of his 2008 Saturn.\nThe official Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 has a number of unique features*. It can be smuggled through metal detectors! Each one is hand-crafted by Lee himself and will have its own unique character. It has trace amounts of Lee's DNA in case you need to leave it at a crime scene to confuse the forensic team. And in an emergency it can be disassembled to give you several feet of duct tape.\n*Due to variances in the manufacturing process, the ability of the Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 to cut anything tougher than a McDonalds pancake is not guaranteed. This product not endorsed by the SHA (Stabby Hobo Association).\nAnd here, for the second time anywhere! The tentative official Badass Zombie Killers Hobo Knife\u2122 Rule \nIf you have an authentic Lee Garvin Hobo Knife\u2122 in your possession, you may do the following once per game. Discard 4 Badassery worth of Weapon cards or Modifier cards from your hand (that is, the total Badassery value or bonus of the cards must add up to at least positive 4) into the Dumpster. Whip out your Hobo Knife\u2122 and Shank one opponent's character.  \nTo Shank, you must choose one of that character's special abilities, and place the blade of the Hobo Knife\u2122 so that it covers it completely. That ability is not available for use for as long as the blade remains lodged in the character (until dislodged by a special effect). At the end of the game, the Hobo Knife\u2122 is returned to its owner. Don't make them come over there.\nShipping\nGames will be shipped in the US by First Class or Priority Mail (depending on whether they top 12 ounces with the stretch goals), and tracking numbers will be available.  \nSame as USA, just a little more expensive. \nEU-bound games will ship from the EU to avoid Customs charges and will go via regular mail within the EU.  \nAustralia-bound games will depend on the level of funding. At the low end they will be shipped via an intermediary service, while if we get into stretch goal territory we can probably use a normal fulfillment center. \nIf you are backing this project from Mars, we will arrange to have your package put on the next available manned flight (losing the entire shipment we shoehorned into the Schiaparelli lander soured us on automated interplanetary delivery options). Kickstarter does not have Mars in their system so contact us privately for shipping cost. Due to Customs restrictions, we cannot ship to the Moon or other planets at this time. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter (third if you count collaborations), and the fourth that Lee has started or been a collaborator on, so while we are not \"veterans\", we have some experience with the process. But this one has the potential to be significantly bigger than previous ones. The project goal is modest and will turn a profit that can go to help Lee, but if it exceeds its goals by a lot, then the scaling goes from \"domestic short run printing\" to \"seafreight container from China\", and from \"local pack & ship\" to \"hire a fullfillment service\". The numbers have been run for both cases and work out, and give sufficient wiggle room for stretch goals. However, I do want to avoid \"stretch goal creep\", since I've seen over-promising on other projects, and overly ambitious stretch goals also cause significant production delays.\n\nFortunately, I have a friend in the gaming industry (Mark Walker of Flying Pig Games (look his projects up)) who is both local and has significant experience with Chinese printers and domestic and international fulfillment operations. So in the unlikely event this explodes like kittens, I'm sure there will be headaches, but the headaches will be manageable. And if worst comes to worst, I can always blame it on Lee... (Lee: Hey!)\n\nThe timeframe from \"end of Kickstarter\" to \"game in your hands\" is going to vary based on how successful it is. The moment the minimum threshold is reached, the art will be contracted and the artist is ready to go on it. If it reaches a \"China production\" threshold, we have several possible suppliers and will have to choose one, and if we hit the top tier for custom game pieces, this will probably add a little to the production time as well. Of course, if we hit these thresholds with time to spare it means we can get them underway even before the campaign ends. One thing that will be a delay at the high end is that seafreight will take about a month, compared to domestic short-run printing that would take a few weeks from printing to delivery. My best guess at this point is \"on time or sooner\" for a barely funded campaign to \"a month or two late\" for one with all the stretch goals, but the benefit of the latter is a much nicer looking product (and more money going towards Lee's medical bills). The listed delivery date is an intermediate value, and if you have funded other campaigns you know how that goes.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Nice guy", "descp": "You just want to help out, because you're a nice guy.

You do not realize the gradual insinuation of high-ish speed net access until it is gone. I used to be able to work from a 14.4k dialup connection. Of course, web pages were optimized for low speed connections and there was not nearly as much to surf, and I relied much more on my extensive reference library of dead-tree books rather than doing some quick google-fu to get an answer. And I would go to an actual library if needed. I still have my old Library of Congress 'go back into the stacks and rummage around pass' as a souvenir of those days. This has been an eye opener. I get .25mb on a good day and live in a cell tower blind spot, so my predicament would probably be murder-inducing to someone who relied on high speed net and good mobile phone coverage.

Running a webseries is time-consuming and expensive, we want to keep making great content for teachers, kids, and parents but we can\u2019t do it without you!\nWHO DOES QKS PARTNER WITH? \nTeddy and I have collaborated with a handful of LGBTQ+ influencers and organizations. Here are a few highlights <3\nWho is part of Queer Kid Stuff Team?\nLindsay Amer - Creator, Writer, Editor, and Host \nLindsay Amer is a queer activist, artist, and storyteller.

Her work has appeared across the internet, in publications such as Bustle, Autostraddle, and Allure. When she isn\u2019t directing Queer Kid Stuff she can be found hanging on a trapeze, talking loudly about feminism, and hunting for the perfect fried chicken sandwich. Also, she is very gay.\nMeghan McCarter - Make Up Artist/Stylist \nMeghan is an advocate for inclusive education through the dissolution of barriers-to-entry at all levels. This begins with community-based action that equips educators, parents, and students with the tools they need when they need them, without precondition. Mostly she does that by making Lindsay look really handsome on a semi-monthly basis but, when she's not doling out fleek brows, she also tutors primary and secondary school students and runs a weekly queer-oriented drink & draw in Bushwick.\nEmmie Finkle - Production Designer \nEmmie Finckel is a New York based scenic and properties designer specializing in new work and immersive/sensory design.

When we shared a demo of our early work (well, hobby) on Imgur and Reddit, the community response was so positive and energizing that we decided we should commit full-time. The footage you see in the video above is the result of our preliminary work, and we're dying to dig in and upgrade literally every feature you see. This Kickstarter, we're asking you to join us to help make truly fine and fun augmented reality & dragons.\nFresh and warm, straight from the egg\nTo bring augmented monsters and heroes to life, we\u2019re using token-based augmented reality. Each token you place and move around your table is transformed into beautifully animated creatures and cravens (or heroes, if you're the sort). In the final version, the QR-coded cards from the demo will be replaced with polished, professional tokens that add to your tabletop roleplaying experience.\nYour one-inch tokens will come in four varieties: print-and-cut, grayboard, ceramic, and engraved wood. To move your characters and beasties through space, you simply move the tokens through a scalable grid that AR&D will generate for you.\nPrototype ceramic tokens\nPrototype wooden inlay tokens\nHero breeding and cultivation is perhaps the best part of tabletop RPGs. Our first core feature is a comprehensive character creator. From within AR&D you'll be able to summon and customize exactly the right hero for your adventure, stick him on a token, and bring him to animated, living-and-breathing augmented life. Want an Elven archer, an Orc cleric, or a Half-demon barbarian? Pick what speaks to you, gear them up, and make them kiss we mean take them on adventures.\nA mockup of the character creator\nAR&D will let you choose from the classic mythological races like Human*, Orc, Elf, Demon-touched, Dwarf, Lizardman, Halfling, Half-giant, and Gnome. Regardless of which you choose, you can customize their natural variations, put them in clown makeup, and select from epic sets of armor and gear to complete the ensemble. (*mythical human, naturally).\nYour new character, ready to murder hobo his way into infamy\nWithin AR&D will be your very own monster farm. Summon up mesmerizing art and captivatingly sculpted monsters that can breathe fire, fly, burrow, and generally end your player characters' dreams. Most of our next months will be dedicated to building up armies of Very Bad Dudes for all of us to play with. On first pass, there will be 25 unique, animated, resizable monsters ready at launch, with more if we hit our stretch goals or find ways to extend out the day/night cycle.\nTo make the library of baddies truly endless, other stretch goals will make it possible for you to upload 3D files you create or find on your own. You could 3D scan yourself and be your own character class! One of us already turned himself into a playable lvl 13 Coward, complete with wooden cart, cabbages, and despair. It\u2019s a prestige class for Peasant, in case you'd like to roll one yourself.\nTo build the best version of AR&D that we can, we'll need you. While we've already had a ton of fun playing around with early versions, we want your help in making a lasting, rich, and robust play experience. As we finish up testable chunks of design, we'll be counting on you to play with us. Long before the final version is issued, your job will be to tell us all the ways in which it breaks, or better yet all the ways in which we can make it shine.\nOur stretch goals will help define how far you all want us to push AR&D. The more bells we ring, the better AR&D will be on release. Also the louder the bells will be.\nWe'll add the ability for you to upload any 3D file you create or download for use in your games. You can share models with friends, scan yourself, or we'll point you in the direction of some open-source libraries to dive into. By making it possible to use your own files, you'll have limitless flexibility in bringing your campaigns to life.\nWith the shared tabletop feature, you can remotely see and interact with the same table your friends are using. You could move your character behind cover in Vermont and your friends in Texas would see it happen right in front of them. You'll have to trust your DM that the Gorgon really was staring your escort in the face the whole time.\nWe'll create a fully integrated character sheet for you to use in-game.

Rampaging LG Unicorns, here we come!\nOur milestones for this Kickstarter are already quite ambitious, so we'll only unlock further stretch goals if we hit all of our first targets.\nWe love Kickstarter, and we love the enthusiasm Kickstarter backers bring to a project. We need a big community of vocal RPG fans to help propel this project forward.\nSome of you may wonder why the funding threshold is set so high. Well, we have huge plans for AR&D, and we're setting ourselves on a course for the next year and a half. We want to make something enduring and worthy of your support. To complete a project that lives up to our hopes and dreams will take everything we've got; half-way simply won't do.\nElder Labs was started by Dan, one of the cofounders of Elderwood Academy. We've always been passionate about fantasy tabletop gaming, and when we first saw augmented reality in action our hearts stopped. Elder Labs' mission is to use the awesome promise of augmented reality to bring tabletop RPGs to life. If you ever want to reach out and say \"hello\" or an awkwardly friendly \"HELLO!\" please hit us up at info@AugmentedDungeons.com.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny Kickstarter, big or small, is at its heart a labor of love, collaboration, and madness. We're no different from any other creators in that regard; we depend on your help and shared love to bring something new to life. There are universal challenges to all Kickstarters and Dan, via Elderwood Academy, has been integral in five successful campaigns.\n\nThe biggest challenges of this project are twofold. First, we need to build a product that is seamlessly fun to use while playing tabletop RPGs. While we love playing with the demo, we're certain there are extensive opportunities to make it more fun for everyone.\n\nSecond, we're basically trying to create an MMORPG's worth of digital assets from the ground up, to be optimized for iOS and Android and serve you the most attractive digital garden of animated monsters and heroes ever. We've lined up everything we need to get it done, but it's no mean feat, and half done will probably mean undone. To help insure against that, we've set the funding level high to cover the absolute costs we expect to incur over the next year.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Elder Labs\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nElder Labs was founded by Elderwood Academy co-founder Dan.

But your friends took a peek and now they all want to grow their own god. You\u2019ve got your trusty twelve-gauge handy to blast a tentacle here and there and make sure your creature grows to completion first. To do otherwise would be madness!\n  Building An Elder God is a fast-playing card game of Lovecraftian construction for 2-5 players ages 8 and up. The rules are easy to learn and a typical game takes from 15-30 minutes, depending on the number of players. Build a Cthulhu-esque tentacled monstrosity to completion before the other players, using damage cards to blast your opponents\u2019 creatures (and slow down their progress) in order to win! There are 115 standard cards in the set, plus 10 Necronomicon pieces. A full-color rulebook is included.\nGameplay: Draw a card, play a card. You either choose a tentacle card to grow or heal your own beast, or play a damage card to blast off the tentacle of an opponent's monster. The Necronomicon and Elder Sign pieces provide additional options to heal yourself or punish your foes!\nThe game is complete, and in fact sold through its first printing a few years ago! We're running this crowdfunding campaign to bring Building An Elder God back to gamer shelves and into stores while making a higher-quality product the second go-around.\nWhat's Changed? We are making sure the stock and coating will make the cards sturdy yet easy to handle and shuffle right out of the box. The Head and Body cards now have alternate sides so that everyone's monster can look unique at the table. The Necronomicon pieces are now punch-out cardstock rather than cards the players are expected to cut themselves. And we've done a light rewrite of the rules for clarity and are printing them in full color.\n  Building An Elder God got a shout-out as Best Kids Game of 2011 in episode #239 of The Dice Tower podcast by Chris of The Secret Cabal.

In addition I have run three Kickstarter campaigns in the past\u2014all funded, and all shipped out the primary rewards to backers. But I discovered how easy it can be to underestimate the time and expense necessary to deliver stretch goals and secondary rewards. It's important to avoid those pitfalls, so I'm implementing the following for this campaign:\n\nSimplicity: It's tempting to chase a high-dollar total by adding lots of stretch goals and extra rewards. Being a one-man company working with a talented-but-busy freelance artist, I'm going to keep the focus on the core game. We may add a few stretch goals but they will likely be digital rewards or improvements to the core product.\n\nTransparency: I'm separating the funds from this crowdfunding campaign in a separate account, and will create a backer-accessible spreadsheet that shows each expenditure and explains what the funds are being used for. This will remain live until all rewards have been shipped.\n\nThe only delays to delivery I can foresee would include unexpected hold-ups from the printer, overseas shipping, or delay in customs when the product enters the United States. We've built-in some time to help account for those and give us enough resources to get things shipped to our backers!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jamie Chambers\n5 created \u00b7 137 backed\nJamie Chambers is an award-winning, best-selling tabletop game designer with nearly two decades of publishing experience.

The Altered:Nozzle is the worlds most extreme water saving nozzle. It installs easily into your existing tap. By atomizing water we can use 98% less water and still retain full functionality. And if you need a little more, then you switch to our regular saving mode. Still 75% savings, but all the water you need.\nMist & Save Mode\nFits into your existing tap.  \nSuper easy installation. 30 sec.\nPays for itself in a couple of months! \nMultiple finishes and sizes.   \nLead Free Eco Brass\nPerfect for kitchen and bathroom taps everywhere. In your home, your boat, at the office, in your vacation home or wherever you have a tap and want to save water.  \nWater stress is a truly global issue affecting over one billion people today, and an estimated 3 billion in 2020. It is a problem we need to do something about. This is our small contribution to this huge issue.\nPLAY\n\nThe old solution for saving water has been to restrict the flow of water. But that only works up to a point. When you're left with only a drizzle, you need a shift in technology. We looked at the problem from another perspective. Instead of restricting water, we wanted to use as much of the water coming out of the tap as possible. The issue with regular taps is that you only use a fraction of the water coming out of your faucet. It bounces of the surface of your hands or plates. Or even worse, it just passes right by and straight down the drain.\nPLAY\n\nWhen atomizing the water we break it up into millions of tiny droplets. Creating a high speed, heavy mist, shooting out of your tap. This increases the surface area of the water drastically and makes it possible for you to come in contact with almost all of the water coming out of your tap. \nPLAY\n\nThe result was even more extreme than we thought. We could have full functionality in washing hands, greens, doing dishes, brushing teeth etc, with only 2% of the water compared to a standard saving tap!\nOne big issue. 2% is not so great when it takes 2 minutes to fill a glass of water. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve developed a switch to a more regular Saving Mode. You still save 75% compared to your old tap, but you get all the water you need. Perfect for filling glasses, pots and pans.\nPLAY\n\nBeing good to the environment should not have to mean being bad at design. The faucet is part of our interior design, something we spend a lot of money on. So if it doesn\u2019t look good sitting at the end of your tap, then it\u2019s just going to end up in some drawer. And there it won\u2019t do much good at all.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve spent a lot of time on the design of the Altered:Nozzle. We wanted it to stand out and make a statement, but at the same time it needed to look as an integrated part on a variety of different faucets. Finally we ended up with this drop shape. It clearly makes a visual statement at the same time as it makes it easy to switch between Mist and Saver Mode. \nFirst of all we think you should feel great about having saved the planet a bunch of water. But lets talk specifics. Even compared to the lowest limit of the Water Sense US standard, the Altered:Nozzle saves you up to 98%. And except for saving water, that means less energy and emissions to heat and transport the water. That is great for planet Earth. But it is also great for you. For an average household in Europe this translates to savings of \u20ac203/year. In US that number is around $255/year. Basically, you\u2019ve just bought a great looking product that pays for itself within a couple of months.\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign we will contact you so you can choose the finish and size you like for your very own Altered:Nozzle.The Altered:Nozzle will be available in the finishes below.\nIf you think it is difficult measuring your existing aerator, you can easily determine the size with the help of a nickel and dime. First remove the insert and washer from the inside of the aerator. Set a nickel on top of the aerator, and if it\u2019s almost the same circumference, the aerator is a regular size. If it\u2019s not a regular size aerator, use a dime. The dime will fit inside a junior size aerator and will sit on top of a Tom Thumb size aerator. \nThe Altered:Nozzle fits into your existing tap and it takes less than 30 seconds to change it.\nPLAY\n\nApproximately 18% of the water used in our homes is water running through our taps. That is equivalent to 32 gallons per household per day. If we do the math and look at some of the most water stressed cities in the world, that means: 40 million gallons running through the taps in Los Angeles, 50 million gallons in Rio de Janeiro, 220 million in Tokyo and 240 million gallons in Shanghai. \nEvery Day.\nAnd most of it straight down the drain.\nThere are already millions of faucets in the world. That\u2019s why we've developed the Altered:Nozzle to easily install into your existing faucet in just 30 seconds. By altering your existing faucet, rather than buying a whole new one, we get the same effect at a fraction of the cost. It also means lots and lots more people can buy our product. And that in turn means we can save a lot more water which is kind of the point. Saving money. Saving resources. Saving water. Sounds good to us!\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since Kaj first got the idea of atomizing water in the faucet. We have a final product, produced by the final manufacturer and we have come out and met the market. It has really been a long road, but we are so excited to finally get the Altered:Nozzle out to you. We believe that water is a basic human right. We must find ways to get clean water to all people in the world. It is not enough just saving water. We must find ways of only using exactly what we need. That\u2019s what the Altered:Nozzle is about. We also think water stress is such a huge issue that we must find many small solutions in order to have a chance to solve the problem. It\u2019s not a single solution problem. This is our small solution. We hope you love it as much as we do.\nMikael, Kaj and Johan\nWe have a small core team of founders who are all experienced professionals in various fields. We also have partnerships with established contract manufacturers and parts producers, both locally in Sweden and abroad. \n\nProf. Kaj Mickos \u2013 Inventor & Head of R&D Prof. in Innovation Technique. Has worked as a professional inventor for numerous years resulting in 14 companies and more than 30 individual patents.

We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, and have now just finished up production on Mythica 4 and 5, thanks to the generous backing of our community of fans.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes, Mythica 2: The Darkspore and Mythica 3: The Necromancer have been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers. Mythica 4: The Iron Crown digital rewards have been delivered, and physical rewards are currently being manufactured.\nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 5: The Godslayer - the final, and definitely the most epic Mythica film yet!\nYou can learn more about Mythica at: http://www.MythicaMovie.com\nOr join the Mythica fan group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/531601233681817/\nIf you missed the first four Mythica films and want to get them right away, you can order digital downloads here:\nhttp://watch.arrowstormentertainment.com/\nYou can order Blurays and DVDs here:\nhttps://mythica4.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Godslayer\nAs the Lich King's zombie legions ravage the world, a cursed young sorceress (Marek) embarks on a quest to obtain a weapon from the gods, with her friend Dagen, a self-serving half-elf rogue. But when she joins her sworn enemy in a desperate attempt to save the world, she must recover the good in herself before her friends are all dead, and defeat the Lich King before the gods are destroyed and the world forever enslaved.\nWatch the trailers for the first four Mythica films below!\n          Melanie Stone plays Marek, an escaped slave and natural-born necromancer. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, Riot, and Miracle Maker.\nKristian Nairn plays Tek, God of the Forge. Kristian is from Northern Ireland, and is a real-life giant, standing 6'11\" tall. He is a world-renowned DJ and actor, best known for his role as Hodor in Game of Thrones.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his long-awaited appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew's voice. He is also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and just DM'd for no less than Vin Diesel. Not too shabby.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known to his scifi and fantasy fans for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars, Once I was a Beehive and Dudes and Dragons.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series. You can see her in the upcoming TV series, Age of the Living Dead.\nThe film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all under way. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, lots of magic, giant CGI sets, armies, etc. We want this finale of Mythica to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\nYou may have noticed, we really stepped up the VFX game in Mythica 4, all because of your contributions. We want to really take it to the next level now, and are confident we can blow you away if you give us a chance.\nBackers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $85,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $85,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better! PLUS, our films release at all different times around the world. Our Kickstarter backers usually get to see the finished product months ahead of the general public.\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution. We love fantasy and science fiction and know there are others out there like us, who we aim to please.\nWe've done several films on Kickstarter in the past - including The Crown and the Dragon, Osombie, The Shadow Cabal, Orc Wars, Survivor, The Christmas Dragon and Mythica 1 - 4, and most of our supporters keep coming back, which means we're doing something right :)\nClick on a name to see our IMDB profiles:\nJason Faller - Writer/Executive Producer\nKynan Griffin - Writer/Executive Producer\nJohn Lyde - Director\nJennifer Griffin - Producer\nYou can learn more about our film-making philosophy and purchase our past projects on our website:\nwww.arrowstormentertainment.com\n$110,000 - MYTHICA BOARDGAME\nIf we reach $110,000 you will unlock the creation of an awesome Mythica boardgame, that will be available as an add-on in Backerkit.\n$400,000 - MYTHICA PREQUEL\nThis is an ambitious one, but let's all dream a bit. If we reach $400,000 in pledges, we will make a Mythica Prequel, featuring backstory's of your favorite characters. How did Marek meet Gojun? What was Dagen up to before he was an adventurer? What were Teela and Caeryn up to? Hammerhead? Gojun? Thane?

As Luna, you\u2019ll solve devious puzzles and battle monsters with your arsenal of mystical potions. With a little help from your grandmother (a powerful witch in her own right), you\u2019ll explore enchanted lands inspired by your favorite fairy tales \u2013 often with an unexpected twist!\nAs powerful as your potions are, you\u2019ll find yourself up against monsters that can shrug off your most powerful attacks. You\u2019ll have to think on your feet and act quickly to sidestep danger. Manage your resources carefully, or you may find yourself with an empty satchel when you need your elixirs most. \nEver wonder what happened after Miss Muffet was frightened off her tuffet?\n\"Put the kettle to the meddle.\"\nConflict resolution that goes beyond pure combat\u2014calm, charm, tame and scare your enemies\nStrategic combat\u2014use potions, the environment, and even other monsters to defeat your enemies\nQuirky storyline featuring rich characters from folklore around the world \u2013 all with a unique spin\nCrafting system that rewards experimentation\nCountless environments to adventure and search for rare ingredients\nResource management, with a vast number of potions and ingredients\nLuna\u2014Your resident witch-in-training and strong, female lead\nBeautiful, illustrated art style reminiscent of your favorite storybooks and animated tales\n\"Potions: A Curious Tale is a wonderfully charming visual delight that promises a tongue-in-cheek storyline and lovely characters.

Fun!\"\nCombat is fast-paced, non-linear, and highly customizable. Set your own play style with the potions you use and the way you choose to face threats. Go full-throttle with an arsenal of deadly potions that burn enemies to ashes, or drop a confetti bomb and escape before they can blink. \nPotions\u2019 effects can work together, allowing for powerful combinations of different attacks. They can also trigger helpful and deadly reactions in the environment. \nTiming is key, any pause taken in battle to throw one of your potions leaves you vulnerable as your enemies barrel down upon you. You\u2019ll have to time attacks just right to take down tougher enemies. All potions are friendly-fire, so be careful where you point that incendiary vial! \nSome creatures will even need to be coaxed by other methods to share their goods. You must think carefully about which monsters to engage with and which to avoid or trick. Sometimes, using your enemies against each other is the most efficient solution. \nGet too carried away fighting and you\u2019ll use up your precious potions and have to re-arm before your next adventure. \n\"Every problem... has a solution.\"\nOn Luna\u2019s path to master potion brewing, she must gather rare ingredients to craft new potions. While her grandmother will teach her some potion recipes, most recipes must be discovered through experimentation with ingredients. \nEach ingredient has descriptive text that hints towards its potential use. These descriptions, along with additional hints from characters in the game, can lead Luna to craft undiscovered recipes. \nLuckily, Luna also learns from her failures. So, while an unsuccessful experiment may ruin her ingredients, it also provides her insight that will lead to the discovery of new recipes as her skills grow.\nIf she\u2019s just refilling her potion satchel, Luna can use her trusty recipe book, where she records all of her previous concoctions. \nLuna must manage her potion supplies by avoiding unwanted trouble and exploring to find ingredients for recipes, or go out and hunt exotic monsters to gather rare ingredients for experimentation! \nEnchanted creatures, large and small, dwell in the forests, caves and mountains around Old Haven. Some are harmless or even benevolent. Others are licking their chops at the prospect of having a lovely young witch for supper.\nEach creature in the Deep Dark Forest has its own strengths and weaknesses. While your potions of flame may burn spiders to ash, they\u2019ll have little impact on the lava-loving salamander. Think of each creature you encounter as a tiny puzzle, with abilities, vulnerabilities, and behaviors you can exploit to your strategic advantage (and monetary gain).\nAlthough many monsters hold the ingredients you need to brew more powerful potions, most will be reluctant to part with them. Some may be persuaded by force, others by charm, still others by guile. It\u2019s up to you to brave the wilderness while using tricks, cunning, and an arsenal of arcane connections to win the components you\u2019ll need to become a potions master.\nA good witch chooses her battles wisely! Remember, not every creature needs to be defeated, and picking the wrong fight may be the difference between being the cook and being the meal.\n\"Go stir crazy!\"\nNot only will your wits and potions help you with the monsters you encounter on your adventures, they will also be key to solving the countless puzzles strewn across the lands. Some obstacles will need a special potion to pass, while others will require creative problem solving to unlock their secrets! \nHidden items are scattered all over this mystical land, so don\u2019t be surprised if any rock or thicket conceals a hidden artifact or ancient potion recipe forgotten over the ages. Even your talks with characters can unveil important pearls of wisdom. \nLuna lives in a world inspired by fairy tales and folklore from around the globe, from African folklore to Western nursery rhymes. Luna's wit and intellect help her overcome challenges posed by these enchanted lands. However, in her quest to become a Potions Master, she also learns important coming-of-age lessons in the tongue-in-cheek story line. Respect is earned, advice can be deceiving, and adults aren't always right. \nLuna never quite fit in with her peers as she was always off exploring and experimenting. When one of her experiments explodes spectacularly, Luna learns that she has an aptitude for brewing magical potions. Unable to train Luna herself and desiring to keep the young girl out of further trouble, Luna\u2019s mother sends her to live with her grandmother to learn potion crafting. \nGranny lives in a small village to the north on the edge of the Deep Dark Forest. Her little town, Old Haven, is the last stop for adventurers on their way to find fame, fortune, and glory in the enchanted lands beyond. A respected Potions Master, Granny has more than enough business selling potions and remedies to the townsfolk and travelers. However, with her advanced age, she is happy to take on an apprentice who can venture into the enchanted forests, mountains, deltas, and grasslands on her behalf. \nWhether it\u2019s helping Mary Muffet with a spider problem or assisting the monk, Tripitaka, and his unlikely crew of disciples on their pilgrimage, Luna finds a way to lend a hand with her cunning wit and, of course, her potions. \nFull Release \nThe full release will be available for Windows, Mac, and Linux via direct download (DRM-free) and Steam.\nAlpha/Beta Access \nAccess to the alpha and beta will be granted on Steam for Windows initially, with Mac to follow.

No, it isn\u2019t a deep strategic challenge, but it does present players with numerous choices and forces them to adjust their plans as the game progresses. But much more important than that, the game is simply fun to play\u2026and you get to play the bad guy!\"\nUltimate Scheme is @FailroadExpress's Kickstarter Game of the Month for May!\nOwen K.C. Stephens says: \u201cI thoroughly enjoyed Ultimate Scheme when I had the pleasure of crushing Rich Baker in a game session. As a result of the X Factor, it has HUGE replay value, creating new opportunities to try different strategies with every game session. If the idea of using complex plots, ninja agents, the global coffee supply, and schemes requiring Unobtainium sounds like fun way to conquer there world, this boardgame is for you! Five of five stars. Would scheme again.\u201d\nRob Schwalb says: \"I had the opportunity to play Ultimate Scheme with Rich Baker at AcadeCon and I had a great time! Everyone at the table picked up the game quick and by the end we could see the intricacies of the design and how it facilitated a variety of win strategies. This is a fantastic game and I can\u2019t wait to add a copy to my library. Highly recommended!\"\nJennifer Clarke-Wilkes says: \"Power corrupts, but absolute power is for the experts. This is a fun and eminently replayable game of plots and counter plots.\"\n\"I had more fun than I thought I would!\" - Russ at Gamerati Game Day.\nHere's part 1 of a play-through video featuring the Dead Gentlemen's Nathan Rice and Steve Wolbrecht (part 2 and part 3 are also available on YouTube):\nMore to Come!\nUltimate Scheme works for 2 to 4 players, and takes about an hour to play on average - slightly more than an hour with four players, and a bit less than an hour with just two. In the video above, Rich provides an introduction to the game and a walkthrough of the turn order. The card types are listed below, and we have a detailed breakdown of the rules components on our website.\nSetup\nIn Ultimate Scheme, you play as one of the 10+ Factions of the game, such as Gigaton Industries or W.R.A.I.T.H. You also draw one Ultimate Scheme, which might be something like Found an Evil Coffee Empire, Start a Land War in Asia, or Ruin Christmas.\nYou begin play with two minions, placed in the starting location indicated on the Faction card. You'll also draw three Scheme cards and an Action Card.\nTurn Order\nEach turn is broken up into five steps. Starting with the First Player, all players complete the first step, then all players complete the second step, and so on. After all steps have been completed, the player to the left of the first player becomes the new First Player for the next round.\nDraw Step. Each player draws one criminal, subversion, or genius scheme from his or her choice of one of the three Scheme decks.\nMove Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and moves the minion to an adjacent location. After all players have moved one minion, they each take a second move in turn order. During this phase, a player might end up moving one minion twice, or two minions once. A player can always elect to not move a minion.\nResource Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and gains resources from that minion's location.. After all players have collected resources once, they collect a second time, in turn order. Resources cannot be gained from a location more than once per round, regardless of whether the location was depleted by an ally or enemy minion.\nExecute Step. Each player can execute a Scheme, provided the player has the appropriate resources to spend and has a minion in the Scheme's location. There is no limit to the number of schemes a player can complete in a given turn, provided that the resource and location requirements are met.\nEnd Step. If Victory has not been achieved, any minions in hidden locations return to their home cities. The First Player changes, and play continues in the next round.\nHere's a closer look at the primary game elements::\nA Faction Card. Each Faction has its own start location and a special ability. Professor Roboto here starts with additional schemes, and gains more Science every turn.\nAn Ultimate Scheme. Each Ultimate Scheme has its own unique victory condition.\nA close up of three locations. New York provides two Finance Resources, while San Francisco provides one Science and an Action Card. Area 51 is a Hidden Site (you must first get access to the site), and grants Science plus Action and Scheme cards.\nAn Action card. Each action card specifies the effect and indicates when you can play it.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s even better than pulling off scores of nefarious plots and capers? Pulling off dozens more, of course! Plan Number B is an expansion to the Ultimate Scheme game that provides you with more factions, more schemes, more action cards, and more mayhem in general. \nPlan Number B begins as a set of 40 new cards, introducing the Interpol Agent to the mix and up to 4 new factions for the Ultimate Scheme game, but here's the best part - Plan Number B gets bigger and better as we hit our stretch goals. What's on the table for Plan Number B stretch goals?  \nInterpol Agent: A new game element that lets you use the forces of law and order as your unwitting pawns to obstruct your rival's plans.\nThe Event Deck: a set of cards that puts a new twist on each round of the game.\nMore Schemes: a new category of nefarious schemes you can undertake.\nSingle Player Mode: for when you want to play with yourself.\nMore Factions, Locations, Ultimate Schemes, Madness, and Mayhem!\nTo add Plan Number B to your Ultimate Scheme reward, select the DELUXE ULTIMATE SCHEME reward, or any of the rewards above $65. Depending on manufacturing time frame, the expansion may be shipped separately after the basic game is delivered.\n\nIf we surpass our initial goal, we'll be able to increase the value of the reward levels by adding more content to the Plan Number B expansion.\n\nAt 250 backers at the EXPANDED and DELUXE levels combined, we'll add the Event Deck to Plan Number B!\nAt $20,000 raised, we'll include cards for single player mode in Plan Number B, and make a digital version of the single player mode available online for download.\n\nWe'll unlock more stuff as we hit our stretch goals!\n\nWe have no other add-ons planned for Ultimate Scheme beyond what is offered in the reward tiers. We want to keep fulfillment simple and straight-forward, so that we can quickly get the game printed and shipped out to all of our backers. That said, if there's something special you want, or if you want to combine reward levels, let us know in the Comments thread or feel free to message us privately and let us know what you're looking for, and we'll see what we can do!\nShipping rates are calculated based on your country when you select your reward tier, and is not reflected in the base reward pledges.\nWe are partnering with Ship Naked to provide delivery to backers. We had a positive experience with them in shipping our previous Kickstarter project, Primeval Thule 5e, and we think they'll be more than ready to handle our Ultimate Scheme. They'll ship all over the world! \nWe are using Ship Naked's Customs-Friendly Worldwide shipping option, which means that not only is the shipping cost a little lower for us, shipments will be EU-, Canada-, UK-, Aussie-, NZ-, and US-Friendly. \n Ultimate Scheme has been in the works for quite some time. We first brought a version of the game to the First Exposure Playtest Hall at Gen Con 2014, and have been testing and refining the game ever since. At Gen Con in 2015, we provided demos in our booth and continued to get feedback and reactions from fans. We've been to local groups like Gamerati to show off the game and get even more feedback.\nSasquatch Game Studio is a small game publishing company formed by three longtime game industry professionals. We initially came together to produce the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting for multiple RPG platforms, and also produced Princes of the Apocalypse, a big adventure for 5th edition D&D. We are all Wizards of the Coast veterans, and we have longstanding relationships with some of the top talent in the biz. For Ultimate Scheme, we brought in two excellent artists: Lee Moyer to help us nail down the game board and design elements, and Claudio Pozas to provide our card illustrations.\nRichard Baker is a best-selling author and award-winning game designer. In addition to extensive RPG design credits, he\u2019s worked on several boardgames and miniature games of note, including the Origins award-winning Conquest of Nerath and Axis and Allies Miniatures game. He also contributed extensively to Risk Godstorm and Axis and Allies Revised.\nDavid Noonan has more than 50 RPG products among his credits, and has written extensively for video games, including Motiga's upcoming Gigantic team action game for Windows 10 and Xbox One.\nStephen Schubert is an award-winning game designer/developer mostly known for his extensive work for D&D and the D&D Miniatures Game.\nLee Moyer has worked as an illustrator on numerous games\u2014RPGs, computer games, CCGs, and more. He collaborated with Keith Baker on The Doom that Came to Atlantic City, published by Cryptozoic Entertainment, and served as the art director (and lead illustrator) for the 13th Age Roleplaying Game.\nLast but not least, Claudio Pozas contributed to Fantasy Flight\u2019s Star Wars and Lord of the Rings LCGs, the Dungeon Crawler ECG by Gifted Vision, and the Ennie Award-winning Counter Collection series by Fiery Dragon, as well as numerous RPGs.\n\"Hitman\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second campaign for the Ultimate Scheme game. After the first attempt failed to fund, we reviewed our campaign from top to bottom to figure out how we can reach success. We took in feedback and created a (hopefully) more engaging cover design, and shot a new pitch video with better production values. \n\nWe also looked for a manufacturer that could work in smaller quantities, so that we won't incur as big of an expense to create more product than we might need. We simplified the components, replacing the more expensive wooden resource cubes with punch-out sheets, which also allows us to create art more representative of the game's resources. Overall, we reduced the cost of the game, and by reducing weight and box size, we've reduced the expected shipping costs as well. \n\nAs a result, we can offer the game at a lower price point, passing our savings on to our backers. In addition, the smaller quantities means a smaller funding threshold, which means that the project success is even more likely.\n\nWe've run two successful Kickstarter campaigns, both for RPG products. Ultimate Scheme is our first board game Kickstarter project, and we've made an effort to anticipate the additional work this project requires to follow it through manufacturing and shipping. We will keep backers apprised of our manufacturing and shipping timelines.\n\nPlan Number B will require some design and playtesting as we extend the expansion through additional stretch goals. We anticipate having the expansion ready to deliver at the same time as the core game.

Rather than give them rules to live by, KAZOO gives girls, ages 5 to 10, tools to create, build, explore, dream, play and ask questions.\nKAZOO will be published quarterly and feature sections on art, nature, science, tinkering and tech, cooking, travel, sports, emotions, citizenship, and critical thinking. Regular features will include: science experiments; comics; art projects; recipes; interviews with inspiring women from athletes to astronauts; and fun activities, including secret codes, jokes, mazes, search-and-finds and more.\nEvery story in each issue will be either developed or inspired by top female artists, explorers, scientists, chefs, athletes, activists, writers and others. Here are just a few of the inspiring women, who have already confirmed their participation in the first issue: \n\u2022MacArthur Genius Alison Bechdel, author of Fun Home is creating a full-page tutorial called, \u201cHow to Draw a Cat.\u201d (It\u2019s the first original, full-length comic she\u2019s published in a year.) \n\u2022New York Times best-seller Lucy Knisley, author of Relish, is creating an original 4-page comic on Elizabeth Robinson, the first American woman to win an Olympic gold in track.\n\u2022Artist Mickalene Thomas, who has shown her work at The Guggenheim, The Whitney, The National Portrait Gallery and MOMA, is adapting one of her portraits into a color-and-glitter-by-number project.\n\u2022James Beard nominated chef Fany Gerson, owner of La Newyorkina and author of My Sweet Mexico is developing recipes for paletas, or Mexican ice pops.\n\u2022Caldecott Honor winner Doreen Cronin, author of Click, Clack, Moo and Bloom, is debuting an original, 4-page short story, featuring a strong girl protagonist.\nGerson's La Newyorkina and Cronin's Bloom\n\u2022National Book Award winner Jacqueline Woodson, author of Brown Girl Dreaming is rounding up her must-read books for girls.\n\u2022Cosmochemist, Fulbright Scholar and Guggenheim fellow Meenakshi Wadhwa, Ph.D., Director of the Center for Meteorite Studies at Arizona State University is contributing to a story on the Perseid Meteor Shower.\nWoodson's Brown Girl Dreaming and Dr. Wadwha with a meteorite\nThe video above was created by Courtney and Peter Hutchens, the amazing filmmaking duo behind Back East Media.  \nWhen girls are young, they not afraid to ask for what they want. They\u2019re not shy about taking up space or making noise. They own their bodies and are proud of what they can do, how fast they can run and high they can climb. They ask questions (and, as any parent knows, sometimes endlessly). And yet, by adolescence, too many begin to question their own voice. The fallout is real. Take a look:\n\u2022Six in ten girls stop doing what they love, because they feel bad about their looks. And by age 11, 30 percent of them have already put themselves on a diet.\n\u2022Seventy five percent of girls are interested in engineering and related fields, and yet only 11 percent of practicing engineers are women.\n\u2022Young girls earn higher grades than boys in science, yet feel less confident in their abilities.\n\u2022By adolescence, girls are less likely than boys to act, and feel, like a leader.\n\u2022Adolescent girls are nearly three times as likely to have suffered from depression in the past year, compared to boys. \nBy celebrating girls for all that they are\u2014smart, inquisitive, creative, brave, strong and, yes, loud\u2014KAZOO will help shore up their foundation, so that by the time they enter adolescence, they\u2019ll be more likely to question anyone who makes them feel small than they\u2019ll be to question themselves.\nOne more point, here: Girls and women are completely underrepresented in our culture. Look at Congress (80% men); the modern art section of the MET (95% men); the engineering profession (89% men); Oscar-nominated cinematographers (100% men); even children\u2019s books, where boy characters are 3 times more likely than girl characters to appear. \nWhen you\u2019re excluded from the political process, museums, professions, awards, even your own bedtime stories, there is a consequence. The less girls see themselves in positions of power, the less likely they\u2019ll be to believe they can achieve such power. KAZOO is the antidote to this invisibility. It will feature some of the most powerful and inspirational women in their fields, thus giving girls a more well-rounded sense of the world and the possibilities within it. \nMy dream is to get KAZOO into every little girl's hands, so she can not only read, laugh and learn, but also see the world from a new perspective, one where she is celebrated for being true to herself. Making that happen will take time and money. If you help fund this project, it means I could: \n\u2022Pay for printing and postage, the biggest expense\n\u2022Hire an ace designer to help make every page spectacular \n\u2022Hire illustrators and photographers to help bring the stories to life \n\u2022Hire a copyeditor to save me from mortal embarrassment\n\u2022Dedicate more of my time to create a truly awesome magazine (and less to freelancing full-time for other magazines)\nOf course, with every dollar you donate, you'll earn some serious feel-good vibes from knowing you could potentially be changing a girl's life. And if that doesn't convince you to back this project, here are a few other perks:\nThe sticker, hoodie, T-shirt, onesie and tote.\nOn Twitter and Facebook, lots of great people are getting behind KAZOO. Some highlights as of April 2nd.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGiven the increased competition from digital media (and the rise in postage fees), the landscape for print magazines may seem a little bleak right now. But there's one area of exception: kids' print media. Children\u2019s book sales, for instance, increased 13 percent last year. That\u2019s because kids still enjoy, and indeed crave, turning real pages, and they still get a thrill to see personally addressed mail waiting for them in their mailboxes. \n\nAs parents, too, we want our children to spend less time staring at screens and more time reading, thinking and tapping into their imagination. A printed magazine, which your child can actually hold in her hands and leaf through at her own pace, is the perfect antidote to an otherwise frenzied media culture.

Led by a merciless witch doctor, an army of sinister creatures and terrifying beasts plot to awaken a long-forgotten terror. Should they succeed, the lives and homes of countless swamp-dwelling tribes will face a fate worse than death. As the inhabitants of Widower\u2019s Wood find themselves trapped in the grim maw of ghoulish horrors, their last hope is a team of ravenous monsters with the cunning and ferocity to bite back.\nWhere heroes fear to tread, only monsters can save the day!\nJoin this daunting band and venture into Widower\u2019s Wood in this fully cooperative adventure board game for 2\u20134 players. The harrowing wilds of the swamp are filled with dire perils and dreadful villains, and it will require teamwork and the unique strengths of your adventurers to prevail. If you\u2019re smart enough, tough enough, and courageous enough to face the greatest horrors of the Iron Kingdoms, you might just be monster enough to survive.\nWidower\u2019s Wood is the latest in the expandable Iron Kingdoms Adventure Board Game series, designed by William \u201cOz\u201d Schoonover and produced by Privateer Press. Inside Widower\u2019s Wood, you will find dozens of miniatures created by the award-winning sculptors of Privateer Press, creators of WARMACHINE and HORDES,  and a character-driven narrative campaign that unfolds over the course of seven detailed scenarios, each of which can be replayed again and again for a different experience every time. The story takes place on a richly designed board with tiles that change from scenario-to-scenario, all accompanied by hundreds of tokens and cards for tracking the progress of your heroes. Powerful game mechanics ensure that the enemies always present new and exciting challenges for the players for a tremendously re-playable game experience. \nTogether, the players comprise a band of daring monstrosities working together to defeat their enemies, achieve tactical objectives, and become more powerful over the course of the expansive, persistent campaign.\nEach character has a unique sheet of statistics but as the campaign progresses you will spend experience points on feats and ability cards allowing you to customize and enhance your adventurer.\nChoose your monster\u2026\nFor illustrative purposes only.

When comparing the Widower\u2019s Wood rules to those of The Undercity, the most notable difference will be found in the map details. The Undercity takes place in the dark tunnels beneath the city of Corvis while Widower\u2019s Wood\u2019s seven chapters explore a swampy forest. Instead of walls and gates, players must navigate through clumps of trees, pools of water, and around piles of fallen ruins. In addition, there is a new villain tactic in Widower\u2019s Wood that allows the enemy leaders to goad their underlings into attacking the heroes, as well as new rules for magic attacks.\nGerman Language Edition\nWe are pleased to announce that a German-language edition of the Widower's Wood rules will be available when the game launches, courtesy our partners Ulisses Spiele.

And if you are already a fan of The Undercity or plan to check it out in the future, the Dead Men Walking expansion, included in the Deluxe Edition and Premium Collector\u2019s Edition reward levels, contains scenarios for use in both The Undercity and Widower\u2019s Wood, maximizing the overall playability of your rewards.\nWhether you paint your miniatures or not, Widower\u2019s Wood is also a tremendous resource for players of Iron Kingdoms Full Metal Fantasy or Unleashed. The figures contained within the game are perfect for use as villains or NPCs in any roleplaying game set in the wilds of western Immoren. Used alongside the game board and tiles, you can create compelling and immersive environments for your RPG sessions!\nWidower's Wood figures make great additions to your Iron Kingdoms Unleashed Roleplaying Game sessions!\nPrivateer Press RPG Producer, Matt Goetz, has written some advice on how to integrate your Widower's Wood miniatures with Iron Kingdoms Unleashed! \nShipping costs will be collected from our backers through the BackerKit pledge manager after the campaign ends. This option allows us to charge the most accurate shipping costs and to avoid overcharging our backers during the campaign, ensuring we have enough funds to cover changes in postal rates or in our estimated weight of the game contents. Backer rewards will ship from our shipping hubs in the UK, EU, and Australia. Our estimated shipping costs are below but may increase or decrease depending on the number of stretch goals that are unlocked as well as changes in postal rates, especially for international customers.

While Privateer is well known as a publisher and manufacturer of miniatures games, our board games\u2014which we are just as passionate about\u2014have not reached as wide an audience as we believe would appreciate them. So, after much consideration and discussion, we concluded that Kickstarter presents the opportunity for us to raise awareness of the board games we make and hopefully get them into more hands than we have been able to through traditional marketing. Plus, it gives us a chance to give our gamers what they want: tons of extra miniatures, extra scenarios, extra tiles, extra everything! \nBy being able to accurately gauge our audience\u2019s interest in a project, we can pack our board games with everything they want without the risk associated with publishing through traditional methods. It also lets us explore things like the Premium Collector\u2019s Edition box for Widower\u2019s Wood. These kinds of items are difficult to adequately determine market demand for in advance, but with Kickstarter, we can order exactly what we need to fulfill everyone\u2019s wishes. While we have no intentions or plans to use Kickstarter for our miniatures wargames, our drive to create new games and load them with extra content is something we can\u2019t contain, and we are excited for the opportunity to use Kickstarter as a platform to bring this project to life.

Right now, Widower\u2019s Wood and the vast majority of its components are already written, edited, designed, illustrated, and modeled.

The most pressing challenge with this sort of project is ultimately one that is out of our hands: overseas manufacturing delays.\n \nWhile we have extreme confidence in our overseas partners after working with them for years, it is always possible that machines can malfunction, weather can delay shipping, or freight containers can be held up by customs.

A software solution that has the potential to save thousands of reams of paper from being used by the entertainment industry and will save all of us TiMe.\nMORE LIFE. LESS PAPERWORK.\n*Startwork (Startwork Packet or Start Paperwork) | noun: A 15-30 page packet every crewmember fills out to join a new production. It contains forms from the payroll company, production company and the financier (normally a studio or network). \nTiM allows you to create an Electronic Profile that only you can access or modify. Using a proprietary process, TiM converts scans or digital versions of startwork into a file that your Electronic Profile \"talks\" to, eliminating the need for physical startwork packets.\nLet's start at the beginning...\nSETTING UP THE PRODUCTION\nA production is created within TiM by the UPM, Line Producer or Studio. \nThe production's startwork packet is uploaded, customized, and saved within TiM. \nCopyright CrewBridge Technologies\nProduction documents can also be uploaded into TiM, at any time, after the production has been created. \nJOINING THE PRODUCTION\nThe production invites you (or your department head) to TiM via text or email. A department head can invite new crewmembers to their department the same way.\nLog in and fill out your Electronic Profile, once.  This information is stored in TiM for all future productions and only you can access or edit it using your password protected login. \nYour digital startwork packet for this production is standing by and automatically populated using the information from your Electronic Profile.\nReview, sign, and submit. \nThat\u2019s it. \nYOUR PRODUCTION HOMEPAGE\nOnce your I-9 is approved within TiM you can be granted access to the all of the production\u2019s documents in one place.\nCheck it out!\nPRODUCTION HOMEPAGE\nBACK AT THE OFFICE\nYour accurate and complete digital startwork packet lands in the Payroll Accountant\u2019s \"Startwork Inbox.\" From here it is sent for approval signatures and easily tracked within TiM's \"Startwork Approval Pipeline.\"\n\"STARTWORK PIPELINE\"\nOnce approved, the Payroll Accountant sends a PDF to the studio and payroll company with one click.\nNo more sorting through piles of startwork or tracking down missing information!\nYOUR STARTWORK\nYour fully executed deal memo and start paperwork are saved within TiM and accessible to you at any time, for all past and current productions.\nIN SHORT: Enter your information once, forever. Period.\nAccess any productions you\u2019re working on, anywhere, on any device, at any time.\nElectronic Profile: your information will be securely stored in TiM and used to fill out your startwork packet for you. Choose what information is visible to the crew and modify your Electronic Profile at any time.\nMy Contacts: access and manage the contact information of people you work with across productions all stored within TiM. No more searching through paperwork for a crewmember's Emergency Contact information.\nProduction Homepage: your hub for all of the most recent production documents, announcements and information in ONE place: \n        - Call Sheet \n        - Schedules (One Liner, DOODs, etc) \n        - Other Production Docs (Script Revisions, Box Kit Rental Forms, etc) \n        - Daily Call Time, Crew Lunch, and Camera Wrap \n        - Digital Crew List and Department Specific Information \n        - Production and Payroll Company Information\nPermission Based Access: all documents in TiM can be set up with custom permissions;  you decide who sees what.\nInvite: invite new crewmembers to your Department or Production via email or text message. Save them as \"core crew\" or \"dayplayer\" and their contact information will be saved in TiM automatically. \nStartwork: Access your approved startwork packet (deal memos & rates) at any time for any past or current production.\nDigital Approval: Electronically sign and submit your startwork packet. No more missing information or missing signatures. \n FOR THE PAYROLL ACCOUNTANT:\nScan and upload paper startwork packets or digital forms into TiM and customize them for any production. Save templates to re-use for future productions.\nAssign accounting codes and rates to new crewmembers as they are invited to the production.\nStartwork Inbox: Completed startwork packets, with all required fields double-checked by TiM, can be easily reviewed and sent for higher up approval the moment they are submitted by the crewmember. \nStartwork Pipeline: Track startwork packets as they are approved within TiM. \nOne-Click-Send: Send a PDF of completed deal memos and payroll forms to the studio or payroll company for every crewmember directly from TiM. No more sorting and scanning. \nSecurity\nTiM is designed without the need for long-term storage of sensitive personal information (like social security numbers) and retains only info that is publicly accessible (like name, email, phone number, etc.). Documents will be stored in Amazon S3 using ServerSide (\"at rest\") encryption as well as an additional layer of encryption (using AES256 which is Government level security).\nI-9 documents (passport #s, driver license #s, etc.), won't be stored in TiM, as many studios/networks/production companies require a designated crewmember (like an AD or Best Boy/Key) to fill in the document information as he/she approves the I-9, not ahead of time. TiM doesn't change the I-9 process, it just makes it easier, faster and less prone to errors.\nHow much is your TiMe worth? \nBy eliminating the tedious process of filling out start paperwork TiM saves at least 15 minutes of productivity for each crewmember on a production. TiM will cost a production significantly less than the time savings it generates per onboard (with respect to the average hourly rate of crewmembers).\nTiM also empowers production staff, that are traditionally saddled with the time-consuming task of putting together hundreds of startwork packets, to focus on more important duties.\nIt saves a production thousands of pieces of paper, countless boxes of staples, several cartridges of printer toner, and a hefty amount of electricity.\nLastly, by virtually eliminating errors or omissions in startwork and facilitating a blazing fast approval process, Accounting, Production Managers and Producers will be able to spend a fraction of the time \"processing\" startwork.\nWhy the low price-point? We want using TiM to be a no-brainer (because it is!). An affordable price-point will help us roll TiM out to as many productions as possible. The more productions that use TiM, the better the onboarding process is for everyone. (Plus, we don't want to fill out startwork anymore either!)\nHigh value. Low cost. Greater good.\n\"I wish I didn't have to fill out all this paperwork!\"\n\"ugh hurry up with that app already... I think of you guys every time I fill out paperwork. The system is so broken!\"\n\"Yes for no more paperwork!\"\nOf the hundreds of crewmembers we've surveyed, 95.5% say they are unhappy with the current startwork process.\nHere's a glimpse of this process...\nSomewhere, right now, there is a heavy duty printer that's been running for hours. An office PA or Payroll Accountant is monotonously separating these mountains of printed paperwork and stapling 20-or-so-page packets one by one, for every single crewmember (200 packets? 500? 1000? Depends on the gig).  These startwork packets are then schlepped by the hundreds to set; lugged to each truck and passed off to each department in heaps so no one finds themselves short at the end of a long, grueling work day.\nDay 1 on set of a new production: We\u2019re already low on startwork\u2026 call the office\u2026 more printing, more stapling, another set run, lugging more stacks around and then tracking down that guy who\u2019s only with the production this one day.\nEnd of day 1: Lug these hundreds of crumpled, coffee stained, torn, often incomplete startwork packets back to the office.  The Payroll Accountant then reviews and sorts them one by one. A missing signature... send it back to set. Imagine doing this 1000 times.\nDay 2: Same thing.\nThank you to our Payroll Accountants for getting us paid all these years. We appreciate everything you do.\nEvery startwork packet asks for the same information (multiple times per packet): name, address, email, phone number, etc, yet no two are the same.  Why are we wasting all of this time and paper on every production?  We've spent the past ten months investigating this and the reasoning we've most commonly heard is, \"because this is how it\u2019s always been done.\u201d  \nWe firmly believe....\nA SOLUTION FOR THE CREW, BY THE CREW\n                               TiM isn't just software, it's a movement, and startwork is just the beginning. This is a chance to change an established process for the better\u2014to create a solution that benefits each of us, all of us, and therefore the production and the system as a whole. \nWe have a working prototype (thanks to our amazing CTO and developer, Carmine Guida), but it will take several resources to make TiM the seamless, streamlined solution we envision.\nTogether we can make TiM a reality.\nThese kickstarter funds will be used for:\nSoftware developers to build out TiM\u2019s database. \nPurchasing developer licenses for PDF importing and conversion.\nPurchasing licenses for clerical software like Quickbooks.  \nLegal advisement.\nTrademarking, copyrights and business registrations, etc. \nAmazon Web Services to ensure TiM is fast, reliable, scalable, and secure when supporting any number of users at a time. \nEmail and SMS services for instant notifications. \nWebsite and software development.\n LEARNING, BUILDING, WORKING, and CELEBRATING TOGETHER! \nJoin the movement!\nPlease know, when it comes to beta testing, receiving exclusive updates, and becoming a TiM Architect to help shape the features and future of TiM, your level of involvement is up to you.

Between the both of us we\u2019ve worked in film for about a decade and our distinct paths allow us to see film from the inside looking out and the outside looking in.\nOur partner, Carmine Guida, is the \u201cunicorn\u201d developer that anyone starting a tech company dreams of and hopes for. A vet in start-up tech land, an experienced businessman, and a skilled musician--he is the perfect compliment to two ADs who have personally struggled with the inefficiencies prevalent in the film production industry. His business savvy and communication skills are unparalleled, which is important when building something that, above all else, is meant to address the needs of the people it serves. We are very lucky to have him onboard.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nA UNIQUE INDUSTRY\nNo two productions are alike and for any single production, the work force, locations, and obstacles change on a daily basis.

For the first time in history, the prevalence of Internet connected devices has made it possible to bring a truly mobile, technological solution to the filmed entertainment industry. Since we are creating tech to move an entire industry away from the paper processes that are so ingrained in its identity, the primary goal is to make sure TiM actually is easier than current practices; not just technology for technology\u2019s sake. We will accomplish this through extensive user testing and an ongoing dialogue with our fellow crewmembers.\n\nCOMPETITION\nWhere a market exists, so does competition.

Do you bring majesty, wealth, and power to the lands or are you a creature of legendary terror? \nExperience dragons in their proper role as the monstrous, complex, and epic protagonists that they are. In this open world action role-playing game you bring your dragon's story to life. As you hunt, eat, and age, your dragon develops. You improve and customize its wings, tail, claws, and breath weapon. Over the centuries, you develop your inner draconic magic and other latent abilities, claim territory, and impact the course of history. \nBecome a terrifying or benevolent dragon powerful enough to threaten city states and reshape kingdoms.\nWhen YOU are the dragon, it is up to you to decide if you want to be a destroyer of enemies.\n...or a protector of your city-state...\nYour influence is inevitable\nThe Gameplay\nDTG is a unique blend of action, exploration, freedom, and power. \nThe game as been described as Grand Theft Auto meets Skyrim.  A \"dragon simulator\" with role playing and city-building elements.\nGameplay is emergent. Whereas most games follow the story of a frail mortal aspiring to be great, DTG puts you directly into a flying, fire-breathing, awe-inspiring, customizable, extremely powerful dragon. \nA dragon surveys its lands. Improve your senses to unlock the minimap and other tools of the hunt.\nAs we all know, dragons do as they please. So immerse yourself in the lore and story of the world.  Fulfill quests, rescuing (or eating) princesses, collecting artifacts and wealth. Or, venture out into the world on your own, live off the land, uncover the lost history of dragons, explore the countryside, and leave your own claw-mark in this world.\nSearching for a snack.\nCompletely destructible cities and castles are planned for the full game. Some dragons have adapted to eat nearly anything from wooden beams to rooftop shingles.\nMany villagers are slow and weak, easy prey for an unscrupulous drake. But remember, your actions will create your reputation.\nFlames spread across the ground and ignites near-by grasses and trees. Frost breath causes fliers to freeze and drop from the sky. Acid dissolves your opponent and their gear. Your dragon's breath is a fierce and dynamic weapon.\nFly solo, or soar across the skies with your friends in co-op or PVP games.\nChoose your draconic heritage. Each color, or race, has its own specialty. Don't like the options? Create your own hybrid dragon.\nDragons occupy an enormous creative space and many games include dragons, or riding dragons, or hunting dragons, or being dragon-born, but none have set to the task of building the greatest \"draconic experience \" possible...Until now!\nThe five core draconic races\nImagine the possibilities.  How do villages and kingdoms react when you fly over-head? Do you seek to work with the races of humanoids or do you extort them? Do you build alliances with your draconic brothers and sisters or do you dominate, displace, or slay them? DTG allows you play through an unparalleled draconic experience in a sandbox fantasy universe.  The player guides his dragon through it's life: hunting, eating, and growing powerful over the centuries.  Becoming more powerful, you progress from day-to-day survival to a mighty beast whose presence is felt across the lands. Our goal is to create a story that engages, but does not dictate your experience: \nA dragon sleeps best near her hoard.\nThe lore provides direction but the real story of DTG is created by the player and it evolves organically, in response to the cities and characters you help and those you destroy.  During each play-through your choices as a dragon will shape the world, your actions affecting the centuries to come. Over time technology and magic will advance--the cities, enemies, and draconic rivals you meet will grow increasingly dangerous over the course of the game.\nTo survive and thrive you will need to eat, seek out a lair, and amass wealth; using food and treasure to purchase new body parts, customizations, and weapons, leveling up abilities, and upgrading your dragon's instinct and senses. Receive gifts or demand tribute from nearby kingdoms to accelerate your growth.  Exploration is key. The world is large and filled with gold, magic, and peril.  Every location contains a potential quest event...\nBurn down an infected forest before the blight can spread\nRespond to slavers demanding your surrender or dragon hunters seeking your hide\nDeliver supplies to impoverished village\nPatrolling your territory\nSlaying prides of griffins\nSurvive in an uncharted world\nOther draconic quests to come...\nDaming a river for a near-by village. A day of your dragon's labor is worth months of manpower. Gold and tribute will surely follow your good deeds.\nTornados, thunder storms, high winds, and other weather events present challenges and opportunities for airborne wyrms.\nThe Final Game\nWe've build a strong foundation for this game and poured our hearts, lives, and money into getting DTG to this point.  Your support will allows us to create an unmatched draconic experience for your PC, Mac, or Linux.  We plan expansion to XBOX One and PSN when possible.\nFull Customization: Choose your dragon's bloodline, body type, and anatomy. Choose its color, face, look, and abilities. Customize and upgrades your weapons and armor such as scales, breath weapon, bite, tail, and wings. Adorn its body with spikes, armor, scars.   Are you lean and fast, choosing razor sharp claws, with talons for extra reach and deadly bleeding? Or are you an armored behemoth, careening through the skies with arrow repelling dragonhide.  All combinations and possible.\n5 Core Draconic Races: We are working on 5 core dragon races that have unique abilities, starting areas, advantages, and disadvantages. Customize and empower your bloodline over the generations by passing on traits and achievements to your descendants by completing quests, leveling up, and choosing a mate.\nHunt and feast on tribute as you grow more powerful through the years. Hoard gold, claim a lair and expand your dominance throughout a dragon-sized sandbox fantasy world.  \nChoose who to help and who to eat. Choose which cities will benefit and thrive under your protection and which will burn...\nSingle and multi-player modes for all of your dragon co-op and PVP needs; work together in peace or find out who's the top dragon.\nUsers Mods - The creativity of our players will help this game become greater than we could imagine on our own. Integration with Steam Workshop is planned as well.\nSeveral possible conclusions; never-ending play.\nDeep RPG elements: From background traits, to titles, and rewarding statistics--you've never been able to make the dragon with so many options.  Become the dragon you've always imagined.\nIncredible soundtrack: We have four great songs so far, but our musician S.J. Tucker is working hard to give us a full soundtrack that greatly enhances and narrates your draconic experience.\nOur Challenge--How funds will be used\nRed Level Games has already built a great deal of the world of Dragon: The Game over the past 14 months. Our Early Access release last year on Steam brought in over 12,000 players!  Since then the vision and technology behind DTG has grown and we need our communities support to deliver this remarkable game.\nUnfortunately, we've disappointed some of our fans along the way and earned some negative reviews with progress that hasn't been as fast as they would like, or features that have been removed, tweaked, or temporarily broken along the way.  We hear them, and understand their complaints.  \nAs we have developed Dragon, it has grown us as a team and a studio to create this game. We also recognized the opportunity to upgrade to Unity 5 and \"swing for the fences\" with a much deeper game and more robust codebase. This has been a long but worthwhile path to follow. Now we're on the other side of the time-consuming pivot from a simple prototype released last November to the current multiplayer, 3d Unity 5 dragon experience.\nWhich is why we need your help.\nWe've solved many of our most complex technical hurdles and need your support to make this game incredible.  In addition to what RLG has already invested into this game, this Kickstarter will allow us to....\nThe first set of features, colored blue and stamped with our dragon logo, are slated for completion. We need your help to accelerate development! With your pledge, we can remain an independent studio and deliver a tremendous draconic experience.\nAccess to the game\nPledge today! Your donation of $15 dollars or more will get you access to the current version of Dragon: The Game via a Steam, Humble, or GOG digital download.  We'll send you your activation key ASAP upon reaching our KS goal so you can join the fun right away.  \nBACKER CHALLENGE\nDragon Supporters, We are offering a unique, custom-made piece of Dragon art from our artist Rob Carlos to the next three backers that donate at the $100 level or above.

In the time that Red Level Games undertook to complete Phase One of the creation of Dragon: The Game, we have already learned about many of the risks and challenges that await us here in the crucial Kickstarter funding phase of this games development.\n\nOne risk is that early players of our game are not able to envision the game as it will ultimately be. In allowing for players to become the dragon, it was necessary first to have a flyable dragon and a world in which that dragon could fly. As this was created and shown, the ultimate Role Playing style of the game was not immediately evident. Without that in mind, Dragon: The Game can feel like a simulator alone.\n\nAs we build out our world, populate it with both dragons and humans, and as players begin to create their own dragon narratives, this misunderstanding will dissipate. We anticipate an increasing desire from our community to have main and side quests to follow, more and bigger lairs to inhabit, and new ways in which their own dragon can become differentiated. Growing our community and getting this feedback is one of the most important aspects of this Kickstarter campaign, and it will allow this community to collectively build the universe of Dragon: The Game.\n\nIn addition to real-time progress towards the ultimate experience of Dragon: The Game, we will also develop many uniquely generated skins and enhanced visual creation. After building the world, we want to make it beautiful for our dragons, even if they eventually burn it to the ground! Our goals are ambitious, but with a successful campaign here, our artists and writers are ready to execute and deliver an immersive and innovative experience!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Changing of the Guard", "update_content": "Hi, everyone!\nAs we move into the new year, there are some changes underway.

We\u2019re partnering with a top-line game manufacturer to deliver an attractive game made with high-quality components. Your quest for world domination includes:\nGame Board: An attractive 21\" by 21\" mounted game board.\nPlayer Pieces: 25 minion tokens (meeples) and 25 control markers, in five colors for up to five players.\nResource Markers: 120 wooden cubes, 40 each for finance, occult, and science resources.\nUnobtanium: 12 acrylic crystal resource markers\nGame Cards: 136 poker-sized illustrated game cards, including:\n10 Factions\n10 Ultimate Schemes \n63 Scheme cards \n48 Action cards \n5 X-factor cards\nRulebook: Full-color rulebook.\nOther Stuff: The Ninja token, Anarchy marker, and first player token. Maybe a little factory lint.\nWe sat down with Will James of GeekDad - http://geekdad.com/2016/01/kickstarter-ultimate-scheme/\nMore to come!\nUltimate Scheme works for 2 to 5 players, and takes about an hour to play on average - slightly more than an hour with five players, and a bit less than an hour with just two. In the video above, Rich provides an introduction to the game and a walkthrough of the turn order. The card types are listed below, and we have a detailed breakdown of the rules components on our website.\nSetup\nIn Ultimate Scheme, you play as one of the 10+ Factions of the game, such as Gigaton Industries or W.R.A.I.T.H. You also draw one Ultimate Scheme, which might be something like Found an Evil Coffee Empire, Start a Land War in Asia, or Become a God.\nYou begin play with two minions, placed in the starting location indicated on the Faction card. You'll also draw two Scheme cards and an Action Card.\nTurn Order\nEach turn is broken up into five steps. Starting with the First Player, all players complete the first step, then all players complete the second step, and so on. After all steps have been completed, the player to the left of the first player becomes the new First Player for the next round.\nDraw Step. Each player draws one criminal, subversion, or genius scheme from his or her choice of one of the three Scheme decks.\nMove Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and moves the minion to an adjacent location. After all players have moved one minion, they each take a second move in turn order. During this phase, a player might end up moving one minion twice, or two minions once. A player can always elect to not move a minion.\nResource Step. Each player chooses one of his minions and gains resources from that minion's location, flipping the minion on its side to indicate that the location has been depleted for that turn. After all players have collected resources once, they collect a second time, in turn order. Resources cannot be gained from a depleted location, regardless of whether the location was depleted by an ally or enemy minion.\nExecute Step. Each player can execute a Scheme, provided the player has the appropriate resources to spend and has a minion in the Scheme's location. While players take turns executing schemes, there is no limit to the number of schemes a player can complete in a given turn, provided that the resource and location requirements are met.\nEnd Step. If Victory has not been achieved, then players reset their minions used to deplete resources, and any minions in hidden locations return to their home cities. The First Player changes, and play continues in the next round.\nA Faction Card. Each Faction has its own start location and a special ability. Professor Roboto here starts with additional schemes, and gains more Science every turn.\nAn Ultimate Scheme. Each Ultimate Scheme has its own unique victory condition.\nA close up of three locations. New York provides two Finance Resources, while San Francisco provides one Science and an Action Card. Area 51 is a Hidden Site (you must first get access to the site), and grants Science plus Action and Scheme cards.\nWhat\u2019s even better than pulling off scores of nefarious plots and capers? Pulling off dozens more, of course! Plan Number B is an expansion to the Ultimate Scheme game that provides you with more factions, more schemes, more action cards, and more mayhem in general.\nPlan Number B begins as a set of 40 new cards, introducing the Interpol Agent to the mix and up to 4 new factions for the Ultimate Scheme game, but here's the best part - Plan Number B gets bigger and better as we hit our stretch goals. What's on the table for Plan Number B?\nInterpol Agent: a new game element that lets you use the forces of law and order as your unwitting pawns to obstruct your rivals' plans.\nThe Event Deck: a set of cards that puts a new twist on each round of the game.\nMore Schemes: a new category of 23 nefarious schemes you can undertake.\nSingle Player Mode: for when you want to play with yourself.\nMore Factions, Locations, more Ultimate Schemes, more Madness and Mayhem!\nTo add Plan Number B to your Ultimate Scheme reward, select the DELUXE ULTIMATE SCHEME reward or any of the rewards above $80. Depending on manufacturing time frame, the expansion may be shipped separately after the basic game is delivered.\nIf we surpass our initial goal, we'll be able to increase the value of the reward levels by upgrading components and adding more content to the Plan Number B expansion (see below). Our first couple of stretch goals include:\nAt $35,000, we'll illustrate each of the faction cards with a handsome portrait of the Faction leader (these cards start off with simple graphic treatment). We'll also add two more Ultimate Schemes to the base game!\nAt $40,000, we'll add the Event Deck to Plan Number B. We'll also add two more Factions to the base game!\nAt 300 backers of Plan Number B, we'll add the single-player mode to the Deluxe game.\nAt $50,000, we'll replace the wooden resource cubes with specially designed resource tokens: gears for science, dollar signs for finance, and pentagrams for occult.\nWe'll unlock even more stuff as we hit our stretch goals!\nAt this time, we have no add-ons planned for Ultimate Scheme. That said, if there's something special you want, or if you want to combine reward levels, feel free to message us privately and let us know what you're looking for, and we'll see what we can do!\nWe are partnering with Ship Naked to provide delivery to backers. We had a positive experience with them in shipping our previous Kickstarter project, Primeval Thule 5e, and we think they'll be more than ready to handle our Ultimate Scheme. Ship Naked provides Customs-Friendly shipping to our overseas backers, and we'll work with them to provide an optimal experience for shipping overall.\nUltimate Scheme has been in the works for quite some time. We first brought a version of the game to the First Exposure Playtest Hall at Gen Con 2014, and have been testing and refining the game ever since. At Gen Con in 2015, we provided demos in our booth and continued to get feedback and reactions from fans. \nSasquatch Game Studio is a small game publishing company formed by three longtime game industry professionals. We initially came together to produce the Primeval Thule Campaign Setting for multiple RPG platforms, and also produced Princes of the Apocalypse, a big adventure for 5th edition D&D. We are all Wizards of the Coast veterans, and we have longstanding relationships with some of the top talent in the biz. For Ultimate Scheme, we brought in two excellent artists: Lee Moyer to help us nail down the game board and design elements, and Claudio Pozas to provide our card illustrations.\nRichard Baker is a best-selling author and award-winning game designer. In addition to extensive RPG design credits, he\u2019s worked on several boardgames and miniature games of note, including the Origins award-winning Conquest of Nerath and Axis and Allies Miniatures game. He also contributed extensively to Risk Godstorm and Axis and Allies Revised.\nDavid Noonan has more than 50 RPG products among his credits, and has written extensively for video games, most recently Motiga's upcoming Gigantic team action game for Windows 10 and Xbox One.\nStephen Schubert hasprovided extensive work for D&D, and also worked on the D&D Miniatures Game, and the short-lived Dreamblade competitive miniatures game.\nLee Moyer has worked as an illustrator on numerous games\u2014RPGs, computer games, CCGs, and more. He collaborated with Keith Baker on The Doom that Came to Atlantic City, published by Cryptozoic Entertainment, and served as the art director (and lead illustrator) for the 13th Age Roleplaying Game.\nLast but not least, Claudio Pozas contributed to Fantasy Flight\u2019s Star Wars and Lord of the Rings LCGs, the Dungeon Crawler ECG by Gifted Vision, and the Ennie Award-winning Counter Collection series by Fiery Dragon, as well as numerous RPGs.\n\"Hitman\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nUltimate Scheme is nearly complete, and the remaining tasks of the core game are incorporating card art and rulebook layout. We foresee no challenges with this, and will press forward with completion once we know we are likely to successfully fund. \n\nPlan Number B, the expansion deck, will require some design and playtesting as we extend the deck through additional stretch goals. Some concepts, such as additional schemes or factions, are less complicated than other elements in the expansion, such as the Interpol Agent or the Single Player mode. We anticipate having the expansion ready to deliver at the same time as the core game. If it is not ready in time, we'll ship it separately after the core game. \n\nUltimate Scheme is our first board game Kickstarter project, and we've made an effort to anticipate the additional work this project requires to follow it through manufacturing and shipping.\n\nIn our previous Kickstarter efforts, we successfully worked with manufacturers in China and external shipping companies, and we are confident that we'll be able to work with a board game manufacturer to get this project completed. We are also confident that we can overcome any additional challenges that arise during the process.\n\nAs of the launch of this project, we are still involved in shipping the last of the stretch goal rewards to our Primeval Thule backers (still within the timeframe we expected when we launched that Kickstarter), but we do not anticipate any conflict in completing that process and running this Kickstarter campaign.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Sasquatch Game Studio LLC\n5 created \u00b7 12 backed\nSasquatch Game Studio LLC is devoted to delivering top-quality hobby game experiences.

We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, and have now just finished up production on Mythica 4 and 5, thanks to the generous backing of our community of fans.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes, Mythica 2: The Darkspore and Mythica 3: The Necromancer have been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers.\nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 4: The Iron Crown - the most epic Mythica film yet!\nYou can learn more about Mythica at: http://www.MythicaMovie.com\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Iron Crown\nWhen a team of unlikely heroes hijacks a steam-powered battle wagon, a daring young wizard (Marek) steals the final piece of the all-powerful Darkspore and embarks on a desperate quest to deliver the cursed artifact to the gods for safe keeping; but when they are caught in a death race between a ruthless team of elite mercenaries and a trinity of demons, Marek must learn to believe in herself before her friends are killed and the Darkspore is lost, to stop the evil necromancer (Szorlok) from uniting the Darkspore and flooding the living world with his legions of undead.\nWatch the trailers for the first three Mythica films below!\nMelanie Stone plays Marek, an escaped slave and natural-born necromancer. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, Riot, and Miracle Maker.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known to his scifi and fantasy fans for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his long-awaited appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew's voice. He is also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and just DM'd for no less than Vin Diesel. Not too shabby.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars, Once I was a Beehive and Dudes and Dragons.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nThe film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all under way. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, lots of magic, giant CGI sets, zeppelins, etc. We want Mythica to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\nWe especially want to make the magic effects better in this film... if you use the trailer as a guide, you'll see examples of our efforts to improve the look of our magical effects.\nBackers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $75,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $75,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution. We love fantasy and science fiction and know there are others out there like us, who we aim to please.\nWe've done several films on Kickstarter in the past - including The Crown and the Dragon, Osombie, The Shadow Cabal, Orc Wars, Survivor, The Christmas Dragon and Mythica 1 - 3, and most of our supporters keep coming back, which means we're doing something right :)\nClick on a name to see our IMDB profiles:\nJason Faller - Writer/Executive Producer\nKynan Griffin - Writer/Executive Producer\nJohn Lyde - Director\nJennifer Griffin - Producer\nYou can learn more about our film-making philosophy and purchase our past projects on our website:\nwww.arrowstormentertainment.com\n STRETCH GOAL #1 - $85,000 \nA behind-the-scenes diary - with essays, Q&A's, and notes from the cast and crew of Mythica 4, with on-set photos from Andrew James, the set photographer. All backers will get a PDF copy sent to them. \nSTRETCH GOAL #2 - $95,000 \nA new Mythica song! We will commission another song to play in the end credits of the film, and we will send you ALL a digital copy of said song. \nSTRETCH GOAL #3 - $100,000 \nA Mythica short story, expanding the universe with whole new scenes and information that you haven't seen on screen. Maybe it's an adventure that Marek and Egan had before the start of Mythica, or maybe it's some Redthorn's adventure between Mythica 2 and 3... I don't know what it will be yet, as we have tons of material to work with... but Jason and I will write it personally -- even though we only really write screenplays, and this will be a new experience for us.

I'm Joel Hodgson. \nOnce upon a time, a television series called MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 was born. We debuted on Minneapolis' KTMA, local television, on Thanksgiving Day 1988, as the world was in the final throes of Teddy Ruxpin-mania. That was almost thirty years ago, but for some reason, people still seem to like the show \u2013 it\u2019s a mitzvah!\nOur show has had a long, strange run. Across a UHF channel, a cable network, cancellation, a feature film, then another cable network, the show lasted for 12 years, two generations of hosts and puppeteers, 2 Emmy nominations and a total of 197 episodes before we got canceled again for good in 1999. Sadly, it was just as Prince predicted.\nBut maybe that's not where it all ends.\nStarting today, we finally get a chance to bring back MST3K.\nWith your help, we can create a new season of MST3K, prove there's still an audience, and maybe even convince a network to bring us back for more.\nGreat question.\nThe simplest answer is that there are a lot of cheesy movies left to riff, and a lot of people who would still enjoy watching them with us.\nPlus, I think there's a place for us. Nowadays, riffing is everywhere! Many people claim that MST3K created a shift in the way people watch TV shows, and that now, as a result, the fields of entertainment have been plowed and readied for a riffing renaissance.\nI mean, look at the influence it\u2019s had... Everyone riffs on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Hell, there are ten to twelve people who are still, unironically, riffing on MySpace and Friendster.\nIn a world where riffing has become as common as our national pastime, baseball, it makes sense: like baseball, everyone knows how to play, but sometimes it feels good to just sit back and watch the original movie riffing team take a whack at it. And if we came back, imagine all the riffs we could make about things like Uber or Cards Against Humanity!\nAlso, there\u2019s a pile of scriptural evidence in whichever sacred text that you hold dear to prove that we need more seasons of MST3K\u2026 so when you share on social media, you know you\u2019re not going to offend anybody.\nYou know, I just read that last sentence... and actually, I\u2019m pretty sure you\u2019re going to offend everybody. But at least you can rest assured that you\u2019ll offend everyone equally.\nWe do, and here's why: I think it's because MST3K is more than just movie riffing. It's a stranger and denser recipe than just saying smart aleck things to a forgotten movie, but I think this is the secret ingredient: we believed that it's easiest to survive the cheesy movie that we're living in with friends who keep us from taking it all too seriously.\nNow, I don\u2019t want to get too maudlin about it, because being too serious is the enemy of comedy. We weren't trying to send a message: job #1 was always to make a funny show. But while we were doing that, I hope we also helped show the kids that society, and the stupid things we say and do to each other, are \"just a show, and you should really just relax.\u201d\nYeah, this is what I was afraid of. Now I\u2019m starting to sound like the Dr. Bronner's label. Next question?\nThe simplest answer is: until now, we couldn't bring MST3K back.\nI've been thinking about ways to re-animate MST3K for over a decade... and over the last 15 years, I've met thousands of you who said that you wanted MST3K back too. But two things have finally changed that make this the right time. And I'm not talking about the legalization of marijuana or the proliferation of water jet pack use.\n1. Crowdfunding gives fans the power to get what they want.\nIn less than two years, I've watched fans use crowdfunding to bring back Veronica Mars, Reading Rainbow and Super Troopers \u2013 all cult favorites, like us \u2013 and it made me wonder how MSTies would respond if we had the chance to return. Now we're going to find out\u2026 and then maybe LeVar Burton can finally stop acting like he\u2019s so much better than us.\n2. We had to work through some complicated legal issues.\nEven though we've always wanted to bring MST3K back, it wasn't that easy. Thanks to the Last Will and Testament of one eccentric old heiress, the rights were tied up for years. It took time to work those issues out, but with the help of my friends at Shout Factory, a special chokehold I perfected in WuDang that I like to call \u201cThe Persuader,\u201d and a night I had to spend in a haunted house as a term of the the old lady\u2019s will, we succeeded.\nThis summer, we finally got all of the rights cleared up\u2026 and now, like Orpheus, we can now descend into hell to hang out with a couple of wisecracking robots.\nNow we're talking!\nOur Kickstarter campaign has two really important goals.\nAs soon as we reach our minimum goal of $2,000,000, we'll be able to make three new feature length episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000. But then, for each additional $1.1 million we raise, we can make three more... up to a full season of 12 episodes!\n(If you're wondering why new episodes cost so much \u2013 especially the first three \u2013 keep going down the page to \"HOW WE'LL USE YOUR MONEY,\" or take a look at the Backer Update where I explained the budget in detail.)\nHere's a simple diagram to help you remember our goals:\nIf we can raise even more than that, I'd love to shoot some (or all) of the new season LIVE in front of an audience \u2013 and maybe even stream the show live on the internet! (Oh yeah: I just saw your eyes light up.)\nFinally, if we raise $1 BILLION \u2013 stay with me on this one \u2013 we\u2019re going to adopt a real live teenage boy and \u201cTruman Show\u201d him into believing he is the Pumaman!\nHear us out, because this goal is just as important: we're not just crowdfunding because we need funding. \nWe're also doing it because we need the crowd!\nIf we want a lot more MST3K, we need to work together to prove that there's still an audience out there that wants MST3K \u2013 and that this isn't all some pitiable delusion \u2013 so that we can find a network or online platform who will agree to pick up the show and keep it going\u2026 hopefully for another 200+ episodes.\nEven if you can only spare $5 or $10, every extra backer helps us send a message to the networks: it's time to #BringBackMST3K.\n____\nOkay. It's time for me to put away the grease gun and give you your marching orders.\nIf any of this rings true to you, we need your help now to spread the word. Back in the day, every episode of MST3K ended with a message that encouraged fans to \u201cKeep Circulating the Tapes.\u201d And you guys did.\nThose grassroots efforts helped MST3K find friends and fans at a time when the rest of show business didn\u2019t quite know what to make of us. It was social media in its most primitive form... and because of you, it worked.\nToday's, it's time to update that phrase for the internet age. If you're with us, this is your call to action, MSTies.\nAnd while you're at it, you can help out even more by taking a minute to follow us on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. (Apparently those matter more than Nielsen ratings, now!)\nListen, I know this Kickstarter idea isn\u2019t for everyone. Neither was Mystery Science Theater 3000. But just like MST3K itself, I know the right people will get it.\nThanks for reading. I hope you'll join us. \nJoel\nDear People of the Internet,\nWelcome to my first-ever Official Crow-Funding Campaign.

Plus a few hat parties.\n\nAlso, I\u2019d like to open up a long-overdue public dialogue on Cee-Lo Green and his fashion choices.\n\nThen, I plan on turning at least a thousand dollars\u2019 worth of funds into pennies, which I will press into elongated souvenir coins at theme parks and fairs.\n\nFinally, if you are still undecided, I ask you to consider this: after years of waiting, I will finally get to decide who lives and who dies. You don\u2019t want to be on the wrong list, do you?\nI look forward to your loyal service in the many years of the New Golden Age to come.\nYour Future Supreme Being,\nCrow T. Robot\nHello, Ladies.\nI'm pleased to be with you again. It's been too long. Now that we're about to be a huge crowdfunding hit, I've got a few things I'd like to discuss with you.\nIt turns out that the last 15 years have been kind to our legacy: we're famous now. And not internet famous, either. Real famous. I have lots of female fans.\nAngelina, Scarlett, and many women named Madison: I've got parts in the new show with your names on them. You can come over and we can run lines in my bungalow, and I\u2019ll make us a curry. Then if things get \u201cconsensual,\u201d so be it.\nI\u2019ll also pretty much be the \u201ctroubleshooter\u201d on this Kickstarter campaign, because I understand how you think and I\u2019m a master of social media. My god: you do realize that I\u2019m the uncredited creator of both memes and avatars?\nI\u2019M ALSO THE FIRST SENTIENT BEING TO TYPE A MESSAGE IN ALL CAPS.\nWhat are you waiting for? Get out to the Kickstarter polls and start voting.\nYours,\nTom Servo\nHey everyone. It's Joel again.\nLook, I know what you're wondering, so go ahead\u2026 just say it.\nBelieve me, man. I get it. If it cost $2 million just to make three episodes, we'd be spending almost $700K per show! And you're right: by itself, an episode of MST3K doesn't cost nearly that much. \nThe real explanation is pretty simple.\n1. We don't get to keep all of the money we raise on Kickstarter! \nCAMPAIGN FEES: Out of the first $2,000,000, we have to pay about 8% \u2013 that's $160,000 \u2013 in fees to Kickstarter and the credit card processor.\n\nREWARD & SHIPPING COSTS: Then, we have to design, produce, print, sort and ship all of the rewards we're offering in exchange for your pledge. (Those t-shirts aren't free, you know!) That costs about 27%, so that's another $540,000.\n(We're not charging you twice for shipping, I promise. Even though Kickstarter asks you to add more for shipping, they count that money toward the total we've raised, even though we still have to spend it on, you know\u2026 shipping!)\nSo, out of the first $2,000,000 we raise, we have to spend $700,000 just on the costs of this Kickstarter campaign!\n2. Then, we have to spend a lot on startup costs just to get the show going. \nTo shoot new episodes, there's a lot we'll need to do: creating concept art and designs, building sets, making models, creating costumes, adding new features to upgrade the robots, and all sorts of other things. All of that work costs money, which is why our first $2,000,000 includes $550,000 for startup costs. The good part is that every penny of that ends up on screen where you can see it.\n3. But... the more episodes we make, the less each episode costs! \nWe have to spend the same amount up front, no matter how many episodes we make. If we only make 3 episodes, these costs increase the budget for each episode by $183K\u2026 but if we make a full 12, they only increase it by $46K each!\nAnyway, once you take out the CAMPAIGN, REWARD and STARTUP COSTS, there's a lot less than $2,000,000 left. In fact, that leaves just $750K for three episodes, which \u2013 I hope \u2013 sounds a lot more reasonable than $2,000,000!\nAt the end of the day, our goal is to make each episode for around $250K.\nTo put that in perspective, that means we're spending less to create 90 minutes of MST3K than even the low-end reality shows spend to make 22 minutes! (Really makes ya think, don't it?) \nNow, if you're as tired of reading as I am of writing, here are some wicked cool graphics that explain all of this:\nI know not everyone will want this much explanation, but if I'm asking you to trust me with your money, I think it's important to be crystal clear about how we're using it. \nPlus, $750K for each set of three episodes feels a lot better than $2,000,000. \n(But man, I'd hate to try to sell a car to you people. Tough crowd!)\nHopefully by now, you're already on board. Maybe you're not even reading this. Maybe you've already made your contribution, selected your rewards, and are now rushing around the internet helping spread the good word to all of your MST3K-deprived friends!\nBut if you're still on the fence, maybe I can make it easier for you.\nPersonally, I think the most compelling reason to help out is that you want to see new episodes of MST3K\u2026 and not just for you. Think of the friends and family who you can finally introduce to the new MST3K: the one with a fresh new cast, fresh new riffs, and zesty new cheesy movies!\nOn the other hand, let\u2019s not any of us forget: this is Kickstarter. I know that you know that that\u2019s gonna mean some cool rewards for helping us out. And for a show that\u2019s never really been about cool merch...I think we\u2019ve finally got some!\nUPDATE! We've gotten a lot of questions asking exactly what's included with each package, so we've put together another helpful little chart:\nYou can see all of the rewards on the right side of the page, but here are a few highlights:\nBecome... Part of MYSTERY SCIENCE HISTORY!\nAll backers \u2013 no matter what you pledge \u2013 will be invited to join the new MST3K Information Club. (It's like the old MST3K Info Club, only better. And modern. And more exclusive. And wider in the hips.) Over the next year, we'll invite you to help us rediscover MST3K and get it oiled up and running smoothly. You'll be part of the process!\nRead... Our Page-Turning Insider Updates \nWe don't just want to take your cash and walk away: we want to take your cash and talk away! Most Kickstarter projects promise \"exclusive behind-the-scenes updates,\" but this time, I mean it: I've already started planning things I want to share with you. It'll be like getting email from me, Crow and Servo for at least a year.\nPossess... Amazing, Terrifying, Heart-Warming New MST3K Swag\nBefore the end of the campaign, we'll start sharing the designs we're planning for some of the #BringBackMST3K swag you can get, including the OFFICIAL T-SHIRT ($50+), OFFICIAL MUG ($75+), OFFICIAL KEYCHAIN ($100+), OFFICIAL POSTER ($150), and many more. We've got several amazing artists working on this stuff. I can't wait for you to see it.\nTake Control.... of the New Episodes!Bringing back MST3K isn't enough power for you? Great! For real high-rollers, we're offering all sorts of ways to be part of the episodes themselves. You can\u2026\nSteal the hearts of millions when you... APPEAR IN AN EPISODE! \nThrow your weight around and\u2026 BECOME A PRODUCER! \nKickstart your new riffing career and\u2026 HELP WRITE AN EPISODE!\nImmortalize your favorite inside joke with\u2026 A PERSONAL RIFF!\nOwn and Command... Your OWN Robot Friend!\nThis one is difficult for me, but I want to make sure this Kickstarter succeeds, so I'm willing to make the sacrifice: a very limited number of you can KEEP THE ACTUAL CROW and/or SERVO FEATURED IN A NEW EPISODE! They'll record a personalized video for you, and then we'll ship them off to your doorstep. When we're done shooting.\n1. FOLLOW \"@MST3K\" ON ALL OF OUR SOCIAL CHANNELS.Be sure to follow our official accounts on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram. Ask your fellow MSTies to follow them too! Tell them that those numbers have a really big impact when we start asking networks to #BringBackMST3K for more new seasons.\n2. CIRCULATE THE MESSAGES AT THE END OF EACH UPDATE. At the end of each Backer Update, Crow or Servo will share a message or image that you can copy and paste to share with your friends, to help spread the word.\n3. KEEP CIRCULATING THE FACTS\u2026 NICELY! I know there are still some fans out there who are skeptical about this Kickstarter, about why MST3K costs so much money and how we'll spend it, about bringing in a third cast, about who is and isn't going to be involved\u2026 So, like they say on the subway, \"If you see something, say something!\" If you hear fans insisting that $2MM is more than we need to make three episodes, or that the old team isn't invited back, I hope you'll share the facts with them. (Please be nice, though! The internet needs a lot more of that.)\n4. JOIN (OR START) A LOCAL MST3K MEETUP GROUP.\nThe internet is great, but sometimes riffing is even better when you can meet old (and new) friends in person! There are already a lot of MST3K groups on meetup.com, but if there's not one near you, start one now and invite your friends! We've got some events planned for this month, and we'll be calling on all the local groups to be part of them.\nAs long as we have the funds we need, we'll be able to produce new episodes. That part is easy! But over the last month, I've had lots of time to think about all the possible risks and challenges MST3K could face...\nMAYBE THE WORLD HAS CHANGED!\nMST3K has been away for a long time. YouTube didn't even exist when we shot the last episode of MST3K. (Yes, Virginia, there was a world before YouTube. People laughed more back then. Colors were brighter. There were concerts in the park.)\nI've imagined many hypothetical risks:\nWhat if no one enjoys watching B-movies anymore? \n What if you don't want us talking while you do? \n What if there is an unknown virus that has killed mankind's ability to enjoy a good solid ironic viewing? \nWhat if kids playing in \u201cGarry\u2019s Mod\u201d on Twitch have made the whole thing meaningless? \nWhat if robot-shaped puppets don\u2019t have the overwhelming cultural significance they once did? \nWhat if our collective consciousness can\u2019t take the excitement, and the entire world becomes a flash mob, and we all steal our own TVs?\nWhat if all eight billion people on the planet become a single \u201cImprov Everywhere\u201d troupe, but don\u2019t have anyone left to surprise?!?\nAs you can see, this whole endeavor is fraught with risks.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been over this!

Why a kickstarter now you may ask? Well, for the past few years Frank has come straight out of pocket and that pocket is now empty... or it has a hole in it... either way there's nothing but lint and a pawn shop receipt in there and neither buys anything.\nWe just need a little help (miniscule really) getting past the post production finish line. All six episodes of season one are shot, picture is locked and 95% color corrected,  and audio is near a final mix. We just need to get a few dollars to pay for music composition, cast and crew screening (the crew went above and beyond they deserve it), web space and design, a handful digital FX work, and a few post production odds and ends.\nThis production has spent at least $15,000 (... I lost count after a while) on this labor of love (maybe an albatross at this point). Many people on the cast and crew have contributed hundreds of man hours already for a web series we consider to be pretty special and unique.\nPlease help us get it across that line!\n\n\nSincerely,\n\nTony Tibbetts (Executive Producer)\nAutumn Perrotta (Co-Producer)\nMichael Scott Robinson (Associate Producer)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risk with any crowd funded project is that the project will never see the light of day. Which is not really a huge risk in this scenario because the project is at least 90% complete. Will Frank get completed without fundraising? Probably, but not very soon and not at the level of quality we think it deserves. I think the cast and crew who have contributed their time and energy deserve the best product possible. \n\nIf the project is successfully funded I believe any obstacles will be minor and easily surmountable.

This campaign is also featuring an all original cyberpunk themed boardgame, CYBER:RUN! The 1-4 player, co-operative strategy boardgame will blend film and boardgaming to a whole new level.\nThe Gamers: Natural One\nIn 2013, our partners at Zombie Orpheus Entertainment teamed up with Lynnvander Media and created 2 awesome movies in The Gamers universe: The Gamers: Humans & Households and The Gamers: Natural 1. Since then both projects have won awards, and The Gamers: Natural 1 recently won Best in Genre at the 2015 Gen Con Film Festival.\nThe Gamers: Natural 1 takes The Gamers property to a new genre of gaming, the futuristic cyber-punk style games. With the story taking two of Dead Gentlemen's and Zombie Orpheus' well known characters from our movies The Gamers: Dorkness Rising and The Gamers: Hands of Fate, Gary & Leo, Natural 1 expanded Gary's family and established a new terrific cast and storyline.\nBy successfully funding this Kickstarter we will be able to continue this story as well as create an epic board game to go along with it.\nThe Budget\nSo where is all this money going? How does it all break out? Pretty much like this:\nThe Gamers: Natural 20 picks up six months after The Gamers: Natural 1 left off. Monica and Ryan are preparing for their wedding. Gary and Leo have come to wish them well. But happiness is short lived as Ryan\u2019s business partners make a deal with a nefarious CEO without his consent. His only chance to make things right? MURDER. No, wait. CYBER:RUN. And murder. Oh, come on. A little murder? No? No murder? OK, fine. On this exhaustingly murder-free journey, Monica and Ryan team up with old friends and new. To victory? Who knows? We just know it\u2019ll be on the low end of the scale when it comes to most murders on film. Thanks a lot, standards and practices.\n\nHow Social Stretch Goals Work\nUnlocking Social Stretch Goals enhances reward levels or unlocks a reward for all backers.

We're also excited to announce some new cast being added to the CYBER:RUN line-up. Some of the cast will be flying into Ontario, Canada from the US and other faraway places to make this production nothing but awesome. We need your help getting them here to make an amazing film.\nDead Gentlemen Productions and Lynnvander Media Inc are poised to make an amazing sequel. \nThe Gamers: Natural 20 is based off the works \"The Gamers\" created by Matt Vancil. The\"Natural 20\" universe is created by Thomas Gofton and written by Andy Dopieralski. The film will be directed by Andy Dopieralski and will employ the avenger-like powers of the creative team Zack Ready (Director of Photography), Chris Wilker (VFX Supervisor - N1), Johnathan Karkar (Score - N1), Rob Mayer (Make-up), Mitch Mommaerts (Steadi-cam) and Aaron Soch (Sound Design - N1). The project will be produced by Scott C. Brown, Don Early and Thomas Gofton.\nCYBER:RUN is a fully cooperative action-strategy board game for 1-4 players. The game takes place in a corporate headquarters where players must work together, fighting the security forces, hacking security systems, and collecting resources to complete a series of objectives. As the turns pass the game gets more difficult, forcing players to work quickly to complete their objectives. CYBER:RUN is drenched in the humor and style of The Gamers: Natural 20, and includes a series of optional video-clips that feature the characters of The Gamers: Natural 20, and replace many of the game's cards.  \nKey:\nYellow means you choose either DVD or BluRay, but not both.\nPurple means you get 2 each.\nThe DVD - The DVD will contain the movie, a trailer, and any special features we are able to include. This may include Outtakes, Deleted Scenes, Commentaries and more!\nThe BluRay - The BluRay will be identical to the DVD, just in HD.\nMockup of CYBER:COIN in Ultimate CYBER:RUNNER Package\nCYBER:PARTY - We are holding a CYBER:RUN party at Gen Con Indy 2016 and we hope you can make it.

Duties are not included in your shipping charge. However, they may not apply anyway.\nOnce the campaign has reached its goal, we have some great Stretch Goals planned. These goals will enhance both the movie and the board game!!! There is a lot we want to add and make this already amazing movie CYBER-AWESOME!!! Things like cameos, new scenes, etc.\nAfter the campaign is over there is typically a survey you as a backer need to fill out. This will provide us with the necessary information to ship your rewards to you. Additionally you will be able to pick up extra copies of the movie, the game, and any other Add-On\u2019s we offer that you can\u2026 wait for it\u2026 add on to your order.

With 3 live action films and 1 animated film, we\u2019re focusing on characters from myth, legend, and faery tale.\nWe\u2019re here to explore intimate, magical stories found in poetry and bring them to life on film.\nStill from \"The Worn Out Shoes\" photoshoot by Kat St. John Photography\nWhen artists collaborate, something magical happens. Something new that reflects many intentions, many ways of seeing and responding to the world. It\u2019s easy to find beautiful, ongoing collaborations between poets and dancers, photographers, textile artists, and even graphics artists\u2026 but what about poets and independent, narrative filmmakers?\nTell Your Children is for people who love independent film, for people who love contemporary, original poetry, and for people who love faery tales, myths and legends. We want to create something new, something layered and engaging to present to an audience. Ultimately, we hope to inspire and encourage more collaboration among artists of varying genres.\nOur main focus is to make a quality poetry short (the first of hopefully many!). The second is to fairly pay the professional cast & crew who will help us make it. That\u2019s why we want to show our appreciation for YOUR support in 3 basic categories: \nDigital rewards are delivered digitally, with no shipping overhead, and put your contribution directly into the film. For instance, The Poems at the $30 level will be delivered digitally, saving shipping and paper, and will be pretty enough for you to print out and display, share, or fold into a poetical origami swan, if you choose!\nArtist rewards are works of art, created just for this campaign by artists whose work inspires us, and are placed at reward levels that allow us to compensate the creators for their time to craft and deliver.\nProducer-level rewards offer a big, personal thank you for Super Contributors.\n...of course, we have a couple of extra special rewards for good measure! \nFor those who love our makeup co-artists, Espionage Cosmetics, we have a limited quantity of  \"Tell Your Children Faery Tale Nails,\" a specially curated 3-design set of high-quality, adhesive nail art (which includes the digital link to the film). Learn more about the Faery Tale Nails in the FAQ.\nFaery Tale Nails\nAnd for those of you who clicked over from the Dead Gentlemen, ZOE, or JourneyQuest, Emilie plans to have a little too much fun recording a series of downloadable Wren ringtones.\nStretch Goals\nOur goal is $6,000, which will allow us to produce 3 live action poetry shorts.

We can't wait to reveal them to you as the campaign progresses!\nWe are scheduled to shoot the 3 live-action films this coming November, 2015. Each short will be filmed (or drawn!) on location in the Pacific Northwest. We live in a beautiful, moody, mysterious place, and it\u2019s bursting with creative talent at every seam.\nThe creator of Tell Your Children is Emilie Rommel Shimkus, a poet, actress, vocalist, and 3rd generation NW native. Her poetry has recently appeared in the anthologies Sarasvati Takes Pegasus as Her Mount and In Tahoma\u2019s Shadow. As an actress, Emilie is perhaps best known as Wren, a bardic graduate student on the trail of her epic in the fantasy comedy JourneyQuest. Emilie has also appeared in many other short films, commercial campaigns, stage productions, playwrights' festivals, and as a voice actor in video games. In addition to writing the 4 poems in TYC, Emilie will direct 1 short, act in 1 short, and provide voice-over for the entire project.\nOur producer, Rose Hall is also a PNW native and has produced short, feature, and commercial projects. Recent work includes Brothers, (writer, director), Valley of the Sasquatch (associate producer), Marla Mae (co-producer), and her feature film Fugue, currently in development (writer, producer, director).\nOur directors and director of photography are all active, experienced members of the Puget Sound film, theatre, and poetry communities.\nWe are also lucky to add the varied talents and expertise from working artists for our animation, sound track, poster design, and makeup/special effects design.\nTell Your Children is the inaugural film production of The Northwest Renaissance, a non-profit (501c3) organization with more than 30 years committed to the mission to bring poetry to the communities of the Puget Sound area in Washington State. We do readings, workshops, and publications, and we\u2019re excited to add film as a whole new way to inspire and welcome.\nWe are supported by our producing partners, The Tacoma Arts Commission and 4Culture\u2014who have already awarded the Tacoma Artist\u2019s Initiative Program grant to this project\u2014 and by Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, who will provide added distribution venues after we complete and publicly screen the films.\nWe are so proud to be a female-centric, inclusive, and family-friendly film set. That means that all of our key crew positions are female, including the creator, producers, directors, director of photography, assistant director, and several other positions. It also means our set and shooting schedule will be purposefully designed to accommodate working parents and mothers of infants.\nThank you so much for reading ALL of this! Thank you in advance for any contributions you are moved to make to help us create new, engaging art. And please help us spread the word!

Click here for details: \nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/arrowstorm/mythica-3-the-necromancer-starring-kevin-sorbo/posts/1373239\nMythica is the most ambitious indie fantasy project ever undertaken. We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, with two more films in the Mythica series planned, thanks to the generous backing of our community of fans.\nMythica 1: A Quest for Heroes and Mythica 2: The Darkspore have been completed and all rewards have been shipped to our wonderful Kickstarter Backers.\nAnd now, we're super excited to share Mythica 3: The Necromancer - our favorite of the Mythica films thus far!\nAlso, if we don't make our goal, Kevin Sorbo is going to be very... DISAPPOINTED!!!\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Necromancer\nWhen her most loyal friend is taken hostage by Peregus Malister, the cruel master of the Thieves Guild, Marek must embark on a corrupt mission to serve the Thieves Guild with her team of would-be heroes. But when the mission leads them into the clutches of Szorlok - their greatest enemy - Marek must sacrifice her ambitions and perhaps her own soul before her friends are killed, to stop Szorlok from obtaining the Darkspore.\nWatch the trailers for the first two Mythica films below!\nMelanie Stone plays Marek, a natural-born necromancer with a club foot. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, and the off-broadway rock opera, Deep Love.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars and the upcoming release, Dragon Warriors.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series, including Disney's Life Bites.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his long-awaited appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor, and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew. He is also Dungeon Master supreme over at Critical Role, and just DM'd for no less that Vin Diesel. Not too shabby.\nPhilip Brodie plays Betylla, evil henchman of the Thieves Guild. Philip is an extremely talented British actor and writer, known for Zombie Diaries 2, Dawn of the Dragonslayer and A Landscape of Lies.\nRobert Jayne plays Peregus Malister, the sinister head of the Thieves Guild. Robert is a veteran actor and writer, best known for Tremors, Pearl Harbor and Different Strokes.\n The film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all underway. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, dragon sequences, etc. We want the movie to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\n Backers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $75,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $75,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\n We're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade.

I'm excited to share our newest project, Women in Practical Armor.\nEdited by Ed Greenwood and Gabrielle Harbowy, this project is important to all three of us because we feel showcasing an already empowered female warrior is essential. If women in fantasy are capable and intelligent enough to lead in battle, wouldn't they also be intelligent enough to protect their abdomens, tie their hair back, and cover their faces while fighting?\nEvil Girlfriend Media is passionate about breaking stereotypes and creating new mythology, and our goal with this project is to bring you high quality, well-edited stories that will take the fantasy genre to a new level.\nOur authors are a talented and energetic bunch, and as the campaign progresses we'll be sharing interviews, anecdotes, trivia, and special pledge levels from some of the biggest names in science fiction and fantasy. \nEd Greenwood-Editor: An award-winning Canadian writer and game designer, Ed's books have sold millions of copies worldwide, and his writing credits would easily fill this entire page.\nGabrielle Harbowy-Editor: In addition to being the Managing Editor at Dragon Moon Press, Gabrielle is an award-nominated short story writer and anthologist whose first novel comes out next year. This is her fourth anthology collaboration with co-editor Ed Greenwood..\nErik Scott de Bie: The author of eight novels and counting, speculative fiction is only one of Erik's many talents, which include designing tabletop RPGs, mentoring new writers, fencing, and frenetic rock karaoke.\nJudith Tarr: An award-winning fantasy author and frequent finalist on World Fantasy and Locus award ballots, Judith has been writing steadily since her first novel released in 1985.\nTodd J. McCaffrey: New York Times bestselling author Todd McCaffrey has written more than a dozen books and numerous short stories.\nMary Robinette Kowal: Hugo Award-winning author, award-winning puppeteer, and voice actor, Mary Robinette Kowal also won the 2008 Campbell award for Best New Writer, and is one of the hosts of the Hugo Award-winning podcast Writing Excuses.\nBecause we not only want to do this book, we want to do it right. With your generous pledges, this campaign has covered the costs of production in advance. Our continuing goal is to secure funds to properly market Women in Practical Armor as a major release, as well as pave the way for similar projects in the future.\nOne important component of our Kickstarter that we want backers to know is that the first month of royalties of the book will go to a PTSD charity chosen by Gabrielle Harbowy and me. Every day can feel like a battle for those with PTSD, and we want our backers to know that because of them funding the book, we want to give back.\nWe've got an armory full of great rewards for our backers, so why not try one on for size? As the campaign progresses, we'll be unveiling special offers from our authors, add-ons for your pledges, and more!\nHere's a look at a couple items besides the anthology itself included in our backer levels.\n\nStarting at the PATENT OF NOBILITY level ($50 or more), backers receive a limited edition medallion keychain, crafted by Eloise J. Knapp.\nAt the CLOTH COIF level ($150 or more) Editor Gabrielle Harbowy is offering to knit a \"yarn mail\" hood for five lucky backers. Crafted from a design by (and used with permission) Etsy creator WeeBeeUniquesByJulie, it's the perfect thing to keep your head warm and protected while reading our mind-blowing stories!\nThis coif is only one of the special offers put forth by our creators. For example, Contributor Eric Landreneau has offered an e-book copy of his novel Break! A Tale of Cursed Blood to all backers at the CAP level and above.\nBut this book is bigger than just us, and as mentioned above we want to market and promote it as a major release. Your pledges enable us to do just that, and now that we've funded, we're counting on your help to spread the word about how awesome it is.\nSo let's talk about\nThanks to your support, we've covered the costs of production, including paying our authors and artists professional rates. We know all the places we'd like to market this book, and we know more or less what it costs to do so.\nAnd it costs a lot. Money most independent publishers don't have to spend, so many great projects never go out to more than a few hundred people. We're looking to all of our new friends to help us spread the message in the time we have left, so that we can give Women in Practical Armor the launch it deserves.\nOur first two stretch goals are modest ones, but they have significant impact on how we move forward in marketing the book.\n$7000\nBacker T-shirts (UNLOCKED)\nThanks to our backers, our wonderful Women in Practical Armor T-shirts are now included in all backer levels $100 and up, and are available as $25 add-ons to backer levels MAIL SHIRT and higher. So check out this awesome backer exclusive in the Add-Ons section below, and get ready for our next stretch goal of...\n$10000\nRaises for WiPA contributors (UNLOCKED)\nWe're already paying our authors professional rates, but we'd love to pay them more. So if we raise at least $10000 with this campaign, we'll be re-writing our contracts to compensate them at 8 cents a word.\nThat's kind of a big deal. And it will certainly raise some eyebrows in the publishing world. Which is exactly what we want. We're changing the world, remember? It starts story by story, one word at a time. And with your help, we'll be there before you know it.\n$12500\nEd Greenwood and Gabrielle Harbowy (UNLOCKED)\nYou probably know by now that our esteemed co-editors can put together a great book, but did you know they can write? Because if we can raise least $12500 with this campaign, they\u2019ve agreed to co-author an original story for Women in Practical Armor! We\u2019re really excited about this stretch goal, and hope you are too.\n$15000\nBackers-only Release Party (UNLOCKED)\nNorwescon 39 in Seatac, WA is a major science fiction event in the Pacific Northwest, and just so happens to fall right in our expected release window. We\u2019re going to be there promoting the heck out of Women in Practical Armor and other EGM releases, but we also want to recognize all the backers whose support made this project possible.\nSo let\u2019s be honest, of course we\u2019re going to have a party. But instead of just a noisy affair in a cramped convention hotel room, we want to invite the entire legion to celebrate with us at once! So if we raise at least $15000 with this campaign, we\u2019re closing the doors to the general public, and opening it up the entire world.\nThat\u2019s right, if we hit this goal the WiPA backer party will be broadcast live on the web, and you\u2019re all invited! We\u2019ll have contests, prizes, contributor interviews and advance readings, as well as a few surprises. (I have it on good authority that Queen Katie loves to sing).\n$20000\nBecause some women like to do it alone, in the shadows.\nThis stretch goal is one we\u2019ve wanted to announce since this campaign started. Women in Practical Armor was never meant to be alone on your bookshelf. It was meant to be the first of several anthologies featuring already empowered female protagonists. So with this in mind, we're now proud to announce the second volume in the series, and our final stretch goal for this campaign.\nWomen in Comfortable Shoes will present stories of rogues, thieves, assassins, and other self-assured ladies, and with your help, we can do it in style. Right now we can't share much more information than the title, but if we hit our stretch goal we'll be able to guarantee the same pay rate of 8 cents a word to all our authors that we're offering for Women in Practical Armor.\nBut wait, there's more.\n Battle Ready Poster ($10)\nActual woman in practical armor Ann Shilling\nWe teased our Battle-Ready backer poster on day one, and are now prepared to share more about it.  \nAs a $10 add-on for backers at PAULDRONS level and higher, we're offering this full color, 12 x 18 poster detailing the armor worn by real-life woman in practical armor Ann Shilling during our Kickstarter video.\nAnd if that weren't enough, we've got a special reward for our backers at MAIL SHIRT and higher levels. It's this crazy new book called...\nExtra Copy ($12)\nYou've already secured yourself a copy of our trade paperback, and possibly even an e-book as well. But what about your friends? No matter how successful our campaign is, or our subsequent marketing efforts, there will always be someone down the line who's looking for a good read and just doesn't know what to pick.\nBut you do. As a $12 add-on, you can order an additional trade paperback of Women in Practical Armor to share with them. This backer-exclusive price is only available through this campaign, and is available multiple times per pledge.\nBacker T-Shirts ($25)\nSo cool. So Comfortable\nWe've been talking about \"mobile marketing\" for a while now, and although some Kickstarter campaigns lead with extras like this, we wanted to keep the focus on the book and our authors. Now that that's out of the way, we're happy to announce our Women in Practical Armor backer shirts.\nThese great shirts are available as a $25 add-on to backer levels MAIL SHIRT and higher, and automatically included in all backer levels $100 and higher.\nTo add any of these great bonus items to your existing backer reward, increase your total pledge (using the \"Manage Pledge\" option) to cover the cost of each item you want. \nFor a poster, add $10 to your pledge\nFor an additional trade paperback, add $12 to your pledge\nFor a backer t-shirt, add $25 to your pledge\nThere's no need to change your backer level\u2014in fact, we recommend you do not, unless a different level has other options you want (signed copies, medallion keychains, etc). Changing your backer level does not automatically qualify you for an add-on\u2014you will still need to pledge additional funds for additional items.\nAfter our campaign is complete, we'll send a survey to all backers through which you can identify the items you want. If you want to make sure we know your wishes, send us a message as well (Not a comment, though we'll read that too).\nSo what do you say, backers? Are you ready to march an extra few milestones with us? Because we guarantee there's more cool stuff waiting for us down this road.

It was a financial strain for my husband and me; we no longer had to pay daycare, but we were still looking at a bit of stress from losing my income. \nAt the time, I was teaching music classes at my daughter\u2019s daycare twice a week in exchange for two days of childcare. I learned a bunch of standard children\u2019s songs, including \u201cThe Wheels on the Bus.\u201d At home, we sang the song often, and the Mommies on the bus and the Daddies on the bus always said \u201cI love you.\u201d At school, the Mommies on the bus said \u201cshh shh shh,\u201d and the Daddies on the bus said \u201ckeep the baby quiet!\u201d complete with finger wagging and stern faces.\nThis floored me. Daddies are just as capable as Mommies of soothing their distressed children, and the whole idea that a Daddy would sternly tell their partner in parenthood to \u201ckeep the baby quiet\u201d was upsetting and unfair. I took my outrage to social media, telling the story, and saying \u201cwouldn\u2019t it be funny if I wrote an album of progressive, feminist children\u2019s songs, with titles like \u2018Only Yes Means Yes\u2019 and \u2018Princesses are for Everyone\u2019 and \u2018Wheelchairs are for Wheelies.\u2019\u201d\nThe response was a resounding \u201cYES YOU SHOULD DO THAT, I WOULD BUY IT.\u201d A friend of mine even replied with \u201cThe Mommies on the Bus Say Smash the Patriarchy.\u201d (Ok, he didn't say \"smash.\" Use your imagination.) After much deliberation, I decided to name the project \u201cYes Means Yes!\u201d and adopted a new children\u2019s music persona named Ms. Cacie (my nickname). \nMy aim is to help people educate children about being good to each other and themselves, embracing diversity, and supporting each other with understanding and compassion. I now have 14 songs ready to be recorded, but I need your help to offset the cost of recording and producing the album.

September and October are my busy season with music and other part-time work; I'm hoping to start recording as soon as possible, but there is a chance I won't be able to start until early November, which gives me four months to accomplish recording, mixing, mastering, getting album art, and printing CDs.

Coloring is fun and calming for me. \nI started drawing people I love and respect because, let's face it, the world can be pretty sh**ty sometimes and adoringly painting the faces of friends really made me feel better.\nColoring a picture of my sister\nI have been sharing some of these pictures on social media and the response has been wonderful - turns out a lot of you enjoy coloring AND feminism! From those drawings, the idea for the Badass Feminist Coloring Book was born.\nWho's in this book?\nThis book has a collection of well known feminists like writer Lindy West and comedian/writer Jenny Yang and everyday badass feminists that you haven't met yet, but who have awesome things to say. These people are writers, comedians, mothers, daughters, sex workers. There are feminists of different ages, races, body types, gender identities - this is the intersectional feminist coloring book you've been waiting for.\nFeatured Feminists so far(note, this list is very likely to grow and change):\nWagatwe Wanjuki, Lindy West, Hari Kondabolu, Kimya Dawson, Feminista Jones, Jenny Yang, Jennifer Pozner, Margaret Corvid, Madison Foster, Marcella Arguello, Elicia Sanchez, Betsey Brock, Kaylani Perisho, Avital Nathman,  Michi Trota, Talcott Broadhead,  AND MORE\nAwesome pictures, inspiring quotes - and you can scribble on their faces- this book has it all!\nGimme the book details.\nThis is a coloring book printed on high quality paper made by - you know- professional book makers. I plan on featuring at least 20 different feminists - however, if the funding is there, I'll definitely add more. Each feminist gets their own page and a badass feminist quote, like this:\na page from the Badass Feminist Coloring Book\nWhere does the money go?\nI think it's obvious from the goal that nobody is trying to get rich here, but let me break down where the $4k is going:\n25% gratuity for the feminists featured (I don't believe feminists should work for free)\n30% printing and shipping\n30% labor and artwork fees (I'm drawing every one of these pages)\n15% fees, unanticipated costs etc.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProvided I don't suddenly lose my ability to draw - there aren't many risks to this project.

He is a man of stern political beliefs, ones that he is more than willing to kill for.\nIn the first film, Bill went on a rampage in his hometown of Tenderville, Oregon that left 93 people dead. He disappeared soon after, leaving a video that promised he would rise again...\nIn Rampage: Capital Punishment, Bill took over a TV station in Washington, D.C. Using a hostage camera crew, he let the world witness the carnage. As the police tried to intervene, he detonated explosives hidden within the station, killing everyone inside.\nBill however escaped, and has been waiting, biding his time until now...\nUwe Boll on the set of Rampage: Capital Punishment\nOver 35 years of making films, good and bad, exciting and depressing, controversial and amusing, I have found in my Rampage films something I am truly proud of. Rampage is my favourite of all of my films, and the first time I felt I made something that both reflected me fully as an artist, and engaged the audience in the way I intended.\nEver since we made the first film, fans have been clamouring for more from Bill Williamson, and I felt that we should strike now. Bill, his politics and ethics aside, is a character who believes what he is doing is for the people, and the first two films have struck a chord with audiences in a way that surprised even me. So why not get them involved?\nI want to give you the chance to be a part of the action. Let's make a film for the people, by the people.\n- Uwe Boll, Director of the Rampage trilogy\nBill Williamson (Brendan Fletcher) delivering his message to the world\nUpon making Rampage: Capital Punishment, we were hindered in raising finance due to how much the first film had been pirated online. I love that Rampage reached so many people, but to those who finance films it was obviously worrying that they would not see a return on their investment, and so we had a much smaller budget than the first film.\nThe money we raise here will support entirely Rampage 3's final action scene, which will leave the streets of Washington ruined, in a sequence more explosive than anything scene before in the Rampage trilogy.\nHelp us by simply pre-buying the film, so that we can guarantee we will get to make the film we want to make, and you will want to see. We also really do want you to be in the action, and are offering our backers the chance to actually be there amidst the chaos!\nSo join us, and together we will conclude the trilogy in the biggest way possible!\nJust a few of our amazing rewards!\nWe're offering you the chance to be a part of the final chapter in the Rampage trilogy. Through simply buying the exciting rewards along the right of this page, you will help make Rampage 3: No Mercy the best film possible!\nWe have a variety of rewards for backers, from copies of the film, to posters, to the costume, to chances to join us on set or even be killed on-screen in the film (with a full on-set actor experience, including a hotel and travel to and from set).\nLook out for one-off special items and opportunities, and make sure to get involved at any level to ensure you get to be a part of the behind the scenes backer-only content that will continue throughout the film all the way up to release.\n-\nWas ist die RAMPAGE Trilogie ?\nDie Trilogy folgt dem desillusionierten Bill Williamson w\u00e4hrend er versucht die Erde von Idioten, Betr\u00fcgen und L\u00fcgnern zu befreien. Er hat ein klares Konzept und startete mit einem Amoklauf in seiner Heimatstadt Tenderville in Oregon, wo er die halbe Stadt ausl\u00f6schte. Dannach versteckte er sich \u00fcber ein Jahr, um dann wieder aufzutauchen und eine ganze TV \u2013 Station als Geisel zu nehmen. In einem Live Interview macht er Amerika klar, dass wir es leider vers\u00e4umt haben die Welt zu retten und deshalb die Erde untergehen wird. Das einzige was jetzt noch helfen kann ist das T\u00f6ten der politischen F\u00fchrer und der Superreichen.  Am Schluss sprengt er den ganzen Sender in die Luft und entkommt selber durch einen L\u00fcftungschacht. Die Polizei h\u00e4lt ihn f\u00fcr tot.\nWarum ist Uwe Boll hier?\nNach 25 Jahren Erfahrung im produzieren von Filmen, bin ich auf RAMPAGE besonders stolz. RAMPAGE 1 bekam die besten Kritiken von allen meinen Filmen und entfachte die besten Diskussionen mit den Zuschauern.  RAMPAGE 2 kann so nicht alleine stehen bleiben ---- wir m\u00fcssen sehen wie es mit Bill Williamson weitergeht. RAMPAGE 3 wird der letzte Teil sein und weil es sehr schwer ist den Film zu finanzieren, brauchen wir eure Hilfe. \n- Uwe Boll\nWarum KICKSTARTER?\nRampage 2 wurde so oft illegal downgeloaded, dass es schwer ist mit einem sich stetig verkleinernden DVD Markt RAMPAGE 3 zu finanzieren. Wir waren in der Lage schon 20 L\u00e4nder zu verkaufen, aber as Geld reicht nicht, um die grossen Actionszenen, die wir planen auch umzusetzen. Denn diesmal attackiert Bill das WEISSE HAUS. Wir brauchen eure Unterst\u00fctzung.\nWelche Preise bekomme ich?\nIn der Liste findest Du tolle Preise und sogar die M\u00f6glichkeit beim Film mitzumachen ----aber haupts\u00e4chlich geht es ja darum den Film \u00fcberhaupt zu erm\u00f6glichen. Von DVDs, \u00fcber Poster, Kost\u00fcme bis zu Sprechrollen ist alles drin.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEveryone involved in this film is an industry professional, together having decades of collective experience.

We can also be found on localized social media in Polish, Czech and Russian.\nActual Handmade Reliquary Box\nWhy the Bard's Tale?\n30 years ago, a small company by the name of Interplay produced a cRPG titled Tales of the Unknown I: The Bard\u2019s Tale. This game was crafted at a time when the RPG genre was growing and being defined by an endless stream of innovative releases. In this period dominated by Wizardry and Ultima, The Bard\u2019s Tale was an unexpected hit, putting Interplay on the map. Brian went on to produce many of the RPGs we still love to this day, including Wasteland, Baldur\u2019s Gate, Fallout, Icewind Dale, Planescape: Torment, and many more. The Bard\u2019s Tale was also one of the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, and The Bard\u2019s Tale III was featured in the Smithsonian\u2019s \u201cThe Art of Video Games\u201d exhibit.\nDuring our successful crowdfunding campaigns for Wasteland 2 and Torment: Tides of Numenera, our legions of generous backers stunned us with their outpouring of support, proving those games still had an audience that was willing to help make them happen.\nAs we began to look into our next project, we were flooded with requests from many of our supporters who wanted us to return to The Bard\u2019s Tale universe. The dungeon crawl genre it represents has largely been forgotten by mainstream publishers. What better time than the 30th anniversary of the original for us to bring The Bard\u2019s Tale back to life with a true dungeon crawling sequel, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV!\nCraft your party, your way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to develop, progress and grow a party of adventurers as you see fit. Build a combat-hardened warrior to lead the way, or a spell-flinging Conjurer to provide support from the back lines. A character\u2019s class provides the basic archetype, but as you progress you will tweak and evolve your party to suit your play style.\nThe original Bard\u2019s Tale games allowed you to evolve your magic class characters from the Conjurer and Magician to the more powerful Sorcerer, Chronomancer, Geomancer, and even the feared Archmage, each providing new spell trees to explore. We\u2019re extending this system to all class types for increased levels of customization and tinkering. As your magic and combat abilities grow, you will combine spells and skills from your different party members for increased effects greater than the sum of their parts. Deciding when to evolve your characters has a major impact on the types of spells that become available.\nThe eponymous Bard is of course returning. The Bard is an important member of each party, with magical songs empowering the group in combat or providing a helping hand while exploring and solving puzzles. Your band of adventurers will be influenced throughout the game by the Bard's music. By playing the Rhyme of Duotime, your party will regenerate spell points at increased speed. Switching to The Archer\u2019s Tune will greatly increase your party\u2019s missile damage. Just make sure your bard is well stocked with ale...so his throat doesn\u2019t dry out. \nWe are also bringing back many popular races like humans, elves, dwarves, and including some newly inspired races like the Trow. The races all have their own unique culture and history, integrating your choices more into the game\u2019s narrative. The world and citizens of The Bard\u2019s Tale IV react to your party\u2019s make-up, branching the quest structure and providing a unique experience depending on who is joining you. \n\"In mist-shrouded Skara Brae, in the darkest hours of a winter's night, sometimes can be heard a voice on the wind. The Song of the Maiden the locals call it, a song sung since before the standing stones grew moss, a song of ill fortune, that lures those who hear it to their doom, and drives the melancholy to madness, a song, they say, that must never end, for if it does, the world ends with it.\"\nWhat did the wizard Mangar seek when he cast his spell of Eternal Winter, locking Skara Brae in ice? Why did the invading archmage Lagoth Zanta shatter the Destiny Wand and end seven hundred years of peace? Why did the mad god Tarjan cross the outer planes to burn Skara Brae to the ground and slaughter its people? What secret could drive beings of such great power to again and again lay waste to these ancient isles?\nThe adventurers who put a stop to these fiends never learned the answer to these questions, but now, a hundred and fifty years after its destruction, and the building of a new town on top of the old, another power, greater than all those before, has turned an eye once again to Skara Brae and the time-lost catacombs beneath it, seeking the secret its predecessors failed to find - and once more, a small group of hapless adventurers are all that stands in its way.\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV brings you back to locations you know and love in the bustling, under-construction town of Skara Brae, though the events of the past years have changed it in ways you might not expect. As always, many taverns dot the city for the party to quaff down large tankards of ale and wet their parched throats. The Adventurer\u2019s Guild is still open and ready to assist. The descendants of the original Skara Brae have picked up where their ancestors left off, so magic users can regenerate at the reliable Energy Emporium (Roscoe Jr.) and restock in the ever-ready Garth\u2019s Equipment Shoppe.\nYou know us as lovers of reactivity, choice, and consequence in our games, and naturally The Bard\u2019s Tale IV is no different. Your actions in and around Skara Brae can change the town forever! As you make choices and complete your quests, other local bards will sing songs of your exploits, which may change the attitude of noblemen, modify the friendliness of merchants, or unlock previously inaccessible buildings. Quests are either offered or revoked based on your influence in the world, so you must choose them wisely.\nTell me more\u2026\nBeing a dungeon crawl, you\u2019ll get to explore the dungeons, forests, crypts, and castles within, underneath, and around Skara Brae as well as worlds beyond the lands of men. The emphasis is on exploration, mystery, discovering new locations, and fighting your way through traps and monsters. Secrets abound in these dungeons, and the world is shrouded in mystery. Like the originals, movement and dungeon design is grid-based, but the game allows you to toggle the grid off and move freely if you prefer.\nWe have a passion for non-linear level design and The Bard\u2019s Tale IV embraces this concept. While you explore the world, you will reach areas, obstacles, and monsters you won\u2019t be able to defeat. By venturing out into new areas, developing additional skills and spells, or finding enchanted weapons and armor, you can return with a new set of tools better equipped for the job. Definitely expect a challenge; this game won\u2019t be easy.\nChallenges beyond combat await you. Dangerous traps dot the dungeons, and you\u2019ll need a deft hand to find your way through them \u2013 as well as a keen sense of mapping. With the full rights to use all of the content, story, and setting of the original games, we are returning to many of the familiar trappings and challenges. But don\u2019t worry.  If you find yourself completely stuck, just turn your way to a Magic Mouth, those perfectly ordinary hint-givers that come in the shape of giant talking stone walls.\nA big part of true dungeon crawls is the combat. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV utilizes a dynamic phase-based system to resolve such encounters. What do we mean by that?\nCombat is resolved in a phase-based manner, meaning your entire party takes its turn, and then all enemies take theirs. In the original trilogy, you\u2019d make all of the decisions at once and only then see the results. For The Bard\u2019s Tale IV, we want a more dynamic experience: as soon as you decide what a character will do, they immediately act. This is the first way in which battles dynamically change, as your rolls and effects can have a variety of outcomes which might make you rethink your next action.\nWhen we say that combat is dynamic, we also relate that to the game's pace and feel. The Bard\u2019s Tale IV allows you to give your commands as quickly as you want, even while the animations of your previous commands are still playing out. This removes the tedium of waiting around for animations to finish before the system accepts your next input. And of course, your enemies are a major part of keeping the system dynamic \u2013 you'll need to examine the battlefield and react accordingly to win, including being aware of abilities that directly counter other abilities.\nSpecial abilities will also be a huge emphasis for the game. The Magician class, for instance, uses their powers to enchant and change the properties of objects by manipulating their physical environment. By casting Ybarra\u2019s Mystic Shield, the air in front of the party becomes an invisible shield. Illusions and summoning is a pillar of The Bard\u2019s Tale universe too, so expect your foes to be summoning their own monsters while constantly evolving the tactical nature of the combat at each turn. Running backwards will not be a viable survival strategy!\nPhysical Manipulation of Items and Puzzles\nItems, weapons, armor, and specialized loot are a big part of dungeon exploration. You will want to equip (and conjure) yourself with the best gear, including armor, gloves, helmets, shields, weapons, instruments, rings, and wands.\nThe sense of discovery and mystery doesn\u2019t stop with the environment. Many items hold their own secrets that you\u2019ll need to discover by carefully examining them. Similar to the intriguing video game series The Room, by thoroughly studying special objects, you can unlock ways to enhance or modify their properties. After looting a chest, for instance, you might find a dagger with suspicious holes dotting the blade. After examining it closer and rotating two oddly shaped discs on the hilt of your newly found weapon, a small compartment opens revealing a clock-like dial. Twisting this dial properly and locking it into place, you notice a viscous poison dripping from the blade which will add additional damage to each attack.\nPLAY\n\nWe extend this physical manipulation element into a rich variety of challenges. Dungeons are filled with diabolical puzzles that unlock anything from shortcuts to secrets, to extra loot, and often you\u2019ll need to think of clever ways to use your arsenal of spells and skills to get through them. \nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV has a strong fantasy heritage and represents a leap forward for this genre. We intend to craft its world and creatures with a unique stylistic approach to make the game all the more memorable, with a distinct artistic theme that is instantly recognizable and layers of rich detail that make the bustling world come alive.\nIn both its music and visuals, The Bard\u2019s Tale IV draws heavily from many elements of Scottish culture. We plan to integrate Scottish architecture in the look of Skara Brae and the game\u2019s dungeons and wilderness.\nReference photos from inXile's Scotland trip\nIn many cases we directly take real-life objects, specially photographed, and convert them into 3D objects using the process of photogrammetry. We then take the processed 3D objects and tweak them to end up with authentic and gorgeous game assets that perfectly suit our stylistic approach.\nPLAY\n\nWho is making The Bard\u2019s Tale\nThe Bard\u2019s Tale IV is brought to you by inXile Entertainment, led by Brian Fargo.

We\u2019re Joey Comeau and Emily Horne and we\u2019ve been making our webcomic A Softer World since 2003. You can go look at the comics for free on our website - www.asofterworld.com. For twelve years we\u2019ve been making sad, weird, harsh and sometimes ridiculous comics. Our whole adult lives, it feels like. And now we\u2019re going to stop. A Softer World is ending.\nTo celebrate the end of the world, we want to make a book. A collection of our favourite comics, from the very first to the very last. The final day of this Kickstarter campaign will coincide with the final comic in A Softer World.\n Over the years, people have said some nice things about our comic.\n  \u201c[like] finishing a really good short story, in a fraction of the reading time.\u201d \u2013 Rolling Stone\n\"Touching, horrible, depressing, and blackly funny.

And that\u2019s part of why we\u2019re stopping. We love doing the comic, love what we\u2019ve created, but we don\u2019t want to do the same thing forever. So, we\u2019re going to stop now while we STILL love doing the comic. Before something dies inside of us and all that\u2019s left is the work. And, as Emily pointed out \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s better to burn out than to get old and weird and pathetic.\u201d\nwhere it all started\nOur previous books have been collections in a more traditional sense. The first book collected all of the first 200 comics in chronological order, the second book picked up where that left off, and so on. But we have more than 1200 comics now, and we want to create a book that is only the very best. Sometimes when you look back on your life, you just want the important memories. Not the happiest necessarily. Don\u2019t get us wrong. Skinned knees and childhood funerals helped make us who we are, too. First kisses and broken hearts.\nWe want to make a book that captures (as much as possible) what the comic meant to us over twelve whole years. And so here we are \u2013 The Best of A Softer World. 200 comics. 2 per page! And we\u2019ll be including some of our six-panel comics, for the first time ever in print. All our favourite comics, plus their alt texts, in one beautiful hardcover package. \nWe present:\n\n* To explain the Remix thing: we'll create a PDF of 40 wildly illegal remixes of our own comic text with images from our favourite pop culture shows and comics and release it into the wild on Bittorrent.

Hence, 10th-ish Anniversary Edition Blu-ray. :) Hey, 2005 counts for something, right? The movie received a ton of support from the tabletop gaming industry, enabling real products to be featured in the movie, like Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 Edition, Munchkin, X-Crawl, as well as nerdy comics like Knights of the Dinner Table and Nodwick. This support legitimized The Gamers: Dorkness Rising in a major way. It exploded over Netflix and Amazon and is now considered required viewing in RPG circles worldwide.\nHOWEVER! This movie was our first film ever shot in HD, and it has never been released on Blu-Ray, until now. That means no one has seen this movie how it was originally intended! Even those who have seen the HD digital download have not seen this movie look as good as it does now. Thanks to Ben Dobyns and his digital mastering wizardry, The Gamers: Dorkness Rising is now in the format for which it was intended.

We will not get to fulfilling this Kickstarter until after Gen Con, so mid to late August. Please be aware we are intending on selling this inventory at Gen Con and have factored in the extra inventory into the cost. Do not worry, we will not sell your copy(ies).

The other rewards however, will not be offered at Gen Con.

We will make every effort to be clear in our communications and set the correct expectations so that we get the best quality Blu-Ray possible, and reach our fulfillment goals. If all goes well we hope you will be receiving your rewards by the end of August or beginning of September at the latest. \n\nWe will be using BackerKit once again, which has proven invaluable for fulfilling rewards efficiently, as well as raising more money for the project after the campaign has ended.

Once reported, users will have the option of keeping their report private and cataloguing it in case it escalates, or they can make the report public. If they choose to make it public, they will be able to choose from a menu of options on how they want bystanders to support them, take action, or intervene. They will also be given extensive resources including: safety planning, materials on how to differentiate an empty threat from a real threat, online harassment laws and details on how to report their harassment to authorities (if requested), and referrals to other organizations that can provide counseling and legal services.\nBystanders looking to provide support will receive public requests, along with chosen actions of support. You can \u201chave someone\u2019s back\u201d and know that you\u2019re helping them out in a time of need while directly contributing to safer spaces online. HeartMob staff will review all messages and reports to ensure the platform remains safe and supportive.\nWHY: According to a Pew Research Center survey from late last year, 40% of people have been harassed online, and 73% of people have witnessed someone else being harassed online. Among people between the ages of 18 and 29, this figure jumps up to 92%. For too long, many people have left online spaces because they feel unsafe or unsupported. For too long, many of us have sat back and watched, unsure how to ask for help or how to provide support and resources. With HeartMob, you\u2019ll have a system of supporters beside you, and a user-driven set of actions you can take right now to lend a helping hand. HeartMob can change the internet, making sure that we all feel safe, supported, and empowered online. But we need your help to make it a reality.\nWHAT YOU CAN DO: Hollaback! needs to raise $10,000 in three weeks to support the development of the HeartMob platform. With just as little as $1, you can show your support for the project and get in on the ground floor. And thanks to support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation -- your dollar will go over further. If we hit our goal of $10,000, Knight will kick in $2,500 if we get 250 backers, $5000 if we get 500 backers, and $10,000 if we get 1000 backers.

ON TO THE STRETCH GOALS!\nSlay the Budget. Donate Now.\nBecause we had such gosh darn fun making season one and our fans are demanding more, it's time to gear up for an even magical-er second season of After Forever!\nSeason two picks up right where we left off in season one: The dragon scale worked! After 600 years as the People's Guardian, Cade is mortal and finally free to fulfill her life long dream of opening Lady SconeHearts' Bakery. But in a world where modern technology and disposable culture have forced most wizards, dragons and other magical beings into hiding, it's up to Cade to bridge the gap between the simple, magical culture she once belonged to and the fast paced present in which she's found herself. Joining Cade are Tucker-- a devoted fan-boy, LOTR guru and graphic designer-- and his journalist sister Vivian. Together, they help Cade adjust to her 21st century retirement.\nBut when a handsome warlock from Cade's youth reappears and threatens to destroy modern society and return to the old, magical ways, Cade's bonds with Tucker, modern life, and bakery retirement are put to the test in our particular brand of fantastical realism.\nIf you haven't already, check out our first season!\nOrigin Story\nThe first season was produced purely for the joy of filmmaking by a team of full time students at Western Washington University on a budget of $300. (Most of which went to feeding the crew on set, since SetGrumps are the worst kind of Grumps.) \nWe were honored to be selected as an Editor's Pick on The Web Series Channel's website, (http://www.webserieschannel.com/forever/) and the first season premiered in front of over 100 people at Western Washington University at a live screening. Since then, After Forever has been included in the Middle Women Film Festival, and the Bellingham Film Festival's online database.\nWith all the joy that season one created, our freshly graduated writer, director and producer Natalie Fedak and her team of delusional film friends are eager to unite their learning with an actual budget and create their best screen adventure yet. \nAfter Forever's Season One Premier\nMoney = Magic\nGood fantasy films require a little movie magic, and movie magic requires a lot of money. With the warlocks, giants, and medieval bakeries we're introducing in season 2, we need funds to construct sets, stitch costumes and pay for special effects worthy of our earth-bending warlock, Pax. We weren't able to do a lot of world building in season one with such a small budget, and we are excited to explore what happens when the magic-medieval universe Cade comes from bumps up against modern culture. \nRest assured that we aren't going to write in fancy explosions and pod races just because we'll be able to afford them in the second installment, *cough* we're looking at you Lucas *cough,* but we want some flexibility in the amount of wonder we're able to put on your screen. We plan to DaVinci together as many on-set effects as possible, but some things, like re-growing chopped trees and hurling vicious pet rocks into magma will simply look better in CGI. (Our current alternative to CGI magma is to boil hot sauce in a glass dish on the stove. Please don't let us do that.)\nBut good filmmaking isn't just about good stories or good special effects, it's also about having good people on board to help make each other's dreams come true. This isn't a student project anymore, and we want to be able to give back to the talented crew that's working on season 2. We aren't going to earn living wages with this project, but every donation goes towards making sure our team members can live happy, healthy lives so they can bring their happy, healthy selves to set. \nOther less exciting costs include upgrading some of our basic equipment so that what you hear and see sounds and looks better, and taking care of some little nitty gritty office costs that get overlooked and then bite us in the bum, ala printing costs, website fees, and endless dry erase markers.\nDon't Be a Monster. Be a Backer.\nMany producers like to give pie chart visuals of the budget break down, so we've decided to see that pie and raise it a scone.\nThis Budget reflects the bare minimum that we need to make Season 2. If you help us slay this Budget, a second season will rise from its ashes. \nBUT, if you help us super-slay it, then we can make a super second season. Any money we raise beyond our goal will go straight back into the production, so the more we raise, the more detailed the sets, the nicer the costumes, the cooler the locations, AKA, the more magic you'll get to see on screen!\nBattle Plan\nSeason 2 will feature 9 episodes of about 10 minutes each. As of now, we plan to spend May through July in Pre-production (making costumes, props, rehearsing, scheduling locations etc...) and we plan to begin filming in August. Depending on team schedules and Bellingham's often rainy weather, we should be done by late September and into post production by October. (See RISKS SECTION Below for more details.)\nDepending on our CGI budget, we will spend a couple months in post-production, and plan to premier the second season in late winter/early spring of 2016 on our YouTube channel and at public screenings around the Northwest.\nOur Mountain of Why's\nIt's important to us that funders understand why we do what we do. Sure, on the surface, we make goofy movies and swing around swords, but our content and our production process come out of a very intimate place, and we want you to understand the gooey insides of this project. \nOur writer, director, and producer Natalie wrote After Forever for many reasons, but a chief motivation was to see audiences react to a woman written as a conventionally male archetype (ie, warrior, guardian). BOOM: Cade. Similarly, Natalie wondered how people would accept a more emotional, supportive male character, since the gender stereotypes in Hollywood are equally pervasive for men. Enter: Tucker.\nHer mission wasn't to swap the archetypes just for giggles, it was to subvert the way we label certain traits as male or female, and show that every trait is simply \"human.\" Based off people's reactions to season one, audience humans liked it when movie humans felt human. Huh.\nWith season 2, Natalie's excited to show how dynamic characters can be when they aren't shoved into a box, and unless you're a vampire and enjoy dwelling in boxes, we hope you're excited too.\nOur last little dose of inner-gooey comes in the form of Earth friendliness. Our team has been offered a special deal on a solar powered generator from the sustainability engineers at Goal Zero, and regardless how the Kickstarter turns out, our team will be purchasing the equipment to make our future films with renewable energy. A solar power generator isn't the answer to all our prayers, but it's a start, as is composting and recycling on set, using recycled construction materials, drinking from re-usable water bottles and carpooling everywhere possible. \nWe need a planet to make movies on, and for now, Earth is the one we have and the one we should take care of.\nYou can read more about our Team and their inner gooies on our website under the ABOUT US page.\nwww.afterforeverwebseries.com\nPERKS!\nA Sneak Peek at our Stand Alone Perks:\n$50 pledge: A hand crafted Mini Cade Plush Doll\n $50 Pledge: Miniature Creature Figurine\n $300 Pledge: A hand made youth Toth Bow.\nStretch Goals:\nIf we reach $7000, we can afford to fly in The Sorceress from season one! \nIf we reach $8000, we will make miniature models for some of the epic battle scenes at the end, where we need to destroy a whole bunch of buildings. BOOM.\nIf we reach $10,000, we will include a flashback scene of a little Cade and her warlock friend Pax growing up together.\nIf we reach $15,000, we will film Cade giving a scone-baking lesson at Lady Scone Heart's bakery.

But if we raise, say $50,000, then the possibilities for what we can create will expand exponentially, and we'll need time to readjust and implement our new potential (a daunting challenge we are more than willing to take on.) \n\nThe other risk lurking in the dark is staying on schedule. While this has never been a problem for us before, we believe in quality over quantity, so if trolls steal our footage or the rain gods decide to pee on us during an outdoor shoot, we will extend our schedule to make sure we deliver our best movie when it's ready, not a crappy one on time.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "Where the Road Has Led", "update_content": "Nearly three years have passed since last I wrote, and honestly, I didn't know if I would ever post on this page again. \nThe collapse of After Forever was devastating.

Soon, I embraced our play group style and started writing adventures that were more like raunchy cartoons. After all, if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. \nOur philosophy: It can't be wrong if it makes us laugh!\nI moved to LA after film school and began film-making and animating. Along the way, I met many fellow gamers and artists. After exchanging hilarious gaming stories with Edward Shannon and Patrick Carpenter, we created the Game Knights half-animated series. We needed a prop, parody version of D&D for the characters to play, so Beasties & Bygones was born! We ended up filling this fantasy game world with so much satire, silliness and raunchy comedy that we realized B&B was too big for just a show, so we started creating the real B&B RPG using storytelling techniques I learned in film school.\nWe are making this ridiculous, possibly offensive parody of D&D because it's funny! \nPlease tell your friends (with a sense of humor) about this campaign. \nEvery pledge that includes a print copy will get one limited edition Afrodo the Archer Meeple FREE*!\n*Afrodo the Archer Meeple is available as an addon to any pledge for $3 each! \nAdventure in the world of the Saytrs & explore sexuality with the Sexuality Supplement!\n We are very close to unlocking the next stretch goal!\nIf we raise $4000, We will create a supplement tat explores the traveling circus in Al'tearth!\n If we reach 150+ backers, this Supplement will be added to the Season One Adventure Bundle.\nTo share click on \"Share this Project\" and then the \u2018f\u2019 button under the video at the top of the page.

They can invoke the Taint to cause randomness and impossible things to happen but they have no control over it. Some of their spells/jokes require people to laugh and most of them feature what we call a Targeted (AoE) Area of Effect.\nDownload Sneak Peek #2 The Ivory Tower of Decency Quick-Start PDF!\nClick here to download the Alpha Version of the Quick-Start!\nAdventure Overview\nNot long ago in a quaint town, a powerful Wizard's child came home and said a bad word. This strict puritan Wizard was so offended, he cast a \"Protection from Words\" spell on his own child, so if he ever spoke that bad word again it would be bleeped. The Wizard was pleased with himself until he noticed that his child was coming home every day, depressed and defeated. He was considered an outsider for not being able to curse while his friends could freely f-bomb each other. The angry Wizard decided, to protect his children from exposure to what he called \"bad words\", he had to cast the spell on the other children as well. He gathered the most powerful wizards and convinced them that to protect their offspring, they had to join forces. They did cast the \"Protection from Words\" spell and not just on all the children but the whole town. Now children could never hear damaging words again and the Wizards Communication Cabal was born. \nOur adventurers stumble into town and are greeted by merchants selling wares, children playing in the streets and somber adult faces. They start noticing the townsfolk are using nonsensical words in place of curses. Eventually, they hear the bleeping as someone attempts to curse. The wizards flex their magic muscles, as more and more words are deemed indecent and thus bleeped out of existence. Soon they target the evil flesh that could tempt our children and a \"Protection from Flesh\" spell is cast. Everybody in the town, including the players have blurry ankles because the wizards decided they didn't want their children seeing a naked ankle. An underground resistance called the Coalition of Cussing (CoC) has been gathering. They've been meeting to curse at each other, define codes for \"bad words\" and to look at each other's ankles. ;)  Will the Wizards accomplish their sanitized goal of having a town full of blurry people bleeping at each other?\nWatch our half-animated comedy series, Game Knights!\nA sophomoric, spoof-filled, fantasy world and the tabletop RPG played in Game Knights, the series.\nBeasties & Bygones is an irreverent, upside down RPG that gives you permission to go too far. Satirical, edgy, social commentary with a comedic overtones. There will be no titillating nudity, but there will be mature themes explored for comedic lampooning. We created a parody game world called Al'tearth where your characters can attack taboo topics while exploring, socializing and misadventuring.\nAll books will be available in Dungeon World and 3.5 Open Game License. To learn about the Dungeon World Rules System click here: Dungeon World!\nNow all we need is finishing funds and support in unlocking stretch goals so we can commission more artwork and writers!\nTheme-based, parody storytelling!\nEvery episode/adventure is crafted around a subject and a thematic question. The players can be aware of the subject but they shouldn't know the exact thematic question. The subject for The Ivory Tower of Decency adventure is censorship, but the thematic question could be: Is freedom of expression worth the risk of Tainting your children?\nBeasties & Bygones adventures are written in a loose 3 act structure.\nMost fronts/encounters represent a different angle/bullet point that will either support the one point of view or support the opposite point of view through challenging dangers/encounters within a loose three act structure. B&B adventures are always designed as if the antagonist is the main character. The players decide how their characters change/grow through role-playing, spending XP, and bonding. Also, it gives the antagonist more depth.\nIf players get too distracted or stagnant the GM can play a Plot Twist. That will change the direction of the whole adventure and move the story along. The Plot Twists typically represent the opponent's actions off-screen!\nAl'tearth is a low tech magic-infused clone of Earth!\nAl'tearth's geography is almost an exact replica of Medieval Earth because it was created with a powerful clone spell by an earthborn wizard from middle ages named Gareth Guygaxian. Since it was created to protect the creatures of magic, it is a low-tech world. The clone spell drained Earth of it's magic, superstitions, \"Mythical Creatures\" and Ancient Gods.\nMany Mythical Creatures call Al'tearth their home but most Beasties were tainted upon arrival:\nSome creatures were but a daydream on Earth & now exist in Al'tearth, like the Dingle Faeries; tainted faeries that serve the Excremental Gods. \nSome creatures were merged into one like the Chupasasquatch; The Chupacabra of Mexican lore merged with the Sasquatch or like Mime-pyres; who were Vampires that merged with Mimes.\nAncient Gods from all mythologies have been twisted into bizarre bygones of their former selves. They govern each other with a yearly award ceremony and grant each other positions in the Zodiac Council. Sampling of Bygones:\nPenetor, the God of Fertility was Priapus in Ancient Greece.\nHermaphrodite wasn't always the androgynous lord of sexual ambiguity, s/he was once Aphrodite, Greek God of love, beauty, and sexual passion:only \nThe races are fragmented across this medieval alter-earth and are as varied as the lands they originated from on earth:\n\nSatyrs are a debaucherous society that elects it's king every four years with a triathlon that includes competing in a drinking challenge, a talent show and public intimate performances. They must have intimacy every 7 days or they frenzy.\nThree-Quarterlings are halflings that grew a little taller then their halfling cousins and have formed a a society that is pretty close to Utopia. They come in all colors and the only judgement they make on each other is size. The taller they are the more status received.\nHalf-Ettins are, essentially a race of co-joined twins. They are rather rare and their life involves heavy co-operation because each head controls half of he body. (Note this will be a cool role-play option as two players can play one half of a character. Wrestling for control of each action or cooperating and making two heads truly better than one.)\nFunding Goals\nThis Kickstarter funds the creation of the Beasties & Bygones Corebook and the Season One Adventure Bundle.

That means two different sets of books/PDFs, albeit with a lot of content overlap, each with their own rules. For this print run of the physical books, we are going with a print-on-demand publisher who has a strong reputation to ensure that printing/shipping goes smoothly.\n\nOur backers are very important - that's why we've researched and received guidance from several successful Kickstarters like Ron Newcomb (The Rangers), Andres Salazar (Pariah, MI), and others. Critical Hit Media is committed to bringing you entertainment with no boundaries. Why? Because It's Funny! And that has been the driving force behind our vision. We pledge, alongside your pledges, that we will be resolute in our attention to this project, and that we'll provide you with many great adventures to adventure upon!\n\nOur goal is to deliver an irreverent, funny, high-quality product on time. We padded the delivery times a little bit because this is our first Kickstarter. The game world is bursting with loads of content, the book is being laid out in rough form, and some of the artwork for the book is complete. With two different versions of the book, however, there is the potential for possible delivery delays due to unforeseen circumstances. It is possible that we may need to adjust things with the printer to make sure the book looks amazing and accurate.

A 1-day badge will be reimbursed for anyone who runs 8 hours of events, and a 3-day badge will be reimbursed for anyone who runs 18 hours of events.\nJust our way of saying thanks!\nSee you in May!\n\nMULTIPLE REWARDS\nSo you want to buy more than one badge? No problem! Just pick the most expensive of your rewards, and after clicking through, simply add on the price of any other rewards you also want. For example, instead of making two accounts to get a couple of 3-day badges, simply pick the 3-day reward once, and then donate 90 dollars instead of 45.

It is even bigger, better and more epic than the first film.\nHere's a quick word from the creators of Mythica:\nHOW CAN I WATCH MYTHICA 1?\nIf you'd like to catch-up and watch Mythica 1, it premiered in the US on CONtv, so click on the CONtv Originals logo below to create a free account and watch Mythica 1!\nIf you live outside of the US, you can download Mythica 1 directly from our website. Go to: http://watch.arrowstormentertainment.com\nHere is a trailer for Mythica 1:\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her. She recruits a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, and thwart his goal of uniting the four shards of the Darkspore to unleash an undead plague on the land.\nThe Darkspore\nWhen Teela\u2019s sister is murdered and a powerful relic stolen, Marek and her friends face a sinister new enemy - Kishkumen, a foreign mystic bent on reclaiming the Darkspore for his master Szorlok. Armed with twin maps, Marek and her team race Kishkumen and his horde through creature-infested lands, to a long abandoned underground city \u2013 all the while pursued by bounty hunters intent on returning Marek to slavery.\nJoined by the mysterious dark-elf warrior \u2013 Qole \u2013 the team journeys deep underground to discover that the ruined city is now home to an undead dragon. Trapped between Kishkumen and the dragon, Marek and her team must employ all their skill and magic to battle the beast, and combat Kishkumen for their hard won treasure and their lives.\nMelanie Stone plays Marek, a natural-born necromancer with a club foot. Stone is a brilliant new actress, with Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor. Since filming Mythica, she has starred in The Christmas Dragon, and He Knows My Name.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars and the upcoming release, Dragon Warriors.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a rapidly rising newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that also counts, right? Since Mythica, he has gone on to starring roles in Cyborg X, The Christmas Dragon and War Pigs.\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series, including Disney's House of Anubis.\n Rocky Myers play Qole, a mysterious Dark Elf warrior. Rocky is a very talented actor who has starred in previous Arrowstorm films Survivor and Cyborg X. You can also catch him in the action-thriller Safari and the kids adventure, RoboRex.\nMatthew Mercer plays Szorlok, the Dark Lord - making his first appearance in the Mythica franchise, with many more sinister deeds to come. Matthew is a talented actor, and voice artist, best known for his voice work in countless franchises... basically, if you've played a video game, you've heard Matthew.\n The film is already shot, and we are hard at work on post-production. Sound, music and VFX are all underway. But we still have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - whole green-screen sequences, dragon sequences, etc. We want the movie to be as good as it can be, so every extra dollar we can get helps us make the movie more awesome. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\n Backers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $75,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $75,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nWe've sent Mythica: A Quest for Heroes (the first film in the series) out to a few reviewers and have received some stellar feedback:\nMOVIE PILOT REVIEW\nGEEK DAD REVIEW\nTV EQUALS REVIEW\nALEX BLEDSOE REVIEW\nFAITH GEEK REVIEW\nDUNGEON CRAWLER REVIEW\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade.

Romas Collection of Horn & Hardart Memorabilia\nAmericans once sipped coffee and ate pie around communal tables, sharing their struggles and dreams with strangers at Horn & Hardart\u2019s iconic Automat. Lifetimes ago, these working class palaces nourished a sense of unity that bridged the diversity of class, language, gender and race in the urban melting pots of the East Coast.\nThe story begins in a booming Philadelphia in the late 1800s. White-collar workers are flooding into the offices of newly built skyscrapers, and lunchrooms are springing up to feed them. Coentrepreneurs Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart seize their chance and by the early 1900s have BUILT a thriving chain of small restaurants and cafeterias, the latter a brand new trend of its own. Hardart brings back from Europe inspiration for the Automat, a \u2018waiterless\u2019 cafeteria that proves enormously popular, making the Horn and Hardart chain the dominant American restaurant company for the next half century. Kings of the New York and Philly restaurant scenes, the Automats feed millions throughout the Depression and two World Wars, serving all comers in palaces of marble, silver, and steel. Good food served cheap, and the enduring thrill of the automat machines themselves wins the Automat a place in our culture and hearts alike.\nTravel back in time to experience this unique piece of America's history, an exciting story and one that may seem strangely familiar. More than just entertainment, THE AUTOMAT is a parable of how we once dined happily together before turning to the isolated and unhappy experience offered by fast food, a bad deal that no amount of advertising can disguise.\nOur Goal & Our Drive\nWhat started as a shared fascination with cafeterias and their culture, has turned into an incredible educational journey. As we dive deeper into the archives and hear stories told by people who experienced Horn and Hardart's restaurants first hand we appreciate more and more what we once had but have since lost.\nThe Automat is a project already two years in the making, with hundreds of hours of interviews and archival research behind us. We are seeking funding to complete shooting of the documentary film and to begin post-production work.\nThe money will help pay for:\nInsurance\nEquipment Rental\nPermits\nTransportation\nDirector of Photography\nTranscription\nEditing\nIn the event we exceed our goal we will be able to get further into the post-production process. \nRewards\n  The Team\nDirector/Producer | Lisa Hurwitz\nLisa is Director and Producer of the THE AUTOMAT. Lisa's background is in arts administration. She directed the 2012 and 2013 Olympia Film Festivals and was Executive Administrator at Bumbershoot 2014: Seattle's Music & Arts Festival. She is very proud to have spent 4 years as a volunteer 35mm film projectionist at the Olympia Film Society at the historic Capitol Theater while getting her B.A. from The Evergreen State College. She is also proud to have run the Film Society's successful and crucial digital cinema conversion campaign. \nProducer | Alec Shuldiner\nAlec authored the 2001 PhD dissertation the film is based on, Trapped Behind the Automat: Technological Systems and the American Restaurant, 1902-1991. As a Producer and Historical Consultant on THE AUTOMAT, he is assisting in adapting his dissertation for the screen. Alec received his B.A. in Comparative Religion from Harvard University and his doctorate in Science and Technology Studies from Cornell University. He lived for many years in the Netherlands where automat machines are still popular. Currently he works for Autodesk, a leading provider of 3D design, engineering and entertainment software.\nAssociate Producer | Becki Chandler\nBecki is the Associate Producer for THE AUTOMAT and Production Designer for various film projects and interactive corporate events. She worked as an Operations Manager for a NY based non-profit focusing on human rights, civil rights, fighting anti-Semitism and promoting tolerance. She studied and worked as an Interior Designer & Project Manager for over 15 years. She has served on various non-profit boards, supporting fundraising campaigns, strategic planning, and educational programming. Becki is the granddaughter of immigrants that settled in NYC and ate at the Automat.\nCinematographer | Philip Lucas\nPhilip is a graduate of The Evergreen State College where he studied film with an emphasis on social justice. His work has ranged from experimental travelogues to a broadcast quality sitcom pilot. Outside of filmmaking Philip's main interests are writing, photography, and he is a passionate cook with a flair for French cuisine. He now resides in Philadelphia and has a cat named Leonard Nimoy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have been extremely fortunate thus far to have access to historians, members of the Horn & Hardart families, Horn & Hardart employees & customers, and celebrities.

Peasant\u2019s point of view.\nThe story behind Suspension of Disbelief began when we started reminiscing about our LARPing days. Every month was filled with evil villains, horrible monsters and world-ending danger; which lead to the question: \"Who the hell would want to live here?!\"\nProof of Concept Pilot\n Proof of Concept: Fence of Summoning\nThe show started with a few sketches about the crazy things that happen in, really, any fantasy game as seen from the NPCs point-of-view.  We had a few generic townies standing in as our protagonists watching as people were assassinated in broad daylight, corrupted the basic fabric of reality and came up with the dumbest character names.  \nAfter we held an open casting call, those protagonists really took shape.  We initially imagined four men in the roles, maybe gender-flipping one or two if we needed to.  Turns out, we had four phenomenal women blow us away at auditions.  They came in immediately harnessing the possibilities in these characters, breathing a real life into them.  After meeting those four women, there was no question.  Our Salvagers would be women.  And they would be hilarious.\nWe knew we had something special after the initial table read.  We filmed the shorts over a long weekend, building the exterior porch and interior of our own Last Chance Tavern.  As we edited the shorts, we began sketching out future adventures.  The story took a life of its own, growing into its own fleshed out fantasy world.  The more we saw of the work our cast had done, the more we knew that this show deserved more.  After much deliberation, we came to the conclusion that a few short sketches wasn\u2019t going to be enough for these women, these characters or this new world we had discovered.  Taking what we had already filmed as a proof of concept and the centerpiece of the first season, we began rewriting in earnest, introducing more characters, more intrigue and more monsters for our special effects department to play with.\nSeason One is now a feature-length season told in seven episodes.  We follow the Salvagers as they try and survive: monster-summoning fences, rogue adventurers, sentient vegetation, visiting nobility, undead hordes, and totally harmless old men with ulterior motives. We couldn\u2019t be prouder of this new show and we need your help to unleash it on an unsuspecting world!  BWAHAHAHA...sorry.\nFind Us On Social Media:\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SODSeries \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/sod_series\nTumblr: http://isthatblakeoutlaw.tumblr.com/\nFrom the beginning we wanted to tell this story from a peasant's-eye view. We wanted to start off with a simple story of simple people trying to make a life under extraordinary circumstances.\nOut of our first few sketches came the Salvagers. They don't hunt, they don't fight, they don't take sides, they stay out of politics and crazy adventures. The Salvagers pick up what's left behind on the battlefield when the Heroes are done fighting, either because they're victorious or they've fallen and their spirits are on their way to be resurrected. The Salvagers, or others like them, sell gear back to unlucky adventurers or to merchants in town at a reasonable mark-up.\n Dani is played by Madi York\nWilla is played by Madeline Hatter\nSally is played by Adena Brumer \n Myke is played by Christina Leidel\nThis is a world with a severe class distinction between Heroes and the rest of us. For Heroes life is easy, money is plentiful, power is assumed, and death is a minor inconvenience.\nBeing a hero in Arbrontith means weighing your options, following the directions of your Faction and kicking selective ass at a rate that would make a third-world dictator blush.  Being literally anyone else means running, hiding, swearing, scratching out whatever existence you can manage, running some more and definitely NOT farming.  It means turning a blind eye to random crimes and wanton slaughter in the streets.  It means only counting on heroes to do the bare minimum required to get some sweet loot while your home is invaded by goblins or burned by pillaging barbarian hordes.\nSome heroes are assholes.  Ok, most heroes are assholes.  But some show up with the express purpose of robbing and killing their way to the top.  It always seems cool to wear all black and be the villain until you run face-first into an Abyssal Horror and find out what true Evil feels like.\nOf course there are the monsters, too.  The Dark One summons them from the surrounding countryside, conjures them from the Hellmouth (did we mention there\u2019s a Hellmouth?  That\u2019s pretty hazardous to one\u2019s health.) or finds ways to manipulate weaker minds into becoming his eternal Doom Slaves.  They arrive regularly, almost by some unseen schedule, fight heroes (even though instinct should tell them not to go near the place where untold thousands of their brethren have been massacred) and die horribly.  Some are truly terrible and dangerous.  Some, like our artistic goblin friend pictured above, are pretty stupid and relatively harmless.  Just watch out for what\u2019s on his paintbrush.  It\u2019s probably not poop.\n HeadGames Entertainment has been around since 2007. We've spent seven years making films, succeeding, failing, and learning from those failures. We have produced two full seasons of the hit webseries Star Command:\n We've worked with tons of special effects, huge casts, make-up, costumes and sets.

Within the next 2 years.\nMusic Of Russia\nOn April 20th (& 22nd), 2012 Illumni Men's Chorale and guest soloist Glenn Miller gathered to offer a concert of Russian music, rarely heard inside the United States.\nThe group featured 23 men: 4 counter tenors, 7 tenors, 6 baritones, and 6 exceptional low basses - 3 of whom would be considered *Oktatvists. (see below)\nThe concerts were raw, moving, and powerful.  Russian Orthodox Church music,  soldier songs, and folks songs rang through the halls.\n\nThe concerts also included the first-known performance of the original ending of Chesnokov\u2019s \u201cNe otverzhi mene\u201d (Do Not Forsake Me When I am Old) by guest soloist: Glenn Miller.\nWhen we recorded the concerts, we had no intention of releasing them as a CD - but then we heard them and knew we had to share with our family and friends!  The concerts were recorded live and as such, they are not perfect.  However, they bring with them that stunning, true power that only a live performance can bring.\nPlease consider supporting us in the creation of this CD.\n-------\nWhat you get!\nAn amazing CD with songs never-before-performed by an American choir. This will be unlike any other CD you\u2019ve ever owned! In addition to the basses hitting sizable G2\u2019s in at least four songs, and so many C2s, D2s, and Bb2s you'll lose count, you\u2019ll hear the countertenors soar as high as A6 (Soprano High A), and some beautiful singing by the baritones, tenors and our Illumni soloists!\nA list of songs is in the FAQ below, and there are some wonderful incentives linked on your screen, including:\nA copy of the CD autographed by Glenn Miller\nA copy of the CD with extended liner notes for the entire program\nA Voice Lesson with Illumni's Founder, and Vocal Coach Chris McCafferty, and Basso Profundo Greg Golliet  \nHave a Basso Profundo sing Happy Birthday for you!

In order (high to low):  baritones, light basses, strong basses, strong basses with a good low register, Oktavists with medium range and power, and strong/deep Oktavists.  \nThe more modern, functional, definition of a Basso Profundo is Chesnokov\u2019s strong/deep bass - a bass with an exceptionally low voice with tremendous power.\nWe were lucky enough to have 6+ men who fit these descriptions!\n------\nGlenn Miller, Basso Profundo Soloist\nKnown for his unique Basso Profundo voice, Glenn Miller has performed all over the world. A native of New Jersey, he earned his Bachelor of Music degree in church music and organ at Westminster Choir College, Princeton, where his teachers included Dr. John and Dr. Helen Kemp, Dr. James Litton and Dr. Erik Routley (church music), and Dr. Donald McDonald (organ). While at Westminster, he sang and recorded with leading orchestras in New York City under the direction of Leonard Bernstein, Pierre Boulez, James Levine, Seiji Ozawa, Robert Shaw and William Steinberg.\n\nHe earned his Master of Music degree in choral conducting from the University of Oklahoma. Additional studies in choir training include work with Dr. Craig Hella Johnson, Dr. Barry Rose and Dr. John Scott in the United States and in England. He is active in the Royal School of Church Music in America, particularly its King's College (Wilkes Barre, PA) summer chorister training course. He also prepares singers for guest conductors that have included James Litton (the American Boychoir), David Briggs (Director of Music emeritus, Gloucester Cathedral), Andrew Lumsden (Winchester Cathedral), Gerre Hancock (St. Thomas Church, New York City), Murray Somerville (Harvard University), Richard Tanner (Blackburn Cathedral) and Paul Trepte (Ely Cathedral).\nHe has enjoyed a distinguished career and continues to be in great demand as a professional choral singer, performing and recording with: the Choir of St. Paul's Cathedral, London; the Choir of St. Thomas Church, New York City; Conspirare (Austin, TX); the Robert Shaw Festival Singers; the New York Choral Artists.  He has served congregations in Wyomissing, PA, Oklahoma City, and Somerville, NJ.

It was developed by the Transolar Team in partnership with Vexing Media.\nTransolar Galactica\nThe Game\nRobot Rundown comes packed with challenging gameplay, loads of humor, and an awesome eight-bit graphic design and musical score. Plus there's a ton of cool video cut scenes built into the game that weave the story into the Transolar universe.\nYou play as Sol-Bot, the underappreciated, motorized newbie heroine of the S.S. Transolar\u2019s crew. After an unintended crash, you learn that the S.S. Transolar\u2019s flight records, including the truth behind the accident, are stored within your databanks. That makes you a target. Now the UGCA is after your beating mechanical heart, and it\u2019s up to you and your Transolar allies to escape.\nRobot Rundown has already been designed, created, and published and it is currently available in the Apple AppStore. But we want to do more...\nRobot Rundown is currently only available on the iOS platform. We want to make our game accessible to as many people as possible, on as many platforms as we can- not just to iPhone users.\nWe want to get Robot Rundown onto these platforms as well:\nAndroid/GooglePlay\nSteam\nPSP\nXbox One Store\nPlaystation Store\nXbox 360 Store\nIn addition to getting Robot Rundown onto multiple platforms, we want the game to get as much exposure as possible in order to gain new fans for our show. All proceeds from the sale of the game will go toward the second season of Transolar Galactica. Our hope is by getting the game out there on as many devices as possible, we'll boost the signal for our series and its upcoming second season.\nWhen the Transolar Team ran into production delays on our second season, the last thing that we wanted to do was stop everything, and just wait silently while we waited for things to start up again. Especially after our fans had been so supportive of us! So we decided to find ways we could continue to create content for our fans without the need for our full film production crew... hence, Robot Rundown was born!\nHowever, even with our hard work, ingenuity, and the support from programmer Brandon Smith of Vexing Media... games are expensive to make! You have to purchase the development software, licenses, and pay additional fees to get your game out there for people to play it. And the Transolar Team was not going to reach into our funds for Season 2 to pay for the game. Our fans want to see the best Transolar Season 2 possible, so we decided to incur minimal costs and just release the game only on iOS. \nImmediately after we released the game, we were overwhelmed with the demand to get it onto other platforms. \"ANDROID! ANDROID!\" our fans cried. Well, we heard your pleas, and we want to deliver. So that's why we're here on Kickstarter with the hopes to raise the funds necessary to get Robot Rundown into as many hands as possible. \nOne thing the funds raised here ARE NOT going to is labor costs. Four people created this game and just like with Season 2 of our show, we want the money to go to improve and distribute the game - Not to line our pockets. So rest assured that the money you pledge will be directly helping make Robot Rundown and Transolar Galactica better.\nHere's the cost breakdown of getting Robot Rundown out there to the world at large:\nAnd the cool thing is by helping fund us, you not only ensure the game will be distributed to every corner of the galaxy... but you also get cool, exclusive stuff in return!\nBelow is a handy chart for you to see what goods you'll get with each pledge tier. \nGAME SOUNDTRACK\nOur music composer for the series, Christian Ballard, laid down a wicked 8-bit style soundtrack for Robot Rundown, and we are really excited to announce that Christian is fleshing out the music from the game into a full album that will be available to our Kickstarter backers first before anyone else! Pledge $25 or more to get your ears filled with 8-bit jams!\nLIMITED EDITION RELEASE POSTERS\nAnd below is a look at the designs for our Limited Edition Robot Rundown Release Posters. There were only 15 of each poster printed. Once they're gone, they're gone! Posters measure 18\" x 24\" and have a matte finish.\nYOUR VERY OWN SOL-BOT!\nAnd, if you've got the gumption (and funds), you can pledge at our top tier and receive this little gal... A handcrafted replica of Sol-Bot, the heroine of our game, and a fan favorite in the series:\nA handcrafted Sol-Bot Figure (Approx. 10\" tall)\n Robot Rundown is a fun and addictive game, but we want to continue to build upon it and keep making it a better and more fun experience for everyone. So if we happen to raise more than our goal of $3500, we have plans to expand the game in really awesome ways. Below is a chart showing our stretch goal increments. Each time we reach one of the goals listed below, we'll \"unlock\" the new aspect we'll be implementing into the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs stated in our project description, the Transolar Team is still working to deliver its second season from our last Kickstarter.

Thank you, thank you, thank you. :) After the campaign closes, stay informed by reading the kickstarter updates or the official Five Moons RPG blog!\nOctober 28 Update: We hit the $35k funding goal, so the Monster Guide is pre-funded! As a special bonus for that stretch goal, we're adding a free PDF of theMonster Guideto every print Monster Guide reward.\nOctober 22 Update: Here's an example-of-play video demonstrating the skills, combat, and using the \"boost\" game mechanic for various effects.\n  Five Moons is a fantasy RPG designed by me, Sean K Reynolds. Its play style will be familiar to fans of D&D and the Pathfinder RPG, but colored by my experiences in the tabletop, card, and video game industry over the past 19 years.\nDo you spend more time creating a character than actually playing that character? Does the minmaxer in your group hog the spotlight instead of being a team player? Do you think spellcasters are too good compared to fighters and rogues? Does your character's dependence on magic items feel like a \"Christmas tree\"? It's time to reboot your playing experience. \nWith Five Moons RPG, you can play a character that's fun and successful without having to focus on combat math. You can choose skills that make your character well-rounded--without making you vulnerable. You can wear magic items that are fun and flavorful instead of just being a source of plusses. You can defeat opponents using diplomacy or intimidation, and not just with one all-or-nothing roll.\nThis is a game that mixes old-school simplicity with the customizability of a modern RPG.\nThe goals for this game are:\n* Create a book that's easy to read, understand, play, and reference, like the Pathfinder RPG Beginner Box (a product I wrote and am very proud of).\n* Make characters less dependent upon their gear to survive and succeed.\n* Elevate martial characters to have parity with spellcasters, but still maintain fun and distinct flavor for each class. (caster/martial disparity blog #1) (disparity blog #2) (wands obsolete skills blog)\n* Reward roleplaying, teamwork, adventuring, and social interaction instead of focusing on damage output in combat. (teamwork blog)\n* Create a longer play experience in the leveling \"sweet spot\" (the D&D/PFRPG equivalent of level 6 to level 12) and allow characters to level more frequently so they don't remain exactly the same for many game sessions. (leveling \"sweet spot\" blog)\n* Simplify scaling monster encounters against various character levels.\n* Allow for pseudo-medieval fantasy without \"realism\" hindering characters. (fantasy physics blog entry)\n(The above links point to specific blog entries I've made about those points on the Five Moons RPG blog.)\nThe target funding level of this campaign is to create two initial books:\nFive Moons Corebook: A 128-page hardcover book containing player and GM info, such as classes, races, character creation, skills, combat, magic items, environment, and running a campaign. Also known as \"the Corebook.\"\nFive Moons Player's Guide: A 64-page trimmed-down version of the rules, providing everything a player needs to create a character and play the game.\nStretch goals beyond this will fund the creation of additional books, starting with the Monster Guide, a 32-page book of monsters (see Stretch Goals, below).\nSome of the rewards for this kickstarter are multiple books grouped together into bundles. To keep the different rewards and add-ons from getting confusing as stretch goals add more to each backer level, each backer level grants you a specific bundle, and the bundles are described below. This lets you select what set of rewards you want with one bundle instead of having to manually specify add-ons to your reward levels.\nFor example, the \"Ultimate PDF Backer\" bundle offers you the Corebook PDF, Player's Guide PDF, Monster Guide PDF (the first stretch goal), and PDFs of all other books that are unlocked as stretch goals. Bundles will grow larger and more valuable if we reach the stretch goals we have planned.\nConfused? Check out this handy chart! The columns are the backer level, the rows are the rewards, and the dots mean you get that row's reward if you select that column's backer level. Note: I'm committed to this project and these books. Even if we don't pre-fund a book as a stretch goal, the book will get made, so there's no reason not to pick a reward that includes the later books. I'm a game industry pro, I've been making RPGs for almost 20 years, and self-publishing for more than 10 years.\nHere's a description of all the backer levels, unlocked books, and the bundles.\nAdventure #1 (locked stretch goal): Cavern of the Venomous Pillar, a 32-page adventure.\nAdventure #2 (locked stretch goal): A 32-page adventure.\nAdventure #3 (locked stretch goal): A 32-page adventure.\nBook of Treasures (locked stretch goal): A 32-page sourcebook of new magic items.\nCharacter Options (locked stretch goal): A 32-page sourcebook of new classes and player character abilities.\nCults and Guilds (locked stretch goal): A 32-page sourcebook about factions, religions, and organizations in the World of Five Moons.\nCorebook: The Five Moons RPG Corebook.

This bundle continues to gain additional books as we meet stretch goals.\nLike most fantasy RPGs, you can use Five Moons RPG to run your own campaign world or a published game setting by another company. Some of the design decisions for the game were made with a new setting in mind: the World of Five Moons.\nIn this campaign setting, various civilizations are spread out over many islands in a flat sea. Circling above are five large moons (each representing a powerful god-like entity), and below is a cloud of ether inhabited by alien shapechanging dragons. Magical barriers prevented the civilizations from mixing for decades, but the barriers recently collapsed, allowing a new era of exploration, trade, and conflict between peoples.\nYou can run a campaign in the World of Five Moons as a straight-up adventure-based setting with humans, dwarves, elves, orcs, lost civilizations, and all the fantasy trappings you are used to. Or you can look deeper and delve into who created this world, the reason why its various humanoid races can interbreed, and address the question of what it is to be \"human\" in a world where people can alter their shapes as an act of will or in response to environmental factors. Here is an in-character overview blog post about the setting.\nNow that this project has hit its $25,000 funding goal, we can reveal stretch goals here that'll fund the creation of additional books for the game.\n(Keep in mind: I am committed to making all of the books listed as part of this project, whether or not we hit these stretch goals. Having them as stretch goals just means they're pre-funded, which means I can pay the designers, artists, and editors sooner rather than later.)\nStretch Goal #1: pre-fun the Five Moons Monster Guide: Achieved! Now everyone whose backer reward includes this book in print also gets it in PDF.\nStretch Goal #2 (unlocked at $45,000)\u2014Cavern of the Venomous Pillar: A 32-page introductory adventure for low-level characters.\nWe're in the process of determining the cost of add-ons like dice and t-shirts. In the meantime, you can select the following add-ons by manually increasing your pledge, including multiple copies.\n(Be sure to add the listed extra shipping cost for physical items, which are listed after each item.)\nPlayer's Guide PDF: add $7 for each PDF.\nPlayer's Guide in print: add $20 for each book, plus $5 total for USA shipping or plus $20 total for international shipping.\nCorebook PDF: Add $14 for each PDF.\nCorebook in print: add $35 for each book, plus $5 total for USA shipping or plus $20 total for international shipping .\nMonster Guide in print: Add $7 for the PDF, or $12 for print+PDF (buy it in print, you get the PDF for free). Add $5 for USA shipping or $20 total for international shipping. (If your reward includes the Corebook in print or Player's Guide in print, you do not need to add anything for shipping the Monster Guide, as it'll all go in the same shipment.)\nAdventure #1 Cavern of the Venomous Pillar: Add $12 for each print book, plus $5 total for USA shipping or plus $20 total for international shipping. Add $7 for the PDF. (If your reward includes the Corebook in print, Player's Guide in print, or Monster Guide in print, you do not need to add anything for shipping this adventure, as it'll all go in the same shipment.)\nSolo Portrait: Add $75 for a one-third-page black & white illustration by artist Gerald Lee. In this illustration, Gerald will draw one character from your gaming group (or fantasy versions of you or someone you know) in a standing pose or ready for action. This illustration will appear in the Corebook and Player's Guide, and will include a caption with the name of your character (or the player it represents). You will receive a high-resolution image file of this illustration.\nT-Shirts: Not technically add-ons, but JBM Press will be making Five Moons t-shirts using official art! You'll be able to order them directly from jbmpress.com. \nAs other books are unlocked, they'll also be added to this section (mainly for people whose backer levels don't automatically include those books).\nYou can help spread the word about this project by using these badges and this Facebook cover photo on social media. And here is a one-page flier you can hang up at your local game store (get permission first!).

Went to Gen Con. Came back from Gen Con. Waited to receive the confirmation email that the cover had been approved. Finally emailed One Bookshelf (OBS) to ask if the cover had been approved. They said yes it had, and also told me that didn't have to wait for the confirmation email, I could check that online (even though every time before this I got a confirmation email). I checked the interior pages one more time, caught a few typos, uploaded the interior file again. Waited a couple of days and checked online to see if the interior file had been approved. Saw that the interior file had been rejected and so had the cover (even though the cover had been approved earlier and I hadn't changed it since then). Talked to OBS, they saw that the interior pages' bleed (how much blank space is around the edge of the page) was insufficient, even though it was the same setup as the last interior file I submitted. They weren't sure why the cover was rejected after being approved and they said they'd talk to Lightning Source (the actual printing company that OBS uses) about it. Got the interior bleed fixed, uploaded, and approved. Got the OK from Lightning Source and OBS about the cover. Decided to order one more proof copy to make sure the cover looked right (as I didn't want the cover art to be shifted off the page on every single copy sent out to you). That proof copy arrived today, and it looks fine (photo attached below). So I'm going to upload the shipping addresses of print backers into the OBS site and order your print copies tonight!

You will also get more snakes in Snakeman's episode and better VFX!\n\u201cDark Darkness\u201d is an adventure-comedy-fantasy web series featuring cross-genre misfits who meet at a Darkness Convention and must learn to get along in order to survive.\n\"Ronald's Summoning\" poster art by Ryan Hume\nWHAT IS \"DARK DARKNESS\"?\n\u201cDark Darkness\u201d is a new adventure-comedy-fantasy web series featuring dark lords, mythical crossbreeds, a vampire-wizard, a sorceress-ninja queen, Jerry the Snakeman, and Ronald the Dungeon Master who is a dedicated D&D gamer. Our characters are quirky and rough but definitely lovable. Ronald is a bit full of himself, since he is a metaphorical wizard at D&D. While Ronald lacks many social skills, he has more than a few endearing qualities. Mordecai is also full of himself, which creates constant tension between him and Ronald. But, deep underneath all that anger there is a weakness that Mordecai has gone to great lengths to hide, including disguising himself as Jesus in hopes of out running a secret from his past. Ganamazol is riddled with responsibility and only wants to be care free, but finds she is the only one who can conquer all that her life demands as a sorceress ninja queen. Jerry the Snakeman is intelligent and a diplomat, but has trouble making any friends other than those of the snake variety. Put them all together and it's a powder keg of personalities that must learn to subdue the explosive results or be captured and executed for a murder they didn't commit. Our characters join forces, or conspire against each other, in a magical, fantastical realm. We have Seasons One and Two written, but are making a short, four episode Season Zero to introduce our characters individually before they meet each other.\nWhere is the money going?\nThis video gives a summary of what we will be spending the money on. We are fortunate enough with the help of several different companies including, Current Media Productions, Hand Crank Films and Varvid, to get most of our equipment costs sponsored. So 10% of the money will go to Kickstarter and credit cards fees, 15% will go toward reward fulfillment & 60% of the money will go to the film professionals that do the work. The other 15% will go to location, materials and food.\n\nWhat's happening right now!?\nThe first two episodes of Season Zero have been released. We need your help to finish Episode Three and Four.  Funds from the Kickstarter campaign will be used to complete post production on Episode Three, \"Ganamazol's Gambit\" and shoot principle photography on Episode Four, \"Snakeman's Solitude\". Look at how much work we put into episode Three so far!\n\nSeason Zero points our characters to a \"Darkness Convention\". What's a Darkness convention you ask? A Darkness Convention is a convention for people who love the Darkness and this is where our characters meet for the first time and discover there may be more to their invitations than just a friendly invite.\nThe Cast:\n    As you can see from the promo video, \"Ganamazol's Gambit\" stars Elle Sonnet as the title character. Elle has a long list of credits and has trained for screen fighting and creature acting. Elle is also the host and producer of Chicly Geek, a geeky news and Con highlight coverage show in a webisode style of nerderific proportions. So obviously she fits in with Dark Darkness like Velma in the Mystery Van.\nElle Sonnet as Ganamazol, photo by Damian Vines Photography\n   \"Snakeman's Solitude\" stars Jordan Donovan who played \"Jerry the Snakeman\" in the original stage play. Jordan is also an alumni Main Stage player at Ryan Stile's Upfront Theater in Bellingham Washington. Jordan has collaborated with Ben Eisner, the series creator, in many plays and with Wilson Large on many video projects over the years. Jordan has also been a partner with Darkness co-stars DK Reinemer & Morgan Grobe in Fellsbrook Productions. We know you will love him as Snakeman because he is truly one of the more gifted actors we've seen. Jordan currently owns and operates Current Media Productions in Bellingham Wash.\nJordan Donovan in early concept make-up and wardrobe for Snakeman\nDD History: \u201cDark Darkness\u201d is based on the award-winning serial play, \u201cThe Dastardly Death of Dr. Darkness\u201d, written by Ben Eisner, which premiered at Bellingham\u2019s Idiom Theater in 2007. The play was optioned in 2008 and the screenplay adaptation was finished by Wilson Large in 2011. Large met with Zombie Orpheus Entertainment's Ben Dobyns for advice on developing a cloud based, fan supported product in the winter of 2011, and that's when the idea for Season Zero came about. Season Zero commenced filming in the spring of 2012. The process of making the series has almost been as epic as the characters journey within the series. Here is a short documentary made by some WWU students on Wilson's passion and progress for the project which was made in the Winter of 2013:\nOUR PLAN:\nWHY WE NEED YOUR HELP:\nAlthough the story is often funny and campy, the production value and level of talent of all involved is quite high. The funds raised will be used to pay for items such as wardrobe, makeup, production design and visual FX. Furthermore, the involvement of key cast and crew requires they be paid for their time and efforts. Other costs include gear, such as camera rental, lighting, and audio equipment. The cast and crew are a passionate, dedicated lot and have worked tirelessly for little compensation to get this project off the ground for the love of the story and its characters.\nWriter-Director Wilson Large has already invested tens of thousands of dollars in the project and has been working over the last five years toward bringing Dark Darkness to audiences around the world via a dedicated web channel.\nWHAT'S NEXT?\nUpon successful completion of Season Zero, which this Kickstarter campaign will fund- THANKS TO YOU-- \"Dark Darkness\" will be on the fast track to attract potential independent investors, giving birth to Seasons One and Two and beyond. The story that these characters share is exciting, fantastic and very very funny. We hope you become fans and that we get a chance to share the entire epic journey with you.\nSTRETCH GOALS-\nStretch Goal #1- $3,500 When we reach $3,500 I will put on a special screening of Season Zero sometime after the premieres and donate all the profits from this screening to the Whatcom Hospice Foundation. Hospice played an important part in the final days of someone very dear to me and I want to give back!\nStretch Goal #2- $4,000 I set the original goal at $3,000 because I knew I could make Snakeman's episode and finish the VFX on Ganamazol with a lot of volunteers for that much money. But, I am a very strong advocate for creating paying jobs in the film industry in my home town. Help me put my money where my mouth is and pay everyone that helps to wrap up this season of Dark Darkness. I am not taking any money from this campaign and will most likely still wind up paying some money out of pocket. But, I would love to be able to budget some money for everyone involved.

We want to shoot these scenes with miniatures instead of CGI. We need your help to do it.\nThe Story\nFor the past 14 years, Michael Laine has been trying to do something most people think is impossible: build an elevator to space.\nMichael\u2019s suffered to make this dream a reality. He\u2019s lost his livelihood, loved ones and friends on his quest to make space easily accessible for humanity. Still, there's hope. He resurrected his company, LiftPort, and raised $110,000 on Kickstarter to fund his ambitious experiment yet: making a robot climb the tallest free-standing human structure in existence.\nFamily, friends and supporters have questioned his efforts, and he\u2019s under incredible pressure to pull it off. Is Michael a visionary or just another dreamer? Fair or not, much of the answer to this question rides on his ability to finish this experiment. His company, credibility and ability to continue his space elevator journey are on the line. It's make or break, and we\u2019re capturing it all on film. The lead up. The experiment. Everything.\nThis film is about humanity: both pushing it forward and the struggle of those who dare to do so. It\u2019s about following dreams with dogged determination amidst countless setbacks. Of course, it\u2019s also about the next great leap for humanity. Michael thinks a space elevator can give us permanent access to the Moon for less than a billion dollars.\nThe Experiment and Why It\u2019s Important \nLiftPort has created a prototype elevator: a self-powered robot that can climb a high-strength tether. By climbing 30,000-feet, the robot will test its effectiveness and ability to endure conditions similar to those a full-blown elevator would face. It\u2019s the most rigorous test LiftPort can do on Earth. What would be next? Satellite experiments.\nAfter that, LiftPort thinks it\u2019ll have the technology and know-how to build an elevator from the Moon to space. More than a dozen countries already operate space programs sophisticated enough to blast off from Earth and dock with such an elevator, and that brings the Moon closer than ever before. Reaching the lunar surface would be as easy as riding down a tether -- no hard landings. What\u2019s more, humanity can use the Moon to organize and launch expeditions deeper into space.\nThen, the holy grail: an elevator from Earth to space. While it isn\u2019t possible with today\u2019s technology, Michael thinks LiftPort will have the experience and skill to build it after they construct the lunar system. When scientists can create a tether strong enough for an Earth-based system, LiftPort will be ready to build it -- or so they hope.\nWhy Are Space Elevators Cool? \nCan cut costs of launching cargo from $10,000 per pound to roughly $100 per pound. \n Green energy via space-based solar panels. \nSpace elevators on Mars, Earth and other planets and moons! \nBuild and launch rockets in orbit for deep space exploration. \nLiftPort's ultimate goal: an elevator climbing from Earth to space. For now, they're focusing on a Moon-based elevator.\nWhy are we making this film?\nThe age of doing big things has waned. The railroads, highways, and electric grids were all built decades ago. It appears the epoch of discovery has passed. No human has ventured to the greatest unknown - outer space - in decades.\nThis is a film about the part of all of us that seeks to push humanity forward despite seemingly insurmountable odds. Not all dreams are meant to die when we wake.\nOur Goal\nWe've been working on this project for nearly a year, and have put $20,000 of our own money and countless hours into this project. 75 percent of the principal photography is finished, but...\nWe want to make the film as polished as a big-budget release, with top-notch, miniature-based special effects, stunning visuals and a sweeping soundtrack. To do that, we need to raise money.\nOur goal is to raise enough funds to shoot the miniature-based special effects sequences for the film. Think Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and Alien rather than modern day CGI-based special effects. \nIronically, the first-ever film to use miniature-based special effects was the 1902 Le Voyage dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon) by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s.\nThe technology has come a long way since 1902.\nHere's a video of how the Star Wars films used miniature-based special effects to create a galaxy far far away. The BBC recently wrote about how minature-based special effects is making a comeback in the CGI era. \nOur goal of $37,000 will allow us to show you what the space elevator can, should and one day will be!\nwww.c-themovie.com\nOur model miniatures will be built by Charles Adams, who\u2019s crafted models for major motion pictures and Battlestar Galactica.

The team has worked together on multiple projects including another documentary - Kadi - a film about the dangers poor mothers face in Kenya. \nDirector: Benjamin Ahr Harrison\nBenjamin has directed short subject documentaries on three continents. He won two Webby Awards for The Engadget Show, an internet doc-series where he first produced a segment on the lunar elevator. He is a lifelong space enthusiast, and a first time feature film director.\nExecutive Producer: Mahad Ibrahim\nDr. Mahad Ibrahim is a founder and managing partner of Gobee Group, a social innovation design firm that is on a mission to find solutions to the world\u2019s pressing problems through making technology meaningful. Mahad has specialized in producing engaging books, video, film, and mixed media that explain technology simply to broad audiences including a documentary about maternal health in Kenya. He is also a lifelong space enthusiast.\nProducer: Alexis Santos\nAlexis is a writer who's penned pieces on technology, science and space for Engadget. Based near Florida's Space Coast, he's currently leading content efforts for a technology startup. Alexis has been inside Space Shuttle Atlantis and still can't get over it.\nProducer: Idil Ibrahim\nIdil is an award-winning filmmaker who's worked on films showcased at Sundance, Toronto and other festivals. She's usually behind the camera, but she occasionally appears in front of it.\nShe has lived and worked extensively in East Africa and has produced projects filmed worldwide in places including Serbia, Japan, Turkey, Somalia, Lebanon, Kenya and Uganda, but never the moon! Most recently, she was the female lead in Fishing Without Nets, directed by Cutter Hodierne, which took home the Directing Award for US Dramatic Film at the 2014 Sundance Film Festival. She also directed and produced the \"Making Of\" Fishing Without Nets for VICE and considers herself a seafarer.\nEditor: Todd Thoenig\nTodd is a freelance editor based in New York City who's done work for clients including AOL, NBC, New Balance, Tanqueray and many more.\nThe amazing team at Make That Thing is helping us with all things Kickstarter. We want to make sure that all our backers are treated right! The best way to do that is to bring in the experts. Make That Thing has a lot of experience managing some of the most successful Kickstarter projects out there.\nThe Rewards\nThe greatest reward you will receive from backing this Kickstarter project is knowing that you have contributed to a top-quality independent film about building the biggest thing ever.\nWe want people to be able to help in ways large and small.\nDigital rewards\nOfficial Backers at the $10 level will have their name indelibly linked to this film through our website.\nIn response to your feedback, we\u2019ve just introduced a new way to watch the film. For $15 at the Downloader level, you\u2019ll snag an HD download of the film after its theatrical release. We will, of course, also recognize your critical contribution to making this film with your name on our website. The key difference between the Downloader and Movie Watcher ($25) levels is that you won\u2019t receive access to the online, early-access preview of the film that will happen before the theatrical release.\nThe Movie Watcher level ($25) gives you special access to an early online screener of the film only available to Kickstarter backers. Shortly after the film has been released, you'll also get an HD download of the film.\nA select group of 50 backers will be a Shoot The Moon reviewer ($150). You will participate in an online review of an early cut of the film.  Give your notes on the film along with other members of the Shoot The Moon team. Backers at this level will also receive the autographed poster, mission patch, access to the online screener, and an HD download of the film. \nPhysical rewards\nWhat journey to the moon would be complete without your very own commemorative mission patch.  The patch will be done in the style of the NASA Apollo mission patches (see image below).  The design is not done yet, but we promise it will be very cool!  NASA has a nice page showing all the Apollo mission patches. The Mission Patch level ($35) comes with access to the online screening, download and your name enshrined on the Shoot The Moon website. The Mission Patch will only be available from Kickstarter. \nApollo 15 Mission patch (Source: NASA)\nNo film about space is complete without an iconic movie poster. We're designing a limited edition one just for Kickstarter that'll live up to that tradition. The exclusive poster will capture the splendor of a space elevator and the audacity of the race to build one. It'll be a special way to show you supported this project from the start. The Poster level ($50) also comes with the online screening, download and recognition on the website. For $100 at the Autographed Poster level, you get the poster signed by the filmmakers, plus the patch, online screening, download and recognition on the website. \nAs a Reviewer you'll be a special part of the filmmaking process for $150. You'll have online access to early parts of the film and can give us notes on what you think. We'll listen and discuss things with you. It'll be as if you're in the editing room with members of the Shoot The Moon team. You'll also score a limited edition Shoot the Moon movie poster signed by Michael and the filmmakers, plus the mission patch, online screening, download and recognition on the website.\nBecome an ace Lunar Cartographer for $200 with a very cool Shoot The Moon rotating (and solar-powered!) moon globe for your desk! You also get the mission patch, online screening, download, and recognition on the website. \nIt's 4.5 inches of solar-powered, spinnin' moon goodness.\nWalk the Red Carpet with us at a private screening for $500. You and a guest will receive tickets to your choice of screening in New York City or Los Angeles. As much as we wish we had a space elevator today to whisk you through lower earth orbit to these cities, we don't! You'll need to find your own transportation to the screenings. We may be able to connect you with Virgin Galactic if you like to travel in style. \nFor the monetarily unchallenged, we have the Associate and Executive Producer levels. Both tiers receive all the rewards and a credit in the film. The Executive Producer level comes with a top hat, monocle and money bag befitting their status. (Sorry, cash not included.)\nYou'll rock a top hat, monocle and a money bag at the premiere... and at home and public, if you want. We won't judge.\nWhy are we doing a Kickstarter?\nThere's no doubt that the Kickstarter funds are needed to realize our vision. We're independent filmmakers working with more passion than money to make a film worthy of something that could be the next big leap in human evolution. \nOur goal for this Kickstarter is mostly about building a movement. We want to connect with the community of dreamers, doers and all those that believe the sole purpose of science fiction is to foreshadow reality.  \nWe know you are out there and we want this Kickstarter to serve as the base for this journey to Shoot The Moon.  \nWe want to spread the word as far and wide as possible, and we can\u2019t do that without you. After all, we\u2019re making this film for kindred spirits: fans of space, science, technology and real stories where people face insurmountable odds.\nJoin us in this adventure to Earth's closest companion: The Moon.  \nWe believe in Kickstarter and are active participants in the community. \nWe had to open a new account for the film, but the members of our team have collectively backed over 60 projects. We've also successfully Kickstarted two of our own. \nOur profiles are:\nBen: www.kickstarter.com/profile/benjaminahr \nMahad: www.kickstarter.com/profile/1097131721\nAlexis: www.kickstarter.com/profile/geek", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've been around the video production block many times, but this is the first feature-length production we've done.

Make a Map. Find Adventure.\n\"Worldspinner is the online worldbuilding tool that gamers and authors have been waiting for.  It will give your world a solid foundation upon which your own imagination has limitless room to expand.\" - Philip Athans, best-selling author of Annihilation and The Guide to Writing Fantasy and Science Fiction\nWorldspinner makes it easy to create your own richly detailed fantasy world in minutes, including continents, mountain ranges, cultures, kingdoms, cities, and more. Then, delve as deeply as you like into customizing your world. You can create beautiful maps without spending hours with paint tools, and without needing to be an artist. \nWorldspinner is a tool, not a game. It doesn\u2019t replace your creativity, but multiplies it. It is hosted online, so you don\u2019t need to download anything and it is available anywhere. The technology is almost complete; the maps and screenshots you see below are all real examples from the working system. \n\"Worldspinner is going to be huge for everyone who loves creating fantasy worlds.\" - Wolfgang Baur, Publisher, Kobold Press and author of Kobold Guide to Worldbuilding\nYou can quickly create a world by selecting from a list of themes and letting Worldspinner figure out the details, or you can carefully control the world creation steps yourself. \nCreate the physical world. Every world is approximately the size of the Earth, and has its own topography: continents, islands, mountain ranges, oceans, lakes, and rivers. Geophysical processes are used to model climate and biomes, so forests, deserts, tundras, and other biomes end up where they make sense. \nPopulate your world and watch history unfold. You choose which cultures you want in your world: Celtic, Persian, Dwarf, or a dozen others? If you\u2019re particularly fond of one, you can even order physical coins for it (courtesy of our partners: Fantasy Coins LLC and Conquistador Games). Then watch as a history simulator fills in the backstory of your world, charting the rise and fall of nations, and populating the map with cities. \nCities & Points of Interest. Each city is automatically named based on its culture. You'll never again have to say \u201cthat city to the West\u201d if you aren\u2019t feeling inspired at the moment, or lose track of the name of that little market town that\u2019s on the road to the capital. The world also contains points of interest such as \"dragon's lair\" or \u201cKing Aethelwulf\u2019s Tomb.\u201d You can influence which things show up by choosing the themes you want to highlight in your campaign.  \nExplore your world and make it yours. Worldspinner creates an entire world with incredible detail, and no two are the same. Explore your world to make sure it aligns with your vision and imagination. You can move, delete, rename or create new points of interest and cities. It\u2019s your world, after all, and you have the final say.\n\"Not since the work done by Judges Guild and Harn in the late 1970s has there been such a great product for fantasy mapping. The ability to generate adventure on a strategic scale, as well as populate it with cities, encounters and other adventure material is awesome.\" - Bill Webb, Frog God Games\nOnce you have created your world, you can define the areas you want to print as maps. Maps can be anything from world map down to details of a specific kingdom. Just as with Earth, a single world can fill thousands of maps. \nSizes. Members can print 8.5 x 11\u201d maps for free at home, which is handy when you need one for tonight\u2019s session. But maps are definitely one of those things that get better as they get bigger. So we\u2019ll print and ship maps in three larger sizes:\nStyles. Worldspinner automatically creates high-quality maps in a range of styles to suit your tastes.  Here are a few examples:\nPolitical\nAged parchment\nIllustrated - click for 4000 pixel wide version\n                                 \"An elaborate temple compound, and rumors of a dark plot?  Whatever.  Let's go check out the pirate islands instead!\u201d - Druk Khalborg, 3rd level Rogue\nSound like your players? No problem! In addition to great maps Worldspinner gives you information and hooks to make it easy to come up with adventures on the fly.\nCities full of Plots. Plots help address the question of \"what do we do in tomorrow\u2019s game?\" If you keep your laptop open to Worldspinner during the game, you can click on any city and see a list of potential plot hooks such as \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong with the mayor\" or \u201cQuest for a lost book.\" Selecting a plot will bring up more information on a possible adventure to be had, anywhere from a few sentences to a page or two.  \nVisit Points of Interest. Delve into your world to find the most interesting places for your players to explore. If you click on a point of interest, such as a fishing or trading port, Worldspinner will provide you with information about that port. For example, the port was part of a Norse nation founded 450 years ago, but was created 715 years ago by the Elves before they left this part of the world. This helps to provide a consistent backstory for the game, should you wish to use it. \nTrack progress with the Notebook. Worldspinner provides a logical place to keep notes on what\u2019s happened at a given place, or what you have planned there in the future. If the players come back to a town they set fire to a couple years ago, the locals are going to remember \u2014 and so will you.\nThis is the coolest thing I've heard about all year.\" - Ian Irvine, author, Three Worlds\nMost of the rewards for this project include multiple parts. Here\u2019s a comparison of the reward levels and a little more information on each part.\nOne Year of Worldspinner Membership - As a Worldspinner member, we will store up to five worlds for you, with all your notes, for one year. You can also print as many letter-sized (8.5 x 11, or A4) maps as you like on your own printer.  Memberships are automatically extended each time you buy a new map.  If you want to keep using Worldspinner a year later without buying more maps, that's fine... another year of membership is expected to be $9.95.\nAlpha Access to the Website - As a reward for early backers, some of the rewards grant access to the Worldspinner website before it is opened to the public. During this time, you'll be able to generate your world, order your map(s), and help the Worldspinner team prioritize future features.\nHero of Kickstarter - Great heroes leave their marks on history. When one arises, they can break a century-old stalemate to expand a kingdom\u2019s boundaries. Maps are dotted with cities, rivers, even nations named after these great leaders. As a backer at the $30 level or beyond, you can elevate your favorite RPG character to a Hero of Kickstarter. Such Heroes have a chance of appearing in the worlds that others spin, and leaving their names* across the maps.\nLegendary Heroes* - The mightiest heroes become figures of legend. Our artist will create a bust of your hero based on your description, and we (in collaboration with our partner Conquistador Games) will strike coins in their honor bearing their likeness and name*. Coins are made of metal alloy and come in a range of sizes; backers are given choice of preferred size in order of pledge date. You\u2019ll get a coin purse with 500 coins, 100 of which feature your hero. These coins will also be sold at retail, so they will be used in campaigns all over the real world. One of your hero's coins will be a limited edition plated in 24K gold and framed.  Plus, your hero will appear in many other people\u2019s worlds, on maps and in history.  And they will be mentioned in one of the adventures being written for this Kickstarter by professional fantasy and RPG authors.\nPremium Content - A major goal of this Kickstarter is to fund the creation of new adventures to be sold as Premium Content once Worldspinner goes live.  However, all Kickstarter backers at the $40 level or beyond will get all Premium Content funded by this campaign at no additional charge. The more stretch goals you help us hit, the better this gets!\nSponsor a Theme or Culture* - For themes: you collaborate with the author to set the direction, and we develop it into 10,000+ words of content. For cultures: you pick a historical or (non-copyrighted) fantasy culture, and we\u2019ll implement it \u2014 including the history simulator and name linguistics.  You and everyone else can use these on your maps, and you get major bragging rights!\n* Personalized rewards are subject to our approval; we may reject and refund for any cause at our sole discretion.\n\"Creating a fantasy world is an act of the imagination... Worldspinner has both the capability to present an entire world and the attention to detail to bring it fully alive for others.\" - Jeff Grubb, Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms\nThis Kickstarter isn't about making Worldspinner; that's already on track.  It's about making it better.  We've purposefully set the funding goal low, so we can see how far we get into the stretch goals.  The further we get, the more we can include in the release.\nMost of the stretch goals will unlock new content from an amazing collection of fantasy authors and RPG game designers.

The myths, the folklore, the campfire stories, and urban legends. Every terrifying tale of things that go bump in the night\u2026they\u2019re all true. These soul-sucking, flesh-devouring, shadow-haunting fiends want nothing more than to eat you and everyone you love. That\u2019s where we come in. The Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch. Most just call us Demon Hunters. If you haven\u2019t heard of us, we\u2019re doing a good job. In the name of all that is Good, we fight the forces of Evil. And we\u2019re hiring!\nDead Gentlemen Productions, creators of the worldwide cult hit films The Gamers, The Gamers: Dorkness Rising,and The Gamers: Hands of Fate,are once again teaming up with RPG professionals to bring you the new Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors corebook. \nOur world is a dangerous and ridiculous place. If you love the TV shows Supernatural, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and The A-Team, along with movies like Army of Darkness, Evil Dead 2, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters, Ghostbusters, and James Bond, we do too and it's all here. The truth is, as mentioned above, it's ALL real. Like the show, Supernatural, the Demon Hunters setting relies on existing lore, urban legends, etc., because we have found that the truth really is stranger than fiction. \nThe Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch is the worldwide organization that operates behind the screen of the mainstream. We are what stands in the way of you and what wants to eat your heart while you watch, you know, because it's Tuesday.\nBecause the forces of evil in our world are SO evil and powerful and prevalent, we use comedy to help fight it back. This game is a training tool to help you face what's out there. So grab your friends, generate scenarios, tell your collaborative story, and laugh. Laugh hard. It steels your soul for the horror that awaits you.\nBefore The Gamers, The Gamers: Dorkness Rising, JourneyQuest, or The Gamers: Hands of Fate, there was Demon Hunters. The group that would become The Dead Gentlemen created 2 feature length digital films between 1999 and 2001. The movies were enjoyed by college audiences, and the world we created has inspired us ever since. In 2008 we partnered with Margaret Weis Productions and released the Demon Hunters Roleplaying Game. In April 2014 we relaunched our Demon Hunters story in the form of a webcomic, rebooting the canon, and now we'd like to create a new Demon Hunters RPG using rules inspired by the Fate Core system. Additionally we have developed an adventure generation system based on our experience and tools as screenwriters and storytellers. That's where this Kickstarter Campaign comes in.\nDemon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors Corebook\nThis is a mockup. Actual book may look different.\nWithin the 248 pages of this deluxe-yet-surprisingly-portable Bible-sized (6\" x 9\") roleplaying game book are all the rules and guidelines you need to create your Demon Hunter, seek out and thwart the minions of evil, and survive long enough to keep the mundanes from hearing about it. From character generation to gameplay, it is designed to get you fully into the story quickly. Our system is building on Fate Accelerated & Steve Kenson's Icons Assembled, so if you love those games you're going to love the Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors. \nFor the Gamemaster, an adventure generation system utilizing our storytelling structures that provides tables, charts, clever advice, and a host of useful story elements keeps you from going crazy while spinning grand and epic tales of infernal nastiness. \nIt's a gorgeous black and white tome with a foil-stamped leather-like softcover, and makes a great bludgeoning weapon in case of emergency. \nPLAYTESTING UPDATE: Every backer who pledges for the STARTER KIT or higher reward levels will receive playtesting materials in PDF as they become available. We anticipate the first round shortly after the campaign is over. The playtesting materials will be for both gameplay and adventure creation.\nDemon Hunters Player's Guide PDF\nThis brief primer gets your players acquainted with the world and how to build a basic character. It also includes a number of pregenerated playable characters.\nBurnout! A Dynamic Demon Hunters Example Mission\nThis adventure is designed in the style of mad libs so that you can use the elements in the corebook mission generation system, or the Gamemaster's Apprentice cards (Chill! We\u2019ll tell you about those in just a minute - sheesh). Your team of Demon Hunters have to investigate a strange repeat occurrence, unraveling a dastardly evil plot. Can your hunters save the day? \nAntiTank Sally\nDemon Hunters Temporary Tattoos\nOne of the most notable aspects of this setting is that every Demon Hunter has a Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch tattoo (the one with the 3 swords), and every Order of the Infernal Scepter agent is branded with their insignia. At the TREESLAYER reward level and above, you receive these as temporary tattoos.\nCustom Demon Hunters Dice\nWe are still finalizing what these are going to look like. Below is a photo of our initial prototype, subject to change. Final dice images will be available before the end of the Kickstarter Campaign. You will have the chance to pick up Demon Hunters dice of either or both factions (Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch or Order of the Infernal Scepter) at their respective reward levels, or when the campaign is over through BackerKit (See description below), even if your reward level doesn't include them. \nCONTEST: The Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch and the Order of the Infernal Scepter have been at war with each other for ages. You get to pick a side by backing the CELESTIAL TORCH DICE or INFERNAL SCEPTER DICE reward levels. Whichever faction receives the most support, its backers will win a PDF of the Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors. This includes BackerKit orders!\nPrototype Dice. Design still being finalized.\nDemon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice Cards PDF\nDesigned by team member and professional game designer Nathan Rockwood, this print and play deck of 60 double-sided cards, themed for the world and style of The Demon Hunters, can generate plot seeds, characters, or encounters on the fly, or help a GM plan adventures. These cards also come with a special link for DriveThruCards to buy a printed deck at a discounted price.\nDemon Hunters Adventure Guide PDF\nA series of suggestions, examples, and pre-constructed setups--the Demon Hunters Adventure Guide PDF used in conjunction with the tables in the corebook, or the Demon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice cards (or both!) gets your chapter of Demon Hunters out in the field and honing their skills, even when you feel like you've run out of story!\nThe Cipherspace Codex\nThe digital collection of everything we're offering, including but not limited to:\nDemon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors Corebook PDF\nFillable PDF Character Sheet\nFillable PDF Mission Record Sheet\nPDF Demon Hunters Players Guide, including sample pregenerated characters\nA Demon Hunters Adventure Guide PDF\nPDF Sample Adventure, Demon Hunters: Burnout!\nPDF of the Demon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice Print and Play card deck\nPDF of the script from our college movie that started it all, Demon Hunters\nPDF of a script from the followup movie of our college movie that started it all, Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake\nPDF 2008 version of the Demon Hunters Roleplaying Game, published by Margaret Weis Productions\nDigital Demon Hunters Wallpapers for desktop and mobile devices\nBacker Milestone Goal Reached!

This is the official Brotherhood of the Celestial Torch pin. The pin is 2\" long with 2 clutches!\nMockup. Not actual pin.\n         Add-ons will only be available through BackerKit. We want to run a simple campaign and have found that add-ons create a layer of complication. So not to worry, add-ons will be available when you go to check out when the campaign is over. We will add previews of those here when they're available.\nWhen the campaign ends we will be using BackerKit to help fulfill your rewards and send out the surveys. BackerKit is like a last minute shopping cart, like the rack with all the candy bars, magazines, and batteries to tempt you at the checkout stand. So if you missed out on something that was revealed during the campaign, or you wanted to add something your reward level doesn't include, you will get a second chance to purchase it with BackerKit. \nGabriel\nShipping costs are out of control. And in particular, out of OUR control. All of the rewards include shipping anywhere in the USA. It is stunning what it costs to ship outside the USA and the paperwork to do it. If you live outside the USA, please note the extra shipping fee on each reward. Kickstarter automatically adds this when you check out. \nWe know from experience that delivering rewards is often underestimated. That's why we're extending the estimated delivery dates. We are aiming to ship much sooner, but better to be safe than sorry.\nWe are offering the print on demand copies of the Demon Hunters RPG: A Comedy of Terrors as a link from DriveThruRPG that allows you to purchase the PoD version of the book as close to our cost as we can provide. The print on demand printer adjusts their prices as they need to, so we are unable to provide an exact cost, but it will be less than if you were not a backer. Many backers would like a physical book before their deluxe edition is being traditionally printed, so we are providing this as an option. The PoD version of the book will be a hardcover book, and will not be the deluxe leather-like edition.\nJust to state it again, the Demon Hunters Gamemaster's Apprentice cards are available this way as well through DriveThruCards. \nSilent Jim\nWe are working with some of the best roleplaying game professionals in the industry to make this game incredible, and we need to pay them for their hard work. You're also paying for the print production and shipping costs to us for all the physical rewards. If you live in the State of Washington in the USA, your WA sales tax is included in your reward pledge.\nCam Banks, Writer, Lead Game Designer: Cam is an award-winning game designer & developer who left New Zealand in 1996 to marry his sweetheart and forge a new life in the USA.

He\u2019s also incredibly humble. Masterfully so.\nJimmy McMichael, Writer: Jimmy writes the Demon Hunters webcomic. It is the culmination of a 15-year scheme that has involved playing Herr Doktor in Demon Hunters: Dead Camper Lake, creating and running the Dead Gentlemen website for far longer than he had any interest in doing so, co-writing the original Demon Hunters RPG and accompanying Orientation Video for Margaret Weis Productions, and working on RPGs based on the shows Supernatural and Leverage. This Kickstarter is the final phase of his master plan. All of the pieces have fallen into place.

She's contributed plenty of work to Dead Gentlemen including the JourneyQuest logo, the Luster artwork on the Dorkness Rising cover as well as designed Dead Gentlemen's own company logo. \nNathan Rockwood, Writer, Game Designer: Believing firmly that 'story trumps rules' has led Nathan down many strange paths over the years--medieval reenacting, teaching both English and Game Design, teaching video games IN English class--and one of those paths crossed with the Dead Gentlemen's when he worked as an author and designer on the first Demon Hunters RPG in 2008. Nathan has written for many other games before and since, including the award-winning Serenity RPG, and has recently begun publishing independently, but he's looking forward to reactivating his Brotherhood Chapter... and may even get a real tattoo this time.\nEmilie Rommel Shimkus, Copyeditor: Emilie is an actor, singer, and writer from the Pacific Northwest.

We have learned a lot on previous Kickstarter campaigns with our sister-company Zombie Orpheus Entertainment, and we are using that experience to make this far more efficient and faster turnout than ever before.

So we finally decided to put the two together in an epic, feature-length adventure, the likes of which has never been seen on screen before. \nWe're confident The Christmas Dragon will become a holiday favorite you return to year after year - a sword and sorcery Christmas adventure for the whole family. (If Willow got together with Rise of the Guardians and had a child, this would be it.)\nAnd... we guarantee delivery in time for the 2014 holidays. It's the perfect gift for the fantasy fans in your life!\nMedieval Europe - Father Christmas is a fading memory, after Christmas hasn't come for several years.\nA young orphan girl, Ayden, receives a magic crystal from a dying elf, with a warning that the North has lost its magic, and that she alone can save Christmas. Ayden and her orphan friends begin a perilous journey, and must escape dragons, goblins, bandits, ogres and other fantasy creatures as they team up with Airk, the wayward son of Father Christmas, to return a stolen Christmas orb to the North. When Santa's magic cannot overpower the growing Snarl (an evil forest with tentacle branches), Ayden and Airk must deliver Christmas on a sleigh pulled by a young dragon, fulfilling Christmas wishes for children to restore Santa's magic and save Christmas.\nBAILEE JOHNSON - Ayden\nThough young, Bailee is a fantastic actress and has starred is several films, including 127 Hours, Christmas Oranges, 17 Miracles, and you may also recognize her from a brief appearance in Osombie.\nJAKE STORMOEN - Airk\nSince being cast in Mythica, the always charming Jake has worked non-stop and has starred in several upcoming films, including Cyborg X and Kiss the Devil in the Dark.\nMELANIE STONE - Saerwen\nAfter featuring in Survivor and Christmas for a Dollar, Melanie seized the opportunity to play Marek, the lead in Mythica.

She has featured in a bunch of films, including the upcoming Cyborg X.\nSo, as per our usual pattern, the film is already shot, and we are well underway with post-production. Sound, music and visual effects are all working frantically to reach our deadline so that Christmas Dragon can be released in time for the holidays THIS YEAR. But a shorter schedule means our post-production elves have to devote substantial time, and more time means more money...

We were 3x as successful as we\u2019d hoped. We learned a ton about handling the high demand, fulfilling orders, and working with shipping and international suppliers and backers. We\u2019ve always made it our mission to not be \u201cjust another cosmetics company.\u201d For us, that means we always want to give you, our fabulous backers, a fun, satisfying, more-than-basic retail interaction. \nIt\u2019s been a huge year for us, and we are prepared and pumped to handle anything.\n\nHIGH-QUALITY, PROVEN PRODUCT\nWe knew we had a great product before, and now a lot of other people know it too. Easy to use, easy to maintain, and easy to remove. (And stylish as all hell, no matter your nerd parlance.) Even better, we have now a year\u2019s worth of our own working knowledge of the product and immeasurably valuable customer feedback. We know these nail wraps like the tips of our hands. We know why they fell off in the shower and how to repair a ding or a rip. We can tell you how to make them last longer.\n\nSTREAMLINED SURVEYS & ON-TIME DELIVERY\nYes, we love our community. But we also respect our customer experience, and we want you to get exactly what you want, when you expect to get it. We\u2019ve streamlined our reward levels and survey process, which makes it easier for you to make selections and much easier for us to quickly, accurately fill orders. On-time delivery is always a risk for Kickstarter projects, but we have a leg-up: We already know how to plan for and handle the demand this time around. And, as before, we\u2019ve built time into our delivery schedule for unexpected delays and we have plans to circumvent those issues before they happen. \n\nSHIPPING NOTES\n \u2022 Within the US, shipping is included in your chosen reward level. \n\u2022 Shipping to Canada and Mexico will cost an estimated $10 in addition to your reward level (final total calculated upon survey completion).\n\u2022 Anywhere else will cost an estimated $20 in addition to your reward level (final total calculated upon survey completion).\n\u2022 Shipping for Add-ons (domestic and international) calculated separately after the end of the campaign.\n\u2022 We can NOT ship to: China, Burma, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan, or Syria. Not our choice. It\u2019s a licensing thing.\n\u2022 International backers are fully responsible for any additional customs fees in your own country. (We looked hard into cheaper shipping options, but unfortunately, just because the wraps are small doesn't mean the price to ship them internationally is as well.)\n\nBACKERKIT = BETTER OPTIONS, BETTER SUPPORT, BETTER BACKER EXPERIENCE\nFor this campaign we\u2019re using BackerKit, a 3rd party Kickstarter fulfillment service. This option gives us better integrated survey options and a better ability to update backer info and addresses. Which means that people who missed the Kickstarter can still have the options to pre-order. We\u2019ll fill the backer packages first, of course, and then fill the pre-order packages before they are available in other retail locations. BackerKit also makes it easier for us to handle all our killer add-ons as they are unlocked. We also have access to good tech support before and during shipping\u2014we can catch and fix problems before you even know there was an issue.\n\nSUSTAINABLE, EXPANDING BUSINESS\nWe know, Kickstarter can be a gamble when you don\u2019t know who\u2019s on the other end. But put your fears to rest, friends, we ain\u2019t going nowhere but up. In less than 2 years, product demand\u2014especially the last NAILED IT! Kickstarter\u2014 has required Espionage to expand 3 times, from a living-room operation to 2800 sq ft office spaces. \n\nThe Last Kickstarter alone allowed us to pull 5 NEW FULL-TIME EMPLOYEES into the company. You guys! The creative team is getting paid! That\u2019s right, we all volunteered last time, and now YOU have let us make Makeup for Nerds a real, grown-up, bill-paying J-O-B. Full-time, dedicated employees mean we can expand the product lines more quickly, without loans or credit cards. \n\nAnd hey\u2014our backers know we\u2019re good for it. You know you\u2019re going to get a high quality product and you know we\u2019ll keep you apprised of the whole process.

And if you want to learn more about the creation of this project, check out our interview with A Sound Effect!\nSTRETCH GOALS ADDED!\n$7,000 - TREBUCHET!\n$5,300 - flanged mace  FUNDED!\n$5,600 - great helm FUNDED!\nAlright, now that we've gotten those boring firearms out of the way, it's time to get to the good stuff: medieval weapons!\nWhen we were making The Firearm Sound Library, two things were made apparent:\n1. Our backers were AWESOME!\n2. A lot of them wanted some older, medieval-type weapon recordings. \nHere is where we deliver!\nLet's talk about the project goal. We want to make a fairly comprehensive yet very affordable (AKA FREE) library that will have recordings of some common medieval-era weapons. That means bows, crossbows, knives, axes, spears, swords, slings, and all the implied impacts that anyone making a film or developing a game could use.\nAs with The Firearm Sound Library, quality and usability are the main goals. This means recording every sound effect at top settings, using top of the line equipment.\nBut affordability is also paramount, which is why (just like last time) we only have one reward set at $1, and after the library is complete it will become free to download! So donate what you can to the cause and help us create another library for the entire sound community to enjoy!\nNow, you all want to know how many sounds we will be recording and what they will be. Naturally, each specific sound listed will have multiple takes recorded to provide a wider range of diversity within each sound effect. Also, any interesting visual result (did the weapon penetrate the object or not, did an arrow break on impact, etc.) of the sound effects will be included to give you exactly the right knowledge you need. So the link below will take you to the list of sound effects that you will receive. We currently plan to record just under 500 unique sound effects...each with multiple takes. Take a look!\nSpreadsheet of Planned Sound Effects\nLet's briefly give a little more detail on some of the items being recorded:\nAvarian Recurve\nA light bow of classical east asian design, it is most suited to loose lighter arrows of around 500-600 grains at very high speeds. A very snappy sound is produced.\nEnglish Longbow\nOur bow has a draw weight of 90 pounds and will be loosing arrows weighing approximately 1000-1300 grains. We will be using arrows tipped with short bodkins, long bodkins, and broadheads.\nScythian Recurve\nAn unusual design, the scythian recurve has produced a very fluid, smooth sound when used. We will be using very light arrows of around 400 grains with this bow.\nCrossbow\nOur crossbow uses a steel prod and has a draw weight of 250 pounds. It is spanned by hand and fires extremely thick, short bolts that weigh about 800 grains. The sound of a steel prod crossbow being shot can only be described as \"wicked.\"\nSling\nWe will be using a simple sling made of leather and cord with pebbles for ammunition.\nSeax\nOur seax is of classic broken back design and has a blade length of about ten inches.\nDagger\nOur dagger is from Djibouti and has a long, slender blade.\nSingle Axe\nA small-headed axe with a single blade and a haft of about two feet.\nDouble Axe\nA longer handle of about three feet with a massive, dual-blade head.\nSpear\nWe will be using two thrusting spears, each of about eight feet in length. \nType X Sword\nA weapon with a Type X blade and cast bronze fittings.\nSabre\nA long-bladed cavalry sabre with a basket hilt.\nFor our armour we are using a fairly close approximation to what would be worn at the times each form of armour was in use. Also, it is important that the armour simulators used for impact recordings are set up as they may have been worn. That is to say, no soldier would ever wear just a piece of plate armour, he would have layers of other material underneath. The materials we are using are wool, linen, leather, mail, and steel plate.\nLeather\nHeavy leather such as horsehide. We will be boiling our leather in water as was often done. Underneath the leather will be a layer of wool cloth.\nMail\nMail could be worn over normal clothes or also over other forms of protection. We will be using riveted steel-linked mail over wool cloth.\nPlate\nThere are many ways to wear plate armour, but we are aiming for simulation of a medium-quality breastplate configuration, so we will have a sheet of steel approximately 2 mm in thickness over 10 layers of linen over wool cloth.\nShield\nWe will be using round wooden shields made of boards that are about a half inch thick, covered in glue and linen and with a metal boss. \nFlesh\nIt is illegal in our state to hack away at live people for recording purposes, so we'll be using some beef from the supermarket, or perhaps a pork shoulder. Also, we'll have wool covering flesh to simulate a clothed body.\nSound Tech\nSound Devices 744T\n192kHz Sample Rate\n24 Bit \nThe items and sounds should be reasonably self-explanatory, but if you're uncertain just what a sound effect is going to be, don't hesitate to ask. We are looking forward to this project getting funded, as we already know just how incredible our backer support can be. Thank you for checking out the project, and please help us make this happen!\nThings We've Learned from the Previous Library\nWith the Firearm Sound Library we jumped headfirst into a big project and did a lot of listening when it came to feedback from our backers. The importance of how we format sound effects became very apparent as a sound you can't find is a sound you can't use. This sound library will have metadata just like the last library, and we will use a short name for each sound file to describe the sound for people who don't have a program that can read Soundminer metadata or BWAV.\nA Different Way to Reward\nJust like with the Firearm Sound LIbrary, this will become completely free for download. As with the previous library, we are trying to \"liberate\" these sounds for those that would love professional quality recordings but can't afford professional quality prices. On that note, our library will have a CC0 license, so you can use, share, download, upload...all completely free, with no royalties or need to give us credit!\nWe are not currently lining up ideas for stretch goals, but if we reach our goal before the deadline, we'll certainly be able to add weapons. So, if you'd like to comment with a suggestion for a weapon we can't currently record but could as a stretch goal, please do so, and if we exceed our goal, we'll be recording the most-asked after weapons. Thanks so much for checking out The Medieval Weapons Sound Effects Library.\nCheers!\nBen, Brian, & Kevin", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRenting and insuring equipment is always a liability and challenge. Safe practice with weapons is absolutely paramount. Just because they seem primitive makes them no less dangerous. In some ways, these older design weapons are even more deadly if used carelessly than firearms are.

The production team, however, was overly zealous, and some...things...occurred.\nHappily, the statute of limitations has finally expired and we're ready to release the hilarious/appalling/potentially-criminal results to you! During the film's enforced convalescence, we have managed to put together most of the footage and all we need is a few finishing touches to make the ending really...explode off the screen...you might say.\n--------------------------------------\nStretch Goals!\nACHIEVED!!! $16,000 - Expanded Professional Sound Library. If we hit this goal we will be able to acquire an expanded sound library that has been used on actual professional reality television. The quality of our show will be enormously improved with this addition.\nACHIEVED!!! $17,000 - House Rulez Backer Patch! Everyone at the $50 level and higher will receive an exclusive House Rulez Backer Patch. If you have ever gotten a patch from a previous ZOE Kickstarter you know how cool these are. \n$18,000 - A Thank You Bonus to Sarah Sanders-Ode, our assistant editor (and she's in the show) for editing over 61 hours of footage into 4 hours, over the past several YEARS!\nYou can add the patch as an Add-On for $5 if you're pledging at a lower level. Just increase your pledge accordingly and make a note in the survey we send out.\nHouse Rulez is Dead Gentlemen's first foray into the world of reality television. DG hilariously exposes not only the quirks and foibles of the cast, but also uses hidden cameras to covertly spy on the show's production team--and their increasingly frantic attempts to create a watchable show!\nA four-hour reality television miniseries, House Rulez will be released on the Dead Gentlemen and Zombie Orpheus YouTube channels.\nWe are Dead Gentlemen Productions and our friends over at Zombie Orpheus Entertainment. We created House Rulez twelve years ago with an all volunteer cast and crew and almost have it finished! We are just asking for your help to complete the final sizzling touches! \nAbsolutely! Old favorites like:\nNathan Rice (Lodge from The Gamers movies, Roderick from JourneyQuest, Gabriel from the Demon Hunters series) \nMatt Vancil (finally on camera without facial prosthetics!)\nSteve Wolbrecht (Nodwick from Dorkness Rising, Chris from the Demon Hunters series)\nEd Gibbs (the Hierophant from Dorkness Rising)\nDon Early (Mort Agrippa from Dorkness Rising, Silent Jim from the Demon Hunters series)\nPhil Price (Nimble from The Gamers and a cameo peasant in Dorkness Rising!)\nBen Dobyns (while not acting in the show, House Rulez' director has produced and directed multiple installments in The Gamers, Demon Hunters, and JourneyQuest series)\nMANY more familiar faces!\nGamers: Dorkness Rising, Gamers: Hands of Fate, and JourneyQuest can be seen on YouTube. You can also watch JourneyQuest on Hulu. Our movies are also available for sale at www.watchthegamers.com, www.paizo.com, www.drivethrurpg.com, and www.amazon.com\nThe project was the brainchild of Dead Gentlemen Productions' own DG Improv: all of the original members of DG Improv are involved in this wholly unscripted adventure.\nAlso involved, top improvisers from Puget Sound area troupes such as Fool's Play and Seattle GOGA.\nStory editor Sarah Sanders-Ode not only appears in House Rulez, but cataloged every dramatic moment and spent several years finding and editing the ideal shape and form to tell this epic story. This project would not exist without her passion and dedication.\nFor post-production, Alex Perrault brings the benefit of 20 years of expertise as an Emmy-nominated editor who worked in film, broadcast, DRTV, and web. His long experience in documentary and reality film making, and past with networks like PBS, Discovery, A&E, TLC, and National Geographic, allow him to bring a very modern sensibility to all his projects.\nGraphics, sound, and sweetening will be by Jaya Productions. They started in 2001, working on DRTV campaigns, and eventually grew into the Reality TV space, working on many hit shows that aired on networks like A&E and History. In recent years they've grown into web and corporate video with work for Amazon, Real Networks, US Dept of Energy, King County, Microsoft, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. They specialize in creative storytelling through effective editing and motion graphics.\nAnd finally, Zombie Orpheus Entertainment is on board to help shepherd House Rulez across the finish line. They will bring their Kickstarter and distribution expertise to the task of manufacturing and delivering rewards and putting the show in front of your eyeballs.\nThis will be a FAST turnaround: you'll get to see the fruits of your generosity within a few months of the Kickstarter's completion. This isn't a campaign where your help will enable us to MAKE the project, this is all about FINISHING it. We already have a team of talented and experienced reality television editors hard at work--they are fine-tuning the rough cut and preparing it for release. We will release House Rulez for FREE online under Creative Commons Non-commercial license so that the whole world can see the conflagration of emotion and hilarity\u2014as well as being able to play with the released version all you like.\nCan't afford to pledge? That\u2019s okay! You can help us just by letting anyone who might like our show know that we\u2019re out here. Tweet us, share us, like us on Facebook\u2014any extra exposure we get helps people who can contribute find our project.\nYes. And no. An opportunity to bring the project to the masses presented itself briefly in 2009, but...things...scuttled the attempt. This time, though, we have no fear of a repeat: our legal ducks are all in a row plus a full cut of House Rulez is already complete\u2014only the finishing touches are needed before it can be released in all its catastrophic glory. And that's where you come in.\nYou can find us and ask us questions at the sites listed below. Additionally, you can ask us a question with the \u201cAsk A Question\u201d button at the bottom of the FAQ; we\u2019ll be sure to get you an answer!\nSome things we could accomplish with further support would be a 12-years later \"Where Are They Now\" mini-documentary, better color correction, sharper audio mix with additional sound effects and foley, the ability to release outtakes and extra footage (there's A LOT!), and a full-length commentary. We'll share more details after we meet our primary goal.\nHoly Crap! Thank you all who just responded here to that ZOE email that just went out! Amazing. Okay for our next trick!\n$16,000 - Expanded Professional Sound Library - ACHIEVED!\n$17,000 - House Rulez Backer Patch\nEveryone at the $50 level and higher will receive an exclusive House Rulez Backer Patch.

So keep being awesome and spread the word.\nWELCOME! \nTo the Royal Kingdom of Serenadia, where singing is power. With the right song, you can bring peace to the downtrodden, bake a delicious birthday cake... even KILL! \nHence, the Golden King has decreed all Blackhearts must bear the Muzzle: a magic tattoo that punishes those who try to sing.\nSee, the Kingdom was once ravaged by years of bloody musical warfare waged between the Golden King and the Black Matron. Now, twenty years after the King's dulcet baritone restored peace to the land, the Matron\u2019s teen daughter Malfalia is determined to shed her Muzzle and sing. So Malf sneaks off to meet her idol, Princess Ambrosia... only for Ambrosia to cruelly trick her into triggering her Muzzle and, quite satisfied, leave her screaming on the cold Kingdom asphalt.\n\nBut Malfalia - even writhing, heartbroken and humiliated - is still her mother's daughter. She sings through the pain, shatters her Muzzle and vows revenge: to masquerade as a princess, infiltrate and destroy royal society... then free her fellow Blackhearts from the tyranny of the Muzzles!\n\nA NEW KIND OF MUSICAL!\nWhat makes Muzzled extra-special? We want to put YOU in it! Yeah, once the show is funded, we'll have ample opportunities to put you in the cast recording, singing along with these awesome actors!\n\nCHARACTER INFO.\nAshly Burch\nMalfalia (Ashly Burch) is the daughter of the most terrifying Blackheart in the kingdom... but she secretly wants to be a princess. Not to mention her habit of sneaking song verses when her mother\u2019s away.

She also lends her voice talents to awesome stuff like Bee and Puppy Cat, Adventure Time, and Borderlands 2!\nAshley Clements\nPrincess Ambrosia (Ashley Clements) is the Golden King\u2019s daughter and Malfalia\u2019s childhood hero.

With over one hundred acting credits, he has played iconic roles such as Hercules in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys; Captain Dylan Hunt in Andromeda; and Kull in Kull the Conqueror.\nJuliet Landau\nThe Black Matron, legendary Blackheart and single working mother, is the stuff of living nightmares.

But has she truly settled into a life of servitude... or is the Matron playing the long game?\nJuliet Landau is an amazing actor of screen and stage, and has lent her voice to numerous television shows and video games. She's a cult icon for her fantastic performance as Drusilla in Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel.\nJeff Lewis\nCaptain Hook (Jeff Lewis), newly-registered Blackheart (thanks to a misunderstanding with a gaggle of flying children), is currently trying to survive his budding romance with The Black Matron.\nJeff Lewis (Captain Hook) is an actor and screenwriter best known as Herman \"Vork\" Holden on the ultra-hit webseries The Guild, for which he has won numerous awards.

LeVar Burton here. You may know me as Kunta Kinte, from ROOTS, or Geordi La Forge, from Star Trek: The Next Generation. \nYou also may have grown up with me on Reading Rainbow. \nIt was my mother who taught me that, by picking up a book, I could \"go anywhere\" and \"be anything.\" Ever since Reading Rainbow began in 1983, I have dedicated myself to fostering a love of reading in children, just as my mother did for me. \nOver the past year, I have watched Kickstarter bring communities together to support artists and inventors. Again and again, I have been inspired by watching like-minded people team up to accomplish impossible dreams, and to change the world. \nNow, I am hoping you will join me on my mission: to bring Reading Rainbow back for every child, everywhere.\nTogether, we can change the lives of millions of children. But you don't have to take my word for it: just keep reading!\nI believe that every child has a right, and a need, to be literate. We have a responsibility to prepare our children\u2026 and right now, the numbers show that we, as a society, are failing in that responsibility.\nAnd here\u2019s the problem:\nAnd: numerous studies reveal that children who can't read at grade level by the 4th grade are 400% more likely to drop out of high school.\nAnd: as of 2011, America was the only free-market country where the current generation was less well educated than the one before.\nThese problems won't solve themselves.  Real change will require us all to work together. We cannot afford to lose generations of children to illiteracy. And if we work together, we don't have to.\nThrough Reading Rainbow, we've been working to solve these problems for over three decades. Starting in 1983, Reading Rainbow successfully used television to turn generations of kids into lifelong readers... with great results.\nOf course, when Reading Rainbow began in 1983, we were using television to bring books to kids, meeting them where they wanted to be. In 2014, TV is not that place anymore. Now, we\u2019re trying to reach a new generation of digital natives.\nThat\u2019s why, two years ago, I launched the Reading Rainbow App for tablets. Building on the basics of the television series, we put hundreds of quality books \u2013 and educational video field trips \u2013 right in a child\u2019s hands.\nThe response has been encouraging:\nBut despite this progress, there are big challenges left to face.\nFirst, not all families have access to tablets. Our goal is to cultivate a love of reading in all children, not just those that have tablets. To reach kids everywhere, we need to be everywhere: we need to be on the web, on mobile devices, on game consoles and on connected televisions. \nSecond, a resounding number of teachers have told me that they want Reading Rainbow in their classrooms, where they know it can make a difference. We will provide it, along with the tools that teachers need, including teacher guides, leveling, and dashboards. And with your help, we'll provide it to thousands of disadvantaged classrooms for FREE.\nEvery Home. Reading Rainbow\u2019s digital collection already contains hundreds of books and video field trips\u2026 but with your help, we\u2019ll be able to make the Reading Rainbow library available on more of the devices modern kids use to consume content. Now that we've met our initial goal of $1,000,000, we will be able to launch a new version of Reading Rainbow on the single most-used digital platform: the web.

That would be a monumental milestone for Arrowstorm Entertainment. If we can reach that number, we will commission a custom Mythica song to play during the end credits, and give backers an exclusive early release of said song.\nWe want to hit $80,000!\nWe shot a ton of behind-the-scenes footage, as we have on many of our projects... But we never have the time and money to cut that footage into something enjoyable to watch. Well, now's our chance. If we can hit $80,000, we will take $5,000 of that money, and hire an editor to wade through our footage, shoot some interviews, and make a compelling BTS doc to go on the DVD, Bluray, or digital download.\nDeal?\nMythica is the most ambitious indie fantasy project ever undertaken. We shot three feature films, back-to-back, from October 2013 to March 2014, with several more films in the Mythica series planned.\nBut before we get there, we need to finish the first film, Mythica: A Quest for Heroes...\nHere's a quick word from the creators of Mythica:\nThe Mythica series follows the adventures of Marek, a wizard born with the dark power of necromancy, as she learns to harness the power that threatens to corrupt her, and build a team of adventurers to battle Szorlok, the legendary Necromancer, in his quest to unite the four shards of the Darkspore and unleash an undead plague on the land.\nA Quest for Heroes \nStuck in a life of indentured servitude, Marek dreams of becoming a wizard. When she meets a beautiful priestess, Teela, in need of help, Marek escapes her master and puts together a team of adventurers - including Thane the warrior and Dagen the half-elf thief \u2013 and embarks on an epic quest to free Teela\u2019s sister from orcs and ogres. \nAfter raiding the orc camp, the group learns that Teela\u2019s sister has been taken into the mountains by a giant ogre. Escaping hellhounds and dragons on their dangerous journey, the team find themselves hopelessly outmatched by the man-eating ogre, and must unite all their talents to free the prisoners and escape with their own lives.\nMelanie Stone plays Marek, a natural-born necromancer with a club foot. She's an amazing new actress, Mythica marking her first starring role, having played supporting roles in Christmas for a Dollar and Survivor.\nKevin Sorbo makes his long-awaited return to the fantasy genre as Gojun Pye, legendary wizard and mentor to Marek. Kevin is best known for his starring roles in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Kull the Conqueror and Andromeda.\nAdam Johnson plays Thane, a grizzled warrior and veteran of many wars. Adam can be seen in a myriad of projects, including the Veronica Mars movie, Dexter, Vamp U, Orc Wars and the upcoming release, Dragon Warriors.\nJake Stormoen stars as Dagen, a half-elf rogue. Like Melanie, Jake is a relative newcomer to the screen, but has spent years of his life immersed in fantasy role-playing games... so that counts, right? (Also, you can watch him in the Kickstarter short, Kiss the Devil in the Dark, starring opposite Doug Jones).\nNicola Posener plays Teela, a priestess of the Order of Ana-Sett. Arrowstorm fans will recognize her from her starring role in Dawn of the Dragonslayer, while she has also starred in several British films and TV series, including Disney's House of Anubis.\nMatthew Mercer is Szorlok, darkest necromancer of them all. If you've played a video game or watched anything animated, then you're very familiar with Matt's work - his voice credits include Tony Stark in the animated Iron Man and Avengers films, Call of Duty, Fullmetal Alchemist, Akira, etc, etc. Turns out he's just as great in front of a camera as a microphone.\nRobert Jayne shines as Peregus Malister, regional head of the Thieves Guild. A veteran actor since childhood, Robert has starred in shows as diverse as Tremors and Diff'rent Strokes.\nThe film is already shot, and we just finished up an edit. And holy crap, we have a TON of visual effects shots to pull off - way more than we were initially planning on. But we want the movie to be as good as it can be, so we want to leave them all in. Which brings us to you... we need your support to grow our VFX budget and allow us to actually get this done.\nBackers pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $75,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $75,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of this film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an early sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nAs the campaign progresses, we'll add some more fun rewards - unique props, etc as additional incentives.\nHere are some links to MYTHICA articles, BTS videos and interviews in the news:\nNBC NEWS STORY\nMOVIE PILOT INTERVIEW\nBLIP.TV INTERVIEW\nDUNGEON CRAWLER RADIO - MAREK INTERVIEW\nDUNGEON CRAWLER RADIO - DAGEN INTERVIEW\nJOYSTIQ.COM - DAGEN INTERVIEW\nFILMQUEST.TV - KEVIN SORBO INTERVIEW\nEFFIGY MAGAZINE INTERVIEW - NICOLA POSENER\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade.

Check out Season One, which just went online, and help us make Season Two of our weird transistorpunk webseries.\nFor Season One, each \u201cyear\u201d from 1972 to 1977 is an independent short arc or standalone film that tells small parts of the larger mystery. We were able to do a lot of worldbuilding with the early episodes, but we didn\u2019t get into really telling the main story until the 3-part 1977 season finale. We kept the shorts a bit disconnected because budget and related scheduling limitations kept us from shooting a single long arc all at once.\nCheck out our Season One teaser trailer on YouTube:\nSeason 2 picks up in 1978, and it has been a rough decade for our heroes. Paranoia and government oppression grip the city as the children of prominent researchers go missing. The strange electrical anomaly that has long been a boon to industry is acting increasingly erratic, and our heroes are forced to choose between their loved ones and the fate of the continent as the 1980s loom. \nSeries poster by comic artist Dan Dougherty.\nThis Kickstarter is specifically going to cover production costs for season 2 and allow us to make the season as a unified story.  $8,000 isn't a whole lot for a project of this scope, but we have a lot of great people on board who want to see the story through to its epic conclusion.  This goal is the minimum we need to get everyone in the same place, keep everyone fed, and ensure that our practical effects and production design are appropriately ridiculous.\nEven if you can't help financially, please check us out on Facebook and Twitter at the links below:\nhttp://facebook.com/transistorpunk\nhttp://twitter.com/killvamplincoln\nThe first season can be watched in its entriety on our Youtube or Blip.tv pages!\nhttp://youtube.com/transistorpunk or http://blip.tv/1970s\nOK, GET TO THE ROBOTS AND RAYGUNS:\nOne of the things that set us apart from other series, and other low budget sci-fi in general, is our production design. We focus on puppetry, practical effects, and using vfx software to make practical effects look awesome. We're also totally in love with the 70s technology aesthetic - everything was so big and clunky during the transition from vacuum tubes to transistors (we like to self-define our genre as \"transistorpunk\").\nSpring Heeled Jack valiantly gets bopped by the robot\nOnce Upon a Time in the 1970s has been a labor of love for years, funded out of pocket by taking on extra for-hire video work to pay for production costs. We've shown episodes of the series at comic conventions and film festivals across the country and are proud to finally bring it online. We just wrapped our weird, looping, season one story, and we have big plans for when we go back into production! We truly feel like we're bringing something unique to the science fiction genre and would love your support.\nREWARDS:\nMany of our campaign rewards are based around our distinct production design. Our Blu-ray rewards come packaged in handmade repurposed 5 1/4 inch floppy disc cases. We also have vacuum tube spiders, rayguns, and more! \nBlu-ray in floppy disk case! Possibly the most anachronistic Kickstarter reward ever! ($35 pledge)\nAs for standard rewards, we have great retro pimpbot t-shirts designed by Matt Wiley and retro history postcards.\nShirts come in tan ringers and 70s yellow. Men's and Women's styles available! Check out the pitch video to see them in action! ($35 pledge)\nAll tiers above $10 include a DRM-free HD download of the entire series, ad free, and cut together with all credits at the end to not break up the viewing experience.\nVacuum tube spider bot is ready to terrorize your desk and/or cat!\nOne last thing we are crazy excited to announce is that we are doing an extremely limited edition print of a 2-6 player strategy/battle board game that we have been designing over the last year. We\u2019re not sure we\u2019ll ever do a wide release of this game due to production craziness, but we\u2019re incredibly excited to offer a small number of them.\nOnce Upon a Time in the 1970s - The Home Game! ($150 pledge)\nThe game features 13 figures, over 200 cards in 6 unique decks, 2 boards, and more!\n6 custom character decks make for unlimited replay value and variation!\nWe love the idea of pitching \"a complete night of entertainment\" as a movie/game night tie-in!\nUPPER TIER REWARDS:\nCrazy production design has always been the cornerstone of our story, and while we enjoy having a raygun-filled display case in our living room, we\u2019d love to part with these hand-crafted screen-used props to help cover the costs of the shoot.\nAt the $500 level, we are offering one of our hand-made rayguns used on screen in the series. \nChoose your favorite or we'll build a custom one for the new episodes!\nFinally, we're offering one of our robot puppets for your personal collection or future film/theater project. These robots are like children to us. To fund season 2, we will sell you our favorite child.\nHere we are at a comic convention with the robot! He did not do autographs.\nProducer Credit and Creative Input\nWe are also excited to offer producer credit for this season. Beyond being listed on IMDB and in the press as producer/executive producer for the series, if you support us at a producer level, we really are interested in your input and want to hear your opinions about the direction the show or its marketing/promotion.  If a producer is interested, we'll set up monthly Google Chat sessions and keep you copied on emails about all aspects of preproduction, production, marketing, and distribution.\nEXCEEDING THE GOAL:\nEvery penny beyond our $8,000 base goal will go into producing additional episodes, preposterously large robots, and (most importantly) compensating the cast and crew that have awesomely volunteered their time on this project.\nWHO WE ARE:\nWe are Chris and Anne Lukeman and, together with a ton of amazing filmmakers, musicians, and actors, we released season one of our story.\nWe have released a number of supernatural comedy short films that have played at film festivals and comic conventions across the country. Between our various YouTube channels, we have over 400,000 views, and we are committed to playing with the boundaries of web video storytelling as the medium grows.\nThe first season of Once Upon a Time in the 1970s was a piece by piece experiment in storytelling and worldbuilding. From that, we want to take the story to its ridiculous and powerful conclusion.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks when making a film or webseries.

A few traditional games such as Monopoly, Uno, and Scrabble do exist in accessible formats. These usually cost 2 to 3 times normal retail price. Any blind players who want to play modern games have to have someone help them transcribe the games themselves.\nTransparent sleeves will allow blind players to use braille to play with sighted friends\nOur campaign so far will allow us start producing a new line of products that would add accessibility to existing board and card games with far less effort. These accessibility kits would be add-ons to games that would allow both blind and sighted players to play together. \nOur first kits are going to be transparent sleeves for many different card games. Our base funding goal allowed us just to make these sleeves and our stretch goals will let us expand this to many more complex games. Like traditional game add-ons these products still require that a copy of the game.\nWe realize that some games may not have enough room for all their text on a given card so for those games we will using QR codes or reference sheets to make certain that the blind players have all the information that they need to play the game.\nQR codes allow users to use their smart phones on cards with a lot of text that are infrequently used. Game specific reference sheets will let players reference more frequently used but repeated cards.\nNow that we have funded we are looking into ways to do additional products including dice and board overlays. If we can keep the momentum up we can make much more than just card games possible.\nWe are also going to be releasing a tactile microgame Yoink that will be something that anyone, blind or sighted, can enjoy.\nOur Tactile Microgame Yoink!\nWhat are the stretch goals?\nStretch Goal Diagram\n$10,000 - Unlocked\nMore choices at end of campaign\n\nLarge Games: Munchkin and Dominion\nSmall Games: Guillotine and Hanabi\n$12,000 - Unlocked\nFree Color Blind Print & Play accessibility stickers for Hanabi, Battle Line, Set, and Race for the Galaxy available to EVERYONE!\nThese will be made available to download from our website.\n$15,000 - Unlocked\nMore choices at end of campaign  \nLarge Game: 7 Wonders\nSmall Game: Lost Cities\n$17,000 - Unlocked\nAble to produce braille dice for RPGs, King of Tokyo, or Roll Through the Ages.

It is our hope that soon we can start addressing more disabilities such as Low Vision and Color Blindness.\nIn fact our recently announced stretch goal will provide free printable Color blind stickers for some specific games that have artwork that hasn't taken into account color blindness.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe equipment to produce braille products is highly specialized and expensive. Braille is mass produced using a device known as an embosser. It is a \"braille printer\" that creates raised dots by pressing into the paper. \nWe had been looking into companies that produce braille hoping to find one would produce quality braille to our exact specifications in a cost-effective manner and found no companies in a position to accomplish this. We believe that it is possible if we do it ourselves. \nWith the supplies such as the embosser, sleeves, the sticker paper, shipping materials, reward levels, Kickstarter fees and setup we estimate we will need at least $7500 to really get started making these sleeves available for sale on our website. \nIt is our hope that we will get a lot of support from both the blind and sighted communities in this campaign. Our product would only be useful for blind users so we have designed a small tactile microgame that will be fun for both sighted and blind backers.\nWhat are the rewards?\nWe will be happy to receive any sort of support. Everyone who supports this campaign will have access to our updates but if you are able to pay 10 or more dollars you will be entitled to the following rewards.\n[$10] Digital Rewards\nListed as a Supporter on our website so everyone can see that you helped make board games accessible to blind people\nDigital Wallpapers\nExclusive access to a digital download of In Touch with the Game, a documentary turning published games into an accessible braille title.

Players are not allowed to use their eyes so all players, blind or sighted are on an equal playing field.\n\nPlayers must feel the cards to determine when they have cards with all the same or different attributes. In the center of the table there are totems (we use dice) enough for all the players except one. When a player has a set that is all the same(or different) numbers, shapes and fills they will reach for the totems at the center of the table. \nOnce the first player has their set they declare 'Yoink!' and the remaining players scramble to get the remaining totems. Players who don't get a totem are eliminated and play continues.\nThis game was inspired by the good people at Set .. but it is a VERY different experience.\nDraft of Yoink!

We will not have large stock of games on the shelf ready to go. These will be sold on our online store that we will be adding to our website.\nWe will initially support a few titles and increase our catalog as we are able. We will initially plan to offer accessibility packs that are compatible with Love Letter, Tichu, Lost Cities, The Resistance, Coloretto, Phase 10, Uno, Guillotine, For Sale, San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, Skip-Bo, Bohnanza, St. Petersburg, Pairs, Eminent Domain, Pixel Lincoln, Council of Verona, Dominion and more. \nWhat we add to the catalog beyond that is going to be determined by our backers, publisher support, and demand. If there is a title that you feel should be adapted right away let both us and that publisher know. \nWe can make it happen without publisher support but it will happen a lot faster if they are on board.\nGames with boards may require transparent overlays that are more difficult to produce and we may not have the tools to do an adequate job but we have some further plans for that eventually. Additionally games whose key mechanics rely on sight in some way may need to be adjusted or modified.\nNot all of these games are offered as rewards but they will all be offered on our website when we get it up and running. The huge differences in the number of cards made it too difficult to price some of these games appropriately into the reward levels. \nWe may run into some games that just do not make sense to make accessible but I am confident that these games are the minority. \nWho are you?\nRichard and Emily\nRichard Gibbs is a teacher working in Special Education. He has worked side by side with his wife on numerous braille literacy programs and has extensive knowledge of braille himself. However, his real interest lies in the development and design of tabletop board games. He currently has many games in various stages of development and two games as finalists in the Hippodice game competition. \nEmily Gibbs is a graduate of Louisiana Tech University with her Masters in Teaching Blind students. She has her National Certification in Literary Braille and has lead braille programs across the country. Currently she is working as a Teacher of the Visually Impaired and coordinating the Texas BELL Program. \n64 Ounce Games is the brainchild and merging of their individual interests. They got tired of all their blind friends not being able to play games. Therefore the company's goal is to produce high quality, engaging, strategy games that are also accessible to blind and visually impaired gamers. \nVideos\nHow else can I help?\nIn order to help us make the widest variety of products we need to spread the word. We would really appreciate it if you shared this on Facebook, posted on Twitter and shared this on Google+. \nWe have also made these social avatars for Facebook, Google+, Linked-in or Twitter to help spread the word.\nBraille Sleeves\nYoink!

It's not too late to support us and try our Beta test! Please visit us at storium.com for more information.\n4/8/14: WE DID IT! With the help of our incredible backers, we have unlocked every stretch goal, funded a staggering 60 worlds, and reached 1000% of our original funding target. This has been an incredible campaign and we are deeply grateful for the support we've received.\n(Are you a backer looking for your Beta invite? Please see the first FAQ at the bottom of this page \u2014 the info you need is there!)\n\u201cStorium is everything I never knew I always wanted in a game.\u201d \u2014 Eve Jacob, playtester\nStories are part of what makes us human. They\u2019re all around us, from books and movies to TV and video games. Experiencing a good story can be one of life\u2019s great pleasures. But telling your own can be even more fun!\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve devoted the last year of our lives to creating Storium, the online storytelling game. We\u2019ve been playtesting an early version for months with hundreds of people. The feedback has been amazing, and we\u2019re ready to bring Storium to the public. We need your help to make it happen.\nStorium is a web-based online game that you play with friends. It works by turning writing into a multiplayer game. With just your computer, tablet, or smartphone, you can choose from a library of imaginary worlds to play in, or build your own. You create your story\u2019s characters and decide what happens to them. You can tell any kind of story with Storium. The only limit is your imagination.\nStorium uses familiar game concepts inspired by card games, role-playing games, video games, and more. In each Storium game, one player is the narrator, and everyone else takes on the role of a character in the story. The narrator creates dramatic challenges for the other players to overcome. In doing so, they move the story forward in a new direction. Everyone gets their turn at telling the story.\n\u201cStory and Game had a baby, and it\u2019s Storium. This is vital stuff, equal parts revolutionary and fundamental \u2014 giving the old ways of storytelling a major digital upgrade.\u201d\u2014 Chuck Wendig, novelist and screenwriter\nThe following three-minute video gives you a glimpse of our current beta playtest:\nWhat makes Storium special?\nTotal freedom: You decide what happens in your story.\nMultiplayer: Write and play with your friends, online.\nAsynchronous: Play at your own pace.\nWorlds: Pre-made playsets that help you tell stories in different settings and styles.\nSomething for everyone: You can tell any kind of story you want!\n\u201cStorium is one of the most fascinating systems I\u2019ve ever used to facilitate games, and it\u2019s helped me fall in love with storytelling all over again.\u201d\u2013 Lillian Cohen-Moore, playtester\nThis campaign funds the work that\u2019s needed to launch Storium to the general public. That means:\n1. Worlds for you to play in\nStorium needs a wider library of what we call worlds. Each world is a complete playset that gives you all the tools you need to play a game in a certain style or fictional setting. This includes virtual playing cards that drive gameplay, ideas for stories, pre-made characters, and backstory. We\u2019ve assembled an award-winning group of novelists, game designers, storytellers, and artists to create these worlds. Some worlds are wholly new, while others are adaptations of worlds you\u2019ll recognize.\n2. Important features\nThere are key features that Storium still needs. Your support will help us build them. This list is subject to change based on prioritization and technical feasibility, but here are a few of the examples we are considering:\nReal-time play: Chat and play live with your friends when they\u2019re online.\nShared narration: Give everyone in your game a chance to be the narrator.\nParallel storytelling: Play out two scenes at the same time with different characters.\nImproved support for tablets and smartphones: Play using interfaces created specifically for your mobile device.\n3. Technology and team\nOperating an online service like Storium can be a labor-intensive and expensive task. While it's easy to use and play, behind the scenes Storium is a complex piece of engineering. It requires dedicated, ongoing developer attention. We also have to pay for servers, storage, and a number of underlying services upon which the system relies. As Storium grows, these costs increase. \n\nWe\u2019ve been working full-time on Storium without pay for over a year now. That\u2019s how much this project means to us. We've set our target goal as low as possible, but anything we raise beyond that helps ensure that as Storium grows and evolves, we\u2019ll be able to keep up by investing in the technology and people we need.\n\n\u201cStorium revolutionizes storytelling not by new bells and whistles but by returning it to its most pure form in this most complex of ages \u2014 dynamic characters and people telling evocative and passionate stories.\u201d \u2014 John Adamus, playtester\n\n\n\nHere's a visual overview of the rewards we're offering!\nAnd here are more details about a few of the more popular rewards:\nBeta player\nEvery backer at the BETA PLAYER ($10) level gets instant access to our current beta test of Storium. You\u2019ll find an invitation URL in campaign update #1 (backers only). This URL enables you to immediately sign-up, start a game, and invite your friends to play with you.\n\nPlease bear in mind that this is an early test version of Storium. We expect it to change and grow quite a bit before the public launch. As a beta player, we welcome your feedback. There\u2019s a \u201cGive feedback\u201d button at the top of every page that goes to a built-in playtesters-only feedback system.\n\nMember\nWhen it launches to the public, Storium will have a modest annual membership fee of $25 per year \u2014 the equivalent of just $2 per month. Becoming a backer at the MEMBER ($20) level gets you your first year of Storium membership (starting on the date we launch publicly) for just $20.\n\nMembers will also be granted a special ability when Storium launches publicly: the use of our forthcoming World Creator tools to build their own Storium worlds and share them with the Storium community.\n\n(By the way, there will always be a free version of Storium \u2014 and it will be the full game, not a demo version. You\u2019ll be able to play up to three games, with full functionality, before you have to pay any membership fee!)\n\nWe want to grow Storium into a sustainable business, and we want to do it without plastering the game with advertisements. Our membership fee will help make that possible.\n\nThe Deal\nOur campaign starts by funding ten worlds, but we have dozens more in the works from a wide array of award-winning creators. Every backer at THE DEAL ($40) level will get a year of Storium membership, plus early and ongoing access to every world that we fund through this Kickstarter. This means you'll always be able to play games in these worlds, regardless of whatever they end up costing in the future.\n\n(When Storium launches publicly, many of our Kickstarter worlds will have a small fee for usage. Much like how Apple's App Store works, Storium world creators will have the option of charging app-like prices for their worlds. We will then pass on the majority of the proceeds to the world's creator! We hope this will become great new way for players and fans alike to support the authors and designers whose work they love.)\n\n\"I work nights and weekends and haven\u2019t been able to game with my friends in years. Storium is letting me play again, and the system they\u2019ve built is incredibly cool.\" \u2014 Brian White, playtester\n   Unlocks at $250,000\nCHAMPIONS UNIVERSE \u2014 Enter a world of amazing, super-powered adventure.

Wolf and his Wolf Pack, an elite unit of Rangers, uncover a long-forgotten peril of ancient evil reawakening in this epic fantasy.\nA new legend created by Ron Newcomb, a huge fantasy fan and award winning director, with the vision and skills to bring this bold and gritty tale into reality. Together, with your help, the team of creative minds, talented craftsmen, and actors can greenlight this epic fantasy, \u201cThe Rangers.\u201d\nThe Rangers is about a special force of elite warriors known as Rangers. What is a Ranger? Rangers are mysterious warriors who operate on the fringe of the kingdom of Olaran, using their unique set of wilderness skills to bring justice to the borderlands. Founded many years ago by King Alirion who saw the need to have a force of warriors loyal to the crown, outside of the highly political royal court and aristocratic knights of the military, as a first line of defense. A force that could be the eyes, ears, voice, and hand of the king in the wilds. They are the beacon lighters, they are the law and order to the distant boundaries of the realm, set on the frontiers to guard and watch the borders of the Kingdom. Our story follows the adventures of the unit of Rangers led by Lieutenant Brander Noke, also known as Wolf, for his ferocious, savage, and often unorthodox pursuit of elves during The Elf Wars, and their new rookie Soren Fell, a half elf, whose identity may hold the key to unlocking the enigma of the gathering darkness. Together, they must strive to help their world to overcome the greatest challenge of their time, while they face their own personal demons. Can the Rangers save their world?\nThe World of The Rangers\nThe Rangers is set in a world of high fantasy. It is a rich multi-layered and complex world, with it\u2019s own mythos and lexicon of heroes and races. When we began conceiving the world of The Rangers we started with a creation myth and a timeline for the history of the world, in the same vein as Tolkien\u2019s \"Lord of the Rings\". Drawing from our extensive role playing backgrounds and an almost Dungeons & Dragons style adventure world creation, we strove to produce a \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d level of intrigue in our realm, with surprises for the characters and viewers around every castle corner, and treacherous mountain pass.\nRanger Seal\nYou may have pictured Rangers like when Strider first appears puffing on his pipe at the Prancing Pony, or The Rangers of The North, maybe your vision of a Ranger was Robin Hood, or Drizzt Do\u2019urden, possibly The Night\u2019s Watch comes to mind, maybe even your favorite D&D character, The Rangers are all of that and more. They are even a bit Jedi (well at least, what I thought Jedi were as I grew up in the '80s - not as in with the force, but their awe and respect). We can't wait to get to filming The Rangers Summer of 2014 around the Northern Virginia (US) areas.\n~Loyalty~Honor~Courage~Forever~The Rangers\nThe Rangers at its core is a story of a team, a band of brothers. It takes a team effort to make a great fantasy project like The Rangers come to fruition; here are some of the major players on the project:\n BOARD OF ADVISERS\nBen Dobyns - Zombie Orpheous Entertainment \nKynan Griffin - Arrowstorm Entertainment\nJason Faller - Arrowstorm Entertainment\nRalph Singleton - IMDB\nSPONSOR\nMedieval Collectibles - get your gear!\nOTHER TEAMMATES\nWarPaint - comics anyone?\nMiddle-Earth Network - fans becoming creators.\nJoin your blade to ours and help us create the quality fantasy entertainment you long to see!

Ron and Scott\u2019s film \u201cRise of the Fellowship\u201d won Best Feature Film at GenCon in 2012 and got domestic and international distribution. Their critically acclaimed documentary, \u201cMade in the USA,\u201d is also in distribution. Skip Lipman was one of the major creative forces behind the documentary, Darkon The Movie.

Back the The Rangers and Kickstart this project!\nThe Rangers is currently in full scale pre-production, with all that entails. We are working hard towards hammering-out, honing, and finalizing our epic script. (our team of writers has turned out an awesome story for us to work with!)

The time is upon us, and we are asking for your support to take this project the next level!\nChris Richard Hanson\nThe funds we acquire through this Kickstarter will be carefully allocated. Our business plan will see the money carefully used for getting this film through production as well as post-production. With the highest possible production value we can squeeze out of every dollar invested.

Below is our original Kickstarter campaign, updated to reflect the latest.\nTHE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4) is a dystopian science fiction film set in the not-too-distant future. It is a low-fi sci-fi short, made in China, telling the story of a city on the brink of a water shortage through the eyes and interactions of four main characters: a woman, a man, a lover, and a water smuggler.\nHELLO, PEOPLE OF KICKSTARTER!\nMy name is Jason and for the longest time I wanted to make my own films, so I left my job and my home to fly from New York to a city I\u2019d never been to before, Beijing. I chose China for creative solitude because I\u2019m easily distracted and had heard the Internet would be blocked for me, perfect for writing. Next thing you know \u2026\nI\u2019M FINISHING A MOVIE CALLED THE SAND STORM \nBeijing felt like the future, not cool and sleek (that\u2019s Shanghai) but dim and gritty. \nThe story centers around human dramas within a city in turmoil.\nIt was the start of 2013, and all of China was about to shut down for the holidays. We had two weeks exactly to assemble our cast and crew or we would be forced into production limbo indefinitely. The weather fell below freezing and on a scale of 1-500 (smoggy days in Los Angeles register 60-90), pollution indexes hit a record 800. This was the climate in which we operated. \nWe shot under extreme circumstances, entirely in Chinese, independent all the way. No fundraising, just us. Eventually, we started crowd funding. Then we stopped. Then we started again.\nWHY KICKSTARTER? WHY NOW? WHY $33,000?\nOur plan has always been to release the finished film online, for free, to the world, but we need to pay for it.\nWe wanted roll-out of the movie to be as much of a revelation as possible so we agreed to delay crowdfunding until after we wrapped.  \nNOW WE NEED YOU because to finish the film, pay back everyone, and break even would require over 300% of our initial ask but, honestly, anything helps. Shutting down early would have stopped us cold in our tracks and left people unpaid. Restarting for less than a week means we have a unique opportunity to build a critical mass, together.\nWHAT IF WE EXCEED OUR KICKSTARTER GOAL?\nTHAT WOULD BE AMAZING!! If you fund this project beyond $33k, you\u2019ll help cover our remaining production expenses.\nNEW : Our first stretch goal was 1000 supporters, our second $88k, now it's how many people can come on board. Can we reach 2000?\nWe still have hard costs related to visual effects, sound design, music, mix, color correction, subtitles, festival submission fees, and \u2026 is your head spinning, too? Every contribution counts. Even now.\nWe went at it alone, building sets, renting equipment, hiring a local cast and crew \u2026 some payments were deferred, others covered by short-term loans.\nFINISHING THE SAND STORM\nThere won\u2019t be any WARS OVER WATER for at least a decade but this film can be ready in a matter of weeks.\nSo many wonderful people have helped make the impossible possible. Incredibly talented industry professionals (not just in Beijing, but in London, Shanghai, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York, with credits ranging from \u201cThe Hobbit\u201d to \u201cLost in Translation\u201d) are donating their time and resources, scrambling to finish so we can project on the big screen at a film festival \u2026 and reach the world online.\nWE RECORDED AN ORIGINAL SCORE with a 28-piece string orchestra at London\u2019s landmark Abbey Road, a studio kept historically and acoustically identical to when the Beatles last used it. One performer (pictured) is playing the viola from \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d (sitting somewhere in the middle). We\u2019ll be sharing more details in a future update.\nNEW : As an additional thank you, all supporters of THE SAND STORM (all of you!) will receive a free digital download of the latest album by Philip Sheppard, our film\u2019s composer. He's collaborated in the past with James Lavelle, Jarvis Cocker, Jimmy Page, David Bowie (who\u2019s name may not begin with the letter J but who\u2019s real last name does: it\u2019s Jones), and conducted for the Olympic Games (Beijing and London). Hope you like it!\nALL THIS FOR A TEN MINUTE FILM?\nYes. \nYOUR CONTRIBUTION MEANS SO MUCH\nWe kept our production discreet and for over a year told no one what we were up to \u2026 then we teased without spoiler alerts, mainly with backstage photos and clips from the cutting room floor \u2026 expect to see more during our final five days.\nYour support has made it all worthwhile.\nThanks (in advance, even for reading this far), and at the risk of sounding like every other Kickstarter campaign, we\u2019re giving away special gifts connected with the project: SUPER ARTSY REWARDS \u2026 custom action figures (!!!) \u2026 access to behind-the-scenes footage \u2026 still frames \u2026 and other surprises. Hair.\nOUR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO ENTERTAIN\nEven today, water shortages, poor air quality, and information obstruction exist around the world. These complex issues provide the backdrop for an open-ended story, and our art house sci-fi short is the set-up for more to come (perhaps an eventual full-length feature film). But first, we need to finish the short.\nWhatever\u2019s next, it's going to be awesome, especially if we go at it together. We hope you will join in our adventure as we wrap and release THE SAND STORM.\n\u2013 \u2013 Thank you! \u2013 \u2013\nJason Wishnow and the entire \u6c99\u5c18\u66b4 Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHE GOOD NEWS is we\u2019ve already wrapped principle photography (unusual for a lot of movies on Kickstarter) meaning the hard part is over. But we\u2019re not done yet. It\u2019s no longer a question of WHETHER we finish the film, but WHEN we finish, and that part is up to you! (UPDATE: release and reward delivery dates may be pushed slightly. We will keep you informed.)\n\nSpeaking of risks and challenges\u2026\n\nI OWE AN APOLOGY. Our Kickstarter campaign is back after vanishing for a month and I must navigate the choppy waters of crafting a singular explanation for both an audience of one in China and many others elsewhere in the world.\n\nDEAR AI WEIWEI: Recently, I erred as if THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4) was an average project with average players, even though everything about it was extraordinary. I see how my actions could be perceived as disrespectful to your status as a world-class artist, supporter of the arts, and human rights defender. Your image and identity are precious, so I should have known better than to take at face value an early conversational nod on your part to make and market this movie as I saw fit. Promoting your involvement in the film while failing to fully include you in our Kickstarter preparations was careless. You demonstrated foresight and fortitude by stopping the fundraising campaign before it may have potentially wreaked damage to your public image, and for that I am humbled. Thank you for taking time, earlier this month when I visited, to speak with me about it and for all your previous encouragement with the film. Ai Weiwei, it has been an honor to work beside you and Du Ke Feng \u2013 I can imagine no greater artistic and cinematic Dream Team. My intent was to honor you, not exploit you. Despite missteps in fundraising strategy, I hope you might renew your faith in this project, but more than that, I hope you will find it in your heart to forgive me and to consider me your friend. I continue to admire you tremendously, as a person, as a creator, and as a crusader of art and justice. \u8c22\u8c22\u60a8\n\nTO EVERYONE ELSE: Your encouragement has meant the world to me. Thank you. \n\nWhen I finally started talking about THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4), after waiting until we nearly finished the art-house sci-fi short we'd been making in China, it was because I wondered how we might complete it with the same quality we brought to our initial shoot, done under unusual, perhaps extraordinary, circumstances \u2013 for which I already drained my savings and borrowed from close friends. \"If you can launch a Kickstarter campaign within ten days,\" a stranger overhearing my story at a party said to me, \"I'll pitch in your first $5000 because this sounds like a movie worth making.\"\n\nTwo thousand supporters signed up for the adventure. What started as a dare, fast-tracked to one of the most successful short film campaigns in Kickstarter history \u2013 we might almost break even, and we could at last share our project with the world.\n\nFrom inception, our plan was to release THE SAND STORM online, for free. Crowdfunding made that a real possibility. The majority of backers pledged $11 to watch THE SAND STORM one day in advance plus see their names in the credits, the digital equivalent of lining up for a blockbuster and getting a hug for it. The Guardian wrote: \"far from a Hollywood blockbuster, it is a short film funded by Kickstarter, so it's all very artistically pure.\" The highest compliment. \n\nThe flood of interest in a project we'd kept hidden for so long felt invigorating at first, but then, five days before our scheduled end, the historic campaign went on ice. Why? I alienated the friend and collaborator who inspired it all, and who, up until that point, had been hugely encouraging. Until this happened \u2013 FAST CO. EXIST (April 30).\n\nExcept when we meet in person, Ai Weiwei's studio mediates our correspondence, and I hastily sent advance-links via my usual, casual contacts, rather than his standard channels for such matters, without follow-up on my part, interpreting silence as approval. From our opposite sides of the Great Firewall, things that sometimes seem straightforward can be fraught. Creative endeavors with artistic titans should not be treated lightly. An easily avoidable mistake on my part led to an unpleasant surprise on his: discovering our fundraiser secondhand, through the invasiveness of Google alerts and press inquiries which eclipsed any fun we shared on set. Having waited for a finished film, he instead got chaos coupled with inaccuracies (the distinction of his acting debut belongs not here but to 1993's CCTV series \"A Beijinger in New York\"). How do you say \"I'm sorry\" to the Never Sorry Guy?\n\nThe day after the campaign-freeze, I hopped on a plane to China for a week, we met three times, and he requested I tone down emphasis on him for fundraising purposes.\n\nTo clarify \u2013 he is still in the film, same as ever. Our edit is \"locked\" but because there's more work to do, our release date is in limbo. We've given you our word we will finish THE SAND STORM. And we will. Soon. Movies are meant to be seen.\n\nWhen our campaign went viral to a degree I had only dreamed of for the finished film, I expected the discourse to naturally move away from the topic of celebrity on its own \u2026 but that is not how public conversation works. Nobody needs be singled out as an isolated star: the characters of THE WOMAN, THE MAN, THE LOVER, THE WATER SMUGGLER are equally deserving of recognition, as are each and every member of our expertly talented crew. Now, as we re-launch for five days, let me overtly hijack your focus to a topic far more meaningful, namely, the rise of super-cities and their potential for the decay of health and safety.\n\nThis movie isn't about making a movie star out of an artist \u2014 it\u2019s about making a movie star out of an idea.\n\nSci-fi, as a genre, allows us to speculate about possible future choices, but when the present moves faster than fiction, action is also needed. We shot this short drama with its backdrop of water rationing while on-set pollution levels skyrocketed above international standards for measurement and safety (on a scale of 1-500, smoggy days in Los Angeles registering 60-90, Beijing indexes hit a record 800). The script called for our day players to wear air filter masks to look \"dystopian,\" but the crew wore them as well; we had to. When we edit, I can hear myself coughing on the sound track. This problem is not only endemic to China but in super-cities rising all over the world.\n\nWe hope THE SAND STORM will encourage new conversations about environmental degradation, and how we can create a better future \u2026 but, mostly, entertain.\n\nUntil then, welcome to the *final* final five days of fundraising, another part of our journey \u2013 part of what you get as a supporter of THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4).\n\nJason\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #20", "update_userinfo": "SAND STORM Northern California Screening at The Mendocino Film Festival - This Weekend!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "ANATOMY OF A SHOT (Opening Titles): Creating the Sand Storm Cityscape", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "AFTER THE SAND STORM \u2013 #1", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 63, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/wishnow/a-secret-sci-fi-film-shot-in-china-starring-ai-wei", "project_name": "a secret sci-fi film shot in china \u2022 THE SAND STORM (\u6c99\u5c18\u66b4)"}}, {"backer": "Zombie Orpheus", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "We\u2019re all mages, we Awakened Ones. Tradition wizards and Technocrats, Mad Ones and Fallen Ones and all the \u201cones\u201d in between who refuse to choose a side in our demented little War. We\u2019re ALL mages. Many refuse that title, or deny it to others, but that\u2019s what we are: priest-kings holding the keys to reality.\nTwenty years ago, a game came along that changed gaming. It was big and epic and confusing as hell. It dared folks to think outside the box \u2013 to not simply throw fireballs but to really think about how and why we do the things we do. Mage challenged people to make a difference in their world. And now, more than ever, that challenge stands.\nAgainst the epic tapestry of an Ascension War, Mage: The Ascension, then and now, features architects of reality locked in a deadly fight to see whose future will prevail. \nBut within that sometimes cosmic scope, Mage asks an intimate question: If you had the power of a god, what would you do with it\u2026 and what would IT do with YOU?\nAbove all other things, Mage is about giving a damn. While other folks are hopeless or content enough to accept what they\u2019ve been given, mages change the picture. They disagree, often violently, about what that picture should look like, but apathy\u2019s not in their nature. The Awakening won\u2019t let them sit still and accept the world as it is.\nMages are power incarnate. What they Will, will be. That power can go to their heads, corrupt them, demolish everything they hold dear\u2026 but it\u2019s there. Mage\u2019s dominant theme, then, is hope. Things might get bad, even tragic, but the possibility of change\u2013 that one person can make a difference\u2013 never goes away. \nWhat\u2019s in it?\n\u2022 Updated profiles of the Council of Nine Traditions, the Technocratic Union, and the Disparate Crafts... with many unexpected developments. \n\u2022 An epic history of magick and its factions.  \n\n\u2022 A compilation and clarification of essential and optional rules, including martial arts, vehicles, hazards, cybernetics, the Otherworlds, and far more besides. \n\n\u2022 Overviews of paradigms, practices and tools - the focus of your Art. \n\u2022 Detailed explorations of the epic concepts involved in Mage. \n\u2022 Chilling looks at the Nephandi and Marauders. \n\u2022 The Nine Spheres, plus their Technocratic variants.\n\n\u2022 Old favorites and new faces from among the Awakened Ones. \n\n\u2022 Reality Zones, Paradox, Quiet, the \"coincidental vs. vulgar magick\" debate, and far, far more...  \n\u2022 New full color original art by Michael William Kaluta, Echo Chernik, Steve Prescott, Christopher Shy, Larry MacDougall, and other classic Mage artists, as well as classic B&W pieces carefully chosen from the earlier editions.\nThis Deluxe Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition Kickstarter is designed to enable us to create a deluxe hardcover edition that stands proudly on its own as an amazing volume, or on a shelf with the Vampire the Masquerade 20th Anniversary and Werewolf: The Apocalypse 20th Anniversary Editions. This Deluxe Mage 20th is planned as a black leatherette (with a different pattern than the previous two Deluxe 20th Editions) hardcover with an inset disk on the spine featuring the M20 round symbol, with 600+ full color, gold-edged, interior pages, and a purple silk ribbon bookmark. Embossed into the cover will be the original Mage \"Dante as the Magician\" tarot card as featured on all the previous editions.\nTo help you in choosing a Reward Tier to pledge for, here is a list of the Rewards for backing the two basic Reward Tier containing either just the M20 PDF or the physical Deluxe M20:\n$35 \"Acolyte\" pledge tier gets you: \n- A PDF copy of \"Mage: the Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition\" \n- Your name (or character, or whatever) listed in the book.\n- A computer background \"wallpaper\" graphic for M20\n- Access to purchase a KS-funder M20 shirt on the Redbubble store.\n- A PDF copy of the Mage Character Pack, which will include:\n- - Ascension Warriors.* (25,000+ words)\n- - Familiar Strangers.* (40,000 words)\n- - Gods & Monsters.* (50,000+ words)\n- A coupon for a reduced cost on the PoD copy of \"Mage Character Pack\" from DriveThruRPG.com*\n- A PDF copy of The Catastrophe Ballet: The Mage 20th Quickstart .

Every backer who pledged for a reward containing the M20 PDF or the classic Mage fiction PDFs will receive a PDF/ePub copy of this restored Mage classic.\nAt $520,000 of contributions, we will combine the previous three Book of Secrets projects into a single 180,000+ word book called M20 Book of Secrets that contains all the subjects we expected to cover in the individual BoS PDFs, plus additional material as well! Backers who have pledged to a Reward Tier containing a physical copy of the Deluxe M20 will receive this combined PDF instead of the previous three.\nAt $545,000 of contributions, every backer who pledged for a reward containing a physical copy of the Deluxe Mage 20th will receive a copy of the M20 Art Book PDF. This lavishly illustrated collection contains the very best art from previous editions of Mage: the Ascension, as well as beautiful new pieces from M20.\nAt $563,000 of contributions, every backer who will receive the 180,000+ word M20 Book of Secrets PDF will also receive a coupon for a discounted M20 Book of Secrets PoD in addition to each PDF. This discount will reduce the price of the physical Print on Demand book of M20 Book of Secrets to as close to \"at cost\" as we can make it, and the backer will have to pay the normal DTRPG shipping.\nAt $590,000 of contributions, every backer who pledged for a reward containing a Mage 20th PDF will receive a copy of the Mage 20th Anniversary Edition Cookbook PDF. This companion volume to the Werewolf 20th Anniversary Cookbook will contain delicious and appropriate recipes suitable for the table of any Tradition or Convention.\nAt $613,000 of contributions, every backer who will receive the 115,000+ word Gods, Monsters, and Other Familiar Strangers: An M20 Character Compendium PDF will also receive a coupon for a discounted Gods, Monsters, and Other Familiar Strangers: An M20 Character Compendium PoD in addition to each PDF. This discount will reduce the price of the physical Print on Demand book to as close to \"at cost\" as we can make it, and the backer will have to pay the normal DTRPG shipping.\nAt $633,000 of contributions, you will enable Onyx Path to give the creative team an additional +5% bonus to what they were going to be paid for their magickal contributions to Mage 20th- which means that our creators will be seeing a +20% pay bump total!\nFrom $633,001 to $684,755 of contributions, a percentage of the funds will go towards the creation of the Technocracy: Reloaded, a 21st-century Guide to the Technocracy, including Asian and African Technocracy divisions, Threat Null, arrays of new goodies, and potential options for infiltration, reorganizations, and other surprises. And then, see below.\nAt $684,756 of contributions, you will have made this Deluxe Mage20 Kickstarter the highest funded tabletop RPG KS. So in return, every backer who pledged for a reward containing the Mage 20th PDF will receive a copy of the Technocracy: Reloaded PDF. This book was simply too huge to be a regular Stretch Goal, and even this Stretch Goal won't fund the book entirely, so in thanks and congratulations to all of you who made this such a phenomenal experience, we're going to make it anyway.\nThis is our tenth KS, and so since we continue to learn from the experience: here are some tweaks to our goals, reward tiers, and prizes.\nEstimated Delivery Dates: \nMost importantly, the \"Estimated Delivery\" dates have been extended late through the year much further than we hope to be delivering. Experience has taught that it is better to extend far past our expectations.\nWe've Included PoDs:\nWe are including the Print on Demand version of Mage 20th in the form of a link to DriveThruRPG that enables you to purchase the PoD version (your choice of either Standard or Premium color) for as close to cost as we can give it to you. Because the PoD printer adjusts their pricing for PoDs as they need to, we can't provide a solid $$ amount of what you'll need to pay, but it will be less than a non-backer ordering one. This inclusion is because many backers want a physical version while their Deluxe versions are being traditionally printed.\nShipping Changes:  \nWe will be using different shipping fulfillment services than with our previous Kickstarter ship-outs. While we have not settled on the specific company we will be going with, all four fulfillment companies we have spoken to so far have multiple well-rated Kickstarter ship-outs under their belts, have other positive reviews online, and most importantly for many of our backers: they all provide emailed tracking numbers.\nShipping Charges:\nWe also have been forced by the multiple overt shipping charge increases that have occurred this last year to include that cost in the Reward Tier pledge amounts. We continue to have US and non-US reward tiers so that the specific shipping costs for physical rewards can be built into the pledges, as there was just too much confusion when we tried to leave it to folks to manually add shipping. We do not, however, try to add in or calculate each country's VAT. That amount, if any, will be an extra charge between you and your customs officials.\nRetailer Tiers:\nWe are continuing to include two Retailer Reward Tiers, one US and one non-US, because we want to be able to support all the great Retailers out there who have supported WW for these past several decades. We have a special reward price just for Retailers (someone who owns a store that would sell Deluxe Mage 20th) and anyone thinking of pledging to those Retailer Reward Tiers needs to contact me: richt@theonyxpath.com to confirm that you are operating or representing a store before pledging, please. Any pledges to those Retailer Reward Tiers which do not have confirmations of status will not be honored when sending out Rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This book isn't created at all even though the goal is reached. \nSolution: We have fulfilled five Kickstarters worth of Rewards, one more Deluxe book is at the printer and another is being prepped for press, as you read this. All those books have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, sometimes painfully, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The creators of the Deluxe Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition have over a century of combined experience in the writing, art direction, developing and layout of beautiful tabletop RPG books. The text for the book is written, it going into the development pass where not only Satyros Phil Brucato but Bill Bridges, also a vastly experienced exMage developer, will be tightening and tweaking the raw text. We are awaiting three pieces of art from Echo Chernik, and the finished full-page color pieces from Michael Wm Kaluta. All the other illustrations are in our hands.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the Deluxe Mage 20th. \nSolution: Shipping costs have skyrocketed this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with multiple shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to raise the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to the actual creation of these Deluxe editions.\n\nRisk: The books will take a long time to produce and anger the backers. \nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our Demon: The Descent KS several months before the estimate, and are ahead of the game for the physical book as well. That being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress twice a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #133", "update_userinfo": "May M20 Update!", "update_content": "Hello M20 Backers!\nRichT here:\n\nHope you are all doing well and staying safe!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #132", "update_userinfo": "April M20 Update!", "update_content": "Hello M20 Backers!\nRichT here:\nHope you are all doing well and staying safe!\n\nJust a note, the crowd-funding for M20 Victorian Era has ended, but we have its BackerKit site up, and we'll be continuing counting pledges for at least 30 more days and continuing with Stretch Goals during that time!

The show is getting made! But it's not over yet! Take part in the epic battle of good vs. evil and get a taste of the RPG life by backing the project and participating in the TOMB OF THE FORBIDDEN STRETCH GOALS. A campaign within a campaign! \nEach day there's a new goal to reach. Which goal you choose determines the story - will you choose to follow the path of the light and defeat Cthulhu, or will you choose the path of chaos and help awaken him? The choice is yours! Read all about it in Update #10 here! And watch the updates page for new goals each day!!\n\nRead below for what we're trying to achieve with these stretch goals!\nNow that we're over $8,000, we have several stretch rewards - things to shoot for. Extra goodies, improved production value, and an overall sense of vast accomplishment for you to bask in!\n$10,000 - We make another music video parody like Just Give Me a d6, focusing on another game system OF YOUR CHOOSING. We'll poll the lot of ya after the campaign and write a song based on the most popular system of choice!\n$15,000 - This will help us afford to travel to conventions like Gen Con, Nerdtacular, Strategicon, Kubla Con, BoardGameGeek Con, and many more. Where we can host character creation panels, run games and most importantly meet YOU! Donors at the $20 level and up will receive a custom d20 with a Saving Throw design as an additional reward.\n$25,000 - At this level we can have a professional web-design company restructure the site the way we ultimately envision it. This will be a hub of information and will be an easy to use and navigate marvel of technology (until some Shadowrun hacker archetype breaks in). ALL backers, from the $1 level and up will be given access to a backer's only private forum on the new site with behind the scenes info and cast/crew chats.\n$50,000 - We'll throw in additional episodes throughout the season covering old school games like Paranoia, AD&D 2e, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness, and more! PLUS, everyone who donates at the $35 level or above gets the item (either the t-shirt or the tote) that they didn't order before, for FREE! If you placed an order for two, you'll get your choice of a 3rd item, again FOR FREE.\n$100,000 - We make a web-series based on our characters in the Pathfinder campaign. It'll be like Lord of the Rings (but halflings instead of Hobbits, of course)! Donors of $100 or more will get the opportunity to name characters, visit the set, and even a walk-on role (for donors at $1,000 or more). All donors at the $20 level and up will get a free digital download of this event!\nSaving Throw is an instructional web-series and website, designed to teach you not only how to play, but why. We love pen & paper role-playing games and want to share that passion with you, your friends, and the world. \nWith over 40 years of history, RPGs can be an intimidating prospect for some geeks. And with new systems emerging each year knowing the choices and rules becomes daunting. That's where Saving Throw comes in!\nSaving Throw will teach you what you need to get started in a friendly and engaging manner where YOU are in control. Episodes will be bite-sized and shareable because we know you've got that life-thing that keeps getting in the way!\nWe're like a mixture of Wil Wheaton's TableTop and Mythbusters, with a healthy dab of Top Gear thrown in for good measure. We're a flexible resource you can utilize to help you learn or teach your favorite RPGs.\nWhat will the first series cover/be about?\nSaving Throw will be a dynamic series that takes you out of the living room of most RPG instructional shows and takes you on location and into the studio. We'll help guide you through character creation and gameplay, showing you what you need to play and what makes RPGs so fun! \nIn the first series we'll be covering Paizo's immensely popular Pathfinder RPG system. Pathfinder is a fantasy-based tabletop game based off the 3.5 edition of D&D. Affectionately referred to as 3.75, it's got all the fantasy staples - wizards, dwarves, elves, magic, barbarians, evil kings, dragons and more. Much more. So much you might say you'd need a web-series to help explain it all!\n\nIn future series we'll cover other gaming systems, from old school to new. Our website also has articles about many other game systems. We've got you covered no matter what you're interested in playing.\nIvan leads the session... 2nd ed. for funzies.\nThrough in-depth instructional videos we'll take you step-by-step through the process of creating a character. From rolling ability scores to choosing weapons and spells we'll break down the why's and how's in fun and entertaining ways. With your help we can visit and film at places like Sword Play where people train how to fight like Jedi for a Star Wars: Age of Rebellion-themed episode. Or a blacksmith like the Sword and Stone to discuss skills and proficiencies in a D&D inspired series. Those are just a couple examples of how we'll take you out of the living room and into your imagination. \nWith your help we can make it happen.\nWe're players, just like you! We've got around 50 years of collective RPG experience between us. We love learning new games as well as teaching old ones. Some of us are recent RPG enthusiasts, while others have been playing since childhood. \nHosts:\nIvan Van Norman - co-host, co-writer, GM. A runner-up in the first season of King of the Nerds, Ivan is a formidable presence at the gaming table. He co-designed Outbreak: Undead, the zombie survival RPG, and continues to work on groundbreaking games.\n\nAmy Vorpahl - co-host, co-writer.

She was a member of the prestigious Sunday Company at The Groundlings and is a frequent guest star on The Dungeon Bastard and CritJuice web-series\u2019.\nBen Dunn - co-host, co-producer. Ben is one of the stars and a co-producer on The Nerdist Channel's NerdTerns web-series and is a frequent co-host on GeekScape, 1337Lounge, the Super Nerd Trivia Game Show and more.\nPlayin' some Pathfinder here...\nProduction Team:\nDom Zook - is an award-winning producer of short films such as Snow Day, Bloody Snow Day, Coaching Me Softly (starring Dian Bachar and Steve Zaragoza), and Y Tu Nana Tambien among many more. He's been playing RPGs off and on since 1986.\nTyler Rhoades - Head Writer, Technical Consultant, co-producer. Tyler has been playing D&D since the early 80's having been born into a gaming family.

A student of many RPGs, he lives and rolls in LA with his wife and child.\n\nTogether, we made this music video as an homage to the campaign we were running. With your generous donation, we can make more like this:\nIt's not surprising that a series like this will cost money. While we're dedicated to making this happen regardless of pay, we want to make sure the rest of the crew is adequately compensated, that we've got food on shoot days, and insurance to cover rentals. Your pledge will help us offset the costs to maintain and improve the website and ensure we can continue to bring you the best news, reviews, and information about all of your favorite RPGs.\nYour donation will go towards the following:\n$2,000 - Crew costs\n$2,000 - Post-production (effects, editing, music)\n$1,000 - Insurance\n$1,000 - Location & Gear rentals\n$750 - Travel costs for cons, on-location filming\n$500 - Craft services & meals on set\n$750 - Kickstarter fees/Shipping & Fulfillment costs\n$8,000 TOTAL\nReward descriptions and how to pledge.\nThese rewards represent only the tip of the iceberg in terms of our thanks to you for donating. And we've tried to keep things focused on things that will help your gaming experience. Because ultimately it's you who makes this show work!\n$1.00 - $40.00 are pretty standard reward levels. You got yer t-shirts, yer tote bags, yer exclusive invitations to live filming, etc. From there, however, we get even more exciting!\nYou'll note that at the $35-40 levels you can choose either the BAG OF HOLDING - or - the LET'S DUNGEON T-SHIRT. If you want both, no problem! Just add that tier's amount to your pledge. So for example if you got the LET'S DUNGEON T-SHIRT but also wanted the BAG OF HOLDING, you'd add $40 to your existing pledge of $35 for a total of $75 (plus applicable shipping if you live outside the U.S.).\nStarting at $85 and up we move into unique territory. Each item is tailored specifically to YOU. We'll help you develop your character, run a game with you... heck, we'll even compose and perform a song about you or your character!\nShipping costs are included for US residents, while non-US backers will be charged a small shipping fee depending on the item, as listed in the reward section.\n\nCan't donate? No problem! If you love RPGs and you know other people who do, please share this project! Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, Google+, YouTube... take to the streets! Let us know you shared... there might even be something in it for ya!\nOr maybe you've got some skills with web-design, programming, writing, or After Effects and want to join us? Hit us up! \nIf we're lucky enough to hit our $8,000 goal, we'll be able to shoot the first season but the fun doesn't end there! No sir! We have big plans! With extra funds we can shoot in more locations, attend more conventions, reach out to more groups to help facilitate learning and events.

Alien encounters, UFO cultists, and a town shrouded in dark secrets are just a few of the elements that make up the mystery of Ezekiel\u2019s Landing. Written by Valiant Dead\u2019s own James Treakle, it will be the filmmakers\u2019 first feature length production. They have teamed up with producer Kate Chaplin and Karmic Courage Productions to bring the film to life.\nUPDATE #1: Since we started our campaign we have been approached by interested distributors. \nUPDATE #2: We reached our goal for production!!!! Thank you!! Our stretch goal in these last few hours goes to pay our crew & cast. Right now they are working on deferment and we'd love to pay them as soon as possible because ...they are all unbelievably awesome!  \nSynopsis\nUFO hunter Emma Wright is a believer, a writer, and a fraud. After Wright endures a tense interview with professional skeptic Joel Hooper, Kass Burroughs, an obsessive fan, comes to her with a compelling mystery, one that gives her a new reason to believe and to lie. Before long, Wright and Burroughs discover a deadly secret protected by a small town\u2019s UFO cult -- a secret that lies in the skeptical Hooper\u2019s past, and which could destroy his future. It\u2019s up to Wright and Hooper to battle the UFO cult and reveal the truth, about the town and each other, before it\u2019s too late.\nChaplin's Previous Work\nValiant Dead's Previous Work\nProduction\nThe idea for Ezekiel\u2019s Landing came to fruition almost two years ago when James Treakle presented the idea to the fledgling group that would become Valiant Dead. He wanted to weave a classic alien abduction narrative that, at the time, was well beyond the capabilities of the small team. After many drafts and numerous revisions, the story has been sharpened and its scope refined into something we are not only capable of making, but one we are passionate about.\nToday, pre-production stands nearly completed with the final draft of the script in hand and a full cast assembled, ready for action. Filming is slated to begin at the end of February and will stretch through the end of May. In the coming months, many incredibly talented actors and artists will be sacrificing their time to ensure that the story of Ezekiel\u2019s Landing is told.\nT-shirt included in the $50, $150 & $250 reward\nThe film will be shot across several locations in Central Indiana, including Indianapolis, Noblesville, and Irvington. All told, it will amount to quite a few miles being logged by our cast and crew (some of them will be driving 120+ miles just to get to the set).\nA great deal of care is being put into making Ezekiel\u2019s Landing an amazing visual experience. Part of this effort includes shooting the entire film in RAW, giving us maximum control over the quality of each shot (RAW is the digital equivalent of a photo negative). Our Director of Photography, Bobby Dalley, will be shooting everything on a Canon 6D with the assistance of Magic Lantern.\nAs with any film, the sound plays a critical role in creating a truly immersive experience. Our composer and master audiomancer, Miles Harris, will be building a complete 5.1 soundtrack for the film. Some of the tools in his vast arsenal include Reaper, a Focusrite Scarlett 6i6, and a gratuitous collection of keyboards.\nCast & Crew\nDuring the casting process, several open auditions were held and requests for video auditions from those who couldn't attend were put out. We were completely overwhelmed with the number of incredibly talented individuals that responded. Short bios for everyone can be found on our Facebook page, but allow us to introduce you to the cast of Ezekiel\u2019s Landing.  \nCrew \nMany of our crew are veterans of the litany of Valiant Dead shorts that were produced last year, while others are joining us for the first time. Every single one of them has amazing talent and dedication to the making the best film possible. Coming soon to the Ezekiel\u2019s Landing Facebook page will be interesting bios about each of them. \nDirector - James Treakle \nDirector of Photography - Bobby Dalley \nExecutive Producer - Kate Chaplin of Karmic Courage Productions\nExecutive Producer - Adam Bailey of Valiant Dead \nExecutive Producer - Charles Baker of Valiant Dead \nPlease check out the Valiant Dead YouTube channel to see some of our past work.\nGoals & Stretch Goals\nOur primary goal for this Kickstarter is $3500. This will give us sufficient funding to pay for props, practical and visual effects, transportation, costumes, makeup, and food. Some of these elements are essential to the completion of the project. Others will allow us to give Ezekiel\u2019s Landing the polish it needs to look great. With your support, we can make an amazing sci-fi thriller that is sure to entertain.\nWe have established two stretch goals that we hope you will help us meet. The cast and crew have graciously agreed to work pro bono or on deferred payment (meaning they only get paid if we can raise the money). We want to be able to compensate the cast and crew properly for their hard work on this film. If we are able to raise $7300, we will be able to pay the members of our crew. If we are able to raise $10,100, we will be able to pay our actors as well. Ezekiel\u2019s Landing will be made with or without us reaching these stretch goals -- but you can help us reward everyone involved for their time and talent.\nRewards\nFor those of you who choose to support Ezekiel\u2019s Landing, we have assembled a laundry list of gifts for our wonderful benefactors. Veteran artist Scott Story is creating a gorgeous poster for the film in the style of Drew Struzan. You can check out the reward tiers in the section on the right.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are numerous challenges inherent in any film project, challenges we have met and overcome many times before during the shorts we produced last year. Ezekiel\u2019s Landing will be a test of endurance, however, and it is a test we will conquer with enthusiasm. \n\nWe also face certain technical challenges with this film. Because are shooting the entire movie in RAW, a great deal of hard drive space will be required simply to store the footage. Additionally, a great deal of cloud storage space will be needed to transfer that footage between our editors and visual effects artists.

You can buy some of these same rewards off our website (www.arrowstormentertainment.com) under the Kickstarter Rewards section on the front page.\nHi Friends,\nWell, we made the initial goal of $25,000, thanks to your sharing and support. So now what?\nWell, we still have unrealized dreams for SURVIVOR. So, for our stretch goal, we want to add a scene that was just too expensive for us to justify before.\nSo here's the story - we shot a scene of Dani Chuchran fighting a mutant wolf (planning to create the wolf with CGI). However, as we were reviewing the sequence with our VFX team, they were like \"um, guys... this is a really hard and really EXPENSIVE sequence...\" - (that happens sometimes... our creative energy is bigger than our budgets.)\nWell, we want to put a dent in that budget shortfall, and include that scene anyway, because it is just really cool. So, our new stretch goal of $50,000 will go a long way to making that scene happen.\nAND, as a reward to all our backers, if we reach our stretch goal, we will release an exclusive SNEAK PEAK at the film - a scene of Kevin Sorbo fighting mutants. AND, as soon as that mutant wolf scene is done, we'll give you a ADDITIONAL sneak peak of that one too!\nLook for more STRETCH GOAL REWARDS, coming soon.\nIn the meantime, enjoy this video from director, John Lyde, explaining some more about our stretch goal:\nSURVIVOR is the first true science fiction film from Arrowstorm Entertainment, a world leader in fantasy entertainment. Sure, we've made some zombie movies (Osombie and Zombie Hunter), but now we're talking spaceships, laser guns, wormholes, mutant creatures and a true scifi icon, Mr. Kevin Sorbo!\nAs with all our past Kickstarter efforts, this film has already been shot and edited, and we are well into post-production. Our trailer is actual footage from the film, so you can get a good gauge of the quality, and how close we are to fulfilling our vision.\nJust as young Kate Mitra discovers a habitable planet for what's left of humankind, a meteor strike destroys their space craft, crash-landing them on a mysterious barren world. As Kate, Captain Hunter, and the other survivors gather, they are ambushed by a band of post-apocalyptic warriors and mutated savages. Kate awakens bound in a cave, trapped by flesh-eating cave creatures and separated from her friends, and must learn to trust the planet's mysterious humanoids in order to outrun, outsmart and outfight hordes of bloodthirsty aliens and an enormous mutated wolf creature, and rescue her friends and her captain before they are all eaten alive.\nKevin Sorbo (Captain Hunter) - you love him from Andromeda and Hercules. Now he's back fighting mutants, and he's sure not to leave you disappointed.\nDanielle Chuchran (Kate Mitra) - a rapidly rising action star, you've seen her decapitate zombies, massacre orcs, and cuddle puppies and ponies. Dani's back in fighting form, battling mutants, sub-humans and monsters.\nRocky Myers (Rogan) - football player, lawyer, model and actor, Rocky is an up-and-coming star amassing an impressive array of credits. Look for him in theaters right now in The Saratov Approach, and in the upcoming horror film, Safari.\nThe film is already shot, and we're deep into post-production. But we've still got a bunch more work to do. We need additional funding to create a ton of space VFX shots, including some interiors and exteriors of the various space craft, plus all the action VFX on the planet - a few hundred shots in all.\nPeople pledge an amount and choose a reward. At the end of our 30-day Kickstarter campaign, if the combined total of all pledges for our project meets our $25,000 goal, then the credit cards of those who pledge are charged and we receive the funds to finish our film. If we don't meet our goal, then the money is not withdrawn from your account and no rewards are provided :(. If we exceed our $25,000 goal then the extra funds will be used to make the movie even better - so keep pledging! All funds raised are used directly in the finishing of our film.\nWe're not looking for charity, we're looking for an alternate sales venue - that's why our rewards reflect fair market value. Don't think of it as a donation, think of it as a pre-purchase. If you want to see this film, buy it now through Kickstarter - you'll probably get a better deal from us than from whatever retailer ends up selling it in your country, and you'll help make our film better!\nWe're a small group of independent filmmakers who love making movies, and have been at it for about a decade. It's our full-time job, and every film we have made has received worldwide distribution. We do pretty much everything ourselves, from conception to financing to production to securing distribution.

Hence, they only produce gigantic franchise films that have a chance of generating $1 billion in the theaters. They routinely spend $200 million on production, and another $100 million in marketing... For indie filmmakers, who don't have the theatrical marketing dollars, theaters are still mostly a dead-end.

D20 Entertainment wanted this same team to write the script for this project and have creative control. It is our goal, first and foremost, to bring the characters that the readers have known and loved to the screen and to remain faithful to the spirit of the comic strip. So what can you expect to see? Well \u2014 much of it is going to depend on the level of funding. The more that comes in, the more we\u2019ll have to work with. What you won\u2019t be getting is a simple rehashing of material from the magazine. Instead, you will see all new material. Of course, we do plan to draw from the wealth of material presented in the monthly magazine over the years. The two will be massaged, reimagined, rewoven and combined into an episodic story that flows together seamlessly on the big screen. Readers have come to rely on getting the best story for their buck every month in the strips, and as supporters of this Kickstarter project, you can be assured of getting the best screen adaptation possible. Everyone involved is passionate about the comic and getting it right. Again, just what that story turns out to be depends on our backers. This is where you come in.\nAt $60k, we will produce a short theatrical format picture around 60 minutes long. This will include more appearances by more familiar characters from the KODT universe. \nAt $125k, we get to make dreams come true and enter a whole new frontier. This will mean that the producers (with full creative control by the D-Team) will be able to fully make the movie they\u2019ve been bouncing around for the past six months. Viewers will be able to enjoy not only the classic characters, but also more of their favorites, perhaps even the lovable Squirrely. We have a very exciting story blocked out and would love the opportunity to bring it to life. \nEvery portion of this production will be under the watchful eye of Kenzer and Company and the creative control of the KODT development team who have been extremely protective of their creation over the last twenty-five years. Rest assured, the spirit of the Knights will be faithfully recreated. As funding increases, so can characters be added, and let\u2019s face it, everyone has a favorite character that they want to see on film. We need your help. All we ask is that you download the free comic and share it with your friends to entice them to visit and consider pledging. Help us spread the word. Share and post about the project frequently, and keep checking back for updates every few days. \nBelow is a list of movie props that you can add to your reward/war chest.

Henny was a leading figure in the generation of comedians to break out of Vaudeville onto the national stage, and he brought with him his unmatched rapid-fire delivery of witty, hilarious one-liners, including his most famous joke: \u201cTake my wife...please!\u201d\nThis documentary paints a portrait not just of Henny Youngman the comedian, but of Henny Youngman the man, and features interviews with friends, contemporaries, and family members alongside footage of his greatest performances.\nWho made the film?\nTake My Life Please was directed and edited by Gary Youngman, Henny's son. Gary followed his father into show business and has worked the film industry for over fifty years. He drew upon his vast years of experience to paint this touching portrait of a father both bigger than life and down to earth. For this documentary, Gary traveled the country, interviewing Henny's friends and contemporaries, including Milton Berle, Jan Murray, Red Buttons, and Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara; all appear in the documentary, sharing their stories about their time with Henny. The film also features never before seen footage of Henny Youngman that Gary shot himself in his father\u2019s final years.\nWhere will the money go?\nUnfortunately, the rights to many of Henny\u2019s performances are not owned by the Youngman family. They are instead owned by entertainment organizations, who must be paid for access to the footage. So the bulk of the funds raised as part of this campaign will go to acquiring the rights to use the footage of Henny\u2019s greatest appearances. Additional funds will be used for post-production finishing costs to ensure the picture is up to the high level of quality both the subject and audience deserve.\nAny money raised in excess of the costs of acquiring rights and finishing the film will go toward reimbursing those who generously donated their time to help make the documentary.\nI want to help, but can't pledge financially.\nThat\u2019s okay!

CONTINUE OUR LEGACY BY HELPING TO FINANCE OUR SPRING-SUMMER SEASON, AND BE A PART OF THE COMPANY THAT HAS PUBLISHED MORE GREAT CARTOONISTS THAN ANY PUBLISHER IN THE HISTORY OF COMICS.\n2013 has been a particularly hard year for all of us at Fantagraphics Books. Earlier in the year, one of our founding partners, Kim Thompson, was diagnosed with lung cancer and died four and a half months later, on June 19. Because Kim was such an active part of our company, his death has had repercussions \u2014 emotionally, of course, but financially as well. Kim edited our European graphic novel line and as a result of his illness, 13 of his books scheduled for the Spring-Summer season had to be cancelled or postponed, representing the loss of nearly a third of that season. Our fixed costs stayed the same \u2014because they\u2019re fixed\u2014 but the income 13 books would\u2019ve generated was lost, disrupting our cash flow, and leaving us in a tight spot. Many, if not most of them, will be re-scheduled (Jacques Tardi\u2019s Run Like Crazy, Run Like Hell is scheduled for July 2014, for example) but in the meantime, we\u2019ve suffered a severe shortfall that will impede our ability to produce next season\u2019s books. That\u2019s why we\u2019re asking our faithful readers and new converts alike to help us recoup \u2014 and help finance our next season\u2019s books. The money you contribute will go toward production, design, marketing, and printing our books.\nOUR NEXT SEASON: April-August 2014\nOur Spring-Summer season comprises 39 books by a stellar line-up of cartoonists. We\u2019re biased, but we think it\u2019s possibly our best ever. There are a number of books from names familiar to longtime Fantagraphics readers \u2014 do Peter Bagge, Dan Clowes, Joe Sacco, Drew Friedman, Michael Kupperman, Jim Woodring, Don Rosa, Tony Millionaire, or Gilbert and Jaime Hernandez ring a bell? \u2014not to mention any number of other names that could anchor a comics Hall of Fame: Charles Schulz, Steve Ditko, Simon & Kirby, Hal Foster, Carl Barks, Floyd Gottfredson, L.B. Cole, Jacques Tardi, Joihn Severin, S. Clay Wilson, Wally Wood, and more. We also have one of our strongest seasons of original graphic novels ever, including new greaphic novels from Olivier Schrauwen, Simon Hanselmann, Esther Pearl Watson, Conor Stechschulte, Carol Swain, Lane Milburn, Eleanor Davis, and Ed Piskor.\nFrom The Complete witzend to The Complete Eightball, Buddy Bradley to Megg & Mogg, and Don Rosa\u2019s ducks to S. Clay Wilson\u2019s pirates, not to mention new Peanuts, Disney, EC and Love and Rockets books, our 2014 lineup truly features The World\u2019s Greatest Cartoonists.\nAnd that's merely one publishing season of five months; we publish a virtual pantheon of cartoonists every season. This isn\u2019t about a single cartoonist or book, but a critical mass of work by a group of utterly amazing intergenerational cartoonists. Help us keep this flag flying.\nOUR BONAFIDES:\nWe don\u2019t want to bore you with a list of what we\u2019ve accomplished over the nearly four decades that we have been publishing. Many of you know who we are, but for those of you who don\u2019t and those of you who have forgotten:\nGary Groth started co-publishing The Comics Journal, now the longest running print magazine about comics, in 1976. It was the beginning of a quixotic venture: Our immediate goals were to publish advocacy journalism and serious criticism, elevate the artistry of comics, and fight for creator rights. In short, to declare war on the creative mediocrity that dominated mainstream comics at the time as well as on the greedy corporate policies of the major companies. This was a time when artists had virtually no alternatives to Marvel and DC, when the underground comix distribution system had effectively collapsed, and when there were no alternative publishers.\nAfter four or five years of encouraging independent and alternative cartoonists (and chastising mainstream comics companies), we took a big risk by putting our meager money where our enormous mouths were and published a number of emerging, then-unknown cartoonists in rapid succession throughout the 1980s: Jaime and Gilbert Hernandez, Peter Bagge, Dan Clowes, and Joe Sacco, among others. We wanted to complement our criticism of the status quo by publishing comics that reflected our commitment to the art form. We also began publishing collections reprinting newspaper strips like Popeye and Prince Valiant, and collections of work by such artists as R. Crumb, Jules Feiffer, Ralph Steadman, Spain Rodriguez, Vaughn Bode, and many others in the underground counter-cultural tradition. We have been unwavering in our devotion to honoring the history of cartooning and championing the next generation(s) of cartoonists.\nOUR MISSION:\nIn a world of throw-away art, filled to overflowing with comics that are trite, jejune, juvenile, and thoughtless, we\u2019ve always wanted to publish comics that will endure, and have consistently published cartoonists who pushed the boundaries of the expressive possibilities of the form.\nWe have been waving the banner of cartooning for almost 40 years now, and our always believed in its artistic potential\u2014 in its power and subtlety, its vast capaciousness and intimate smallness, its ability to transport us to different worlds or express the human heart in conflict with itself, its ability to vivify political and historical events or reveal intimate autobiographical truths, its hilariously vulgar humor or its moving urban dramas.\nTHE PERENNIAL STRUGGLE\nWe are not going to bullshit you. If we were a big corporate publisher (or perhaps an avaricious smaller one), we\u2019d have plenty of money to weather this temporary crisis. But, we\u2019re not. Ours is and always has been an intrinsically difficult commercial enterprise, and we have survived due to a combination of good taste, sheer will, good luck, and reasonable business acumen. Still, it has never been easy. Fantagraphics has always been a guerilla publisher \u2014 lean and mean. In order to do what we do, we\u2019ve always kept our overhead low and our lifestyle modest. No fancy offices, no limousines, no frills. We publish 100 books a year with a staff of 20 \u2014 a level of efficiency unheard of in corporate publishing. We work hard! We would never be mistaken for a bottom-line oriented, bean-counting commercial publisher with their blockbuster mentality, bloated budgets, and eagerness to pander to the lowest common denominator of consumers. We pride ourselves on taking risks, publishing work based on merit, and a commitment to serious artistic standards.\nAnd we take pride in our professionalism; we are a publisher with a highly skilled, dedicated, and passionate staff, who shares our values and the values of our authors, believes deeply in what they do, and who edits, designs, and markets our author\u2019s books with great love and care. We have created an infrastructure that is specifically tailored to sell the kinds of books we publish \u2014 great works of comics, art, and literature. But, this infrastructure costs money and it\u2019s not always commensurate with the fluctuations of income from selling books.  Our fixed costs stay the same throughout the year: rent, payroll, health care premiums (over $1 million paid over the last 15 years!), utilities, etc.  But, the postponement or cancellation of so many books in a single season causes a precipitous drop in income.\nWe have always managed to weather the lean times. Sometimes wealthy patrons have loaned us money and on one or two occasions we have campaigned directly to you, our readers, pre-Kickstarter, and asked you to buy books when we were on the edge. We have throughout our history flirted with the idea of looking for an investor, but rejected it on principle: unless someone invested in us in the spirit of being a patron of the arts \u2014highly unlikely\u2014 that way leads not only to madness but to the slow erosion of the core principles the company was founded on. (Does everyone remember what happened to Kitchen Sink Press when investors got their claws into them?).\nWe\u2019ve has never existed comfortably within the traditional capitalist model\u2014 ruthlessly competitive, obsessed with growth and the endless accumulation of surplus money.  Our artistic values have always tempered our profitability. Fantagraphics has always managed to scrape by, but we realized that with the advent of crowd sourcing, we are in a position to make an end-run around the most brutish strictures of the marketplace and appeal directly to our readers. We now live in a world where artists as diverse as Spike Lee and Amanda Palmer can ask their fans to help finance their art and, in that same spirit, we are asking you to help us continue this quixotic enterprise. \nPlease visit the catalog over at the Fantagraphics website for a more in-depth description of each book!\nNewest premiums added at the top!\nCOMPLETE CRUMB COMICS SIGNED BY R.

We feel strongly that this is something that we need to explore.  Unfortunately, this will take us past the November 10th deadline for this Kickstarter campaign.  And so, in order to give us time to do our due diligence for our fans and backers, we have decided to cancel it.\nAt the end of the day, we feel that we owe it to all of our backers who have pledged their hard-earned money to help create a live Midnight Syndicate concert, as well as to the fans and supporters who have helped us promote this campaign, to thoroughly explore this possibility.\nIf it were to come to fruition, this new opportunity would result in a win-win situation for everyone who is involved in and has backed Midnight Syndicate Live!  It would entail a live show in 2014.\nIf things don't work out, we will take what we have learned and launch a second campaign.\nTo everyone that has supported us and gotten behind this project so far we THANK YOU!   The amazing response we've seen to this campaign just shows us once again that we have the GREATEST FANS IN THE WORLD!\n--- Ed, Gavin, and the Midnight Syndicate Live! team\n-----------------------------------------\nGreetings fans and friends of Midnight Syndicate!  Thanks to your support over the past 16 years, we've been able to continue to create Halloween, horror, and fantasy \"soundtracks for your imagination\" albums.   Now it's time for us to take that next step... something you've been asking from us for years.  We're going to bring your nightmares to life with a one-of-a-kind Halloween horror multimedia Midnight Syndicate live concert experience! This is it! This will be the biggest, most important and exciting project in Midnight Syndicate history but we need your help to make it a reality!\nWho is Midnight Syndicate ?\nMidnight Syndicate is two composers who create \"soundtracks to imaginary films.\"   Our CDs are a blend orchestral instrumental music and sound effects.  Since 1996, we've released 17 studio albums (including  award-winning The 13th Hour, the official Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying soundtrack, and Monsters of Legend).  We've also scored several horror films (most recently Axe Giant on SyFy) and even produced our own movie, The Dead Matter, a few years ago.  Halloween is a big time of the year for us.  You can hear our music used as background in stores, haunted houses, amusement parks (like Universal's Halloween Horror Nights), and television shows (including Monday Night Football), as well as your neighborhood haunt displays this time of year. \nWhat is Midnight Syndicate Live! ?\nMidnight Syndicate Live! is a unique horror-themed multimedia concert experience that blends live music, original films, music videos, and theatre.  As it is for many of you, Halloween is 365 days a year here.  We want to make Halloween history with an event that celebrates the holiday and the horror cinema at the core of what we do.\nPersonnel\nThe visual element to this show is as important as the music.  To pull this together we\u2019ve teamed up with a talented group of veteran FX artists and filmmakers.  In addition to the individuals listed below, we will have many opportunities for fans and other artists to be involved.\nPictured (left to right): Beki Ingram, Gary Jones, Robert Kurtzman, Edward Douglas, Gavin Goszka, David \u201cHouse\u201d Greathouse\nRobert Kurtzman is a special effects legend.  In addition to being the co-founder KNB EFX (Walking Dead) and creating effects for some of Hollywood\u2019s biggest films over the years, he also produced From Dusk Till Dawn and has directed films including the original Wishmaster and The Rage.\nDirector Producer Gary Jones' television credits include Xena and Hercules but he\u2019s also known for his FX work on films like Army of Darkness and the monster movies he\u2019s directed like Mosquito, Boogeyman 3, and Axe Giant.\nAlthough many first met David \"House\" Greathouse as a contestant on Syfy\u2019s Faceoff, he has been working in the haunted house and film industries\u2014as well as designing masks and touring with the theatrical metal band Mushroomhead\u2014for over 20 years.\nAfter working on The Dead Matter, Beki Ingram became a contestant on the second season of SyFy\u2019s Faceoff and has since worked on films like Children of the Corn and Jug Head.\nJason Carter rose to fame as the memorable Ranger Marcus Cole from Babylon 5.  Some of his other credits include Angel, Charmed, The Dead Matter, and Midnight Syndicate\u2019s Carnival Arcane album.\nIn addition to their incredible work as haunted house prop, makeup, and set designers, long-time Midnight Syndicate collaborators Jason Blaszczak and Screamline Studios have recently teamed up with Steve Kopelman on Rob Zombie\u2019s Great American Nightmare.\nAmong the performers from across the country this show will allow us to feature include vocalist, Destini Beard whose collaborative work with Midnight Syndicate includes the Time Forgotten and The Dark Masquerade albums.\nYou!  This show is for you, the fans of Midnight Syndicate, and we\u2019ll be looking for your input on what you\u2019d like to see and hear. Additionally, by contributing to this Kickstarter campaign you will forever be a part of this important part of Midnight Syndicate and Halloween history.\nWhy haven\u2019t we done live concerts so far?\nAs an indie band on our own label, one of the main reasons is getting the resources together needed to produce that FIRST show.  The cost is higher for us because of the style of music we perform and the visual elements needed to make it the kind of show you deserve.  Additionally, having produced a smaller version of this multimedia concert many years ago, we know the kind of team we need to make this something really special.  It\u2019s only been through working in film (The Dead Matter, The Rage, Axe Giant) and in the haunted attraction industry over the years that we\u2019ve been able to build a team of talented veteran professionals who, together, have significant experience in all facets of this show.   With this cross-section of talent, we can create something extraordinary.\nWhy now?\nWe have the best fans in the world and your support is what has allowed us to keep producing music for all these years.  This is the next stage in Midnight Syndicate history as we adapt to an ever-changing music industry.  This live concert is not only exciting, but also an important step for Midnight Syndicate going forward.  By supporting this Kickstarter campaign you are not only helping to create an awesome Halloween horror multimedia concert experience but also helping Midnight Syndicate grow and continue to release more great music!\nRewards\nMost of the rewards we are offering are exclusive to the Kickstarter campaign.  That\u2019s so when you hold that special edition DVD in your hands or wear that shirt or hat, we want to remind you that you\u2019re watching or wearing something YOU made possible.\nWhat will the money be used for?\nClose to half the money we raise on this Kickstarter campaign (after the cost of rewards and processing fees) will go towards the purchase of the equipment and additional personnel we need in order to reproduce Midnight Syndicate\u2019s music in a live setting.  The other half will go towards the production of the original films and stage elements that will play such a huge part in this show as well as the production of the DVD version of the show.\nWhen will this show debut?\nWe plan to debut this show in Cleveland, Ohio in early November of 2014 with the DVD of the concert to follow shortly thereafter.  Once we produce this first show, we have a plan in place that will allow the concert to sustain itself financially as we add new concert dates in other cities and continue to expand the show in years to come.\nWhat if we exceed our goal?\nHere\u2019s where things get even more exciting.  $40,000 is the bare minimum that we need to produce the first concert.  That being said, additional funds would allow us to expand the scope of every aspect of the show.  As we surpass our goal, we will unlock more stretch goals and rewards!\nIn closing...\nThis show has been a long time coming.  It is a huge step in Midnight Syndicate history and we\u2019re asking for your support to make it a reality.  To our fans, thank you again for your support over the years.  To everyone reading this, thank you for taking the time to listen to us.

Similar to traditional role playing games, we advance our character through experience, but that is where the similarities end. Ever, Jane is about playing the actual character in the game, building stories.  Our quests are derived from player's actions and stories. And  we gossip rather than swords and magic to demolish our enemies and aid our friends.  \nTry to win the sympathy of Lizzie Bennet by telling lies about your rival, as Mr. Wickham does, but be careful.  The system will notify someone if they are being talked about too often and a good sleuth may find the player who is spreading such rumors.  If you are caught in your lies, the consequences you intended for your target will hit you two-fold. \nThe current prototype provides fully functional infrastructure for both the gossip and the invitation systems as well as a 3D village in which you can walk about, bowing and curtsying to people appropriately.   We have a tutorial that walks you through the basic mechanics and UI.  There are no balls, dinner parties, or mini-games yet nor any ability to travel between villages.  We need additional funds to build those.  And that is why we are here.\nIn traditional MMORPGs, players have stats such as Strength, Dexterity, Intelligence.  In Ever, Jane we use Personality Traits that fit with the major characters in Jane Austen's novels.  \nPlayers can choose to be like Marianne Dashwood preferring Happiness over Duty.  This decision will gain the admiration of those around her who enjoy her lightheartedness, but will offend those like Mr. Knightly who prize duty.  \nPersonality traits are raised (and lowered) through daily activities in the game, starting with the gossip system where what people say about you can affect your reputation and status.\nIn addition to gossip, we provide an invitation system that allows players to invite one another to various events in-world.  The invitation system can be used to enhance one's personality traits but it requires strategic thinking.   If a player invites a person of higher Status with the hope of improving their own Status, care must be taken.  If the player invited rejects the invitation it will harm rather than improve Status. If the invitation is accepted, but out of Duty rather than Happiness, the Status will only improve slightly.  On the other hand, if the player invited accepts with Happiness, Status improvements may be as much as doubled.  \n\nTrying to understand how other people will react to you is part of the Jane Austen character experience.  For more information on Jane Austen's use of strategic thinking, see http://goo.gl/ZocpSI\nThe two major events in Ever, Jane are the balls and dinner parties.  In each case, players must acquire the requisite accoutrements before attending.  Balls need gowns, formal attire and carriages.  Dinner parties require formal clothing and while, unlike the balls, characters may walk to the party, most will want to acquire a better form of travel.   \nThe juiciest gossip snippets can be found at balls and dinner parties. They also present opportunities to vastly improve ones personality in whatever direction one is aspiring.  The dutiful man can capture points by dancing with every wallflower.  The happy hostess can earn points by providing outstanding meals to her guests.  \nCharacters in Austen's novels occupied themselves with various pastimes.  Ever,Jane will provide activities, called mini-games,  that emulate the character's daily lives.  \nThe ball is one mini-game with dancing its own skill to be acquired and exercised.  At dinner parties we will have games of Whist as well as other puzzles and word games.  Men will want to hunt and fish during the season and women will enjoy sewing, embroidery, and playing the piano-forte. \nMini-games will allow players to increase secondary personality traits which enhance primary traits and open opportunities for unique activities and events.\nSimilar in functionality to guilds in your more traditional MMORPG, the family is a collection of players who play together to increase family status.  Family status is reflected in each individual player's scores so preserving and helping the family become a critical part of game play. Nothing can prevent a family from having a Lydia among them, but the more fortunate families may also have a Fanny or an Emma.  The family must pull together in crises lest everyone in the family be hindered from the best virtual life has to offer.\nThe quest system allows us to create story lines involving the various players in the game based on their goals, situations, and the story arc of the village.   The gossip system keeps us informed as to the goings on in the village and allows the development team to actively curate player experiences through quest modifications tailored to player's own stories. \n\nIn addition, our forums provide a place for players to publish their stories as they live them in the world.  This allows visitors to their village to catch up on the local gossip prior to visiting.  Or they can rely on the local town gossip.\nThe Art in the game is all done by Renee Nejo with the occasional bit of engineering art by our founder, if you can find it.  You can find more of Renee's work at reneenejo.com.  \nWe are assuming a 15% overhead from the funds we collect to cover PR expenses.  In addition, server costs should run approximately $600/mos. for 500 concurrent users (CCU) beginning in May 2014.  \nThe remaining has been broken into four iterations of approximately 6 mos. each at $21K for payroll to support the existing staff.  \nTime estimates are based on the 15 mos. it took to build the prototype which contains the gossip system, invite system, login, networking, servers and preliminary art.\nIteration 1:\nSleuthing system (part of Gossip)\nCharacter Customization\nPost (writing letters between characters)\nVisiting complete with calling cards\nIteration 2:\nDinner Parties\nBalls\nTravel between villages\nCarriages and Horses\nIteration 3:\nSubscription authorization\nCustomer Service Tools\nHunting\nSewing\nUpgrade gossip to use language parsing\nIteration 4:\nFishing\nEmbroidery\nFamilies\nCard Games\nMetrics\nAdditional Artist\nMusic\nDrawing\nA character artist with animation skill will improve the look and feel of the characters while allowing Renee to focus on the environment, which is her specialty.\nMusic and drawing provide additional mini-games for players.\nAdditional Programmer\nEstate Planning\nAn additional programmer will allow us to hammer on the quality of the servers to provide a more robust experience.  It will also allow us to implement systems in a more timely manner.\nEstate planning for those fortunate enough to own estates gives players the opportunity to use tools to modify their environment.\nAdditional Designer\nLandscaping\nAn additional designer will allow us to provide a more sophisticated algorithm for managing personality traits and aid in building the player based economy.\nThe Regency period was a fascinating period for landscaping and we hope to explore the removal of formal gardens and replacing them with swamps and hermitages as part of the activities we provide.\nHire full time QA\nFarming\nAs the project grows, a full time qa person becomes increasingly critical to ensuring we don't break more than we fix and that our product meets the standards our users require.\nAnimal husbandry, gardening, and providing food for the village are part of the lower subscription level options we wish to provide. \nHire a producer/project manager\nPlayer Based Economy\nA producer or project manager would provide direction and guidance for our growing team and free the CEO to work on building the company and not just building one game.\nTo complete the fun, every virtual world needs a player based economy where artisans and crafters can sell their wares and the wealthy can indulge their whims for the latest fashions.   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEver,Jane is not just a game, it is a service and running a service 24/7 provides a unique set of challenges. My experience managing the team that ran ~650K simulations on 10K hardware servers across 3 geographic locations on Second Life has prepared me with an understanding of the challenges. My work with the Customer Support team prepared me for the kinds of tools we will need to build to provide quality service.\n\nMMOs require a huge amount of content. By building our villages with modular housing and stitching together village elements we will provide content that appears different but is made of core building blocks. If you go behind the houses in the current village you will see evidence of some of those building blocks as we have not put the backside of the village together yet. In addition, our quest system allows us to build quests very quickly.\n\nEven the best tested servers crash. The servers for the prototype run via a keep-alive service which respawns any server that crashes. The servers can come up and stay up in any order. In fact, the only way to kill our servers is through a program called KillServers which prohibits the keep-alive services from respawning them so they can die. \n\nScaling is another challenge of MMOs, particularly at launch time. Our servers are set to spawn new villages when the population of a single village reaches a low water mark. This allows us to maximize the experience for players by preventing any one server from getting overloaded and lagging. Our servers are virtual servers which allow us to grow our hardware when the spawning of software servers begins to overwhelm the hardware. For the demo, updating a server to double it's memory took approximately 30 minutes and was as painless as a server is capable of being. Unless we outpace Softlayer's hardware, we should be able to scale. \n\nCommunity is everything in an MMO. We need a critical mass in order to make the game fun and we need to build and nurture that community. We are working hard to bring the Janeite community into our world, as well as traditional gamers looking for something unique. The Janeite community is very strong and active and their cosplay community is amazing. In addition we have a community manager who is wonderful with people and has experience building on-line communities. \n\nWe plan to run our service live throughout development to allow our backers to help us set the direction for the game.

The kickstarter funding has successfully concluded ... but the journey of our game is only beginning! Come visit our website and see how you can become part of Sojourner Tales!\nIf they combined the power of tablets, smart phones and ebook readers...with the joy of storytelling and board games.\nWelcome to Sojourner! I'm Tracy Hickman. I'm an International and New York Times Best Selling author and game designer. For over thirty years, my wife Laura and I have been writing novels and designing games ('Dragonlance', 'Wayne of Gotham', 'Ravenloft', 'Dragon's Bard'). Now we're thrilled to invite you on our latest adventure: to bring interactive adventure storytelling to families and hobbyists alike. \nIn Sojourner Tales, you will use strategy and wits as you discover and collect the pieces of your mysterious story as you strive to be the first to complete the epic adventure. The tale is different every time you play ... or you can download new Sojourner Tales to explore from our website!\nNumber of Players: 2-6\nPlaying Time: 60-90 minutes\nAge of Players: 12+ (requires minimum reading skills)\nSetup time: 5-7 minutes\nTeach the rules: 3-5 minutes\nAlmost everything you need to know in order to play the game is contained in our basic game play video right here. \nCan I play without electricity?\nAbsolutely! The Sojourner Story books are designed so that you can use either a print version of the adventures or the e-book version although the electronic versions make the game faster and easier to play.\nWINNING\nThe first person to collect all five of their Chapter Disks and fulfill the final win condition of the story wins that game!\nThere are other rules clarifying the random setup of the board and when you turn over a face-down Chapter Disk but you already know enough rules right here to play the game.\nWe've created a board game like no other: the first to integrate download content for tablets such as iPads, smart phones and e-reader devices such as Kindles, Nooks and Kobos.\nUnique Ebook Story Modules: The story told in every Sojourner Tale is designed to be contained entirely in the electronic mobi or epub files. You also have the option to download the adventure in PDF format to print out and use with the game if you do not have a tablet or other device that supports the electronic book formats. However, the use of any touch-screen device provides a magical experience in storytelling and helps the game move faster.\nAdaptable Design: The game components that come in the box and the rules of the game itself are specifically designed to be adaptive to a broad spectrum of storytelling. Each Sojourner Story Module contains information on which location tiles are to be used on the board with that particular story, thereby changing the look of the game board depending on the story being told. All of the flavor, setting, characters and narrative of the adventure are contained in the downloaded module ... meaning the game can adapt to any story you want to live.\nInnovative Storytelling System: The board keeps track of your location in the epic story, making certain that the game flows back and forth between the board and the ebook with the story continuity left intact. For random encounters, an innovative 'Twisted Tales' system lets the players draw two twisted cards and one tales card and then 'stack' them in such a way as to make a phrase -- a phrase which takes them to a specific adventure entry for that combination of cards. \nGrass-roots Licensing: We want YOU to write adventures for our game and so we are even providing you with a 'grass-roots licensing option whereby you can not only create your own Sojourner Tales games but (with our license) also sell those adventures on our official website.\n\nAnything is possible! Since the story and complexity of the game is designed to be contained entirely in the Sojourner Story Module, it is entirely up to the module designer.\nThe book contains our 'secret recipe': a matrix of entries designed specifically to interface with the game. You play the game under the same basic rules but once you enter the book, whatever the story's author creates will plunge you into that story.  Some stories are simple and created for quick play and families. Others may be complex, intended for more serious hobby gamers.\nOur stretch goals list two additional modes of play: Improv and Theater play. Improv is a way of using the game to make up the story collectively as you play.  Sojourner Theater  play has each person at the table downloading the same book ... but with each player taking a different speaking part as the game progresses.\nIn our initial release of the game, we will include components for six genres of story:\nFantasy\nScience-fiction\nHorror\nRomance/Steampunk\nMystery\nHoliday\nAdditional themed components representing further genres are certainly possible. What would you like to see?\nWe're packing a lot of awesome in every box.\n1 Gameboard\n50 'Twisted' Cards\n50 'Tales' Cards\n36 'Destiny' Cards\n6 Player Tokens\n6 Six-sided Dice\n1 'Lead Player' Marker\n1 'Chapter' Marker\n1 'Scene' Marker\n32 Story Disks (6 each in 6 colors)\n6 Journal Display Boards\n15 Location Tiles (creates 6 unique board configurations supporting fantasy, sci-fi, horror, mystery, romance/steampunk, superhero and holiday themes)\n1 Sojourner Story Module (print edition with additional access instructions for downloading PDF, Kindle Mobi or iPad epub files)\n1 Rules Book\nOriginal Cover Design\nCould you write a game just for your son's birthday?

Turns out that most of you just wanted the core set with the potential to expand over time. What this Kickstarter will do is add 30 more models: character models, new sculpts, and monsters.

Are you still living under a rock? Bones are only the best high-quality plastic gaming models to hit the industry in the last decade.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change one.\n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed one massive Kickstarter and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of a Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment, no matter the size, against loss and damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We learned a lot during our first Kickstarter. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that would help us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays are easy to solve, such as replacing a printer that is creating barcodes that a particular USPS hub is having a problem reading. Other delays are out of our hands, such as the 2012 longshoreman strike that delayed two of our overseas containers. We have even intentionally created delays when we chose to change models already in production to make them better.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in the model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for a buy in level model. This event did not occur in our previous Kickstarter but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops we will issue a refund or credit depending on your desire for the buy in pledge amount for the model. Also we reserve the right to modify pieces shown to meet production requirements.\n\nIn summary we have the knowledge, wisdom and know how to prevent, solve, and work through just about any problem that we will face and will do everything possible to make this an exciting and enjoyable event.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #119", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter 5 starts in 20 minutes.

Hollywood has announced that by the end of 2013, movies will no longer be projected using 35 mm film. In fact, the Empire won\u2019t get any new films from our distributers after Labor Day 2013 because our attendance drops sharply and all new 35MM films will go to higher grossing theaters. The vast majority of today's theaters -- 88%, according to the National Association of Theatre Owners -- have made the jump to digital projection.\nThe Empire Theatre, Block Island circa 1890.\nAll theatres must convert to digital projection equipment or close.\nThis technology change is very expensive. For large multiplexes, 70% of the cost of the conversion to digital projection is subsidized by the film industry. Without this subsidy, the multiplexes would have to close. For small single screen theaters like the Empire, that subsidy is not available. It is reported that approximately 1000 independent theaters across the country will close because they cannot afford to convert to digital projection.\nOur current 35mm film projector in use since the 1960s.\nTo raise the funds for the Empire, we have launched this campaign on Kickstarter. The way Kickstarter works, if we don't reach our goal of $55,000, then we get nothing and your pledge is cancelled. Through Kickstarter, we ask you, Empire supporters, to help us keep the doors open by making a pledge. In return for your support, we offer some great incentives.  \nPlease help us by spreading the word! Send this link to your family, friends, colleagues, classmates, teachers, acquaintances. Post it on your Facebook. Tweet about it. And encourage others to do the same. Our Kickstarter campaign can only be as successful as we are in getting the word out.\nHere are some quotes from our patrons:\n\u201cI love the Empire theater. To me the Empire theater is a work of art in itself. The character it has is amazing - the barn like cathedral ceiling with the rafters, the ropes and pulleys to open the small windows to let the heat out and the breeze in, the wooden floors, the beautiful not perfect chairs, the old posters, the stage and roller skating sign on the back wall. Sometimes I go to see a movie there even if I only have a slight interest in the movie because I want to be in the theater. Like seeing a game at Fenway Park. With all the advanced technology of the sterile modern movie theater (which I also love) this is a refreshing other time experience that in my opinion is extremely important to preserve. The Island would not be the quite the same without it.\u201d Steven Wright, Comedian\n\n\u201cIn 2003 when I saw Freaky Friday here to a packed house of all ages, this place gave me the feeling, lost for so long, of what it had been like going to a local single-screen movie theatre as part of a community. With the almost Draconian restrictions against \u201cdevelopment\u201d rightfully promulgated by conservationists, here\u2019s the last place in the world you will ever see a multiplex, and I say whoopee to that!\u201d Gerald A DeLuca, Theater Historian\nGo Digital Or Go Dark\nEmpire Theatre before and after the 1993 restoration.\nWhen we bought the theater 21 years ago, it had been closed and condemned for 7 years. We restored the theater and have been operating it ever since.  \nOther communities have rallied to support and save their local independent theaters, including the Jane Picken's Theatre in Newport.  The Empire is hopeful that with your support we will be able to continue to bring films to Block Island for many years to come.  \nWhat are the benefits of digital projection?\nSince the Empire Theatre is not insulated and heated, for 130 years the building has been closed for the winter. Currently, the local community has to travel to the mainland to see new movies in the winter. However, digital projectors are portable, so we could move the digital projector to the local school, community center or church and provide entertainment year-round. We hope to bring a much needed cultural outlet to the island. We will have the ability to bring the community together to see not only Hollywood movies but sports events, operas, plays and other cultural events. What a relief for the island's winter cabin fever! \nOriginal ticket booth from 1882, recently restored.\nHistory of the Empire Theatre\nAround 1850 Block Island's economy began shifting from fishing and agriculture, to catering to vacationers traveling to Block Island seeking it's cool summer beaches. \nFirst constructed in 1882, the building\u2019s original purpose was to offer roller-skating, a popular pastime at the time. Advertisements for the rink described the \"Perfectly Smooth Hardwood Floor\" a \"stone\u2019s throw\" from the hotels the Manisses and the Ocean View.\nAround 1890, the skating rink was converted to a live theater with a raked stage. Soon the Empire started showing silent films, and then \"talkies.\" The theatre continued operating over the summers as both a cinema and occasional playhouse until it was closed and condemned in 1986.\nOriginal 1880s sign advertising roller skating at the Empire.\nGary Pollard, the current owner, purchased the derelict building in 1992 and completed a number of large renovations. After a seven year slumber, the theater opened its doors under Pollard\u2019s stewardship in 1993. \n\"Today the Empire stands as a one of the very few classic rustic movie theaters remaining in the United States.  She still serves as an anchor on Water Street and also as a proud example of historic preservation at its finest.\" \nBlock Island Historical Society \nCatching bubbles from our bubble machine.\nVisit our website for more historic photographs and information about the Empire Theatre:     www. empiretheatreblockisland.com\n Frequently Asked Questions of the Empire Theatre Kickstarter Campaign\n1. Question: If the project is not fully funded, will I get a refund? Answer: When you make a pledge of support, your credit card isn\u2019t charged until Labor Day when our campaign ends, and only if we reach our goal of raising $55,000.\n2. Question: Why should I support a for-profit business?\nAnswer: We believe that we are part business, part community service, part historic preservation society. All upkeep of the 130-year-old building, all historic landmark renovations such as hand painting the original ticket booth, all preservation of artifacts such as original posters and signage for display, are the burden of the owner. Due to this excessive overhead, and also due to the very short season on a remote location, we have difficulty keeping the business open. We think the community has to decide what having a historic theater on their island is worth. Kickstarter does not normally accept small businesses, but it does support independent theaters for these reasons.\n3. Question: Don\u2019t you make a lot of money on a $12 adult ticket?\nAnswer: Theater owners have to send the film distributors half \u2013 or sometimes more than half \u2013 of what we get in ticket sales.  Profits also come from concessions. Which is why we ask that you do not bring your own snacks and drinks into the theater, but people regularly do. One couple had a pizza delivered to the theater for themselves! The staff intercepted it and ate it.\n4. Question: What exactly are you going to buy with this money? Answer: There are four companies making industry approved, state of the art digital projectors. We have researched them all and are ready to purchase one when we have raised the needed funds.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks and challenges surrounding the digital transition are minimal as we have done extensive research on the equipment and installation process.

If you haven't, you're not the only one.\nClick on the trailer below and see the first step in correcting history! Then join us and be part of history yourself by helping to make this film!\nThe year is 1895. A new technology called the \u201cmechanical pencil\u201d is patented, the first comic strip is printed in a newspaper, and photography is the talk of the town. This is the dawn of the modern era, and there are no limits to what the future holds. Major innovations in technology change the way people live, work, travel, dress, communicate, and the way they are entertained. \nIn Paris, the Lumi\u00e8re Brothers have one of their first private screenings of their revolutionary Cin\u00e9matographe, the first reliable system to project moving images. A small group of friends and colleagues, including engineer and industrialist L\u00e9on Gaumont, watch in awe the soon-to-be famous footage of workers leaving a factory. Cinema is born. \nThere is a young woman in the audience. Her name is Alice. She is 23. She is secretary to L\u00e9on Gaumont. She experiences the light and shadows of the flowing sequence of images on the screen as more than a technological wonder. She sees life. She sees stories. She sees the future. \nAlice Guy (after her marriage known as Madame Blach\u00e9 and after her divorce as Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9) went on to make one of the first narrative films ever made. By her own account, she made it in 1896 (some say before Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s). \nAnd she kept going. She made one of the first films ever with a close-up, created synchronized sound films as early as 1902, was in good part responsible for the birth and growth of the Gaumont film studio in Paris, France, which she ran for almost a decade (1897-1907), and in 1910, she founded, built, and ran her own studio, Solax, first in Flushing, New York, then in Fort Lee, New Jersey (not far from where Edison and D.W. Griffith worked). She was a wife and a mother. She wrote, directed, or produced more than a 1,000 films over her 20-year-long career. \nThen it all ended. Her name disappeared from film history, and her legacy vanished into the shadows. \nA pioneer in the movie industries of both France and the U.S., an innovative filmmaker with a career spanning 1896 to 1920, director, screenwriter, producer, studio owner, CEO, entrepreneur (as well as wife and mother). If she had done only one of these jobs in the earliest years of cinema, it would have been enough to win her a firm place in cinema history. This feature documentary sheds new light on the many accomplishments of Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9, a woman you ought to know.\nAlice Guy was the first female film director. She would become the first female movie studio owner, and one of the most prominent filmmakers in the industry, making her one of the highest paid women in the U.S. \nHow could such an important figure in the birth of cinema be unknown to us? \nSo we, filmmakers Pamela Green and Jarik van Sluijs, had a case, a real detective story. We decided to search for answers. We\u2019ve discovered surprising new information as we began our research and interviews. It turned into a feature documentary in-the-making about Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 and the birth of cinema \u2013 Be Natural.\nAfter two years of research, which has taken us all around the country and the world, both physically and virtually, we have new findings, greater than those we could ever have imagined: print and audio interviews with Alice herself, old family 8mm films, recordings, photos, scrapbooks of clippings collected by Alice\u2019s stars, letters in her own hand. We have discovered and translated French documents, found rare correspondence written by Alice in English that brings new insight into the story. It seems that the more we dig up, the more we are led to new clues, and as each clue leads us to another, it recasts our understanding of an earlier discovery. Our feature documentary will include this new material, much of it seen or heard here for the first time. \nThe early filmmakers were explorers. Like Columbus, Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 had to navigate through many unknowns, but through experimentation, determination, and vision, she reached new shores. What was it that made her who she was? What drove her, inspired her, propelled her imagination? And what or who made her disappear from history? And, especially, why?\nIt was an exciting era, and Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 was one of its most creative forces. For Alice, the camera, film, the projector, and the Chronophone sound system were all new technologies, and the rules for how to use them had not been written. For us, witnessing the digital imaging revolution \u2013 YouTube, Instagram, Vine, and many other new technologies \u2013 the rules continue to be newly written.\nWhat did it mean to work with pioneering technologies at the end of the 19th century? What does it mean to work with pioneering technologies of the 21st century? What can we learn from this film pioneer as she found new ways to visually tell new stories? Over 100 years later, and in so many ways, we are again at the frontier \u2013 looking at fast-paced change and facing many of the same challenges. \nBe Natural will be both grand and personal. Grand, because to tell the story of Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9, the director, is to tell the story of film, and to tell the story of film is to tell the story of the modern world. Personal, because of the amazing materials we have found which will allow us to tell her story through her own words. Imagine, she was born before electric light was invented; lived through two world wars, saw the invention of television, and died in New Jersey in 1968 while the U.S. was at war with Vietnam. \nWhen Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 directed actors \u2013 many of whom had never seen a film camera before \u2013 she advised them to \u201cBe Natural.\u201d As she recalled in an interview, she had signs saying that in her Solax studio.\nAlice Guy-Blach\u00e9's story is unique and fascinating. It is also telling of the history of cinema\u2019s first decades. Still, you may ask, \"What makes this documentary so special?\u201d The answer is in our approach. Everything from the way we've done the research to the way we will recreate Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9's world graphically, using VFX (3D modeling, compositing, and animation), to the manner in which we will edit the film, is designed to put ourselves and you in Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9's shoes. \nBut how do we tell the story of someone who was born more than 100 years ago? We have found extensive historical material including photos, films, diaries, scrapbooks, letters, and publications. Also, because Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 wore many hats throughout her career, we decided to ask our film industry colleagues, who today write, direct, produce, design, light, shoot, edit, and distribute, to help us understand the making of Alice's films. Through their experience and knowledge of their craft, we are able to tell Alice\u2019s story and also highlight the relation of present to past. Most of the interviews will be shot on the Canon C300. \nThe trailer, although not the film itself, visually suggests our stylistic approach to this amazingly rich subject matter. The film will boast 2D and 3D CGI recreations of the locations, technologies, objects, and settings of Alice's story. This is not to say that this will be a VFX film. CGI is simply one of the many tools we are comfortable with, and we will be mixing it with a multitude of other media. This includes stock stills and footage combined with recently discovered assets, such as nitrate film (to be transferred and restored), 8mm film, video, slides, and other photographic materials. All this supports the themes of mysteries to be investigated and understanding of the many controversies surrounding this remarkably creative woman.\nIn Be Natural we will continue to enhance the graphic approach we have perfected in previous projects such as The Kingdom, 42, and Bhutto, for which we were nominated for an Emmy as co-producers, and the mini-documentary sequences for VH1\u02bcs Soul Divas: History of Soul Music. Our aesthetic approach will be guided by the look and feel of the turning point between the Belle \u00c9poque and the early 20th century filtered through a modern lens.\nIn short, we aim not just to look back at Alice\u2019s past, but to stand next to her and look into her future \u2013 our present. \nWe are Pamela Green (director) and Jarik van Sluijs (co-director), the founding partners at PIC Agency, an audio-visual communications studio focused on entertainment and motion design based in Los Angeles, California. We have designed and produced a variety of cutting-edge content for motion pictures, television, and commercials, and we are known for our innovative and memorable main title sequences for feature films like The Bourne Supremacy, Fantastic Four, The Illusionist, Cloverfield, The Kingdom, Sex and the City, Twilight, Push, Surrogates, The Cabin in the Woods, The Muppets, Red Dawn, G.I. Joe: Retaliation, Now You See Me, Fast & Furious 6, 42, and many others. We often combine archival images, audio, CGI animation, and editing into gripping and entertaining stories. We attribute our success to our never wavering focus on story. \nWe've got the support and participation of some amazing people!\nExecutive Producer Robert Redford \u2022 Narrated by Jodie Foster\nAnd the participation of Marc Abraham \u2022 Dino Everett \u2022 Alison McMahan \u2022 Cheryl Hines \u2022 Anastasia Masaro \u2022 Marc Wanamaker \u2022 Diablo Cody \u2022 Peter Decherney \u2022 Valerie Steele \u2022 Julie Delpy \u2022 Lorenzo Di Bonaventura \u2022 Senator Loretta Weinberg \u2022 Alan Williams \u2022 Chris Horak \u2022 Anand Tucker \u2022 John Bailey \u2022 Catherine Hardwicke \u2022 Peter Billingsley \u2022 Neil Hunt \u2022 Sir Ben Kingsley \u2022 Wayne Kramer \u2022 Julie Taymor \u2022 Marquise Lepage \u2022 Kevin Macdonald \u2022 James Bobin \u2022 Vadim Perelman \u2022 Julie Anne Robinson \u2022 Floria Sigismondi \u2022 Joan Simon \u2022 Terry Lawler \u2022 Frederik Du Chau \u2022 Bobby Cohen \u2022 Stephanie Allain \u2022 Jean-Michel Frodon \u2022 Jane Gaines \u2022 Anne Fletcher \u2022 Anthony Slide \u2022 Cecile Starr \u2022 Howard Cohen \u2022 Jon Chu \u2022 Drake Stutesman \u2022 Maxine Haleff \u2022 Vanessa Schwartz \u2022 Ava DuVernay \u2022 Elsie Fisher \u2022 Susan Constantine \u2022 Mark Stetson \u2022 Richard Abel \u2022 Kevin Stitt \u2022 Tom Meyers \u2022 Cari Beauchamp \u2022 Robert Dassanowsky, and the list keeps growing!\nWe need your help to take this project to the next level, the first rough cut. \nTo achieve this, we are raising funds through Kickstarter to complete our research, and specifically to see all of existing Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9's films. Her films are in archives spread all over the world \u2013 France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Sweden, Holland, Great Britain, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and the U.S. They are in all different formats from nitrate to film to video. We need funds to find the right footage, preserve and/or copy it, and then obtain the rights, so we can include them in our documentary.\nAs more and more of Alice\u2019s films are being discovered and identified, we need funding to see these films so that you can see some of her innovations within our documentary. With your invaluable help we can put Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 back in history and onto the main stage of our collective imagination!\nThough we are making this film in the most economical way possible, and many people have already given of their time and services gratis, the shooting, editorial, and VFX needed to create the 1890s-1920s world are expensive. This comes as no surprise in making a feature documentary. \nThe rough cut will get us one step closer to placing Alice\u02bcs story back where it belongs, next to that of the greatest figures of early cinema!\nIf you've seen our Kickstarter video, the trailer for the film, and the list of those who have offered their help and guidance, you're probably asking yourself, \u201cWhy do they need my money if they've got all these big names involved, and the encouragement of so many in the film industry?\u201d \nIt's simple. We cannot get funding in Hollywood for a film of this nature.\nSadly, this is not the type of project that easily gets traditional Hollywood funding, nor is it the type of film that qualifies for most of the typical educational grants. Hollywood funding doesn't usually go into beautifully made documentaries; educational grants don't allow for this kind of ambition and entertainment value. This is a passion project for all of us involved, and it is through passion that we've been able to pull the favors from those in the industry so far.\nWE NEED YOUR HELP TO GET THIS STORY TOLD!\nWe have built a reputation in our field, and through it have built friendships and followers that are helping us tell Alice's story. We have the best in the business giving us their time, helping us, guiding us, and rooting for us \u2013 rooting for Alice. Understandably, we have maxed out our favors, and now we're asking you, and your families, and all your friends to get us over the finish line!  \nTo thank you for joining us on our journey in telling Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9's incredible story, we have created lots of goodies! We know you don\u2019t really need more stuff, but these are tokens of thanks and ways you will help us carry forward and spread the word of Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 \u2013 a woman whom people have to know! \nDepending on the amount you decide to pledge, we have some great rewards, including an exclusive Be Natural Postcard, a limited edition Be Natural teaser poster, the already popular first edition Be Natural T-Shirt, a second T-Shirt we're calling \u201cSave Alice,\u201d a bumper sticker, pin, dog or cat collar, tote bag, pen, baseball cap, iPhone case, coffee/tea mug, water bottle, notebook, beret, charm bracelet, scarf, tie, and bow tie! \nIf you pledge $1000, we will send you everything from \u201cAlice Collection\u201d! \nAgain, no matter the amount you can afford, by backing this project you become a part of it, and we are extremely grateful to you for helping us place Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 back in history!  \nWe are looking forward to keeping you posted on our progress, and hope you will choose to be part of this journey! \nLike us on Facebook \u2013 facebook.com/BeNaturalMovie\nFollow us on Twitter \u2013 twitter.com/BeNaturalMovie\nFind us on Vimeo \u2013 vimeo.com/benatural\nVisit us at \u2013 benaturalthemovie.com\nAnd here \u2013 picagency.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt took us more than two years to get where we are in telling Alice's story.

Last year we filmed about 30 roleplaying game sessions, and one of those stood out above the rest as a session with a clearly cinematic story. What\u2019s unique and exciting about this project is that the screenplay is an adaptation of a story and characters created through roleplaying.\nDon\u2019t play roleplaying games but like dark tales? You\u2019ll love this film, too! It contains bitter family rivalries, unexpected betrayals, a nasty and manipulative villain, lies and deceit, and perhaps a horrifying hanging...or two. For fans of dark works, it\u2019s delicious! Naturally, this project only succeeds if what we create is appealing to someone who doesn\u2019t care at all about games. If you\u2019re a film buff, it\u2019s crucial we create a work you find compelling on its own merits, and we believe we can do just that.\nI'm intrigued! Tell me more...\nThe game that launched the tale was Fiasco, but the game was played in a dramatic fashion instead of a more common comedic way. The players included Ben Robbins, the designer of Microscope, and Seattle-based story gamers Caroline Hobbs, Jerome Vernich, and Pat Kemp. We\u2019ve completed a screenplay adaptation of this gaming session, and we\u2019ve brought together a talented film crew to put this project together.\nCaroline Hobbs and Ben Robbins in the Fiasco game session that inspired this film.\nWhen completed, The Devil Walks in Salem will be a \u201clong short film,\u201d roughly 30 minutes in length. We will film it in Washington State using local cast and crew. So, if you\u2019re local to Seattle and you\u2019d like to actually be in the film, it includes an \u201cangry town mob\u201d scene where Kickstarter backers who select that level of pledging get to yell \u201chang her!\u201d or \u201cburn the witch!\u201d and join the fun by wearing period costumes!\nAs another part of this project, we\u2019ll finish a documentary on story gamers, plus we\u2019ll put together footage of the entire Fiasco game session so serious gamers can watch the actual game play out\u2014I know it sure upped my game to watch these talented story gamers in action. We\u2019ll also provide a transcript of the game that inspired the screenplay alongside the shooting script so you can see precisely how the game was adapted to the screenplay. Further, we\u2019ll have bonus interviews with the cast as well as with Ben Robbins, who organized the game, and designer Jason Morningstar, who will share his reaction to how his game, Fiasco, was adapted to an unusually dramatic style.\nWhat is Fiasco?\nFiasco is a roleplaying game designed by Diana Jones Award winner, Jason Morningstar. Traditional roleplaying games tend to focus more on mechanics and the accumulation of power through gold, magic items, and \u201cleveling up.\u201d Fiasco is a game where the emphasis is on story creation. Fiasco also shuns the traditional notion of requiring a game master; the players collaborate with one other to create a wholly original story, and the mechanics are focused around rights of narration.\nFiasco, by Jason Morningstar\nWhy Kickstarter?\nUsing story games to develop a script is a new concept, and community-based funding allows us to explore this idea of merging story games with cinema. So, with your help, we can afford to hire the cast and crew to make this the best film possible.\nCome join us in making the dream of creating a movie out of an exciting gaming session a reality.

Not only will you receive cool rewards for joining our little filmmaking \u201cclub,\u201d you\u2019ll know that without you, this film would never have been produced.\nWhile I believe this project will be well-received by the gaming community, I also hope it will help make roleplaying games more accessible to those who are curious about what happens in the basements of gamers around the world. In other words, I hope we provide a showcase for what roleplaying is all about.\nWhether you\u2019re a film buff or a gamer, I hope this project inspires you as much as it inspires me.\nVision for the Future\nI\u2019ve enthusiastically played roleplaying games since 1978. I merged this passion with my career in 1990 when I founded Wizards of the Coast and authored that company\u2019s first product, The Primal Order, a treatise on mythology in gaming. Then in 1997, we acquired TSR, the publishers of Dungeons & Dragons, and I had the opportunity to publish D&D 3.0, one of the most successful D&D editions of all time. During the last decade, I\u2019ve taken a deep dive into expanding my passion into story games.\nYet one thing that\u2019s always troubled me about roleplaying games is that the experience is ephemeral. Just last night (at the time of this writing), I was dining with some local gamers, and Ryan Macklin described an incredible session he had played recently, which led to us discus how roleplaying experiences can never be adequately shared with others. Wil Wheaton, Zak Smith, and others, including me, have explored this by filming roleplaying sessions, which is great but is greatly limited by the patience of the audience for watching what Jeff Grubb calls, \u201cTwenty minutes of excitement crammed into four hours.\u201d\nPerhaps the desire to share memorable roleplaying experiences could be addressed (albeit to a limited extent) through screenplay adaptations? This is the underlying question I want to address with this this film and with future projects.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough I\u2019m relatively new to filmmaking, this isn\u2019t my first film production since graduating from film school.

Rocketmen were intended to combat the threats of tomorrow.  If those threats never arrive, what purpose will they serve? Who do they save now? Rocketmen want to know: are you in peril?\nWPA Poster Featuring Rocketmen\nThe Rocketmen are a fraction of a splinter in the body of the Federal Budget. The contemporary remains of a WPA jobs program, the Department of Municipal Rocketry employs men (who are maybe not employable anywhere else) to wear hydrogen-fueled rocket packs and spend their days on city rooftops, awaiting any peril that might befall the city. There is a lot of waiting. In the old days, there was the threat of Russians to battle and 50-foot robots to contend with. Now, they rescue cats, detain illegal skywriters, and start the occasional roof fire. Some of these Rocketmen haven\u2019t flown since their training session. Mostly, they kill time waiting for the emergency phone to ring, which never happens. Until one day, when it rings.\nOne of these rockets could be yours.\nOur series adventure begins when an emergency actually transpires; one newbie rocketman doesn\u2019t follow protocol and ... things go badly. What follows are a series of adventures as the rocketmen attempt to stay one step ahead of the FAA while they fight to clear their name. A motley group rarely called upon to do much of anything, they must rise to the challenge and use all their resources to prevent their department from being maligned (and likely cut entirely). They rescue people from modern urban peril, uncover a vast underground government bureaucracy, face monsters from their past, and suffer prolonged hydrogen narcosis while standing alone against the surprise enemy they were actually created to defend us from. This time, when the city is threatened, will they be ready?\nBen Laurance as Trenton and Ray Tagavilla as Quinn\nAbout the Artists\nWebster Crowell (Writer/Director) is an animator and filmmaker with over 15 years professional experience in Seattle.

This KickStarter is to enable the completion, printing, and release of a brand new edition of this classic* comedy role-playing game. \n*(Classic status not confirmed)\nJust a few of the over 30 ready to play Character Stereotypes available.\nTales From The Floating Vagabond is a tabletop role-playing game of High Adventure and Low Comedy, where all the tropes, standards, and cliches we've grown to love so well are dusted off, given a shiny polish, and then smashed into little bits and sprinkled over a great big bowl of cosmic oatmeal... Sorry that wasn't very good. I was going for \u201cinspiring metaphor\u201d but I only have the budget for \u201ctortured simile.\u201d\nAnd that's why I'm on KickStarter! To raise the funds to bring a newer, bigger, better, funnier edition of Tales From The Floating Vagabond to life.\nPreliminary Mock-up of the cover.\nYeah, but just what IS a Floating Vagabond? And why are there Tales coming from it?\nThat is a very good question. Followed by a pretty stupid one.\nThe Floating Vagabond is a bar built into an asteroid at the center of its universe. The owner of the bar, Hawk Luger (call him \"Spit\"), installed a Walker Random Dimensional Portal Generator on the door, and now, whenever someone walks into a tavern, pub, gin-joint, or speakeasy in any universe, at any time (past, present, or future), on any world, there's a chance they could end up walking into the Floating Vagabond.\nOnce these folks arrive, an unreasonably large percentage of them wind up embroiled in ridiculous adventures involving gratuitous explosions and acts of desperate derring-do.\nArithon Kincaid, Adventure Broker. Also, broke adventurer.\nSo it's a game of Drunken Inter-Dimensional Hi-jinks?\nWhat? No, of course... Yeah, that's pretty much exactly what it is.\nIn Tales From The Floating Vagabond (TF2V for short), you can Swing Nasty Pointy Things With Panache, Shoot Really Big Guns, or Belch For Effect.\nThe rules have been greatly streamlined from their original form, and now, nearly anything can be accomplished with a single die roll. TF2V uses a sliding scale of dice for difficulty, from d4 for the easiest task, the d100 for super-heroic-you've-got-to-be-kidding-me-what-are-you-smoking challenges.\nMan, his dad is gonna throw an OdinSnit when he see's what he did to the flowerbeds.\nAdditionally, characters in TF2V  have Shticks, comedic special effects that can fold, spindle, or mutilate the Laws of Physics. From the Flynn Effect, guaranteeing that you always have something to swing from, no matter where you are; to the Elfman Effect, providing stirring background music to give you a morale boost or an occasional warning; or even the Harpo Effect, which allows you to neatly fit anything up to the size of a Howitzer in your trenchcoat.\nTF2V is a game of Epic Adventure and Pervasive Slapstick, in a universe where the Laws of Physics have better things to do.\nSo Just What Can We Get For Helping Out?\nHey! Another question!\nYou might have noticed that there's something called Build-a-Brawl listed among the earlier rewards. What is Build-a-Brawl? It's a printable cardstock figure collection that you can use with TF2V or any other game you like. The first 8 sets were created using art by Vicky Wyman from the first edition of the game. With all-new art by Scott Lincoln, there are 5 more sets that will be coming along with the new edition. If you want to see what the Build-a-Brawl sets look like, take a look here.\nThe most obvious physical reward is the actual book itself. The original TF2V book was a 96 page softcover that was plagued with problems with its binding (many people actually thought the game came with a very thin Bartender's Screen screen (for those who were unaware, \"Bartender\" is what we call Game Masters in TF2V).\nThis new version is coming in at close to 264 pages, with a casebound hardcover binding, with full color art throughout.\nAt the higher levels, the actual Bartender's Screen becomes available. Printed on hardcover stock, this screen has a whole bunch of insanely useful charts and tables on the inside (for the Bartender's selfish use), and a gorgeous mural by the incredibly talented Scott Lincoln on the outside.\nSeriously, look at how beautiful that is!\nAt a slightly higher level, you get a set of custom dice. This set includes a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, d30, and a d% (tens place die).\n3.5 Inches by 3.5 inches, and drenched in love.\nThe coasters, in addition to being a handy place to set the drink of your choice, have the bright and attractive Floating Vagabond logo on one side, and a unique in-game bonus on the other.\nA mock-up of the official Floating Vagabond beer mug, as served, bashed, and thrown in the bar itself!\nThe beer mugs offered are sturdy 20 oz. mugs for the serious drinker, with the Floating Vagabond bar logo printed on them in full color.\nOrdering From The Menu\nHey, look! We have add-ons! Some of the extras we are offering will be available for you to add to your pledge. More will be available as stretch goals are reached. For now, If you have pledged at the Soaked level or higher, you can add extra Official Floating Vagabond Beer Mugs to your order, so that you can serve up tasty beverages of your choice to all your Patrons (that's what we call Players).\nPlus, if you're just dying for an adventure or six to drag your patrons through, you can add one of the Classic TF2V adventure pdfs to your order for only $3 per adventure, no matter what your level.\nThere are six classic adventures to choose from:\nBar Wars\nThe Reich Stuff\nThe Adventure Without a Name\nHypercad 54, Where Are You?\nThe Cosmic Paternity Suit\nWhere's George?\nAdd-Ons Available:\nOfficial Floating Vagabond Beer Mug - $12.00\nTales From The Floating Vagabond Classic Adventure pdf - $3.00\nThis Table will grow as we reach stretch goals.\nWhat's All This Ship?\nThere've been a few very good questions about the shipping situations, and I thought I'd make everything as clear as possible.\nThe standard pledge levels, those without the word \"International\" in the name, include shipping to anywhere in the United States. Adding the \"international shipping\" fees to those levels will be sufficient for shipping to Canada or Mexico. (It's a tad more, but I'm willing to eat it in the big picture).\nThe International levels include shipping anywhere in the world, and are not recommended for backers in the U.S., Canada, or Mexico.\nDo You Have Stretch Goals? And Does This Keyboard Make Me Look Fat?\nDo we have stretch goals?! Boy do we! And yes, yes it does.\nIf we reach $35,000 then everyone who pledges $65 or more will also get a pdf of a new adventure written by Matt Vancil, the writer behind The Gamers, The Gamers 2: Dorkness Rising, The Gamers 3: Hands of Fate, and JourneyQuest.\nIf we hit $56,000 then everyone who's getting a beer mug gets a matching shot glass. Plus, everyone at the $270 level and above gets their choice of one of two Inter-Dimensional Zero-G Bowling League shirts; the Floating Vagabond \"Gutter Bums\", or the Crane's Nest \"Assass-Pins.\"\nIf we hit $62,000 then everyone at the $65 level and above gets the pdf of the brand new sourcebook Pub Crawl, written by Ross Watson (of Dark Heresy, Rogue Trader, Deathwatch, Black Crusade, and Star Wars: Edge of the Empire fame).\nIf we hit $115,000 then everyone at the $90 level and above gets the extremely limited Pirate Ninja Monkey plush!\nThe prototype of the Pirate Ninja Monkey Plush.\nIf we reach $120,000, then everyone who pledges $65 or more gets a pdf of a TF2V / Shaintar crossover adventure written by Sean Patrick Fannon!\nThere are more to come, but lets see how close we can get to these, first.\nAnd finally, don't forget to share the love; check out  http://kickingitforward.org and see what other deserving projects are out here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am a full-time game designer with a solid background in delivering projects.

Y\u2019know, I pitched this idea to Lee (me writing monthly updates for the KickStarter) for mostly selfish reasons. Like many, I was frustrated by the lack of information concerning the completion and release of a game that I had paid for three years ago. I also wanted to make sure work was actually being done on the project and that it would actually reach completion. Finally, I wanted to see if it could improve the outlook of the backers. Perhaps if we had a clearer glimpse into Lee\u2019s life, we would be more accepting of the delay. I want to focus on the creation of this project. We are all aware of the challenges Lee has been facing. But this is business, right? I want to hear about how the project is progressing, and so my goal is to focus on . In the last month Lee has been navigating governmental agencies that would put Red Tape Square to shame, along with battling sickness and fighting to keep a roof over his head. I have been there. When you\u2019re unwell and broke, the social safety net we have in this country is sparse and impossible to navigate in a timely manner. It\u2019s like discovering a time bomb in a library and being told to \u201chush\u201d every time you try to shout a warning. You feel unloved and invisible, your basic attempts at staying alive are pushed off with 90 day waiting periods and impossible co-pays. Imagine dealing with this in addition to serious health issues, all while attempting to write comedy. Well, that\u2019s what Lee is doing right now. And backers: I am proud to say that we are making progress. We can stick a fork in , because it is done! Regardless of the myriad issues we know Lee is facing everyday, he is moving forward to complete this game! During one of our extreme digressions in our talk this month, Lee told me about a concept called the \u201cmonkey sphere.\u201d To quickly sum up and get it wrong: this concept states that monkeys in the wild have a sphere, or collection of peers, that they care about and protect. The more successful monkeys have larger spheres, many monkeys make light work. So let\u2019s include Lee in our monkey sphere because there are things we can do to help. I\u2019m calling it the Monkey Sphere of Destiny, and there are things you can do to help. I hope by now you have spread far and wide word of Lee\u2019s GoFundMe page (). These donations have helped Lee to stay alive and keep his apartment for a while longer. In addition to that, tell fellow gamers and your local game store to check out ()! It\u2019s receiving solid reviews on Amazon, and the sale of every deck goes to Lee in addition to freeing up a 3 by 5 inch area in his living room! Lee has also told me how much our stories and good wishes mean to him. I guarantee progress next month if every backer who can afford it sends Lee positive energy in the form of a story of a beloved Vagabond character or campaign. It\u2019s that simple. Lee is in the trenches of life right now, and he needs the support. You\u2019ve given him money, you\u2019ve told people about his project, what else can you do? \u201cSend positive energy, brother.\u201d - Hulk Hogan (probably)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #54", "update_userinfo": "Enjoy the Con!", "update_content": "For this update, Superfan Sean Ellis has once again stepped up in a big way to keep everyone informed.

I am a magician and I need your help!  Don't worry, I am not trapped in a box; quite the opposite in fact.\n\nI have several ideas I would like to put on Kickstarter, from trivia games and joke books, to magic kits and even a big box product.  I have so many crazy ideas it was difficult to decide on what project to do first, but in the end I decided to start with my childhood passion for mazes.\nMy interests vary from pop-up books, clean jokes, mazes, and optical illusions to strange trivia, science, and of course puzzles and magic, but it can all be boiled down to two words: \"Fun\" and \"Wonder\".\n\nMost of my anticipated projects combine both of these elements, and this one is no exception.  The project is simple: I will draw 52 unique mazes, each in the design of a playing card or poker card.  Every card is a maze that can be solved on its own going from corner pip to corner pip, plus the entire deck becomes one big maze going from card to card like a choose your own adventure book.\nThis is not a deck of cards themed to look like a maze.  This is 52 mazes, each drawn around a different playing card.  Every card can be solved on its own going from either corner pip you wish to the opposite one.  This makes it so that there is no backwards - some people try to solve mazes backwards because they are \"easier\", but not my mazes.  Each one is designed to be equally challenging both ways.\nBut wait, there's more...  Add the two jokers (featuring special guest boajes - more on that later) and now you have one big maze starting at one joker and ending with the other.  This maze takes you from card to card.Now, instead of working form pip to corner pip, you start at either corner you like and work your way to one of the center icons indicating your next card.\nFor example, you would start on the joker with the S and as you can see it has several paths, some ending in dead ends and others taking you to new cards.You might choose to go to the 2 of Diamonds and there you start at either corner you like and then find your way to the center. This takes you to the 6 of Spades and from there you would go to the 3 of Clubs where again you have a choice, and so on until you make it back to the joker with the F (for Finish) and make your way to the broken lightbulb.\n\nSome cards that have more than one option will lead you to dead ends, and others will result in an endless loop.  Your job is not only to navigate the mazes, which now use different paths than the 52 individual mazes, but to figure out what cards you should go to and what cards you should avoid.\n\nOh yeah, and if you like you could use the cards for card games or magic tricks.  But don't ever forget they are mazes that look like cards, not cards that look like mazes.\n\nI am doing all the artwork myself so the funding is all going to set up fees, printing, and shipping. \n\nI have drawn a handful of cards already and will draw more as the funding progresses.\n\nI will post updates every few days and occasionally with cards as I draw them \u2013 and I plan on drawing a card or two a day for the duration of the funding.\nThe cards will be printed by the US Playing Card Company on Bicycle stock with a magic finish.\nThe rewards are simple. You get the super fun deck of cards... I mean mazes, plus every backer will get a Kickstarter exclusive thank you maze as well.  And just for kicks, some of the higher backer levels have magic postcards included (you can read more about them in update #3).\n\nBy popular demand we have also added uncut sheets.This way you can have the entire maze right in front of you, or better yet on your wall. I do think this will look sharp as an uncut piece, if I do say so myself, as it serves a purpose.\n$15,000 - Backers $15 or higher get a FREE 3 month membership to TeachByMagic.com.\n$20,000 - Backers $20 or higher get a FREE jumbo playing card maze (original design).\n$40,000 - Blue Backed decks available to all backers $30 or higher\n$50,000 - Backers $50 or higher get a FREE pair of Mazing Dice (for a new Mazing experience).\n$70,000 - FREE Mazing  Magic Tricks booklet - Learn several easy to do card tricks you can do with any normal deck of cards (but they will look even cooler with a Mazing deck!) - FREE for all backers $50 or higher\n$100,000 - Limited Edition (Kickstarter Only) Mazing Deck\nThis will be a limited quantity exclusive deck with metallic ink.

Digital not as in DVD, but as in large drives with encrypted code and brilliant resolution. It\u2019s the new way people are watching motion pictures throughout the world, and its official name is Digital Cinema Package (usually known by its acronym, DCP).\n\nIt\u2019s a big change: the 35mm width was first used in 1892 by William Dickson and Thomas Edison using film stock made by George Eastman. Over more than 120 years, the format conquered the world; for a century Japanese, Indian, Australian, Russian and American films were all finished on 35mm. But times are changing; film distributors, studios and the makers of film stock are rapidly discontinuing exhibition on film. DCP has become the new standard by which films are shown. By 2014, DCP will be the all-but universal standard for films screened in the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s the most momentous technological change since the advent of sound in 1928. Change is coming quickly, and the message from the industry is clear: \u201cSwitch now or be left behind.\u201d Within a year, 85% of the films we show must be screened on the DCP format.\n\nNorthwest Film Forum needs your help to make this change, keeping our screens bright and our doors open!\nWelcome to Northwest Film Forum!\n\nWho We Are\nNorthwest Film Forum is truly a forum, where films can find audiences and filmgoers can meet filmmakers. Our mission is to discover and champion the work of great filmmakers, and to engage the general public and artists alike in deeper exploration of the art of film.  We screen more than 200 independently made and classic films every year, offer dozens of filmmaking classes (including summer camps for young people), and support filmmakers at all stages of their careers.\nOur smart, passionate audience members come from all walks of life to connect with our cinema programs.\nOur cinemas are lively, dynamic spaces that welcome more than 24,000 filmgoers every year to watch new, strange and beautiful films from every corner of the world. We show the best in American and international independent films, cinema classics, live musical scores and new performances that intersect with film. We host dozens of filmmakers each year from around the country and around the world. Panels, guest lectures and discussions add to the unique experience of our theaters. We serve independent artists and other local arts organizations by offering space for auditions, rehearsals and events. We work, for example, with the Seattle Lesbian & Gay Film Festival and the Deaf Spotlight Film Festival. We are a place for connection and for conversation about why cinema matters.\nOur members attend exclusive parties and screenings with giants of indie cinema.\nVisiting artists and instructors teach aspiring filmmakers at the Film Forum.\nThe youngest filmgoers and filmmakers enjoy the art of movies at our venue on Capitol Hill in Seattle.\n\nWhat we need\nWe're preparing to purchase the technology to convert to Digital Cinema, the new projection system that is sweeping the world. That\u2019s $50,000 for one theater, and that buys us:\n   \n\u2022    A Barco Integrated DLP Cinema projector (aka DP2K-10Sx)\n\u2022    A Server for storage and playback, a high-grade cinema lens, a spare xenon lamp. This unit is specifically designed for art house theaters our size.\n\u2022    A Universal projector pedestal, with a modular system that will allow us, on occasion, to still project 35mm films.\n\u2022    Ventilation and lamphouse cooling system in the projection booth.\n\u2022    A new port window cut into our projection booth to match DCP specifications.\n\u2022    Shipping, installation, and new cables.\n \nYou have questions? We have answers.\nOur amazing volunteers are the backbone of the organization.\nWhy has the cinematic world converted to DCP?\nConversion to a \u2018new\u2019 format is fueled by shifts in technology \u2013 your phone is probably a decent video camera, right? \u2013 and because making and shipping the new digital prints saves millions. The cost of replacing projection machines in cinemas, on the other hand, falls on individual theaters and exhibitors.\n\nWhat will happen if we don\u2019t add Digital Cinema at the Film Forum?\nAfter 2013, 85% of the films we currently screen will need to be shown on DCP, because Digital Cinema will be the only available format film distributors will offer. (We know, it\u2019s weird, given that there are perfectly beautiful prints of Pather Panchali out there, but those are the rules.) If we don't have the new technology in place we won\u2019t be able to show films.\n\nWhat is the time frame? Can\u2019t we wait for a few more years and see what happens?\nPutting off this challenge isn\u2019t an option; we have until the end of this year to make the transition before our access to most films is cut off.\n\nDon't we already own digital projectors?\nYes, but ours aren\u2019t built to decode, or accept, DCP, which is \u201cproprietary\u201d and plays only on approved gear. Bonus: the new system will project brighter film images than we have previously shown digitally (and our digital images have been pretty sharp).\n\nHow does Digital Cinema look?\nThe picture on the big screen is crisp and bold. Digital Cinema is a step forward into the future of visual presentation for new films (mainstream and independent alike). Plus, many older classic films are gaining new life after being digitally restored. Film purists will grieve the fading of 35mm, but this new system will feel sharp, and the visual and aesthetic experience will be potent.\n\nCan we just lease the equipment?\nThe \u201cleasing\u201d option available is \u201cfinancing\u201d by another name. We have explored distributors' plans to \"help\" theaters with the transition financially, but that option comes with strings, including mandates about what we will and won't screen. We care about the independence of organizations like ours that screen a huge diversity of new work and classic films, and have rejected this option.\n\nWhat happens to our current 35mm projectors?\nThey aren\u2019t going anywhere. Each year, a few new film prints will be made. Those very few prints will not be a reliable source for the movies we need to show to survive; however, we will hold onto our excellent 35mm film projectors and use them for special revivals. We\u2019ll show archival prints and classic movies on 35mm film.\n\nWant to learn more about our long-term plans?\nWe hope you'll join our community of film lovers and filmmakers.\nConversion to a Digital Cinema Package in our cinemas is part of an over-arching three-year renovation plan to upgrade our venue and our capacity in Seattle. Already King County\u2019s 4Culture as well as the Seattle Mayor's Office of Arts & Cultural Affairs and over 100 individual supporters have seen the value of this project and made generous donations for physical renovations to our lobby and our theaters.\n\nThe upgrade of our cinemas and lobby will complete work that was begun in 2004, when we moved into the current theater. We want to provide filmgoers and filmmakers alike with an inviting, state-of-the-art experience. Along with installing DCP, over the next three years we plan to:\n\n\u2022    Replace our street-level canopy with a marquee; install screens in our street-facing windows to showcase coming attractions and films we helped bring into the world.\n\u2022    Renovate our lobby: finish out our concessions stand, introduce a point-of-sale ticketing system, add seating, re-paint the walls.\n\u2022    Upgrade our four classrooms into state-of-the-art places to learn; they will be out-rigged with new wiring, screens and projectors, seminar tables, screens, carpets, white boards.\nHuge thanks to our team of volunteers and supporters who've helped make this Kickstarter campaign possible, including Amy Billharz, Bmann Photography, Elisa Huerta-Enochian, Charles Mudede, Pat Paquette, Nandan Rao, Jennifer Roth, Margaret Schuler, Lynn Shelton, Marcy Stone, Jessie Wilson and many more.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks and challenges surrounding the digital transition are minimal, as we have done extensive research on equipment manufacturers and integrators, and what will work best for our space.

(That's us!) It has been run out of our home since 1993. Over the years, we have self-published all kinds of things, including art prints, games, posters and comics--most notably, Girl Genius. We are being helped out with this KickStarter campaign, (our first, by the way) by Julie Haehn, who has worked with KickStarter before, most recently on Unexploded Cow and Deadwood from our friends at Cheapass Games. Also giving us advice and making us look good are James Ernest of Cheapass Games: who makes the best KickStarter videos on Teh Internets, and his wife Carol Monahan, once the Director of Sales & Logistics at Wizards of the Coast during the early hey-day of Magic: The Gathering and Vice-President of Cheapass Games.\nIf you haven't seen Girl Genius, you can read the whole thing to date on girlgeniusonline.com!\nWe started working on Girl Genius in 1993, began publishing it as a comic book in 2001, and took it online in 2005. We've won a bunch of awards, and never missed a webcomic update!\n\nWhat are we going to do with the money?\nWe're going to print and ship books.\nTo start with, Girl Genius Volume 12.\nPrinting the actual books is our biggest single expense. The first print run of a typical volume costs in excess of US$25,000. If that seems high, you must remember that we print eight thousand of them, and they usually run to around 120 pages. Our latest volume, number 12, will be even more expensive, as it comes in at 192 pages, and we\u2019ll be printing nine thousand of them, because eight thousand wasn\u2019t enough last time. Exciting? Yes, but one can\u2019t pay the printer with excitement.\nWe also have to ship the books. Actually, we have to ship them twice. Once from the printer to the fulfillment center, and once again from the fulfillment center to the customer. And whether a book is shrink\u2013wrapped with thousands of its friends onto a pallet and loaded into a truck, or carefully packaged for individual shipping, several thousand pounds of books cost serious money to transport.\n\nAfter we raise the initial goal, what do we plan to do?\nWe plan to make more books.\nWe'll start with Girl Genius Volumes 1 and 5, because those are the ones that are the most desperately out-of-print.\nTheoretically, one of the perks of being independent self publishers is that we can be reasonably certain that all of our books will stay in print. This is especially important with Girl Genius, since new readers discover the comic (and the joy of owning the actual books) every day. This last year, there\u2019s been a little more joy than we were prepared for. Several of the earlier volumes are currently out-of-print, with the rest careening toward the same status with worrying alacrity. We have already spent a few conventions sitting at our table feeling rather foolish at the lack of anything much to sell. Last time, we just broke out the tea things and had a little dealer's room tea party.\nStill, this is a bit of an opportunity for us! Our printer has said that the more books we print at the once, the better the deal we\u2019ll be able to get--and that includes multiple volumes.\nWe're also excited, because we've just finished outsourcing our warehousing and fulfillment to the super-competent folks at TopatoCo, who have assured us that under their supervision and superior inventory control, we will no longer be taken by surprise when our books threaten to slip out of print. Hooray!\nOnce we've got enough to print all our books, we want to hire a business assistant. We have lists of Girl Genius projects and fun merchandise we've been wanting to do for years, but don't have the time to oversee. We also know a very talented business person, Carol Monahan, who is good at getting things like this done. We've made our printing goals, and now we are hoping to make enough to hire her part-time to help us expand our tiny entertainment empire.\nAdd-ons!\nHere is how this works: \n Choose the pledge level of the highest price thing you would like (if you want a hardcover and a softcover, choose the reward for the hardcover level). \nIncrease your pledge level by the amount of the add\u2013on you would like to add! (You\u2019ve pledged $55 for the hardcover reward level and want the softcover as well, so you add $30 for a total of $85) \nAfter the Kickstarter is over, we will contact you personally to ask what you wanted for your extra contribution! This is the sort of thing that machines cannot yet do. Revel in it! \nHere is what you can currently add by increasing your pledge. (Please note that according to KickStarter's rules, we cannot sell you multiples of more than ten of any one item.): \n+ $8 - Winged Trilobite Patch\n+ $8 - UNLIMITED J\u00e4germonster Patch\n+ $8 - Wulfenbach Patch\n+ $8 - Sturmvoras Patch\n+ $8 - Pack of 3 Mimmoth patches\n+ $10 \u2013 Girl Genius Volume 12 PDF \n+ $10 \u2013 Travel Sticker set (3)\n+ $15 - Mechanicsburg Patch\n+ $15 - \"Lose your Hat\" Patch\n+ $20 \u2013 Medal (choice of silver or brass tone)\n+ $30 \u2013 Softcover (any edition in print. See the chart below.)\n+ $55 \u2013 Hardcover (of Volume 12 only, the others are all sold out.)\n\n\nWe will be adding more add-ons as we go, for instance:\nThe Stretch Goals:\nBook reprints, and more book reprints\u2026and FUN!\nYes, book reprints are boring. But that's what we need to do right now. Still, never fear, we're aware of this, and so we've been trying to think up ways to make our stretch goals more interesting for our supporters. We've got a bunch of them in mind, and will be releasing them as necessary. Here's what we've got so far:\n$70,000: We'll reprint Vol.1. Huzzah! We'll also make an unlimited-edition J\u00e4ger patch available for anyone to buy after the campaign. (It will be different from the limited-edition KS one.)\n$85,000: We'll reprint Vol. 11, and give all of our supporters at or above Hero of Science level digital copies of Girl Genius Volumes 1-3. EDIT: The PDF only level will get this too!\n$100,000: We'll reprint Vol.5, and release a short video starring Phil in his \"Mr. Hyde\" personality, demonstrating the use of our astonishing new orange peeler. (I do truly think you'll want to see this, I never get tired of it... --Kaja) EDIT: Also, supporters at the $30 level and above (that is, everyone getting a book) will get one signed bookplate! The bookplate will be signed by Phil and Kaja. We can't promise Cheyenne without begging first, but we'll get on that.\n$115,000: We'll reprint Vol.2, and give all of our supporters at or above Hero of Science level digital copies of Girl Genius Volumes 4-6. EDIT: The PDF only level will get this too!\n$130,000: We'll reprint Vol.3, and Professoressa Foglio will record a video lecture on the ornate and beautiful language of fans: with emphasis on the dialect used among the Sparks of Europa.\n$145,000: We'll reprint Vol.7, and give all of our supporters at or above Hero of Science level digital copies of Girl Genius Volumes 7-9. EDIT: The PDF only level will get this too!\n$160,000: We'll reprint Vol.4, and all of our supporters who are getting medals will also get this little insert for amusing customization:\n$175,000: We'll reprint Vol.8, and give all of our supporters at or above Hero of Science level digital copies of Girl Genius Volumes 10-12. EDIT: The PDF only level will get this too! (Also, I will totally post a picture of Phil with a pancake on his head in the next update.--Kaja) Edit: YES! WE HAVE ACHIEVED PANCAKAGE! Woot!\n$190,000: We'll reprint Vol.9, and we'll also be able to offer a winged trilobite patch to go with the J\u00e4ger insignia. As for posting a picture of someone with something on their head, I've been told it's my turn. To be the person with something on her head, I mean. I'll be away at Clockwork Alchemy all weekend, so you'd think I'd be safe, but it's a steampunk con held in conjunction with an anime con, so I really shouldn't have much trouble finding something to put on my head. If you're into that sort of thing. Oh, goodness, it's really early in the morning and I've been up all night, and now I have to go catch a plane.--Kaja\nEDIT: Well, I caught that plane, and got some sleep, and now it looks like I'll be spending the weekend finding something suitable to put on my head. Hmm...\n$205,000: We'll reprint Vol.10, and everyone will get a special make-your-own-box PDF kit. A box to put volumes 1-12 in would be cool. Steampunk DIY culture is cool. We'll create instructions for constructing your own special display box, and make fancy new box art that can be printed and used to decorate it. All our supporters will get a PDF with the instructions and art, and we'll post the results in our reader art section at girlgeniusadventures.com! (Also, I've been told to say that we'll put pancakes on our children's heads. I don't know why they're so insistent about this, I think they want to help. Or maybe they just want to make pancakes again?)--Kaja\n$220,000: We will faint from a surfeit of astonishment. (Don't worry, we'll keep a camera crew around to get it on film so we can post it online.) Then we'll get up and reprint Vol. 6. Kaja will dig through her files and put together a file of ALL of the old donation gift wallpapers for all of our KS supporters\u2013plus the new ones that she was getting ready to post when this KickStarter became necessary!\nHoly Cow. We actually have to come up with more stretch goals. We were kind of hoping to add \u201cPrint Buck Godot: Gallimaufry\u201d to the list, but it looks like Buck is probably not going to make it to this party. That\u2019s mostly because we still don\u2019t have a quote, and because really, if we do a separate KickStarter for Buck, we\u2019ll be able to offer Buck-themed rewards, and that will be awesome. Plus, unlike the Girl Genius collections, there\u2019s no way that Buck would be ready for ComiCon. Still, now that we\u2019ve got that ball rolling, we\u2019ll get it printed one way or another very soon, so look forward to a Buck Godot Holiday Season, at the very latest.\n$225,000: UNLOCKED! Everyone who is getting something flat (stickers or books) mailed to them will also get an \u201cautographed\u201d picture of Agatha! (That was a good suggestion, thanks!) (Everyone else will get a digital copy.)\n$230,000: UNLOCKED! Everyone at the Hero of Science level or above (and the .pdf only folks) will get a digital copy of the Girl Genius Secret Blueprints! \n$235,000: UNLOCKED! Printable PDF files of the Girl Genius ButtonMen game buttons (you\u2019ll need your own printer and button maker) will be added to the file of wallpapers that we\u2019ll post for everyone.\n$240,000: UNLOCKED! We\u2019ll be able to make more of Cheyenne\u2019s Tesla Rangers pins, maybe even in time for Comicon!\n$245,000: UNLOCKED! We'll add a Wulfenbach patch (That's the winged castle) to the add-ons.\n$250,000: UNLOCKED! We'll make a Sturmvoraus patch. (art to come soon!)\n$255,000: UNLOCKED! We'll post a picture of Julie with a pancake on her head. Hee! (Why is everyone so on board with this?)\n$260,000: We'll make an \"any plan where you lose your hat is a bad plan\" patch. (art to come soon!)\n$265,000: I'll add scans of our wedding invitation and program to the PDF bundle. Phil and I were married twenty years ago this October, and our wedding paperwork was done as minicomics!--Kaja\n$270,000: We'll make a City of Mechanicsburg Arms patch. (art to come soon!)\n$275,000: Cheyenne will record some ringtones for us as Othar Tryggvassen: Gentleman Adventurer!\n$280,000: In addition to the wallpaper PDFs, a PDF of select production sketches will be added to the digital pile.\n$285,000: Kaja will record some ringtones as Agatha, in both moderately sane and full-blown Spark mode!\n$290,000: Phil will record some ringtones as Castle Heterodyne. Wouldn't it be nice if your house could tell you when someone's on the phone?\n$295,000: We'll make little mimmoth patches! (Because Julie has requested them. Hee!)\n$300,000: We will release a set of J\u00e4germonster ringtones, starring a cast of us. Trust me, we won't have trouble thinking of silly things to say.\nAlso, at $300,000, we can hire Carol Monahan part-time. She's a smarty-pants business manager who can help us get some of our dream Girl Genius projects and merchandise made. She used to be the Director of Sales & Logistics at Wizards of the Coast during the early hey-day of Magic: The Gathering and Vice-President of Cheapass Games. What all our supporters will get for this, we're not yet sure, but at least there will be more really cool GG stuff out there! Also, she says she'll let us post a picture of her with a pancake on her head.\nWhoo hoo! Carol is onboard! WE ARE THRILLED! With her help we are building a few more stretch goals:\n$340,000: Carol's Minion Budget. This will be used to get us more help.\n$375,000: Website upgrade. We will be bringing on our friend and UX expert Ellen Beeman to do a usability study and help us make our web presence work better for you. \nThank you!\nPeople are always surprised when they find out just how small a company Studio Foglio really is. Kaja started it to make art prints of her Magic the Gathering card paintings, and writes along with Phil, as well as managing all the web thwacking and graphic design. Phil has provided most of the art throughout the years, and all the funniest parts of the stories! Cheyenne Wright and various other freelance digital painters add color. Various beloved (and underpaid) friends and relatives have served as part-time convention minions, e-mail heroes and box packing elves.\nFrom the beginning, we have been blessed with tremendous support and goodwill from our readers. We have always been thrilled and a bit surprised by this, and have tried to repay it by providing the best story we can, and by never missing an update.\nWe\u2019d like to ask you to renew that support now. Kickstarter has the potential to be an important help to us as we produce new books, and bring older works back into print.\nPlease support our KickStarter, follow our progress, and tell your friends!\nThank you!\n\n--Kaja and Phil Foglio and the Studio Foglio Team", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are some risks inherent in any project. This one doesn't hold much, we'll admit--we have the book ready, we just need to raise the funds, pay the printer and get it made. Our biggest risk is that we won't fund, and then we won't be able to get our book made, and then we won't have any books...oh dear.\n\nWorking with printers can be worrying, but we have a good relationship with ours. We have printed books with them for years.

Modern remake, with music arranged by Tibetan artists in Tibet, of the classical Central Tibetan song \"Dren Lu\"\nSpecial Reward For Donors! If we reach $4100, every donor will receive an mp3 download of Every song on the album plus the stretch goal extras! That means, 9 songs from \"Memories of the Vast Plateau\" and any extra music videos we finish. You can put them on your ipod, play them in the car, whatever you like! I really want to be able to make these extra videos, so this is my special thank you to all of you if we can make it there!\nEvery $600 increment after $4100: New videos featuring new music arranged by Tibetan artists in Tibet and featuring musical instrument performance by musicians in Nepal. Videos will be shot in Kathmandu and Mustang.\n$5000: Major equipment upgrade and major quality upgrade. I will even try to rent a crane.\n$7500: A full second album worth of music videos available for digital download at high quality for donors and lower quality for the general public.\n$10000: A full digital download for all donors and a DVD mailed to donors of $35 and up of the primary album, the full second album, behind the scenes footage, concert footage and some surprises!\nLet's see how far we can go!\nWho Am I:  My name is Amalia Rubin and I am a singer, songwriter and composer of modern Tibetan music, as well as a performer of traditional Tibetan music and instruments. I have three published solo albums of traditional and modern Tibetan music, as well as being featured on more than a dozen collaborative works and composing for artists in Tibet.  In 2007, I was awarded the Tibetan Music Award for 'Best International Artist' for my first album, 'Mountains and Deserts'. Music is my passion, and Tibetan music is my special love.  Despite the numerous difficulties in this industry, such as a very scattered and limited demographic, geographic obstacles and music piracy, I work hard to keep making music for myself and others.\nBelow: Namkha Tso in Tibet singing one of my compositions\nWhat's the Story: Last summer, I finished the music and recording for an album of modern interpretations of Tibetan folk songs: \"Memories of the Vast Plateau.\" This summer, I have the unbelievable opportunity to travel to Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Nepal, specifically Mustang, three of the most stunningly beautiful and unique locations on earth. The great Central Asian Steppe, the Gobi Desert, The Tibetan Himalayas, all in one summer. I spoke to a major Tibetan music video studio in Nepal and they agreed: we can make this happen. We can make this music video album this summer and we can make an album like none you've ever seen.\nThe final product will be a high quality DVD featuring 9 or more Tibetan folk songs from four different regions of Tibet accompanied by beautiful modern music made by artists in Tibet, and possibly Nepal if we decide to add more songs. The videos will showcase both the natural beauty of our shooting locations as well as the stunning cultures of Central and Inner Asia. Among our locations is Mustang, one of the last Tibetan Kingdoms in the world: A treasure nearly entirely closed off to foreign travelers.\nBelow: Traditional Tibetan song \"White Crane\"\nWhy This Album: This video will be the first of it's kind.  I've been working with Tibetan artists in Tibet, thus creating what may be the first collaborative Tibetan CD between artists inside of Tibet and artists halfway around the world.  It will be the first album showcasing the variety of inner asian nomadic cultures and landscapes, all of which are on the verge of immense change, and possibly even extinction. I hope that this will create interest in these cultures and bring a greater appreciation world wide.\nBelow: Early collaboration with Yeshe Senge in Tibet\nTibetan music is at a delicate point in its history.  Preserving traditional music, while precious, cannot stand to support the continuation of Tibetan music on its own, just as a museum exhibit can't.  At the same time, many fans of Tibetan music fear that the new popular music is too widely influenced by other cultures and that slowly, Tibetan music will die.  Parents and educators find themselves caught in the struggle to teach their children to appreciate traditional Tibetan arts when their children find the classical music boring and would rather listen to pop or hip hop.  It was with all of these concerns in mind that I decided to create this album.    I wanted to create an album that could fuse both traditional Tibetan music with modern emotion.  In order to achieve this, I turned to Tibetan artists in Tibet, the safeguards of Tibetan culture, gave them traditional Tibetan songs and no instructions other than \"make modern music that inspires you.\"  That is just what they did.  The result is thoroughly traditional and thoroughly Tibetan music, that is simultaneously new, modern and fresh.\nBelow: Amalia performing a modern Tibetan song, originally by Tsewang, in Tibet\nI hope to be part of the movement to keep Tibetan music fresh and exciting, whether traditional or new compositions, and I believe this album will be a part of that!\nHow will $3000 make a full album:\nMy travels were planned before this album.  A combination of work and school will be bringing me to Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia and Mustang, regardless of whether or not this album happens. As a result, travel funding is not an issue.  In addition, all of the music has already been arranged, recorded and mixed, taking out the large portion of costs.  The cover has already been designed and will only require minor changes to accomodate the DVD.\nFor the actual shooting, I will shoot some footage independently during my travels in Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan. The rest will be shot professionally in the Kathmandu valley, Lower and Upper Mustang in Nepal. All of the Nepal shooting, editing and mixing will be done by Alfa Studios, a renowned Nepali studio with a great deal of experience with Tibetan artists.\nThe shooting, editing, and mastering itself will cost between $1500 and $1750 dollars, depending on if I need to redo any sound when I'm in Nepal. Another $125 dollars will go towards transportation and housing costs to bring the camera crew to Mustang (yes, it costs nothing, that's part of why I'm doing it in Nepal.)  I'll be bringing my own costumes, and actors will largely be providing their own, but I've budgeted in another $500 for actor costs, including paying the actors at the higher end of the local expected salary, costumes, makeup, and refreshments for the set. I want to emphasize that these costs, including salary, are at the high end for Nepal, where the annual salary is roughly $1600. I will not be underpaying any of my actors or crew. \nThe remaining costs, roughly $700 or so dollars depending on fluctuations in other costs, will go towards the actual printing and distribution costs for Asia and shipping a box of DVDs back to the USA.\nIf we reach our goal, all of this will be a reality. If we go over the goal, it's even better: that means more songs, more music videos! And all of these extras will be available for free!\nWhat do you get for your donations? Even a one dollar donation will give you access to exclusive, donors-only content with photos and descriptions of the shoot. Other prizes include beautiful, fair trade (as best I can guarantee!) Tibetan crafts, copies of my CD, exclusive music videos and mp3 downloads that are not and will never be available on commercial CDs, private Tibetan music skype-lessons, and of course, the finished DVD itself.\nI'm excited about this chance to make a truly unforgettable album of Tibetan folk music in the 21st century, and I hope you will join me in making this dream a reality!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBiggest challenges we face are:\n\n1) Instability in Nepal- Nepal is not at the most comfortable point in its history and relationships with Tibetans are very tense. Fortunately, I'll be working with a team of video editors, cinematographers and directors with many years and dozens (if not hundreds) of albums worth of Tibetan and Nepali music and videos under their belts. They know the ropes and they've done this in far worse times than now. They say they can manage it and I trust them.\n\n2) Time- I will only be in Nepal, the location of the editing studio for 3 weeks. Of that time, about 10 days will be in Mustang, out of communication of the studio. This will mean I need to rush thing and keep a good schedule. Fortunately I have a lot of experience with working under strict time limits. In addition, I've worked remotely with this studio before to make music and I have friends who work for and in the studio. That means that if we run out of time, as long as the footage is shot, we can go forward with the editing. What if the footage isn't finished? I hear you cry. No worries! I'll continue shooting in India and send them the footage. In short: unless I get crushed in an avalanche, things will move forward.\n\n3) Language- I speak fluent Tibetan (so I'll be fine in Mustang) but no Nepali. Fortunately, the people at the studio speak good English and most of my actors are either Tibetan or speak English. Plus, in all locations, I have friends fluent in the local language and English. And this can't be any harder than the time I had to shoot 5 music videos in Tibet, in the dead of winter, while wearing a summer chuba outdoors with singers and camera men who only spoke Amdo-ke. I did that. I can manage this!\n\n4)\"Isn't Kyrgyzstan where the Tsarnaev brothers were from?\"- No. No it isn't.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "FINALLY PRINTING!!!", "update_content": "So, one of the things with working in other countries is the moment you LEAVE the country, your project goes to the bottom of their to-do list. \nBut I just got a phone call confirming the master DVD is being made and shipped out to me!!!!\nFINALLY!!!!!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "THE MASTER DVD IS COMING!!!", "update_content": "So, for any of you who have worked in studios in Nepal, you know what's been going on: the moment you leave the studio, trying to remain on schedule fails because the projects of people IN the studio supplant yours, even if your project was first in line. *grumblegrumble*.
