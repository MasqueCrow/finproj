[{"backer": "Patrick Thomas Mitchell", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Check out this awesome review from iGeeksBlog!\n   Follow us on Twitter @nixsensor\nCheck out our story on CHCH http://www.chch.com/grad-gets-grant/\nProduct\nNix is a patent pending device that allows anyone to become a color expert. Just grab Nix from your pocket, purse, or bag, touch it to an object and magically watch the exact color appear on your iPhone, Android, PC, or Mac. Once scanned, you can keep palettes of your favorite colors, match the color to real life pigments, and even receive directions to the nearest store where you can purchase the color.\nNix is perfect for interior designers, graphic designers, model makers, makeup artists, hobbyists, photographers, fine artists, crafters, hackers, makers, museum curators, painters, land lords, and even\u2026 engineers\u2026\nHelp support Nix and become a color expert today!\nOur Story\nWe first came up with the idea for Nix\u2122 while working with a few interior design friends. They thought that lugging around tote bags filled with paint decks was a huge pain in the butt and so did we! It\u2019s the 21st century! We didn\u2019t think it made a lick of sense that you should have to pay hundreds of dollars for a big bulky paint deck system that only worked with one company\u2019s paints. To make the situation worse, this expensive \u201csolution\u201d was still greatly affected by ambient lighting conditions and human error. We discussed the idea of a product that could solve all of these problems and everyone we spoke to in the industry thought it was a great idea, but it never really got past much more than a design on the back of a napkin until the next major milestone in our story. \nEarly drawings to final renders.\nA colleague of ours was doing incredible work at a local hospital with burn victims and patients with other severe skin disorders. Her business was to consult with patients and manually create custom makeup that perfectly blended with the patients\u2019 natural skin tones. Interestingly enough, at that moment she was actually looking for an accurate and inexpensive color sensor to remove the costly manual color matching routine from the procedure. It would revolutionize her business model while allowing her to help patients from all over the world. We thought this was a noble idea and it inspired us to start full time research and development on the product. There was just one problem: as recent engineering grads we didn't have the necessary funds to do the project justice. \nWe decided to apply for a R&D grant to help get the ball rolling. It was a grueling process as every last detail of our business plan had to be scrutinized by government analysts. After two months of revisions we finally secured the funds! It was a ton of work, but looking back it was worth it just to come out with such a rock solid business plan. The grant allowed us to hire our first employee and set us into motion working our asses off doing science.   \nA small selection of our prototypes.\nSix months after our initial funding, hundreds of Red Bulls, too many man tears, and countless prototypes later, the final Nix prototype that you see in this campaign was born. \nThe App\nCurrently Nix works with our development PC and we have built all the graphic assets for the iOS/Android application. We need to take the logic from the PC application and combine it with the graphic assets to finish the application.\nHere is a video of Nix working with our development PC for reference.\nThe application allows users to actually scan an object but the fun doesn't stop there.\nWith your backing we will be able to finish the app!\nIn the final version you will be able to:\nSave a scanned color to a swatch, with notes.\nView a color in RGB, HSL, HSV, Lab, XYZ, HTML, or CMYK.\nConvert the color to a multitude of media such as: interior wall paints, oil paints, makeup, watercolor, hobby paints, wood stain, automotive paint etc. \nAfter you have selected a particular media you can select a particular brand.\nGet directions to the nearest store where you can buy the paint!\nOur Mission/Values\nOur mission is simple: supply a cutting edge, intuitive, scientific grade instrument to anyone who wants to become a color expert.\nOur Team\nMatthew Sheridan\nMatthew Sheridan is a serial entrepreneur, sailor, and holds a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Mechatronics Engineering and Management.

They serve as an inspiring, expert resource for entrepreneurs.  They also foster connections across the community that accelerate growth for all.\nVentureStart\nThe VentureStart program helps technology entrepreneurs in Southern Ontario by providing access to Business Skills Training as well as Business Launch Support to enhance their ability to launch and grow a new start-up venture.\nWe would also like to thank:\nHamilton Invention Center\nWhy do we need the funding?\nManufacturing a hardware venture as advanced as Nix can become expensive.  Luckily our team\u2019s wealth of experience working on large nonprofit engineering projects helps us to keep costs down. Nonetheless, we still need to raise $35k to get this innovative product into your beautiful hands.\nHere is the breakdown:\n$9,500 for the molds, and the actual injection molding process.\n$5000 to optimize the PCB for maximum Bluetooth range, battery life, and manufacturability.\n$10,000 for the PCBs, components, and assembly.\n$2000 for the high energy density lithium polymer batteries.\n$3000 to professionally recode, and launch the app.\n$2000 for Kickstarter rewards above and beyond the actual product.\n$3500 for Kickstarter fees and payment processing fees (approx. 10%)\nSchedule\nThe next few months are going to be gruelling but we are used to this level of work and we are confident that we can stay on schedule.\nOct: Kickstarter Ends\nSelect winning quote to be immortalized on our production PCB.\nNov: Send out preliminary rewards (stickers and past prototypes)\nDec: We will make sure the PCB is optimized for lowest power consumption and best Bluetooth range by working directly with professional RF Engineers (from the manufacturers of the individual integrated circuits).\nOnce PCB is optimized we will send the PCB gerber files to be produced. We will use the same manufacturer we made the prototypes with as we are comfortable with them and they have done a very good job in the past.\nWe will also optimize our diamond enclosure for manufacturability. To do this we will slightly modify the plastic wall thickness as well as add snaps to connect the lid. \nWe will start production of the diamond enclosures using a North American manufacturer that we have received quotes from and samples. .\nJan: Receive assembled PCBs and Enclosures from our manufacturers.\nWe will assemble the Nix color sensors (very easy as they only have 3 large parts) and we will test each device for quality control and calibration.\nFeb: Ship Nix to all of our loyal backers :)!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nHardware\n\nAs we already have a working prototype, we have already taken out a large proportion of the risk associated with hardware production. We also have all of our suppliers lined up and ready to go in Asia as well as the USA. That being said, there will always be risks associated with manufacturing, such as lost shipments, manufacturing errors, factory strikes, etc. We will also have to have our design certified by the proper government agencies. We have assembled a team of the best advisors and will take every precaution necessary to mitigate these risks.\n\nSoftware\n\nAfter successful funding on Kickstarter, the iOS application will need to be professionally recoded before launch. This will ensure that our customers (you) will receive a polished product with maximum accuracy, stability, and ease of use. We have our programmers lined up and ready to go so there is very little risk other than in the actual coding process which could experience standard delays for holidays, sick days, etc.\n\nWe will be at the mercy of Apple when we submit the app to the app store so there will be some risk involved there. We will mitigate this risk by working closely with Apple to abide by all rules and streamline the process.\n\nWe will maintain a high level of communication with our backers throughout the entire process and alert our backers of any unforeseen delays or problems as soon as we know about them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "Shipping and Calibration Update", "update_content": "Hi Everyone,\nWe had some delays with the Canada Post shipping system, particularly with opening a corporate account.
