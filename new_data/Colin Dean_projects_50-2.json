These include Apple (iPhone), Samsung, Huawei, OPPO and many other cell phone manufacturers.\nRISC OS is an alternative to operating systems such as MS Windows, Linux or macOS. RISC OS provides a faster user experience, a flexible development environment, and energy-saving processor technology.\nWe\u2019ve designed a fully integrated system that runs RISC OS on a powerful hardware device that we call Cloverleaf. \nRISC OS is the first and original OS that ran on ARM RISC CPUs. It is a 32-bit OS with cooperative multitasking. It was designed with a graphical user interface with many outstanding features like contextual menus and a three-button mouse.\nFrom the beginning, it has included a vector-graphics program. One key feature is its modular design which offer programmers easy access to all areas of the OS. RISC OS also includes BBC BASIC as its main programming language.\nWe\u2019re building the Cloverleaf RISC OS for you. With the user in mind, RISC OS is an OS for users who want a more efficient and robust OS. Cloverleaf RISC OS comes with a large list of free programs that cover most areas (see under section \"Free Software\" below for detailed information). \nRISC OS is the right OS for explorers and tinkerers as it doesn't restrict your access to the hardware and you can create any software you like. You can control external hardware using the 40-pin GPIO connector \u2014 the same as used in the Raspberry Pi\u2122 and Arduino\u2122. For programming beginners there is the built-in BBC BASIC which is the perfect tool to learn programming. BBC BASIC also opens up the doors directly to the heart of the hardware, the widely-used ARM CPU, as one awesome feature of BBC BASIC is the possibility to include ARM assembler code directly in your BASIC programs.\nCloverleaf RISC OS is your choice to reduce your carbon footprint. At Cloverleaf, we are firm believers that we must find sustainable solutions to power our computers to fight global warming.\nThanks to RISC OS and ARM CPUs, Cloverleaf is making it possible to build low-power systems available for everyone. We have the technology to deliver systems that run on 5 - 15 W of power rather than 80 - 300 W on your current desktop computer. At this low-power consumption a RISC OS computer can be easily powered by a small solar panel.\nRISC OS provides a feature that every computer user needs: speed. \nRISC OS was originally written for ARM chips with a clock rate of only 8 MHz! The RockChip RK3399 SoC used for our Cloverleaf hardware runs now at 1.8 GHz. That is 225 times faster than the original CPU. The handling speed of RISC OS has improved nearly 100 times in the last 30 years. \nAnother factor of the fast and responsive user experience is the cooperative multitasking of RISC OS. This ensures that the application you are currently using at any moment gets the processing time it needs to finish its current task. Only then does the CPU move on to the next task.\nRISC OS programs use minimum space in your computer\u2019s memory because the original OS was designed for a computer with half a megabyte of RAM rather than several gigabytes like most of the operating systems on the market today. RISC OS can run happily in 256 MB and still have 200 MB free for applications. Our current Cloverleaf hardware offers 4GB of RAM so there is plenty of free space for data and programs.\nWith no need for virtual memory, RISC OS runs your programs faster than on other operating systems, especially when overloaded.\nMany computer users may find themselves frustrated with operating systems such as MS Windows and macOS and with good reason. Forced computer upgrades or OS upgrades usually occur every three to five years.\nEach time a user installs new hardware in their computer, these monopolist companies make gargantuan profits by taking advantage of the \u2018need\u2019 to upgrade.\nHow often have you had to buy new hardware such as printers, scanners, graphics cards, and sound cards because new versions of the OS do not have drivers? How much has your company had to pay for upgrading third-party software because of incompatibilities with new operating systems?\nWe don\u2019t believe that this is right. That\u2019s why Cloverleaf will build a smart, user-friendly OS that doesn\u2019t force you to upgrade your computer hardware every four years or upgrade your software to newer versions.\nBecause this technology was built right in the first place, you can be confident that RISC OS will perform as powerfully ten years from now as the day you take it out of the box.\nPLAY\n\nThe RISC OS operating system is right choice for retro gaming lovers and computer hobbyists. RISC OS offers a number of emulators for well known retro computers as the Commodore C64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the Acorn Micro and the Acorn Archimedes. In addition to games in these emulators, a plethora of games have been ported to RISC OS from Linux and other platforms, including commercial titles like Elite, Duke Nukem, Lemmings,  and Heroes of Might and Magic 2. RISC OS also develops and releases new games frequently.\nAlso available on RISC OS is the well-known ScummVM, which allows you to perform numerous adventures and RPGs. ScummVM supports an extensive library of over 250 adventure games - including many classics from legendary studios such as LucasArts, Sierra On-Line, and Revolution Software. ResidualVM is also available to play 3D adventure games on RISC OS, including Grim Fandango, Escape from Monkey Island, and Myst III: Exile.\nBecause RISC OS is such a compact and resource-efficient OS, it will happily run in a few megabytes of RAM rather than gigabytes\u2014making it the perfect tool for any computer hobbyist. RISC OS, unlike most operating systems, is barebones out of the box. RISC OS is great for 2D vector graphics, DTP, and programming whatever you have in mind in BBC BASIC/ARM assembler, C/C++, Python, RiscLua and others.\nPLAY\n\nThe Raspberry Pi is an affordable single-board computer that is very versatile. It can be used for a variety of tasks, including electronic projects, games, media servers, secure Internet proxy servers, robotics, spreadsheets, word-processing, and more. But Linux pushes this lightweight hardware to its limits.\nIn contrast, RISC OS was designed for much less powerful ARM CPUs and\n    smaller memory sizes, and is therefore a perfect match for any\n    Raspberry Pi.\nBecause the lightweight RISC OS was designed to run on ARM processors and doesn\u2019t need gigabytes of memory to perform, Cloverleaf\u2019s RISC OS distribution is perfect for your Raspberry Pi Zero, 2, 3, and 4.\nRISC OS is for explorers who want to have new experiences and seek exciting computer solutions. Those who want to do more with their OS at faster speeds will love RISC OS\u2019s intuitive straight-forward technology.\nPlain and simple, many computer users are fed up with monopolists, and are looking for alternative solutions that better meet their needs. Instead of dealing with constant, expensive updates and constricting hardware and software, RISC OS explorers can experience a completely new OS world while being environmentally conscious.\nCloverleaf\u2019s system is the ultimate tool for tinkerers, makers, and programming ninjas as well as for computer beginners.\nRISC OS was introduced by Acorn Computers in 1987, and was bundled with every ARM-based computer manufactured by the company. Acorn Computers created the fast, ultra-efficient ARM CPU. For this revolutionary RISC CPU, the operating system RISC OS was created. It was popularized by Acorn's Archimedes computer; Acorn machines were used in almost all UK schools and universities during the 1980s and 1990s.\nThe OS has undergone several updates since its inception, with the latest version being RISC OS 5.28. As of October 2018, RISC OS was made fully open source, and it is now licensed under the Apache License 2.0.\nSome of the greatest features of Cloverleaf\u2019s OS are the included software and programming tools that are available for free.\nIn the box with every Cloverleaf computer, users can expect the revolutionary ARM technology, teamed with its original, radical OS, RISC OS. \nIn our Cloverleaf RISC OS distribution, we include a collection of the best free programs and tools available, so that you have a wide range of choices for your daily tasks.\nSome of the available programs include:\n    A powerful Word Processing & DTP System (Impression Style)\n    Pipedream as spreadsheet, database, and word processor\n    Fireworkz (spreadsheet and word processor)\n    ChatCube (Instant messenger with integrated client for Telegram)\n    GCC as a GNU Compiler Collection for C++\n    BBC BASIC which allows users to easily write directly in ARM assembler without needing a compiler \n    Python 2 & 3, the most popular language for machine learning and artificial intelligence\n    RiscLua, a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language\n    Games collection (RISC OS games, Acorn Archimedes, ZX Spectrum, Acorn BBC Micro, Commodore C64, & ScummVM)\n    MessergerPro (Email & News client)\n    OpenVector (Vector graphics program)\n    Merlin (3D editor and raytracing)\n\nWe are building RISC OS for ultimate convenience. Now, it will be easier than ever to access our outstanding collection of games and emulators for:\nSinclair ZX Spectrum\nAcorn BBC Micro\nAcorn Archimedes\nMSDOS\nComodore C64\n  You\u2019ll have access to a wide range of retro games on these platforms, as they will be included in our collections. Not to mention that you can access even more games and programs through PlingStore and PackMan. \nRISC OS Cloverleaf is a crowdfunding campaign to upgrade and revive the unique  computer operating system RISC OS. With Cloverleaf, we\u2019re aiming to build a new brand for the RISC OS operating system that gives users an exciting and user-friendly alternative to monopolists like Microsoft, Apple, and Google.\nWe believe that users need more choices for computer operating systems. The current market for powering our computers is currently insufficient; we must give consumers the option to no longer be dependent on only three companies.\nThis project is about developing RISC OS. When you receive your first version of RISC OS, it won\u2019t be at its final development stage. Improvements will come out on a monthly basis, with new programs and upgrades available over time.\nCloverleaf aims to build community. That\u2019s why we\u2019ll always be available and happy to receive your feedback, so we can ensure that your experience and desires using RISC OS will be met!\nOur project targets include adding support for WIFI, USB 3, Bluetooth, NMVe, multi-threading, GPU and multi-language support for all major languages.\n Cloverleaf has a wide variety of Funding Offers which gives users simple pricing on great products. With any purchase, 100\u20ac will be put towards the development of RISC OS as the best alternative computer OS.

This offer includes also a wireless keyboard and mouse.\nYou are a wealthy individual or are a company or an organization that wants to see RISC OS grow as fast as possible. Then you can opt for our supreme supporter offer. You can choose which open source project you like us to port to RISC OS. This will enable us to work for 4 month on each software package. The port might not be fully completed during that time but should have major features.\nSome of the software packages might need at least two or three fundings (2/3) to be fully ported. The porting will also depend on the current technical limitations of RISC OS. For example RISC OS currently has no access to the ARM Mali GPU. So OpenGL can currently only be implemented with software rendering. \nHere a list of possible open source software that can be ported to RISC OS:\nfreepascal.org\nlazarus-ide.org (former Borland Delphi IDE)(2) This includes the freepascal.org.\nkicad-pcb.org (2) (PCB layout)\nlmms.io (digital audio worksation)\naudacityteam.org (digital audio worksation)\nOpenGL (3D library) (2)\ngodotengine.org (2D/3D Games engine) (3)\nlibreoffice.org (Office package)(3)\nopenoffice.org  (Office package)(3)\nrust-lang.org (programming language)(2)\ngnumeric.org (spreadsheet)(1)\nThe main figures behind this project are Stefan Fr\u00f6hling (former Evolution Computer GmbH, Germany) and Andrew Rawnsley (R-Comp Interactive, United Kingdom). Both have a long history related to RISC OS. Stefan was active in RISC OS products 20 to 25 years ago and came back to RISC OS two years ago and is the initiator of the Cloverleaf RISC OS project. \nStefan found a competent partner in Andrew who was active in RISC OS business during the last 25 Years, and has many years of experience delivering five generations of RISC OS computer systems.  Andrew is also co-owner of the RISC OS intellectual property (IP) and is actively involved in all areas of its development and deployment.\nThere are many helpers behind the scenes that want to support RISC OS for various reasons. Most help us with advice or work in their free time to support the development of RISC OS. Some released their RISC OS software for free to the RISC OS community. Some of them we want to mention here: Raik Fischer, Jeffrey Lee, Jason Tribbeck, Andy Marks, Micheal Grundlitz, David Higton, Tom Williamson, Andrew Conroy, Gavin Smith, David Feugey, Paolo Fabio Zaino, Peter Howkins, Nemo, Richard Hallas and many more. (Sorry if we forgot someone in the list)\n  RISC OS ist ein Open-Source-Computer-Betriebssystem mit einer grafischen Benutzerinferenz (GUI), das erstmals 1989 von Acorn Computers ver\u00f6ffentlicht wurde, um auf ARM RISC-Prozessoren ausgef\u00fchrt zu werden.\nARM-Prozessoren zeichnen sich durch eine herausragende Energieeffizienz aus, weshalb sie derzeit in \u00fcber 90% aller Mobiltelefone der Welt zu finden sind. Dazu geh\u00f6ren Apple (iPhone), Samsung, Huawei, OPPO und viele andere Handyhersteller.\nRISC OS ist eine Alternative zu Betriebssystemen wie MS Windows und MacOS, die eine schnellere Benutzererfahrung, eine flexible Entwicklungsumgebung und energiesparende Prozessortechnologie bietet.\nWir haben ein vollst\u00e4ndig integriertes System entwickelt, auf dem RISC OS auf einem leistungsstarken Hardwareger\u00e4t ausgef\u00fchrt wird, das wir Cloverleaf nennen.\nRISC OS ist das erste und urspr\u00fcngliche Betriebssystem, das auf ARM RISC-CPUs ausgef\u00fchrt wurde. RISC bedeuted nicht Risiko, sondern Reduzierter-Befehlssatz-Chip. RISC OS ist ein kooperatives Multitasking-32-Bit-Betriebssystem. Es wurde mit einer grafischen Benutzeroberfl\u00e4che mit vielen herausragenden Funktionen wie Kontextmen\u00fcs und einer Maus mit drei Tasten entworfen. Es enthielt von Anfang an ein Vektorgrafikprogramm. Ein wesentliches Merkmal ist der modulare Aufbau, der Programmierern einen einfachen Zugriff auf alle Bereiche des Betriebssystems bietet. RISC OS enth\u00e4lt auch BBC BASIC als Hauptprogrammiersprache.\nOS ist ein Betriebssystem f\u00fcr Anwender, die ein effizienteres und robusteres Betriebssystem w\u00fcnschen. Das Cloverleaf RISC OS kommt mit einer gro\u00dfen Liste kostenloser Programme, die die meisten Anwendungen abdecken (Detailierte Information finden sie weiter unten bei \"Gratis-Software\"). RISC OS ist das richtige Betriebssystem f\u00fcr Entdecker und Bastler, da es Ihren Zugriff auf die Hardware nicht einschr\u00e4nkt und Sie jede gew\u00fcnschte Software erstellen k\u00f6nnen. Sie k\u00f6nnen \u00fcber das 40-PIN-GPIO wie Raspberry oder Arduino auf externe Ger\u00e4te zugreifen. F\u00fcr Programmieranf\u00e4nger gibt es das eingebaute BBC BASIC, das das perfekte Werkzeug zum Erlernen des Programmierens ist. Dies macht es perfekt f\u00fcr Kinder, ihre ersten Schritte in die Computerwelt zu machen. BBC BASIC \u00f6ffnet aber auch die T\u00fcren direkt zum Herzen der Hardware. Die weit verbreitete ARM-CPU als eine gro\u00dfartige Funktion von BBC BASIC bietet die M\u00f6glichkeit, ARM-Assembler-Code direkt in Ihre BASIC-Programme aufzunehmen. Mit Cloverleaf RISC OS sind die M\u00f6glichkeiten endlos. Benutzer haben die M\u00f6glichkeit, das Betriebssystem selbst zu \u00e4ndern, da es Open Source ist und f\u00fcr jede Aufgabe \u00fcbernommen werden kann.\nCloverleaf RISC OS ist Ihre erste Wahl, um Ihren CO2-Fu\u00dfabdruck zu reduzieren. Wir bei Cloverleaf sind fest davon \u00fcberzeugt, dass wir nachhaltige L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die Stromversorgung unserer Computer finden m\u00fcssen, um der globalen Erderw\u00e4rmung entgegenzuwirken. Dank RISC OS- und ARM-CPUs erm\u00f6glicht Cloverleaf den Aufbau von Systemen mit sehr geringerem Stromverbrauch, die f\u00fcr alle verf\u00fcgbar sind. Wir verf\u00fcgen \u00fcber die Technologie, um Systeme mit einer Verbrauch von 5 W bis 15 W, gegen\u00fcber 80 W bis 300 W auf Ihrem aktuellen Desktop-Computer, bereitzustellen. Bei diesem geringen Stromverbrauch kann ein RISC OS-Computer problemlos mit einem kleinen Solarpanel betrieben werden.\nRISC OS bietet eine Funktion, die jeder Computerbenutzer ben\u00f6tigt: Geschwindigkeit. RISC OS wurde urspr\u00fcnglich f\u00fcr RISC-CPUs mit nur 8 MHz (!) Taktrate geschrieben. Der aktuelle RockChip RK3399 SoC, der f\u00fcr unsere Cloverleaf-Hardware verwendet wird, l\u00e4uft jetzt mit 1,8 GHz. Das ist 225-mal schneller als die urspr\u00fcnglichen CPUs. Da die GUI bei der Erstellung von RISC OS bereits sehr weit fortgeschritten war, hat sich bis jetzt nicht viel ge\u00e4ndert und es wird auch nicht viel mehr Rechenleistung ben\u00f6tigt. Daher hat sich die Handhabungsgeschwindigkeit von RISC OS in den letzten 30 Jahren fast 100-mal beschleunigt. Ein weiterer Faktor f\u00fcr die schnelle Benutzererfahrung ist das kooperative Multitasking von RISC OS. Dadurch wird sichergestellt, dass die aktuelle Anwendung, die Sie derzeit verwenden, die Verarbeitungszeit erh\u00e4lt, die zum Beenden der aktuellen Aufgabe erforderlich ist. Erst dann \u00fcbergibt es die CPU f\u00fcr die n\u00e4chste Aufgabe. RISC-Betriebssystemprogramme belegen einen minimalen Speicherplatz im Arbeitsspeicher Ihres Computers, da der Ursprung des Betriebssystems auf 1 MB (!) RAM und nicht auf mehreren GByte beruhte, wie bei den meisten derzeit auf dem Markt befindlichen Betriebssystemen. RISC OS kann problemlos mit 256 MB RAM ausgef\u00fchrt werden und verf\u00fcgt immer noch \u00fcber 200 MB freien Speicher f\u00fcr Anwendungen. Unsere aktuelle Cloverleaf-Hardware bietet 4 GB RAM, sodass gen\u00fcgend freier Speicherplatz f\u00fcr Daten und Programme vorhanden ist. Da kein virtueller Speicher verwendet wird, f\u00fchrt RISC OS Ihre Programme schneller aus als auf anderen \u00fcberlasteten Betriebssystemen.\nViele Computerbenutzer sind m\u00f6glicherweise aus gutem Grund mit Betriebssystemen, wie MS Windows und MacOS frustriert. Erzwungene Computer- oder Betriebssystem-Upgrades werden normalerweise alle drei bis f\u00fcnf Jahre durchgef\u00fchrt. Jedes Mal, wenn ein Benutzer neue Hardware auf seinem Computer installiert, erzielen diese monopolistischen Unternehmen enorme Gewinne, indem sie die Notwendigkeit eines Upgrades nutzen. Wie oft mussten Sie neue Hardware wie Drucker, Scanner, Grafikkarten und Soundkarten kaufen, da es f\u00fcr die neue Version des Betriebssystems keinen Treiber f\u00fcr Ihre alte Hardware gibt? Wie viel Servicekosten musste Ihr Unternehmen f\u00fcr das Upgrade von Software von Drittanbietern aufgrund von Inkompatibilit\u00e4ten mit dem neuen Betriebssystem bezahlen? Wir glauben nicht, dass dies richtig ist. Aus diesem Grund wird Cloverleaf ein intelligentes, benutzerfreundliches Computer-Betriebssystem erstellen, das Sie nicht zwingt, Ihre Computerhardware alle vier Jahre zu aktualisieren oder Ihre Software auf neuere Versionen zu aktualisieren. Da diese Technologie von Anfang an entwickelt wurde, k\u00f6nnen Sie sicher sein, dass RISC OS in zehn Jahren genauso leistungsf\u00e4hig sein wird wie an dem Tag, an dem Sie es aus der Verpackung nehmen.\nDas Betriebssystem RISC OS ist auch die richtige Wahl f\u00fcr Retro-Gaming-Liebhaber und Computer-Hobbyisten. RISC OS bietet eine Reihe von Emulatoren f\u00fcr bekannte Retro-Computer, wie Commodore C64, Sinclair ZX Spectrum, Acorn Micro und Acorn Archimedes. Neben original Retro-Titeln wurde eine Vielzahl von Spielen von Linux und anderen Plattformen auf RISC OS portiert, darunter kommerzielle Titel, wie \"Elite\", \"Duke Nukem\", \"Lemmings\", \"Heroes of Might\" und \"Magic 2\". RISC OS Benutzer entwickelt und ver\u00f6ffentlicht auch h\u00e4ufig neue Spiele. Ebenfalls auf RISC OS verf\u00fcgbar ist das bekannte ScummVM, welches Ihnen erm\u00f6glicht, zahlreiche Adventures und RPGs auszuf\u00fchren. ScummVM unterst\u00fctzt eine umfangreiche Bibliothek von \u00fcber 250 Adventure-Spielen - darunter viele Klassiker legend\u00e4rer Studios wie LucasArts, Sierra On-Line, Revolution Software. ResidualVM ist auch verf\u00fcgbar, um 3D Abenteuerspiele auf RISC OS zu spielen, dazu geh\u00f6ren Grim Fandango, Escape von Monkey Island und Myst III: Exile.\nDer Raspberry Pi ist ein erschwinglicher Mini-Computer, der sehr vielseitig ist. Es kann f\u00fcr eine Vielzahl von Aufgaben verwendet werden, darunter elektronische Projekte, Spiele, Medienserver, sichere Internet-Proxyserver, Robotik, Tabellenkalkulationen, Textverarbeitung und mehr. Aber Linux-Distributionen bringen die g\u00fcnstige Hardware schnell an ihre Grenzen. Im Gegensatz dazu wurde RISC OS f\u00fcr viel weniger leistungsstarke ARM-CPUs und kleinere Speichergr\u00f6\u00dfen entwickelt und passt daher perfekt zu jedem Raspberry Pi. Da das ressourcenschonende RISC-Betriebssystem ausschlie\u00dflich f\u00fcr die effizienten ARM-Prozessor konzipiert wurde und keine Gigabyte Speicher ben\u00f6tigt, ist das Cloverleaf RISC-Betriebssystem perfekt f\u00fcr Ihren Raspberry Pi Zero, 2, 3 und 4.\nRISC OS ist f\u00fcr Entdecker gedacht, die neue Erfahrungen machen und nach aufregenden Computerl\u00f6sungen suchen. Wer schneller mit seinem Betriebssystem mehr anfangen m\u00f6chte, wird die intuitive, unkomplizierte Technologie von RISC OS lieben. Schlicht und einfach, viele Computerbenutzer haben die Nase voll von Monopolisten und suchen nach alternativen L\u00f6sungen, die ihren Anforderungen besser entsprechen. Anstatt sich mit st\u00e4ndigen, teuren Updates und eingeschr\u00e4nkter Hardware und Software zu befassen, k\u00f6nnen RISC OS-Entdecker, dass sie mehr Computer eine neues, schnelles Betriebssystem erforschen und dabei noch umweltbewusst handeln. Das Cloverleaf-System ist das ultimative Werkzeug f\u00fcr Bastler, Hersteller und Programmier-Ninjas sowie f\u00fcr Computeranf\u00e4nger.\nEine der gr\u00f6\u00dften Vorteile des Cloverleaf RISC OS-Betriebssystems ist die beiliegende Software und Programmsprachen, die kostenlos zur Verf\u00fcgung steht.\nEinige der verf\u00fcgbaren Programme umfassen:\nEin leistungsstarkes Textverarbeitungs- und DTP-System (Impression Style)\nPipedream als Tabellenkalkulation, Datenbank und Textverarbeitung\nFireworkz (Tabellenkalkulation und Textverarbeitung)\nChatCube (Instant Messenger mit integriertem Client f\u00fcr Telegramm)\nGCC als GNU Compiler Collection f\u00fcr C ++\nBBC BASIC, mit dem Benutzer problemlos direkt in ARM Assembler schreiben k\u00f6nnen, ohne einen Compiler zu ben\u00f6tigen\nPython 2 & 3, die beliebteste Sprache f\u00fcr maschinelles Lernen und k\u00fcnstliche Intelligenz\nRiscLua, eine leistungsstarke, effiziente, leichte und einbettbare Skriptsprache      \nMessergerPro (Email & News Client)\nJetzt ist es einfacher als je zuvor, auf unsere herausragende Sammlung von Spielen und Emulatoren zuzugreifen, um:\nSinclair ZX Spectrum\nCommodore C64\nAcorn BBC Micro\nAcorn Archimedes\nMSDOS\nAuf diesen Plattformen haben Sie Zugriff auf eine Vielzahl von Retro-Spielen, die in unsere Sammlungen aufgenommen werden. Ganz zu schweigen davon, dass Sie \u00fcber PlingStore und PackMan auf noch mehr Spiele und Programme zugreifen k\u00f6nnen. Bist du ein Programmierer? Interessieren Sie sich f\u00fcr das Programmieren? Wir haben die Tools, Compiler und Programme f\u00fcr alle Ihre Anforderungen an Creative Computing.\nRISC OS Cloverleaf ist eine Crowdfunding-Kampagne zur Aktualisierung und Wiederbelebung des einzigartigen und dynamischen Computerbetriebssystems RISC OS. Mit Cloverleaf wollen wir eine neuen Markt f\u00fcr das Betriebssystem RISC OS aufbauen, die Benutzern eine aufregende und benutzerfreundliche Alternative zu Monopolisten wie Microsoft, Apple und Google bietet.\nIn diesem Projekt geht es um die Entwicklung von RISC OS. Wenn Sie Ihre erste Version von RISC OS erhalten, befindet es sich noch nicht am Endpunkt der Entwicklung.\nW\u00e4hrend Sie bereits eine Menge gro\u00dfartiger Tools zur Verf\u00fcgung haben, ist dies erst der Beginn der Entwicklung von RISC OS. Die Verbesserungen werden monatlich ver\u00f6ffentlicht, wobei im Laufe der Zeit neue Programme und Upgrades verf\u00fcgbar sind.\n\nUm RISC OS schneller weiterzuentwickeln, ben\u00f6tigen wir Ihre Hilfe. Mit Ihrer Unterst\u00fctzung k\u00f6nnen wir das bereits herausragende Betriebssystem RISC OS nutzen und es noch benutzerfreundlicher weiter verbessern und an heutige Anforderungen anpassen. \nUnsere Projektziele umfassen Unterst\u00fctzung von WIFI, USB 3, NMVe, Multithreading, GPU und mehrsprachige Unterst\u00fctzung f\u00fcr alle wichtigen Sprachen.\nSie sind eine wohlhabende Person oder ein Unternehmen oder eine Organisation, die m\u00f6chte, dass RISC OS so schnell wie m\u00f6glich w\u00e4chst.

Auf diese Weise k\u00f6nnen wir 4 Monate lang an jedem Softwarepaket arbeiten. Der Port ist in dieser Zeit m\u00f6glicherweise nicht vollst\u00e4ndig fertiggestellt, sollte jedoch \u00fcber wichtige Funktionen verf\u00fcgen. Einige der Softwarepakete ben\u00f6tigen m\u00f6glicherweise mindestens zwei oder drei Mittel (2/3), um vollst\u00e4ndig portiert zu werden. Die Portierung h\u00e4ngt auch von den aktuellen technischen Einschr\u00e4nkungen von RISC OS ab. Beispielsweise hat RISC OS derzeit keinen Zugriff auf die ARM Mali-GPU. Daher kann OpenGL derzeit nur mit Software-Rendering implementiert werden. \nDie Beispielliste m\u00f6glicher Open Source-Software, die auf RISC OS portiert werden k\u00f6nnen, bitte im englischen Text ansehen.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we are using existing hardware we will not have any risk of technological matter.

TVs aren\u2019t always convenient so we made a way to take console gaming with you wherever you are without the need of an internet connection.       \n\n\n\nAs lifelong console gamers, we know there may be some PC master race gamers who gawk at the idea of playing Mario on their powerful gaming computer.  But we say the more games we can play, on even more platforms, the better! \nSeamless console docking to your laptop. It's that simple!\nLaptops are Really Versatile Screens\nThe biggest benefit of course is to take advantage of the screen you\u2019re always carrying already.  Not one of those additional portable monitors but a laptop that we use daily for like\u2026 school, work, shopping and creative stuff. \nShadowCast completely hides in the shadows of the original Switch dock!\nLet's imagine a time before 2020... and you were waiting at an airport for a flight to board and you wanted to get a couple rounds of Smash Bros in with a friend\u2026 or two\u2026 or three. Tabletop mode is nice\u2026 but let\u2019s just say it\u2019s not the most ergonomic. With ShadowCast you can easily plug your Nintendo Switch to your laptop and play on a screen over 4x the size.\nNot quite as easy as adjusting the viewing angle of a laptop, is it?\nYou Could Always use Another TV\nThere's also many situations where there just isn\u2019t a HDMI display available - many of us are happy with our laptops and integrated desktop computers. I think back to the times when I lived in a dorm room or even living abroad for brief periods where having my laptop, a PS5, and a ShadowCast would\u2019ve been amazing. \nWorks with current-gen and next-gen with up to 4K input\nAnd then there\u2019s always competing for the living room television - whether it\u2019s someone in your household streaming a whole season of the latest Netflix series or just having another gamer in the household. Oh and it also makes having a second television for multiplayer that much more convenient to set up. \nPS5 on an iMac - when a TV just simply isn't available\nOur App Makes the Difference\nAccompanying the ShadowCast is our new Genki Arcade app. We literally have made it easier than reaching for the TV remote and hitting the \"input\" button. We've designed Genki Arcade from the ground up to minimize computing resources and prioritize latency for gaming performance. Just open the app, and it'll auto detect ShadowCast and you'll be playing immediately without any settings to fiddle with.\nTV vs. ShadowCast - HDMI splitter shows a 0-0.02s difference in Smash Bros.\nGenki Arcade (left) is 50ms faster than OBS (right) and uses less than 1/3 of the CPU\nWe've developed a native Mac OS app that's optimized for both Apple Silicon and Intel processors as well as a dedicated app for Windows. Additionally, we're in the process of making a web browser version that allows you to play on shared/public computers and other systems without installing any software (compatibility will vary, for example iPadOS currently doesn\u2019t detect external video devices but we\u2019re confident it will someday!).\nWindows or Mac, we got your Animal Crossing addiction covered\n The beauty of being able to connect your gaming console to your computer means you can actually record, edit, and stream your gameplay. While it may not be at the same level as a professional grade capture card that costs 5-10x more, it\u2019s more than capable for most gameplay capturing needs while being much more flexible and easy to use across multiple platforms. \nWe're making last year's best capture cards feel a bit outdated.\nRecord To Your Heart\u2019s Content\nSure you can use the built-in video recording feature on the Nintendo Switch but that\u2019s limited to 30 seconds - that mean you'll have to rush that epic boss fight or finish that speed-run extra fast.  It's is also a pain to export and you\u2019re limited by an already small internal storage and expensive memory cards. With ShadowCast you don't have to worry about recording length and can rewatch your whole session of Among Us, add your commentary, and refine your strategy.\nWith a 30 second limit everyone is sus!\nWe\u2019ve actually created what we believe is the most simple to use, not just for playing but also to record gameplay videos.  Here\u2019s a sample of a recording of us playing on various consoles with the ShadowCast: \nThese videos are screen recordings of gameplay played off an early build of our dedicated Genki Arcade app.\nPlays Nice with Others \nWe made the Genki Arcade app to be truly simple to use, but for those that need more complexity you\u2019ll be happy to know that ShadowCast is compatible with popular professional capture card applications such as Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), Streamlabs OBS, XSplit, and much more. This will allow you to capture video with detailed customizations and even overlay various webcam feeds, graphics, and animations.\nIt's pretty much compatible with everything you throw at it\n\nBegin Your Career as an Influencer\nUltimately the main reason for anyone to capture video is so that they can share it with the world. ShadowCast can easily upload your previously recorded or edited videos and even stream live to your favorite platform - whether your team Twitch, YouTube, or FaceBook, we got you covered.  \nTo maximize compatibility across as many platforms as possible, we\u2019ve disguised ShadowCast as a webcam so that it can do a few more party tricks. This means it can actually be selected as a webcam under many typical apps popular today thanks to all the remote working, including Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams, and FaceTime - and further even supports video players like QuickTime and VLC if you don\u2019t have our app installed.\nVideo Chat Your Gameplay\nThis allows you to not only share your gameplay live with anyone, but you can actually play with your friends and see them on split screen just as if you were playing in couch co-op mode in-person.\nYou can play any of your favorite games in split-screen even without being on a couch\nDon\u2019t Settle for a Weak Webcam\nAs an additional benefit, ShadowCast works with all HDMI output devices beyond gaming consoles, including better cameras.  This means you can upgrade your video conference by swapping out your poor built-in webcam for most digital cameras, including DSLRs, camcorders, and action cameras - as long as it supports HDMI out (some cameras require a HDMI-mini/micro converter).  No more grainy, low resolution videos with poor lighting. \nKickstarter compresses these images, but hopefully you get the idea!\nThe Perfect Stay-at-Home Camera Assistant\nIt\u2019s also quite useful for situations where you just need to see what you're photographing or recording on a bigger laptop screen - no need for expensive wireless monitors! \nA better view of your DSLR in real-time so you can skip the expensive screen monitor\nWe actually had the idea of ShadowCast back in 2019 and started to collaborate with  manufacturers of the top video streaming and capture card brands. The timing was a bit too early as the components needed were overly expensive and had originally intended to make a Super Dock. Since then, we've refined the idea, dived into software and made something that we're quite excited to share here.\nMight as well make it as small as possible right?\nHere's also a video showcasing the latency between a TV and ShadowCast. We setup a powered HDMI splitter to show the screens simultaneously with the same baseline:\nPLAY\n\nSetup ShadowCast in 3 simple steps!\nIf you need a more visual adventure we've prepared a short video showing the 3 simple steps in real-time to setup ShadowCast.\nPLAY\n\nThis is really, really small\nDimensions are 25 x 52 x 9mm or 0.98\" x 2.1\" x 0.35\"\nWeighs just 10 grams (latest prototype)\nHDMI 2.0 input brings in 4K video from the latest game consoles, including the Nintendo Switch, Playstation 4/5, and XBox Series S/X\nUSB-C output transfers to computer up to 1920x1080 @ 60fps\nGenki Arcade app requires macOS 10.12+ or Windows 7+\nIncludes USB-C 2.0 Cable 1.8m long cable\n\n\n Get more ShadowCasts if you wanted various colors or one for every console:\nGet a Covert Dock, a pocketable dock and GaN charger for the Switch and more:\nGet a Genki Audio, connects 2 Bluetooth headphones to your Switch (and other consoles) works docked, and has a port to charge your Switch:\nGet a Genki Audio Lite, a slimmer portable Bluetooth audio adapter that is optimized for the Switch and Switch Lite (does not fit PS5): \nGet a Force Field Lite, a dual magnetic enclosure grip case with vegan leather to protect your Switch Lite with compatibility for both Genki Audio and Audio Lite: \nIf you're in need of a flexible HDMI, premium USB-C 3.1 cable, or portable metal stand: \nGenki was a brand founded by three guys with a dream to challenge the gaming accessory industry to make more compelling hardware.

By now the risks are less of us being able to make the product but more likely if we deliver on time. One of the biggest chunks of time is always the pre-production phase which includes tooling/mold production, test molds, and securing components. This time, we\u2019ve actually gotten a lot of the work done before launching the project which means greater financial risk for us but a lot less timeline uncertainty for our backers. We're happy to say we're even better equipped to face these challenges but no matter how much we plan there\u2019s always a chance that things can go wrong.

Fight aliens; befriend aliens. Make a fortune through trade \u2014 or through piracy! Chart your own course among the stars, or find yourself at the heart of dramatic events: turn the tide of wars, develop new technologies, and destabilise entire cultures!\nCosmic Frontier: Override is a single-player space-trading game in the mold of the inspirational Elite (1984). It is a remake of Escape Velocity: Override (1998), by the same scenario designer. It is planned to be released for Mac, Windows PC and Linux systems, with a target release date in the middle of 2021. We are seeking your backing to meet that target and release a game of the highest quality possible!\nPlanet landing concept art by Chris Smallfield\nGAMEPLAY\nAs in Elite and other games like it, the core gameplay involves piloting your ship from one star system to another, visiting planets and space stations, buying and selling goods to make a profit, while evading or fighting pirates and other threats. When you make enough money, you can upgrade your ship with new equipment and weapons, or buy an entirely new ship which may have drastically different capabilities.\nThe main difference between Cosmic Frontier and Elite is that it features a top-down view, like that of Asteroids, rather than being a flight sim. The result is an easy-to-learn game with a great atmosphere of adventure, suitable for both quick bites of play or long gaming sessions. We\u2019re certain that any fan of the Escape Velocity games will enjoy Cosmic Frontier, but the game is intended to be easy for the most casual pilot to pick up and play.\nCosmic Frontier is a free-form game: you can go wherever you want, and work for whomever you want \u2014 including for no one but yourself. You can be a peaceful trader, a bounty hunter, a soldier for Earth, a galactic explorer, a rapacious pirate \u2014 or all of these and more in the life of a single pilot! In addition, there are dozens of story-line missions which advance events within the game universe and provide unique challenges and opportunities. But it is also quite possible to avoid all this scripted content and still experience many hours of rich gameplay.\nTo get a fuller idea of the gameplay, or to summon up some nostalgia if you played the original game many years ago, please take a look at ASW Fangirl's youtube playthrough.\nSCENARIO\nIt is 150 years into the future. Humanity has achieved interstellar travel, but soon after doing so it became embroiled in a war with the pitiless Voinians, imperialistic aliens who see humans as just one more inferior species to enslave or annihilate.\nThe Voinians were halted at the Battle of Sol, but the conflict remains in the balance and battles continue to rage on the frontier just a few hyperjumps from Earth. Nearly all of humankind\u2019s energies are poured into this struggle for survival, and little of the rest of the accessible galaxy has been explored.\nYou begin as a solo pilot, with nothing but a shuttlecraft, a hyperflight licence and a handful of credits to your name, determined to make your fortune among the stars.\nTo players of the original Escape Velocity: Override, all of the above will sound familiar. They can be assured that all the best things from the original game will be preserved, and that there will be expanded content including new ship types and new mission strings. In addition, there will be a prequel mini-scenario, covering the period of humanity\u2019s first encounter with the Voinians, which will be released as DLC free to backers at the $10 level and above.\nCosmic Frontier: Override will feature:\nHundreds of star systems, planets and space stations to visit\nDozens of different classes of ship to pilot, and fight against\nNumerous human and alien factions with their own characteristic technologies\nA wide range of weapons and equipment for your ship\nHundreds of missions, including some which will change the face of the galaxy\nPlease note that, unless otherwise indicated, all screenshots come from the original game, Escape Velocity: Override, and are not representative of the final product\nMODDABILITY\nAmong the most important features of Cosmic Frontier will be moddability: Escape Velocity was a pioneering game in terms of the ease of content modification and creation by users, and both its sequels derived from content initially created by mod developers.\nCosmic Frontier too will be highly moddable. Shortly after the game\u2019s release, a free mod developer\u2019s kit will be released that will include a full guide to the scripting language that any user will be able to use to make their own additions or modifications to the scenario, or to create entirely new scenarios of their own. This includes the creation of new ships, new weapons, new outfits, new missions, new star systems and visitable worlds and stations, and a host of other features.\nThe new engine will have extensive compatibility with the resource files used by the Escape Velocity games. At worst, it will only take a small amount of conversion effort to get your old EV mods working with Cosmic Frontier. At best, it may prove possible to just plug them in and play!\nModdability is very important to us. Many people got their first taste of software development and graphic design through working on Escape Velocity projects, and we hope that the same will be true for Cosmic Frontier in the future. In addition, if this project is successfully funded, we hope that Override will not be the only Cosmic Frontier game we release \u2026 \nENGINE\nCosmic Frontier will feature a brand new game engine which will at least match the capabilities of the game engines of the games in the Escape Velocity series. In the future, we intend for this engine to be available for use by further projects, both by us and independently of us. Helping to fund Cosmic Frontier will also help to fund development of this game engine.\nThe engine itself is referred to by the name Kestrel. For practical reasons, Kestrel will not be source-available during the initial run of development, but following the release of Cosmic Frontier: Override it will become open-source, with a licence that will allow people to use it as the main engine in the development of their own games.\nKestrel will permit modification of the game on four different levels:\n1. Base Engine (C++). For fundamental changes, such as graphics rendering and physics calculations.\n2. Core Gameplay (Lua) - Changing how the resources and assets of the game are handled and the game experience is delivered.\n3. Mods (Lua) - Additional functionality, and changes to core functionality.\n4. Plugins - Traditional EV-style plugins that add content to the game without altering functionality.\nYou can read more and follow future progress on the Kestrel development blog. \nAn example of the Kestrel Development Language\nFUNDING GOALS\nOur initial funding target of $45 000 is set based on the amount of part-time and spare-time work we expect to put in to bring you the game by the middle of 2021. (Please keep in mind that we do not get every cent of the funding: there are fees to Kickstarter, payment processing fees, and also taxes to take into account.) A healthy funding amount will help us enormously in justifying to our families the amount of time and energy we have already put into this project. The greater the funding, the more time and effort we will be able to put in.\nIn addition, neither of the developers are primarily artists. Funding will enable us to commission artists, or even add an artist to the team if we meet the first stretch goal below, which will allow us to add new and improve existing art assets, and ensure a smooth, polished user interface.\nWe believe that the main funding target will be sufficient for us to at least match the quality of experience of the original Escape Velocity games, re-scaled and adjusted for modern displays and other gaming norms. In addition, there will be new scenario content including new ships and missions.\nStretch Goal 1 \u2014 Graphical Upgrade \u2014 $60 000\nShould we reach the $60 000 level, we will commit to a full graphical upgrade and overhaul of the original, which we will most likely look to achieve by adding a third member to the development team, who will focus on graphic design.\nPart of the charm of the Escape Velocity games was always that any would-be modder felt that they could be capable of creating content that didn\u2019t look out of place alongside the original work, and therefore we don\u2019t want to set the graphical bar so high that the same won\u2019t be true of Cosmic Frontier. So the focus will be on crisp, clear design and UI, putting new polish on existing Override assets and creating new content that fits in seamlessly.\nWe don\u2019t have any definite candidate in mind for this role at this time, but would be looking for someone with both a background in playing and modding the EV games, and some experience of professional graphic design.\nShort of this milestone, we will focus on producing and commissioning specific pieces of art in order to smooth out the original Override look as far as is feasible.\nStretch Goal 2 \u2014 Age of the Council \u2014 $100 000\nAt the $100 000 level, we will have the confidence to guarantee the release of a sequel to the Override scenario, entitled Age of the Council. This will be planned for release between 12 and 18 months after the initial release of Cosmic Frontier as paid-for DLC.\nThe bones of the Age of the Council scenario already exist, including the design of many new ships and weapons. The scenario takes place in essentially the same map of systems as Override, but begins 25 years later and (in addition to the impact of the pilot\u2019s actions in Override) there have been many other changes to the political shape of the galaxy \u2014 and there will be still more in the course of the plot!\nDraft ship designs for Age of the Council\nAnd beyond: We don\u2019t have any further specific stretch goals beyond these at this time, but the greater the funding level, the more ambitious we will be able to be in terms of: (1) bringing you the highest quality remaster of Override possible; (2) creating more content in the Override universe; (3) building the most complete and flexible game engine possible; and (4) planning for future games under the Cosmic Frontier title in new original settings.\nImportant reward tier note: If you are generous enough to fund us at a level where you get the chance to add new missions, a new ship type or other features to the game, we will do our best to implement your vision. However, we may have to impose certain limitations or guidelines to ensure that your addition fits in seamlessly with the rest of the design.\n\nWHO WE ARE\nTom Hancocks \u2014 Engine Developer\nTom is a software engineer who has worked with Apple's Cocoa frameworks for the past 16 years, and had some experience with Carbon and REALbasic before that. His first commercial project was a utility called TuneBar, which acted as a controller for iTunes, allowing users to control iTunes from within any other application on their system. The Escape Velocity series played a large part in expanding his interest in software development, and has been a game that he has periodically returned to. When he noticed that macOS Yosemite was beginning to emit warnings of incompatibility over EV Nova, he began to look into cloning the engine and reverse-engineering the old file and media formats that it had used.\nPeter Cartwright \u2014 Scenario Designer\nPeter began creating the scenario for Escape Velocity: Override shortly after the release of the original Escape Velocity, and Ambrosia Software picked it up as that game\u2019s first sequel shortly after he had left school. Although he has continued to do some game modding \u2014 including being a small part of the Magna Mundi team for Europa Universalis III \u2014 he did not stay in software development, mainly working as a freelance international translator, including for organisations such as the United Nations.\nBoth members of the team happen to be from the east of England.\nOverride Theme Music by Nolan Markey.\n\"Cosmic Frontiers are calling!\" and \"Greetings from the Cosmic Frontier\" poster images by Chris Smallfield.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the first independent software project for both of us.

We are constantly fighting for more donations and we are getting a state-of-the art Direct-to-Garment printer to help our cause. \nThis KickStarter is a wonderful opportunity for us to create some hacker-themed swag for our supporters and become a revenue source for us to use over the long-term. By fronting all of the orders for garments on Kickstarter, we eliminate the risk in having to finance the equipment. With the equipment fully paid for, we will add a crucial revenue stream to our project so that we can get more of our crucial work funded.\nThe Plan\nOSTIF is kicking-in half of the funding for the new equipment from our own donated funds from previous projects, and we are raising the other half through this KickStarter. We have carefully selected commercial-grade equipment, high quality materials, and gathered volunteers to work on the production of the shirts and wallets. \nWe have commissioned multiple designs and our staff has created multiple others, and the designs are all shirts we would wear ourselves. Many of these designs are appearing on this KickStarter for the first time and can't be found anywhere else!\nAll of the designs shown below are available in a \"Men's\" Tee, a \"Women's\" Tee, and a Unisex Fleece hoodie.\nWe discuss the designs of the rewards below:\nThe Designs\nThese are RFID-blocking wallets that block \"drive-by\" readers from scanning cards in your pocket. You can custom engrave them with whatever you want (Obviously nothing copyrighted or illegal, and it must be two-tone black and white. The maximum print area is about the size of the pictures shown in the KS gallery.) \nThis design is a space-twist on the Tux the Linux Penguin. It is very high resolution and looks fantastic!\nThe two designs above are a new design based on the old Jolly Roger flag. It features a skull and cross-keys design. The black shirt design has a bright glowing effect with a blue hue and the white shirt has a more subdued two-tone \"posterized\" design. \n Update: This design was just added! It commemorates our collaborative work with the Monero and Arweave projects to do an intense audit of RandomX, a new proof of work algorithm that multiple cryptocurrency projects have now adopted. It features a block of encrypted text that is garbled and unreadable, with a large X-shaped area of the text block glowing in \"Monero orange\" with clearer encrypted text. It is a high resolution design that doesn't show well in mockups, because we can't cram enough pixles into the maximum file size to show the details.\n This retro design represents OSTIF.org's anti-censorship work on the obfs4, shadowsocks, meeklite, and meekheavy projects. These technologies help break censorship in authoritarian regimes around the world. We are working to make them more secure, easier to use, and more effective.\nThis design shows Edward Snowden in a mosaic built out of computer text (ASCII). Snowden revealed worldwide illegal surveillance programs being conducted by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ).\nThis design is made to look like a band world tour shirt, but it is showing the real locations of large organizations that were struck by the leaked EternalBlue vulnerability. EternalBlue was a vulnerability that was originally found by the NSA, and instead of reporting the issue to Microsoft for a fix, they left systems worldwide vulnerable and built tools to exploit it. These tools leaked and ultimately became the WannaCry and NotPetya ransomwares that did billions of dollars in damage from downtime and destroyed data.\n This design is titled \"The Internet is Beautiful and Dangerous.\" The jellyfish design has Ethernet cables for tentacles and the bell has the international symbol for WiFi.\n This design is not just a stylized version of our org's name. We have hidden the Glider symbol in the design. The Glider is a symbol of hacker culture and it represents a simple shape that glides when it is used in the \"Game of Life\" originally designed by John Conway in the 1970's. The game has incredibly deep complexity while having deceptively simple starting conditions. An example of the game is here: https://playgameoflife.com/\n These bright designs represent the growth of the open source community with circuit-board traces and icons representing the many uses of open source software.\n\nThis design is a front and back design that features our organization name on the front, and on the back, it shows an actual NSA document leaked by Edward Snowden that shows that the US National Security Agency cannot decrypt an Off-The-Record encrypted message. It shows that even with the NSA's vast resources and manpower, properly built encryption systems prevail.\n This design represents the security audit work that we do, with a magnifying glass revealing \"horrors\" inside of your devices. It is meant to represent possible back doors in proprietary systems, such as the Intel Management Engine, AMD Platform Security Processor, or the ARM TrustZone, as well as all of the problems with Spectre, ZombieLoad, RIDL, and other security flaws that organizations try to fix with updates.\nThis design satirically calls out the biggest three \"surveillance as a business\" companies in the world with the warning \"BIOHAZARD - AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES.\" One design features just the biohazard symbol with the companies, and an alternative design includes a faint skull in the background, with two of the glowing company logos over the eye sockets.\nHere are two Monero designs. Being the largest privacy-oriented cryptocurrency in the world, we have worked closely with the Monero project on key features that have shrank transaction sizes, sped up the network, and hardened the blockchain against the rise of application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). We have worked together on Monero BulletProofs, and Monero RandomX and we currently working closely on two other projects now.\nThis next design is a play on the \"OK Boomer\" designs that are floating around the web. It is the same style of lettering, but says \"OK Facebook\" using fake Cyrillic text. Instead of the \"have a terrible day\", it has a defeatist mantra of \"overthrow my government.\" This is to point out the unchecked Russian (and other) influence campaigns on Facebook and their failure to rein in international campaigns to undermine governments and reshape people's opinions.\nThis design symbolizes the growth of the Open Source Movement and its rise to wide adoption, with our role in improving project code quality and security. It features the word \"FIGHT\" with the \"i\" being symbolized by a tree made up of circuit-board traces.\nThe next one should be appreciated by programmers and security engineers alike! This is our \"typewriter\" design, featuring a typewriter that shows an actual critical flaw that was found by OSTIF while reviewing OpenVPN 2.4.0.\nThis is a two-sided design titled \"resist surveillance.\" It features a symbol of resistance over the United State's NSA logo.\nThe Windows Elephant design has a double meaning, one is superficial and the other is much deeper. Generally Windows is considered bloated and slow when compared to competing Linux solutions for a lot of tasks, hence the elephant failing to jump the chasm. The deeper meaning surrounds the removal of the Elephant Diffuser from BitLocker drive encryption. Removing this key component was against the advice of Microsoft's own cryptographers because it significantly weakens Bitlocker. Micah Lee wrote an excellent article explaining the situation here: https://theintercept.com/2015/06/04/microsoft-disk-encryption/ In essence, Microsoft weakened their encryption for Windows on purpose by killing the Elephant Diffuser.\nThis design is a tongue in cheek joke meme started in the early 2000's when Steve Ballmer of Microsoft famously said that \"Linux is a cancer that attaches itself in an intellectual property sense to everything it touches.\" He then went on to compare Linux and the Free Software movement to communism. Today, Linux is a dominating presence on servers, in the cloud, and on smartphones everywhere.\n\nUpdate: This design was just added! It's a Monero Chameleon. It symbolizes Monero's focus on privacy and fungibility.\nUpdate: This design was just added! It's a play on words for \"fungible\" a key feature that Monero focuses on.\nBelow are our additional designs from our backers and staff.

Learn advanced Scala. Learn really well by coding a huge amount. Write more code during play than you do at work or at school.\nThe Game\nScalaQuest takes place in DataLand, a place where land produces data, and its inhabitants harvest data to survive.\nIn DataLand, many mysterious forces have arisen, with mystical names such as 4-train, C-cross-cross and Hava. They all made data harvesting more efficient, but they all came with dangers of their own. Eventually, Complexity Plagues appeared, forces became slow and inefficient. Whole crops were lost. Those were difficult times for all.\nWithin DataLand, a powerful wizard named Ski has roamed for a while, taming many of these forces. Recently, he's discovered a new force and named it Scala.\nHowever, Ski knows this great power needs to be wielded wisely, so he's gathering an order of apprentices, who can use Scala skillfully and with great care.\nHe's called this the Order of The Ski, or Order[Ski] for short.\nThis is where you come in. \nYou shall become his apprentice, and learn Scala through practice and peril. You will start on the warm, safe haven of Values and Expressions, cross the Classes and Objects plains, hike over Variance Hills and make your way to the treacherous Implicit Forests.\nAnd after that? Who knows what lies ahead.\nWarning: This might be the first time you ask your team members to play a game during work hours.\nWhy Scala?\nScala is a programming language that mixes Object Oriented and Functional Programming. It has been adopted by organizations such as Twitter, LinkedIn, Netflix and Duolingo, and it has enjoyed steady growth for several years. Lately, investment in the language has come from companies like Intel, IBM and Juniper Networks. Its developer community is sharp, curious and dynamic.\nScala is being used in solid frameworks like Akka, Spark and Play, and is gaining much traction in Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Reactive Systems.\nIf you're a developer, having Scala under your belt can open up exciting job opportunities.\nThe content\nOur goal is to cover a range of topics well beyond the very basics, including:\nValues and expressions \nClasses and Types\nObjects \nCase Classes\nValue Classes\nFunctions\nInheritance\nOptions\nPattern Matching\nCollections\nError Handling \nImplicits\nCurrying\nVariance and Covariance\nThe type system\nMONADS. Yes, Mondays. I mean Monads.\nEach level will typically focus on one topic, but as you advance you will be prompted to reinforce your existing knowledge.\nWho we are\nAs a Senior Software Developer & Trainer, Alejandro splits his time between architecting and building software, and coaching others on how to effectively use the Lightbend Reactive Platform. He has a strong passion for teaching, and is one of the few certified Lightbend trainers in Scala, Akka and Play. Over the last 4 years, he has taught over a thousand people from a variety of companies, ranging from startups like Hootsuite and large corporations like Intel and IBM. Alejandro has also created strong connections with many experts involved in building and supporting these platforms. (More about Alejandro)\nChristian is an experienced software developer who has been around a few blocks, and is still trying to find the safest neighbourhood to hang out in. Professionally he is somewhat of a generalist. His love for Scala started a few years ago when he was exposed to its capacity for brevity, its hiding of redundancy found in other languages, all the while being unwary of the dangerous hidden parts. Now he believes the way forward is to come to terms with acceptance - that no advanced language can ever be fully understood, yet sufficient patience and effort can still lead to skill, power and accomplishment. (More about Christian)\nWhy do you care?\nYou will want to back up this project if:\nYou want to learn Scala from scratch and have no time for nonsense\nYou want to level up your Scala skillz\nYou want to grow your Scala team\nYou want to encourage others to learn the language\nYou think great learning should be super affordable\nHow will you learn Scala?\nWe strongly believe fun is a multiplying factor for learning.\nWhen you're having fun, you're more engaged and tend to retain more information.\nPlay is the highest form of research. -- Albert Einstein\nSurely, Einstein was referring to the Zelda series here!\nThe best moments usually occur when a person\u2019s body or mind is stretched [...] in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile. -- Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, Flow (1990)\nIf you're working at a task that's too easy, you get bored. Too hard, and you ragequit.\nAs developers, we also call this Flow, and we crave it often - but do we leverage 'fun' and 'games' enough for learning?\nLearning Scala is difficult and worthwhile... but can we make it **fun**?\nRepetition. In order to survive the quest, you will need to write a lot of code. Exercises will rarely repeat, but we will ensure that every concept is covered from as many angles as possible. You will write lots of code.\nObservation. As developers, we spend more time reading code than writing. We'll challenge you to read, understand and fix Scala snippets.\nMetaphors. We believe the right metaphors can unblock learners from understanding hard concepts. The further the metaphor from code and software, the better. We will use the game environment to create these metaphors and help you develop an intuition for hard concepts.\nThat is our goal with ScalaQuest.\nWhat about other learning options?\nYes, there are great training courses out there, some in pure digital form, others delivered by human beings.\nBut not everyone learns the same way. \nWe believe there's space for many different learning environments, and we've challenged ourselves to build one we really like!\nIn addition, we're creating a very affordable platform, that would allow you to learn at a monthly price that you can simply forget about.\nWhere the project is at\nWe've made tremendous progress and already have two working levels, with number 3 coming very soon. We plan on having beta testers in the near future to validate and improve our current direction. As a backer, you will be invited to participate in this phase, of course!\nFor some of the heavy lifting (compiling and running user code) we'll be integrating with Scastie in the near future.\nOur goals\nOur goal with ScalaQuest is to provide a relatively humane path to learning the basics and the intermediate parts of the deep world of Scala. We want learners to experience success and failure in the form of adventure, laughter and death, rather than in the form of confusion and self-doubt. ScalaQuest is a safe place to play with fire!\nOur objective is to launch ScalaQuest with 8 complete levels, which we believe will take us the rest of 2017. Our goal then is to have a publicly available game by January 2018.\nAfter launching the game, our goal is to release one new level per month.

I use it for referencing information or separate communication while gaming, and I'm really glad DuoScreen will allow me the option to bring my second screen anywhere I want to game.\u201d\n-Tannis Kapell, Longtime Gamer\nAround the turn of the millennium, the use of two screens for a single desktop computer began to popularize -- and for good reason. Increasing screen space increases the amount of content you can keep at your fingertips. Having two screens allows you to organize more content, saves time, clicks, and keystrokes when switching between programs, and improves multi-tasking. \nHowever...\nThe use of laptops also skyrocketed. Instead of travelling to our computers, we were now taking them with us for both work and play. Despite the rise of both these technology trends, there has not been a technological innovation to make second screens as mobile as the modern laptop.\nThis problem plagued Nick Greco. He had often used dual monitors, especially in his work as a software developer. However, he also liked working away from his office desk environment. He needed to find a way to bring a second screen to use with his laptop when he didn't feel like working at his office desk. \nThen, he met Ben Matzke, who faced the same dilemma. Together, they conceived of a solution: building a second screen into a laptop dock. \nTaking this idea and running with it, they applied and were accepted to Pittsburgh's Thrill Mill startup incubator, beating out dozens of other new companies in the process. Not soon after, the first prototype of the DuoScreen was constructed. That DuoScreen was fully functional and slim enough to not be a burden to carry easily. It effectively solved the problem they sought to fix. \nAnd yet, \nNick and Ben weren't satisfied. They were happy they built a solution to their problem, but they wanted it to be cooler, sleeker, edgier. After months of work developing this first DuoScreen, they decided their practical solution needed an upgrade.\nEnter Jacob Howell, a veteran industrial designer who helped redesign DuoScreen into the product we have brought to Kickstarter. His expertise in product development helped make the DuoScreen appeal to a larger market, reflect the brand identity of Nomadz, and brought the initial vision of the DuoScreen to life. His seamless entrance has lifted the entire operation to another level.\nNomadz Inc. wants to find solutions to increase the efficiency, convenience, gratification of mobile computing. We see a world where all computer stations become mobile, and we have a passion for building technology to meet this evolution. \nThe DuoScreen is embodiment of this combined vision of Nick Greco, Ben Matzke, and Jacob Howell. DuoScreen has come a long way since the early days, and we now have a product that not only lets you bring a second screen with your laptop, but also is the coolest looking piece of hardware you own.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs we jump head-first into Kickstarter, we see three major challenges that we are prepared to overcome:\n\n1.) Refine the final design \u2014 While we were pleased with the prototype, we still feel there is some room for improvement. We're still testing different rails, hinges, and straps to provide you with the very best version of DuoScreen.\n\n2.) Making the DuoScreen affordable \u2014 One of the challenges we've encountered is finding the optimal balance of number of units manufactured, initial capital required, and the unit price.\n\nOur $100,000 fundraising goal will let us produce the smallest number of units at the price we want\u2014but leaves us a razor slim margin for error. Anticipating this challenge, we've had extensive discussions with manufacturers to make sure we can produce the initial batch the affordable prices available on our Kickstarter.\n\n3.) We're a young company \u2014 Nomadz is a new company, and we're using Kickstarter as a launchpad to hit the ground running. While we face natural challenges of being first-timers, we still look at it as an advantage. Older companies have multiple projects that divide their attention, we have a singular focus on the DuoScreen Kickstarter, and this one mission is our top priority.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Nicholas Greco, Ben Matzke, Jacob Howell\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nWith the advent of mobile devices, the modern worker often finds themselves away from their normal desk.

We couldn't have done it without you.\nFor those of you who missed the Kickstarter campaign, please head over to:\nhttp://purggo.com\nWhere you can continue to pre-order / purchase your very own PURGGO.\nLike us on FACEBOOK + Follow us on TWITTER\n \nThis is real life, and in real life, we have to deal with surprises. \nHave you ever left takeout in the car overnight, only to be greeted with the stench of garlic and onion the next day? \nOr perhaps the kids forgot their sweat-drenched football equipment in the back seat, and it festered into an odor that can only be described as \u201cthe depths of hell itself.\u201d \nOr maybe the pooch skinny-dipped in the lake, magnifying his natural musk, and then rubbed his wet and furry body all over your car seat? \nSometimes, even the car A/C seems to send out an aroma akin to the sewage treatment plant you drive by every morning. \nAs if the smell isn\u2019t enough, you realize the next day that you have to give a ride to a friend or an important client.\nUh oh.\nThe nasty odor in your car is embarrassing! You\u2019re usually calm and in control of your life, but right now you\u2019re panicking because something needs to be done. \nYou desperately crack open all the windows and speed down the highway like a crazed antelope, hoping the wind will remove the offending odor.\nIt worked!...?\nUnfortunately, the moment you close the windows, the stench slowly returns because it has already been absorbed into the fabric.\nExasperated, you glance at the eerily neon and chemically scented car air freshener that you got at the gas station for $1.99.\nAfter a moment of hesitation, you crack it open.\nThe artificial scent containing 89 chemicals (EWG) hits your senses like a semi-truck.\nYour body goes into shock and you almost lose control of the car. Yikes.\nAfter a few minutes, the scent starts giving you a headache, and the back of your throat starts feeling itchy and sticky.\nTrying to scratch your throat with your tongue is not fun.\nEven worse, you have an asthma attack or an allergic reaction.\nBut wait, at least the odor is gone, right?!\nYou take a tentative whiff\u2026and realize in defeated frustration that artificial lavender fragrance mixed with garlic and dog musk is even more unbearable.\nNooooo...!\nSound familiar? We can do better. \nLogo piece crafted from bamboo\nPurggo is awesome because bamboo charcoal is a super & all natural material: \nIt adsorbs and eliminates odor instead of just masking it.\nIt is fragrance- and allergen-free, and it is all-natural and non-toxic.\nIt works 24/7 passively and lasts for 365+ days.\nIt is one of the most renewable natural resources in the world.\nIt is 100% asthma and allergy friendly. \nAnyone who wants to avoid embarrassing car odor.\nAnyone who is in control of the health and well being of themselves, their families, and their passengers.\nAnyone who has asthma, allergies, or breathing sensitivities.\nAnyone who rejects the status quo and believes in healthy, safe, and sustainably made products.\nAnyone who wants to transform their driving time into a naturally purified personal oasis.\nPurggo is for YOU.\nOur friend\u2019s golden retriever, Brandy, who is the love of our lives, has an uncanny ability to \u201cmusk-up\u201d the car. Especially after a visit to the lake.\nCommon air fresheners like Febreze don\u2019t work, because all they do is release a sickening artificial scent that mixes with existing odors based on our experience. Plus, the chemicals in the artificial scent aggravate our friend\u2019s asthma and allergies. Brandy hates the scent as well, always whimpering in annoyance.\nBut, getting rid of Brandy\u2019s musk from the car was critical for our friend\u2019s social and professional life!\nWe wanted to help her find an effective and natural product that\u2019s safe, healthy, convenient, and sustainable. Yet all we saw were common brands pushing their overpowering scented chemical fresheners to mask odors, or good intentioned folks recommending baking soda.\nNobody wants to breathe in chemicals, and let\u2019s be honest, who\u2019s got the time and energy to sprinkle and clean up baking soda all the time?\nWe knew we could do better.\nOne afternoon, while having tea with Mark\u2019s grandma, we serendipitously discovered bamboo charcoal. Grandma Zhang told us that bamboo charcoal has been used for thousands of years in Asia to purify both air and water, and it is completely safe.\nGrandma Zhang rockin' Hello Kitty like a BOSS\nYou don\u2019t take Grandma Zhang\u2019s wisdom lightly, so we immediately started testing, and we were pleasantly surprised by what bamboo charcoal can do.\nAnd then, we created Purggo.\nOur vision to help people breathe healthy and live happy, our mission to create a natural, safe, and responsible product, and our passion for design are all reflected in Purggo.\nBen drawing like a mad man...\nWe chose honest materials that are environmentally responsible, and complimented them with a clean, simple, and friendly design language. Bamboo charcoal is deeply rooted in Asian culture and history, and the smooth and rounded volume of our product is inspired by Japanese simplicity and Zen philosophy.\nBen's secret sketch book\nThe outer design is defined by the characteristic texture of natural hemp fabric. It\u2019s undyed to accentuate the toned-down and calm beauty of nature. Bright and fresh color accent is used in the stitching to add contrast and excitement.\nTesting different materials for Purggo\nWe hope you enjoy Purggo as much as we enjoyed designing it.\nThe air freshener business is a 3 billion-dollar industry in the United States.\nYet for such a huge industry, the FDA doesn\u2019t regulate most of the ingredients that corporations put into air fresheners.\nSounds crazy, right? It\u2019s a head-scratcher for us as well.\nThe result is that common brands can put whatever chemicals they want inside their air fresheners, many of which are incredibly harmful to the human body.\nIn a recent independent study conducted by the EWG on Febreze, a P&G brand, 89 air contaminants were detected in the product, yet the label on Febreze only included 5 ingredients.\nMany of the 89 air contaminants cause immunotoxicity, neurotoxicity, cancer, developmental/reproductive toxicity, and allergies.\nInsanity.\nThe worst part is, from our experience, the scent only overpowers and mixes with existing odors, and doesn\u2019t remove the smell at all.\nYou can see the research here.\nFor a simple comparison between common brands and Purggo:\nPurggo is powered by nature\u2026and science.\nIt\u2019s filled with 100% all-natural moso bamboo charcoal, activated and carbonized between 1110\u00b0F - 1300\u00b0F (600\u00b0C - 700\u00b0C).\nThis form of bamboo charcoal has been used for thousands of years in many East Asian countries to purify both air and water.\nMost common car air fresheners either dull your senses to give you the illusion of freshness, or try to cover up the existing smell with a sickening and overpowering scent.\nArtificial lavender scent + dog musk + takeout? Yuck.\nPurggo adsorbs and eliminates the odor, rather than masking it.\nThe bamboo charcoal in Purggo is 4x more porous than regular charcoal. The pores and cavities work together to act like a big sponge.\nAs air passes through the pores, odor particles are trapped on the surfaces inside, which purifies the air in your car.\nThe scientific term for this process is adsorb, not absorb. We spellchecked :)\nHave peace of mind knowing your family\u2019s health is protected.\nHave peace of mind knowing you won\u2019t ever offend your passengers with overpowering scents or fresheners that trigger their asthma or allergies.\nPurggo is all-natural and non-toxic. It\u2019s fragrance- and allergen- free. It\u2019s also 100% asthma and allergy friendly.\nYou never have to worry about the kids or the pooch getting too close to Purggo, because bamboo charcoal is safe even if ingested. People in many countries today will still take bamboo charcoal tablets as a natural alternative to Pepto Bismol!\nFor the KickStarter community, we\u2019re going all out. Check out the video below of us showing just how safe the product really is.\nWhile it's safe, we don't recommend trying this at home. It's like chewing on sand!\nMost common car air fresheners, in addition to being ineffective, don\u2019t last more than 45 days.\nIt\u2019s a pain in the butt to constantly have to purchase refills.\nWith Purggo, we wanted to challenge the status quo and create something long lasting. Something we\u2019d love to use ourselves.\nThis is why Purggo works 24/7 passively, and lasts more than 365 days.\nIt\u2019s the world\u2019s longest lasting car air freshener.\nAll you need to do is to put Purggo under the sun for an hour every month or two. The sunlight will recharge the bamboo charcoal inside by removing excess moisture, and restore its air purifying property.\nCreating a sustainable and responsible product was something that we wanted to do from the beginning.\nBamboo is one of the most renewable natural resources in the world, as it can grow as much as 40 feet in just a few months, and reaches maturity in less than 5 years.\nWhen harvested responsibly, a field of bamboo is able to renew itself indefinitely with zero artificial fertilizer and no human intervention, because the plant grows so fast and needs so little.\nHemp, the fabric used to make the outer layer of Purggo, has a much lower environmental impact compared to cotton. Hemp requires half the amount of water and produces 200% more fiber from the same amount of land compared to cotton. A major challenge with cotton is the huge volume of pesticide needed for yield. Hemp on the other hand, doesn\u2019t need any pesticide to grow, just like bamboo.\nAfter a year, cut open the Purggo bag and dump the bamboo charcoal into your yard or plant pot. It will serve as a rich and natural fertilizer and insecticide for your lawn, garden, or flowers.\nWhile we have mad respect for Grandma Zhang\u2019s wisdom, we were a little dubious when we first heard about bamboo charcoal.\nIt just sounded like hocus-pocus. What is this bamboo charcoal?!\nBen is an industrial designer and Mark was an accountant, so our minds are about as analytical as they come.\nObjectivity, precision, and data are part of our vocabulary.\nNOT \u201cgood feeling.\u201d\nFortunately, we validated bamboo charcoal through both experiments and research data early on.\nIf you\u2019re still not convinced of bamboo charcoal\u2019s super powers, check out below:\nTHE ONION TEST\nThat was a fun little experiment you can do at home, but what if you\u2019re a data nut and wanted more hard proof?\nSCIENCE OF BAMBOO CHARCOAL - RESEARCH\nIn a study published in the Journal of Health Science titled \u201cScience of Bamboo Charcoal: Study on Carbonizing Temperature of Bamboo Charcoal and Removal Capability of Harmful Gases,\u201d by the Nagaoka University of Technology in Japan, researchers tested bamboo charcoal\u2019s capabilities.\nThe results were overwhelmingly positive. \nFor instance, a test with nonenal (an odorant) using bamboo charcoal carbonized at different temperatures (500\u00b0C, 700\u00b0C, 1000\u00b0C) revealed the following results:\nFig. 9. Time Course of Nonenal Concentration in Sampling Bag\nOdor elimination is quite clear.\nYou can check out the full study here.\nThe results can be summarized as: \n\u201cIt is expected that (bamboo) charcoal can be effectively used as a countermeasure against Sick Building Syndrome or as a deodorant.\u201d\nBamboo charcoal is a form of \u201cactivated carbon,\u201d which is widely used by manufacturing facilities, and the academic community also acknowledges it as a prime material for odor elimination.\nMaterial composition of Purggo:\n100% moso bamboo charcoal\n100% hemp fabric\n100% cotton rope and stitching\nPurggo\u2019s bamboo is sourced from all over Asia, and carbonized using traditional kilns as you can see from the photo below:\nOne of the actual kilns used for Purggo\nThe quality of the bamboo charcoal makes a huge difference in its ability to adsorb odor. Check out the quick video demonstration on the quality of our bamboo charcoal:\nEach Purggo is also hand-made by our master craftsman / craftswoman, so in a way, every Purggo is unique.\nGeek squad\nBetween Ben and Mark, we have over 15 years of product design, development, fulfillment, and logistics experience, and we are in a unique position to bring Purggo to you.\nAfter over a year of research, design, and improvement, Purggo is finally ready. Our bamboo charcoal is carbonized at the perfect temperature for maximum odor adsorption. The design is simple, intuitive, and responsible.\nWe are also part of the community, and have previously developed, launched, and shipped a successful product on Kickstarter, called Slip Stopper.\nNot only did the product deliver on time to happy customers, it went on to be featured in major publications such as Forbes, PCMag, Macworld, and TUAW.\nPublications that have acknowledged our previous project\nCreating products, keeping our backers informed, and delivering on our promises is the name of the game, and something Ben and Mark are very experienced in.\n3 NEW STRETCH GOALS BASED ON POPULAR DEMAND\n$40,000 - Every single backer automatically gets 20% OFF on the next replacement Purggo.\n$50,000 - UNLOCK the Lava Gray color scheme.

Bamboo is one of the most renewable natural resources available, growing as much as 40 feet in just a few months, and reaching maturity in less than 5 years. It also doesn\u2019t require any pesticides.\nWith enough backers, we can cultivate a bamboo field specifically for Purggo. Once the initial bamboos have been planted, the field will be able to renew and sustain itself indefinitely.\nA simple equation\nThe fun just multiplies.\nWhen you think of bamboo, you think of pandas \nThis is something fun we want to do through this Kickstarter campaign. For many people, when bamboo is mentioned, the next thought that comes to mind is panda.\nYou have the power to make some lucky pandas VERY happy.\nFor every 1000 units of Purggo backed, we\u2019re going to custom-make and donate a bamboo cake to a lucky panda.\nWe\u2019ll document the entire process on film, so you can join the adventure!\nGet your own mini garden\nAfter using Purggo for a year, the bamboo charcoal inside can be used as a rich and natural fertilizer.\nSo, we will send you some vegetable or flower seeds of your choice 365 days after you receive Purggo. You can start your own mini garden and use the bamboo charcoal as fertilizer.\nCheck out our herbs being fertilized by some bamboo charcoal:\nPurggo bamboo charcoal fertilizer - for our herbs\nOur mission is to help people Breathe Healthy and Live Happy.\nPurggo\u2019s all-natural car air eco-purifier is just the first step. Bamboo charcoal has many applications and can be used in other parts of our lives as well. We\u2019re already working hard on the next line of products using bamboo charcoal, and we can\u2019t wait to show them to you.\nWe hope you\u2019ll join us on this adventure!\nWe need you. Please back Purggo today!\nWe are all ready to go, and the only missing piece is YOU. Your support will help us scale up production to bring Purggo to market in a sustainable way. To achieve cost efficiency, we need to purchase raw material in bulk, which is very capital intensive.

Help us do more by giving back.\nCryptocat is one of the world\u2019s leading encrypted instant messaging platforms. It is renown for its ease of use and accessibility, serving around 300 individuals at any given moment. Cryptocat is available for Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera, Mac OS X, and iPhone \u2014 with your help, we want to bring Cryptocat to Android, significantly improve our iPhone app, and also working on exciting features like encrypted video/audio chat!\nCryptocat focuses on treating ease of use as a security property. We want to make encrypted chat fun and accessible, because we know that anything else just can\u2019t work with the general public. Cryptocat has managed to bring encrypted chat to 35 different languages and to more than 200,000 individuals around the world.\nPeople all over the world who, for some reason or another, want to simply afford themselves private communications are discovering Cryptocat and relying on it. We have met people in war zones who rely on Cryptocat to talk to their families. Activists who rely on Cryptocat to organize. Middle school teachers who used Cryptocat to teach Internet privacy to children. Canadian sex clinics deploy Cryptocat to discuss private matters with their clients. Journalists from Reporters without Borders who hold workshops specifically to teach their colleagues and related individuals how to protect themselves using Cryptocat. In Lebanon, secular movements are using Cryptocat to avoid being harassed by sectarian militias. Even in Tibet, individuals in isolated mountains use Cryptocat to communicate in privacy.\nSince 2012, the amount of different situations we have seen Cryptocat deployed in is truly hard-hitting. Hundreds of people are connected to the Cryptocat network at any given time, and it is surreal for us to even try to imagine all the stories we haven\u2019t heard of how Cryptocat has helped. In Russia, Croatia, and all around the world, we hear stories regularly involving Cryptocat. Cryptocat\u2019s impact has been strong enough to make it the only encrypted instant messaging software to be completely banned in Iran (since November 2013).\nEncrypted video/audio chat:\nAs part of this fund-raiser, we want to make it possible for Cryptocat's browser clients of setting up end-to-end encrypted audio and video chat within the browser. We want this to be a drop-in replacement for Skype and other services that would have you risk your privacy.\nMobile apps for Android and iPhone:\nCryptocat is already available for iPhone \u2014 but we need your help to bring it to Android and to improve the features of our iPhone app. With your donations, we can hire new engineers to get this done, and fund our existing team.\nMore details on planned research goals:\nUnit Tests The three main components of Cryptocat mobile applications are the OTR component, the mpOTR component, and the XMPP component. Those components handle the critical feature of the app: the encryption of the communications, and the connection with the chat server. It is important to make sure we do not break the security or the connectivity of the app across releases. Writing test code will help us to preventively detect bugs and avoid regressions in upcoming releases. It is particularly important in an open-source project where lot of different contributors might help improve the codebase. Using existing frameworks, we\u2019ll have to setup a test environment and adapt the existing code so it\u2019s easier to test. After the test environment has been properly set up and the main functionalities have been tested, it will be easier to write more tests as we discover bugs and add new functionalities. Projected time needed for development: 8 weeks\nQuality Assurance Into Maturity This deliverable allows us to maintain the quality of Cryptocat\u2019s mobile releases over the course of their release in 2014 as the applications go through their first year in production. Projected time needed for development: 2014\nIdentity verification In the context of a secure conversation, both parties should be able to verify their identities. The OTR protocol uses SMP to detect impersonation or man-in-the-middle attacks. SMP will have to be implemented at the protocol level, and the app user interface will have to be adapted. We should present the user with an interface that allows him to ask a secret question to his recipient and to answer to his recipient\u2019s secret question. On top of this, Cryptocat\u2019s user interface must be expanded to enforce and encourage authentication much more clearly to end-users. Projected time needed for development: 8 weeks\nSecure file transfer for mobile apps In order to allow recipients to exchange files securely, we\u2019ll use our OTR encrypted file transfer specification. We will have to implement it both at the protocol level and at the UI level. The recipients will have to be presented an interface to pick a file to send, and to be notified when a file is being received. Projected time needed for development: 8 weeks\nFile preview We will adapt the user interface to allow the user to preview received files (e.g: images, videos, sounds) and to open them with other applications. Projected time needed for development: 8 weeks\nMultiple Conversation Rooms For now, Cryptocat for iOS allows you to join a conversation room and chat with the people connected to this room. In order to allow the user to connect to multiple conversation rooms and talk with people in those rooms, we\u2019ll adapt the way the XMPP connection is handled and adapt the user interface to allow the user to switch between multiple rooms. Projected time needed for development: 8 weeks\nTablet compatibility In order to provide the user with an optimal experience while using the app, we\u2019ll adapt the user interface to take advantage of the screen extra space provided by tablets. This will mean modifications on top of the existing Cryptocat for iPhone and Android codebases. Projected time needed for development: 8 weeks\nImprove Translations For now, Cryptocat for iOS is available in English and French. We need to make it available in as many languages as the Cryptocat web application (35 languages.) Projected time needed for development: 8 weeks\nTor Integration Investigate the possibility to use the Tor anonymity network with Cryptocat\u2019s mobile application, bundling it similarly to how Tor is currently bundled for Cryptocat for Mac OS X. Projected time needed for development: 12 weeks\nTimestamps in Chat and other User Interface Improvements Currently, Cryptocat\u2019s mobile interface remains relatively undeveloped. One example of a mobile user interface improvement would be adding timestamps. In the chat view, we will add the timestamp for each message, localised accordingly to the user\u2019s system locale. In order to keep the UI clean, we\u2019ll hide the timestamps by default, and show them when the user swipes a chat bubble cell. Projected time needed for development: 10 weeks\nSend Chat Invitation (potentially iOS only due to technological restrictions) When a user is connected to a conversation room, they would be able to send an invitation link to another person using the iOS app. The invitation link will be sent by email or SMS, and when taped, the link will launch the app with the conversation name pre-filled. We know we can do this on iOS but we haven\u2019t investigated its technical possibility on Android or other platforms yet. Projected time needed for development: 8 weeks\nDocumentation Cryptocat for mobile needs documentation to help others compile and install the app and to explain the best way to contribute to the code, documentation, translations, and so on. We have no funding for any kind of mobile documentation at present. Projected time needed for development: 6 weeks\nCool rewards for donors!\nCheck out some of the cool swag you can get for pledging to support this fundraiser:\nCryptocat stickers!\nCryptocat t-shirts!\nFinally, a bit about the team:\nNadim Kobeissi: Nadim created Cryptocat.

When every community had it's own local brewery. These local breweries varied in style and flavors; Irish reds in New York City, German Lagers in Philadelphia, and even a steam beer in California. \nLocal flavor made from quality ingredients are inherent in our Company values, and we believe that you deserve more from a beer than what the Macro-breweries tell you. We have spent numerous hours creating and recreating recipes in order to deliver a wide variety of beer, from a wide variety of places. While you may not enjoy every one of them, we will strive to find you a pleasurable beverage that can be enjoyed over and over again. \nWho We Are.\nStephen M Nicholson - Stephen has been home brewing for just over seven years. He has been the inspiration behind many of the flagship beers. Inside his little circle of home brewers Stephen is often sought for advice and recommendations on how to improve recipes. Almost from the first sip he can tell you what style of hops and most of the malts that were used in the recipe.  \nRoger J Nichols - Over the past six years, Roger has been concentrating and perfecting his skills as a brewer. His first batch of beer was like most home brewers, a simple wheat beer, but this seemed way to simple for Roger's taste. From his cupboard he grabbed the vanilla extract and added it to the secondary fermentor. The result was far from perfect, but after a few revisions we now have a wheat beer totally different from any we've seen. From the very start he has never been hesitant to experiment with the recipe; it's this experimentation that has allowed us to create some nontraditional but very tasteful beer.\nCombined we have more than 30 years in the Military. We are currently proud members of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard and have both deployed multiple times in defense of this great nation. We are both very proud of our service to the country and are offering a 10% Military discount to our brothers and sisters in the Armed Forces on all of our beer and merchandise from the brewery.\nOwning a brewery has been a dream of ours for the past several years. As our friendship grew, so did the idea of pursuing that dream. When we agreed to partner together and start a company; Deadlock Brewing Company was born. \nStephen Nicholson - Owner, Master Brewer\nRoger Nichols - Master Brewer\nOur Nano Brewery.\nWe will be brewing on a 1.5 Barrel electric brewing system (1 Barrel =31 US gallons). We have spent countless hours designing, redesigning, building, wiring, rewiring, drilling, and testing our setup. Up to this point we have been purchasing equipment bit by bit, and have our brewhouse complete What we need now are fermentors, bright tank, kegs, packaging equipment, and a location.\nHand Built Brewing System\nWhat will the Kickstarter money be used for? \nAs you can see $30,000 doesn't go very far. Having general construction skills helps, and we will strive to make every dollar stretch. If we exceed our goals, the extra money will be utilized to improve the tasting room and start an outdoor beer garden.\nSome of our flagship beers.\nCatch 22 \nClocking in at a respectful 8.5% ABV, this Full body Imperial IPA balances a great malt character, with 6 varieties of hops. A whopping 117 IBU's isn't for everybody, but for all hop-heads it will be love at first sip.\nRock Pale Ale\nBritish Crystal Malts and 4.6% ABV makes this a very tasty session beer. At 42 IBU's it's flavorful enough to please craft enthusiasts, but not overly hopped for less developed pallets.\nA Hard Place Stout\nA simple but tasty Stout. If you love the darker brews this is right up your alley. 5.3% ABV and only 33 IBU's.\nBetween a Rock and A Hard Place\nOur version of a black and tan. Only available for growler fills at the brewery.\nQuandary \nLike nothing you've ever had! Korean rice beer. Milky white in color with just enough hops to classify it as beer. If your looking for something unique this is a must have.\nStandoff Porter\nRich and robust. Clean dry finish. Aroma's of roasted coffee with hints of vanilla. 5.6% ABV and 40 IBU's.\nThe Angry Pilgrim\nSpiced sweet potato beer! This full body brew is our fall seasonal. Similar in taste to a pumpkin beer, but sweeter with milder spice. 8.2% ABV.\nRewards.\nCoaster\nBartender Bottle Opener\nTee Design\nGrowler\nIsn't this growler awesome\nWhat is Kickstarter and how does it work?\nKickstarter is a crowd-funding platform for creative projects. It gives everyone the opportunity to play a part in the success of a project such as Deadlock Brewing Company. Kickstarter is an all or nothing platform which means if we are unable to achieve our $30,000 goal by July 31st 2014, you aren't charged and we get nothing. But, if we exceed our goal, then we are that much closer to making this dream a reality!\nPledging to our endeavor is simple:\nCreate a profile on Kickstarter (all you need is an email address).\nCreate an account on Amazon (if you don't already have one). This is where payments are processed.\nPick your reward level and help support a great local new business.\nSo tell your friends, family, neighbors, coworkers, congressman, therapist, anyone and everyone you know.

Societies change.  When Russian playwright Anton Chekhov wrote \"On The Dangers Of Tobacco\" in 1902, which characterizes a man on the brink of a nervous breakdown, he addressed pressing social issues of his time period and the society he was a part of.  For over a century, Chekhov's brilliant comedic monologue has captivated audiences around the world, and will continue to do so as time moves forward.  With this understanding, we believe that the work can transcend the time and place in which it was written.  We propose to present an alternative version that lampoons contemporary western issues.  We titled it, \"On The Dangers Of Marijuana.\"\nFilm Poster\nWe will take Chekhov's iconic character, Ivan Ivanovich Nyukhin, and revamp him for our own surrealistic and satirical approach to filmmaking.  Our character, whose name is I'an Smelkin Junior, is a washed up scientific writer who, like Chekhov's Ivanovich, is a henpecked man who has been conditioned to live for his wife's purposes.  His wife, who will be an integral character in our film, runs a drug rehabilitation center for women in Los Angeles, California.  I'an is routinely sent out to give lectures to Americans on the dangers of Marijuana use.  Ironically and hypocritically, I'an is an avid marijuana smoker, which lends to humorous and bizarre antics from our protagonist.  When I'an gives his lecture portrayed in our film, he and his audience, as well as the audience of the film, will experience the psychosis in stunning visual detail.\nI'an's life will exist in a dark, grotesque, satirical, and dystopic universe that becomes increasingly fantastical as he delves deeper into his marijuana-induced madness.  This is a world that is a regurgitation of our own and we will portray an American society that has been perverted by pop culture. The film will feature a variety of colorful characters that will help emphasize the philosophical questions that arise in the story.  \nUnlike many of the interpretations of Chekhov's work from the past, I'an's lecture will be presented as an odyssey of the mind and will utilize a multimedia presentation that will indulge the viewers' senses.  The film will  also analyze the life of the protagonist outside of the lecture hall through a series of flashbacks and vignettes, giving the film's audience an understanding of what causes the breakdown.  The story of I'an Smelkin Junior will be an experience not to be missed.\nWe thank you greatly for your contributions to make this film possible and look forward to presenting you with the finished product.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIt takes a lot of resources and manpower to complete a film, so every donation counts.

Pre-order at ZipSeam.com - use code Kickstarter for $5 off!\nA poorly fitted shirt or dress makes you look sloppy, lethargic, and unprofessional. The ZipSeam is a patent pending breakthrough invention that allows the user to quickly and inexpensively tailor their own shirts in the comfort of their own homes; turning any off-the-rack item into a sexy, sleek, fashion piece. \nIn an attempt to purchase collared shirts for my workplace, the only options offered were shirts of different neck sizes. The resulting shirt fit well around my neck, but my torso looked like I was wearing a one-man tent. Actually tucking in the shirt turned me into a hot air balloon, but leaving it un-tucked gave me an irresistible urge to do twirls in my button-up dress. I\u2019d always noticed a similar ballooning effect on my other collared shirts, albeit to a lesser extent.\nI wanted my shirts to fit something like this:\n\"Slim fit\"\nAll of the department stores have mannequins outfitted in sleek dress shirts, but what matters is this, which isn't immediately apparent\u2026\nFalse advertising anyone?\nA quick glance at the back of the mannequins revealed many folds of cloth, hidden from the shopper, beguiling them as to the true fit of the \u201coff the rack\u201d shirts.\nBait and switch haha!\n\u2026and so I explored options for bettering the fit of my shirts.\nTraditional tailoring is often expensive/cost ineffective, time consuming, and commonly permanent. If you were to take needle and thread to cloth, tailoring one shirt would take the average person well upwards of an hour to possibly result in a questionable result. A whole wardrobe? The thought of tailoring my entire closet is horrifyingly daunting. \nA sewing machine is faster than sewing manually, decreasing the time commitment necessary, but the initial cost at minimum is $50 for a passable machine, not to mention the steep learning curve.\nVisiting a professional tailor entails the drive there, the drive home, and then another drive there and back to pick up the finished product. Hopefully the result is satisfactory; otherwise you\u2019ll unfortunately have to plan for another trip for whenever the touch-ups are done. And at the end of the whole ordeal, expect to pony up $15-25, per shirt! \nHaving a shirt custom made will cost you even more, running anywhere from $50 to upwards of $100 per shirt. Those costs didn\u2019t fare well with my budget bruised with student loans, so I had to try something new.\nThe ZipSeam combines material and structural design to create the strongest seam without compromising flexibility and comfort. The patent pending design allows the ZipSeam to be lightweight, removable, AND reusable; users can tailor a shirt in minutes (demonstrated very clearly in the video). The ZipSeam turns clearance rack items into sleek shirts with excellent custom fits.\nComfort- Who would want to wear a piece of plastic inside their shirts? All my friends asked me that, until they tried the shirt with the ZipSeam in it. Thanks to the ridges, the ZipSeam is as flexible as your cell phone charging cord and can easily bend and flex with your body. Though it is a different feel from fabric, it is very much comfortable (I myself wore a shirt with the ZipSeam for 3 straight days). \nBefore and After\nBefore and After\nSam, who is 6'7\"\n            Ignore my enormous head and you can see the difference\nBefore and After\nI can smile!\nZipSeam bends with your body\nCloseup of the seam\nCAD design of a prototype\nOld prototypes\nPrototype\n3D printed model did not turn out too well\nDifferent materials tested.

Initially they were a stunt to try and get our name into some graphic design press - and splashed in glorious full-colour across packaging blogs. This worked, and we moved onto other projects and 'proper' runs of products for retail...\n\nWe never really got over our first project though! His memory lives on and we often get emails about our graphic design gambling work. So we'd like to rouse the Kickstarter collective once again and hope we can get enough support from designers and people-who-know-designers to be able to fund a full production run of our first project! Even if it is 2 years later...\nCMYK Playing Cards were born from the happy realisation in our studio that the maths fits! A traditional deck of playing cards consists of 4 suits with 10 cards (not including face cards). All we had to do was switch the suits for colours of ink used in printed media (cyan, magenta, yellow and black) and swap the numbers on each card for a percentage of ink on the surface. The cards are just as useful as traditional printed styles, AND perhaps most importantly, all niche and only understood by people who are in our little design world. We've tried explaining the cards to people outside the industry and were met with almost perfect poker face expressions. Our favourite kinds of products are the weird little niche things that only certain demographics (pun) will understand, and while that might not make brilliant business sense; it does seem to attract some of the most sincere people we have met.\nWe combined the opacities of ink with a strict anti-design rule. The only decoration would be made from the kinds of crop marks and registration bleeds usually never seen in the post-production world, and the various shapes, patterns and rules that never make it into a finished piece of printed media where given centre stage.\n\nMade from the finest German black-core paper, with a genuine playing card linen finish, the cards are poker spec at 63 x 88m and include a uniform back face design and matte laminated card tuck box.\n\nWe have some wonderful stretch goals in mind to push this project beyond just being another playing card goal, and we believe the people who understand this project will really enjoy owning such a design-led product.\n**UPDATE*** (28 JANUARY)\nBased on suggestions from backers we have adapted our original artwork very slightly, to improve gameplay and make the product nicer. See images below:\n\n1. HUNDRED MILLION logo removed from the back of \neach card.2.Jokers adapted to include as much fun as I could bear. Also made different so you can tell the difference between each joker. 3. Face cards - added a diagonal line which gets thicker. Jack 0.5pt, Queen 1.5pt, King 2.5pt - this will enable people to tell the difference quickly and separate them from the 100% card - and also reflects the traditional layout of a face card, as minimally as possible.\nUpdated spread design\nClose up of CYAN face cards, jokers and back design changes\n _____________________________________________________________\n**Giant THANK YOU to The super-talented Kenneth Aidan Foo for his video flicking our playing cards about. We are forever in your debt (like any good gamblers).** ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and challenges we have faced have so far centred around the facts. With a product so focussed on the technical and the proof - it was vital not to mess up any overprints or even have slightly the wrong colour; Pure cyan, magenta, yellow and black sound easy to achieve, but the reality of getting the registration correct on so many opacities of so many colours was much more difficult. We spent time finding a factory that could consistently re-produce exact percentages of ink and keep the small print-design details that would typically be ironed out.\n\nOne of our biggest obstacles (as always in a project like this) was logic! Though the cards function just the same as a normal deck, we were concerned that some of the lower opacities in the Yellow suit in particular; could be difficult to read. We experimented with adapting the print, using a black stroke around the numbers, drop shadows, patterns to make the number of the cards more prominent - but they all looked upsetting, and went against the purity of the point. In the end we decided to let the whole flavour of the 20% opacities speak for the card, rather than just the number in the corner. So users become accustomed to which density of ink is which number, in a much more instinctive way.\n\nAnother challenge has been our previous project, we ran a Sugar Skull Spoon (http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hundredmillion/sugar-skull-spoon) funding period in late 2013, and the reward fulfilment management overlapped this work. It was a lot difficult to manage both the reward procedure for the previous piece, and the planning and pricing and supplying of this project, but we have endeavoured to not let one affect the other, and we believe this is a challenge we can meet effectively.\n\nI am confident we have chosen a manufacturer more than capable of delivering this finished product at a quality we are happy with, and are trying to finalise stretch goals from our other suppliers - the usual pitfalls lie ahead of us for those and we promise to keep you informed as they occur, but without giving away too much of our surprise until it is time!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "A new name, and a new game!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #9", "update_userinfo": "New project launched!

With proprietary patent pending Grid & Switch Sensor technology, the SmartCharge\u2122 Bulb senses a power outage, recognizes the ON/OFF position of your light switch and allows control of the light even with no utility/grid power. When the power goes out, the lights go out. The garage door won\u2019t open, kitchen appliances won\u2019t work, and the lamps in your house are useless. But with the SmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs, you\u2019ll never have to worry about being in the dark again. Your lights will continue to operate and even better, you can control them with your wall and lamp switches.\nSimply Replace Your Old Bulbs\nSimply replace any existing light bulb with a SmartCharge\u2122 LED Bulb. \nThere\u2019s no extra wiring, no ugly control box, no remote control or expensive electrical installation required.\nNever notice a power outage - Like nothing happened\nWith SmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs, you won\u2019t even notice a power outage because the SmartCharge\u2122 Bulb will continue to provide you with light. Turn On/Off your SmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs by using the same light switch \u2013 it\u2019s like a power outage never happened.\n\"Turn ON/OFF From The Same Switch Even During Power Outage\"\nSeems Like Magic - But it's Our Grid & Switch Sensor Technology  \nThe heart of the SmartCharge\u2122 Bulb is our patent pending Grid & Switch Sensor technology. It is capable of distinguishing between a loss of power due to opening of the line switch and a loss of power resulting from a grid failure when the line switch is either open or close.\n\nWe put a battery, control technology, intelligence, CPU, memory, inverter, and a printed circuit board all inside the light bulb assembly to make it smart and efficient. \n  From the outside it looks like a normal LED light bulb.\n\n\nGrid & Switch Sensor technology consists of three blocks:\nA. Intelligent control circuit with grid sense and switch sense \nB. Battery and battery charging circuit\nC. Inverter along with few other elements\nThe result, an intelligent light bulb, which is immune to grid power. It always knows, even during a power failure, the wall switch position and turns the bulb ON or OFF based on that position. \nIf switch was ON when power failed, then the SmartCharge\u2122 Bulb will remain ON.\nIf switch was OFF, the SmartCharge\u2122 Bulb will remain OFF.\nDuring a power outage, the switch still has control of the light bulb.\nThe following chart compares a SmartCharge\u2122 LED Bulb to traditional bulbs in the market today:\nAdditionally, unlike other safety light bulbs that automatically switch on when the power goes out - regardless if you are in the room - the SmartCharge\u2122 Bulb recognizes the light switch\u2019s position to conserve its power and only draws from the battery when needed (unlike other \u201cemergency lights\").  Once power is restored, the bulb\u2019s battery recharges itself to make sure you\u2019re ready for another power outage or emergency.\nEnergy Efficient \u2013 Environment Friendly - Long Lasting\nThe SmartCharge\u2122 Bulb helps cut electricity usage for lighting by up to 90%, saving you money and reducing the impact on the environment.\nSmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs are also long lasting, rated up to 40,000 hours or 25 years of life.\nEndless Use \u2013 Anywhere \u2013 Everywhere\nConvenience at its Best\nWhen the power goes out, the whole house goes dark except for rooms using SmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs, which stay on, or are ready to be turned on in another room if needed. \n\"Peace of Mind\" for Everyone\n. \nBe prepared for that test tomorrow.\nYou won\u2019t have to look for a flashlight, candles, or emergency lamp.  You do what you do normally \u2013 just turn on the switch and the light comes ON. \nSmartCharge\u2122 is ideal for a porch light, because if the power goes out in your neighborhood, the light on your porch will stay ON. \nMake neighbors wonder!\nEvolution & Current Status\nWe started working on this technology about 2 years ago. After many iterations and prototypes, we have working samples.  \nWe used standard LED lighting components and finished the design of our final version (industrial design, hardware & firmware). We worked extensively with our manufacturing partner to come with optimal design which is not only compact and elegant but takes care of all the issues in LED lighting like heat sink, optics and power management. We have finished our industrial design and tooling has started. \nOur next step is to produce the first batch of SmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs for UL listing and final testing. While our bulb is under the Underwriter's Laboratory (UL) approval process, we will start initial production planning.\nThe current version of the SmartCharge\u2122 Bulb is limited to one bulb and one switch control.  The ideal applications are table lamp, floor lamp, or overhead single bulb fixtures.  It works for 2 way and 3 way switches but a switch can control only one bulb in the circuit.  We are working on the enhanced technology where one switch can control all lights connected to it.   \nWe have designed the bulb to work on 110 V - 240 V and it comes with  E 26, E 27 and B 22 base socket types.\nWho we are?\nWe are a small start up company with two employees right now. We designed and prototype our concept by a very reputable design company in India. Then we started working with a world class LED bulb manufacturer in China who integrated our technology inside the 5W LED light bulb. Currently they are working on final prioritization and UL approval process. \nWe're focused on developing great consumer products, which bring \"Peace of mind\". We aim to pioneer the emerging world of LED lighting with our technology, by making products in the consumer and small business lighting space providing safety and convenience. We were founded in 2012, and the 5 W SmartCharge\u2122 LED Bulb is our first product.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nPart of the idea behind the lean startup is to prove demand, and build products in a rapid, user-centered design cycle. By reaching out on Kickstarter, we can assess our demand, build a stronger relationship with our early adopters, and use feedback to make our product as amazing as possible.\nUse of Funds\nWe've built our prototypes and figured out our supply chain. We need your help to take the next step. Kickstarter funds will be used towards putting SmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs into production. We're experienced in this field and have led the development and manufacturing of many hardware products in previous companies, including the GasWatch (Propane Tank Gauge) and iFi Smart Tag (a Bluetooth proximity sensor device) so we know what it takes to take a concept and turn it into reality. By supporting SmartCharge\u2122 on this platform, you get in early and get a premium product ahead of everyone else.\n\nWe\u2019re asking you to help us make SmartCharge\u2122 LED Bulb a reality.\nTimeline \nNovember 2013: Complete schematic and PCB design. Finalize Industrial design and firmware. Begin tooling.   \nJanuary 2014: Tooling completed. First set of T1 samples produced. Start UL Listing process. \nFebruary 2014: Order PCB and components. Finalize tooling. Develop packaging. \nMarch 2014: UL Testing Complete. First batch of SmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs produced. \nApril 2014: Ship out SmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs to Kickstarter supporters\nManufacturing \nWe have partnered with one of the leading manufacturers of LED light bulbs in the world as having a world-class manufacturing partner is the key to a quality product. To keep cost down, we are using existing LED light bulb and integrating our technology inside. We are also planning to develop our own grid and switch sensor technology customized circuit boards. \nThanks For Your Support \nWe've dedicated hundreds of hours thinking about the technical aspects of the project and how to deliver the world's smartest light bulb which truly provides \"Peace of Mind\" at an affordable price.  Now you can help bring SmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs to the world by being among the very first to own a SmartCharge\u2122 LED Bulb!\nEach SmartCharge\u2122 Bulb is ready to install in a standard  light bulb fixture right out of the box with no assembly or wiring; simply replace the bulb! They are available in following Base Type:\nE 26 - North America\nE 27 - Europe\nB 22 - UK, India and Other countries\nWe are working on more options for different sizes of household & commercial lighting and other applications of our grid and switch sensor Technology.  We\u2019d like to hear from you if you have a recommendation. \nOur Vision: \"Peace of Mind\"\n\"In this electronics age, besides impact on economic growth,  the quality of human life depends on electricity almost as much as on food and shelter.\"\nThe SmartCharge\u2122 LED bulb answers an important need \u2013 a way to insure that you\u2019ll never be in the dark during a power outage.  Everyone in the world depends upon light bulbs to go about their daily activities. But regular light bulbs and switches do not work during power outages. We are dependent on candles, flashlights and other emergency lighting when the power goes out. During outages, productivity is lost and accidents happen.  Most light bulbs are based on century old technology and are not energy efficient, which impacts our environment.  SmartCharge\u2122 Bulbs are not only energy efficient, smarter, and last longer - they ensure that you won't be left in the dark during a power outage.

The Nine Dots team will log on to the game every evening at 8pm.\nGoD Factory: Wingmen is still a work in progress. There are still many aspects that will be modified before the \"gold\" release, estimated to launch in March 2014.\nNote that this free version will be available only for the duration of the Kickstarter campaign. Anyone who buys the game will also gain access to the alpha and beta. You can start playing the game right now and if you back us, you'll be able to keep on playing for as long as you want.\n\nPress quotes\n\"GoD Factory Wingmen was one of the more interesting titles I checked out at PAX\"\n- TotalBiscuit\n\"Quite how multiplayer space-combat dogfighters vs capital-ship game GoD Factory: Wingmen hasn\u2019t raised the mere $70,000 Kickstarter ask is beyond me.\"\n- Jim Rossignol, Rock Paper Shotgun\n\"The first game in 15 years that's going to make me buy a joystick for my PC\"\n- James Portnow, Extra Credits\n\"Two of the hottest things in gaming right now are MOBAs and the Oculus Rift. When you take those two things and whip in a spicy dash of sci-fi space combat, it's hard not to get a tad excited. To the point of twitching.\"\n- Jarimor, ZAM\n\"There is nothing simple about GoD Factory. I got my first taste of the game at Pax East 2013, and I can truthfully say that the game is as deep as it is beautiful.\"\n- Alex Coccia, GreenlitGaming\n\"The space shooter genre has been sorely missing in action since the critically acclaimed X-Wing vs. TIE Fighter in the early 90's. After my time with GoD Factory at PAX East, I think GoD Factory is as close as we've come to that experience since so many years ago.\"\n- Dave Voyles, former Armless Octopus Managing Editor\nWhat is GoD Factory: Wingmen?\nGoD Factory: Wingmen is played through fast-paced and intensely tactical 4 vs 4 player matches, where the aim is to destroy the enemy's 13km long Carrier before it wrecks yours; all under the relentless fire of enemy players and point-defense turrets.\nYou play as mercenary pilots who constantly improve and customize their gunships between battles. Completing a match earns you credits according to your performance, which are used to purchase increasingly powerful and exotic parts.\nThere are 4 playable species in GoD Factory: the ruthless Humans, the wise Guantris, the gigantic Chorions and the unnatural Ar. They each have unique ship designs, both visually and gameplay-wise. Players choose and start with two of those species and can unlock the other two during the course of their career.\nVote for us on Greenlight!\nThis is primarily a PC game, but we're also trying to bring the game to consoles. We will also have Mac and Linux versions, with the ability to play with your friends no matter what OS they are using. You'll be happy to know that this game is not hardware intensive, so if you have a decent PC, even if it's a few years old, it should be able to run the game. We are working hard to make GoD Factory:Wingmen accessible to as many players as we can, without sacrificing the beauty of the visuals. We're already able to run the game quite decently on 5 years old laptops, so we're pretty confident that we'll be supporting a wide range of computers.\nKey Features:\nMETHODICAL DESTRUCTION\nTo win a match, you and your team must wreck the enemy Carrier's components. Each one that your team destroys cripples the enemy players in unique ways; wrecking their Carrier's Radar reduces their detection range, for example. Which Carrier parts your team destroys, as well as the destruction order, is one of the most important parts of the game.\nESSENTIAL COOPERATION\nTeam play is your most powerful weapon. Taking down the massive carriers or finishing off an isolated enemy player requires concerted effort. Well organized teams can even trigger powerful elemental combos on their targets by firing complementary weapons.\nGAME-CHANGING ABILITIES\nGunships come equipped with a great number of special abilities. Ranging from teleportation to the creation of holographic decoys, GoD Factory offers a deep tactical gameplay that's light-years beyond simply firing your weapons until the target explodes.\nDOUBLE GUNSHIPS\nUniquely to GoD Factory, you do not bring a single machine to the battlefield. Rather you build and use two gunships in each match. Each gunship is made from 12 different category of parts, so a player chooses 24 different parts to bring to a match. In addition, players can borrow their teammates' gunships and try different builds.\nVISIT YOUR SHIP DEALER\nWith over 1000 different gunship parts, you can precisely tailor your ships to your playstyle and to your team's strategy. Buying a part belonging to one species may unlock it for other species, letting the player mix and match a variety of normally separate parts. A player can also customize the colors his ship with a high degree of control.\nOCULUS AND JOYSTICK SUPPORT\nGoD Factory allows players with special hardware to have an even more immersive experience. A first person cockpit view is available to all players, but is particularly enjoyable with the Oculus Rift. The game also support a wide variety of gamepads and controls schemes.\nA good game isn't just a set of features however, it's an experience, and it has to be approached like one. We're orienting ourselves on four key aspects of the experience that we'd like to deliver:\n(Taken straight from the Game Design Document!)\nCreate\nThe player wants to feel that he's doing his own thing. He's crafting a ship that fits his preferences, he works on making a play style and strategy of his own. He wants to build his squad by joining like-minded players. Everything must come with a sense of ownership.\nFly\nWe need to convey a sense of mobility to the player. He must be picturing himself moving into a 3D space with both skill and freedom, the ability to go wherever he feels like. The movement of the ship and the camera must give to players the reflex to tilt their heads to follow their ship's motion. They want to feel \u201cthere\u201d.\nCooperate\nAny player wants to feel like he's playing an important part in his team. In order to do so, we must reward every actions done as a group and make sure that victory is achieved when everyone acts toward a common goal. In order to convince the player to be a team player, he must feel the presence of his allies in the fight.\nImprove\nAn aspect that will hook our players is the strong sense of progression when playing the game. Not only will his ships become better as he plays, but learning the complex systems and the meta-game will always give him something more to learn. One reason to keep playing is that you always get better.\nIt also helps that we have a very talented team to make the visuals of the game. Etienne Vanier, our lead artist, made a short video on the artistic direction of the game, showing how much thought and care we've put in it.\nThe Oculus Rift is a virtual reality headset that was immensely successful here on Kickstarter. VR replaces your vision by the environment of the game by placing monitors in front of each eye. Motion tracking and stereoscopic 3D make this even more convincing.\nOculus Rift is not ideal for every game because it completely replaces your vision. For a game with a character that walks and jumps, it can feel a bit awkward as the player is sitting in a chair. However the experience from GoD: Wingmen is within a cockpit, creating the perfect environment for simulation.\nIt is our intent to support the Oculus Rift for GoD Factory and we hope that we'll be ready on time for launch.\nNine Dots is a team of 7 developers working full time. We've got two programmers, three artists, one game designer/studio manager and a recently added game designer. Most of us have been working on this game for a year now with no salary. Before that, we had worked on a different game, Brand for over a year, also with no salary. So needless to say, we're a bunch of extremely committed developers doing all we can to make a great games!\nThe team and some loved ones :-)\nNine Dots was created to fight back against management practices from the game industry which we think are holding us back. We want to change how we make games, and what games we make. We are vehemently against crunch time, we believe in building our own intellectual properties rather than working on the projects of others and we make sure that everyone has a meaningful creative input on the game. If you want to read more about this mission, we were featured in a related article on the Penny Arcade Report not long ago.\nWe are giving everything we have to make this project a reality. However, sometimes that's not enough. We have a very solid alpha, which was thoroughly enjoyed by hundreds over hundreds of people during PAX East.\nHowever, we might be unable to bring the game to completion. We've been working for 2 years at Nine Dots now, without salary. Our personal savings and resources are spreading thin, and even though we haven't paid ourselves salaries, we still have business related bills to pay. We have to pay for insurances, rent, licenses and many other things to sustain the business. We are surviving on a $25,000 bank loan, but that won't suffice.\nWe need to buy music and sound effects, we need enough to pay the office rent and other day-to-day expenditures, we need funds for marketing (such as going to conventions, some banner space, trailers, travels, etc) and of course we need some money ourselves as developers to stay afloat. We'll start selling the game right after this kickstarter, but it will be an incomplete version. We still have work until probably March of 2014 before we're done implementing all the core features we'd want for the game. We intend to deliver a steady flow of updates but that requires resources, and that's where backers come in.\nAll our backers will also be thanked in the game's credits.\nPledge $1 or more: Supporter\nPledge $15 or more: Early Bird\nPledge $20 or more: Rookie Pilot\nAnyone who makes a pre-order of the game also buys his way into the alpha that will be released in October. You also get an exclusive cosmetic addition only available to backers: a Wing Lamp that adds a flare effect in front of your ship.\nPledge $30 or more: Certified Pilot\nWe made four unique ships, one for each species, available only to kickstarter backers and early buyers (but Kickstarter backers get it at a discount). These ships are made from the three major visual ship parts, which are the wings, the hull and the cockpit.\nWe also add to the mix a highly reflective, unique \"Super-Copper\" material that you can apply to any of your ships.\nPledge $50 or more: True Wingman\nGet 4 licenses, so that you may share the game with your friends. They will all have access to the alpha and beta.\nYou also get the exclusive \"Super-Silver\" material to apply to your ship and a vanity item that will add a blazing fire to your trails. \nPledge $100 or more: Veteran Wingman\nNot only do you get all the previous rewards, you also get all future expansions and DLC to the game. We intend to support the game for a while and frequently update with new content, and it will all be available to you without spending one dime more. You also get all 4 unique ships, and the unique super-gold material to apply to your ship.\nPledge $250 or more: Galactic Superstar\nThere are big billboards on space stations and satellites that will appear in some level environments. These billboards will shuffle through a bank of images. You get to provide us with an image of your choice (we need to approve of the image first) and your image will be displayed on those billboards. You would like to promote your own game? You want to make a joke to make our players laugh? You like kittens? Show it on our billboards!\nYou also get a vanity item that alters your ship by adding bigDiamond gemsto your ship.\nPledge $400 or more: The Astronomer\nYou get to design your own stellar Constellation, which all players will see in the sky surrounding the battlefield. You will have a maximum of 12 stars for your constellation. Note that not every constellation will necessarily appear at the same time in every match.\nYou will also get a Vanity Item that produces an Ornate Luminous Haloon your ship.\nPledge $1000 or more: The Terraformer\nFor this amount, you can either design a custom Planet that will be up for everyone to see in the game *or* a custom Vanity Item, similar to the other vanity rewards such as fire trails, diamond chunks, star flares in front of your wings, etc. Tell us what you'd like to see, if it's reasonable we'll do it. We won't do anything offensive or which concerns intellectual properties we do not own the rights to. The planet will not appear in every match and will be one of the randomly shuffled level element.\nPledge $2000 or more: Patron of the GoDly arts\nDesign a GoD Monument (instead of a Planet or a Vanity Item), which are absolutely ASTRONOMICAL statues or monuments. These colossi have a big visual impact on levels, even more so than planets or space stations, and will usually be the main piece in a level environment. Just like the planet, the GoD Monument will not appear in every match. It will be one of the random elements that composes a level's environment. Believe us, all players take notice when a GoD is there. In some cases, we might even be able to animate the GoD monument, depending on the complexity of the concept.\nPledge $5000 or more: Fleet Admiral\nDesign a new Carrier Cannon (instead of a planet, vanity item or GoD) This cannon will have its own unique shape and projectile special FX. You also choose whether this cannon will only appear on your side when you're part of a match, or if every player in the game has access to it.\nPledge $8000 or more: The Omnipotent\nFor this much, we actually make a game that will be available in our game. In the Crew Quarter menu, where a player can see his stats, trophies and codex entries, there will be an arcade cabinet which can be selected to play a game. This game will be your idea, which must not take more than 2 weeks to make. We'll discuss this at length to make sure it ends up being something you're satisfied with, but you need to have realistic expectations. This arcade cabinet will be available for any player to try.\n___________________\nWe are open to suggestions if there are other rewards you'd like to see. Note however that we want to stay away as much as possible from physical goods, as they take a LOT of resources, both in time and money, and that would detract us from our commitment to make the very best game we can.\nWe need your help, and the simple fact that you're here reading this, that you've spent time considering our project or watched the video means a lot to us. If you like what we are doing but can't afford to contribute at the moment, know that you can help us a lot by simply talking about us and sharing our Kickstarter. We're very grateful for this kind of help as well and we know all too well that sometimes you're just strapped for cash and can't help this way.\nNow let's make GoD Factory: Wingmen a reality, shall we?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nConsidering that we've been working on GoD Factory for over a year with no salary, I think it's pretty safe to think we can bring this project to completion if we get the cash and the support we need from our backers.

We are ready, more than ever, to take on this challenge.\n\nWe have no intention of dropping the ball. Our entire company is dedicated to this project. We're betting the farm on this project, we can't allow it to fail. So we'll do everything we can to be successful and worthy of your support.\n\nWith all that being said, it is possible that we'd delay the game and/or some rewards.

If we were funding it purely based on our personal savings & residual royalties from our previous games, we'd have to make serious cuts to the scope & polish of the game. By coming to kickstarter, we'll be able to deliver the awesome game we're picturing in our minds while hopefully being able to involve the community more in the game-making process.\nSo how are we planning on using the projected $100,000? Here's a rough estimate:\nIn addition to any money raised through this kickstarter, we'll also be adding our own money from revenue of our previous games to the pile.\nWhat if the kickstarter gets overfunded? We don't know about you, but we hate it when kickstarters get a lot more money than they expected, drastically increase the scope of the game, and end up pushing the release date back months or even years. What's worse, some of these kickstarters drastically underestimate how much all those new features are going to end up costing with the result that they end up running out of money before they manage to fulfill all of their promises.\nWe don't want this to happen to us!\nWith the December 2014 fulfillment date, we've given ourselves a bit of leeway as far as development time goes. If we get enough money that we decide that we can spend a couple extra months polishing up the game, we'll be able to without pushing back that date. In addition to that, we could use additional funding to increase our audio budget and hire additional help so that we can get more done without noticeably increasing our development time.\nAnd what if after all this, we end up finishing the game and still have a good chunk of money left over? How about using that extra money to develop some free post-release DLC? We've released some major free DLC for our previous games (the alternate storyline in Cthulhu Saves the World & the Epilogue scenario in Precipice of Darkness 3) so we'd be game for doing something similar with Cosmic Star Heroine. Maybe a separate mini-Roguelike mode ala Lufia 2's Ancient Cave...\nEDIT: Note, we've improved some of the higher tier rewards from what these charts indicates. You can read about the changes here.\nIf you would like to customize your reward tier and add additional physical rewards to your pledge, you can!

What's your name?\u201d \u2013Martin O\u2019Donnell, pg. 9 of Steel Town\n\u201cCaptain Heinde emerges from the barge and steps onto the gangplank.\u201d \u2013pg. 17 of Steel Town\nDarren Shahlavi will play Hugh O'Donnell, oldest of the three brothers and leader of the strikers\nMatthew Stannah will play Martin O'Donnell, the middle brother, hotheaded but loyal.\nTy Kunzelman will play Carey O'Donnell, the youngest brother, with an unbeatable spirit.\nChris Kies will play John Potter, the Homestead mill superintendent, steadfast and earnest. Check out the video below for a spotlight on the character JOHN POTTER:\nThe inspiration for Steel Town stems from an appreciation for the strength of character of individuals on both sides of the conflict, including the rags-to-riches robber barons of the Gilded Age, like Andrew Carnegie and Henry Clay Frick, and the blue-collar champions of the workers, like strike leader Hugh O\u2019Donnell. I wish to remind audiences of the heroism embedded in the nameless Pittsburgh steelworkers whose backbreaking work shaped our country westward and skyward. This work will aim to shed light on both sides of the conflict. By presenting the story as a dramatic film with high production quality, I aim to prompt an important dialogue on the relationship between capital and labor in the context of past tragedies and triumphs.\nI have loved movies ever since I saw Toy Story in 1995. Pixar has always been my biggest inspiration simply because of how well they craft their stories. If you can make someone love a lamp in under a minute, you can do almost anything. I take this appreciation into every film I direct, and while Steel Town is very different from a Pixar movie, the same golden rule always applies: tell a great story.\nWhat will your donation help pay for? Here is a complete budget breakdown for our entire film, down to the last cent. If we don't raise at least $15,000 on Kickstarter, we can't make Steel Town.\nWe've already begun work on several aspects of the production. For example, we've cooperated with local filmmaker Alan Jaskiewicz on set construction for the barges that will carry the Pinkerton Detectives down the Monongahela toward their final confrontation with the strikers at Homestead. \nAlan Jaskiewicz directs a music video for the band Secret Eyes, on a set that will double as the barge which the Pinkertons ride to Homestead.\nWe are also collaborating with area experts and historians, such as Ron Baraff, Director of Museum Collections and Archives for the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area. Ron is our main contact for Carrie Furnace, a former blast furnace which is now open to the public in an effort to educate on the history of steel. Kickstarter funds will go toward shooting the opening scene of the film, the steel mill explosion, at Carrie Furnace.\nAs we continue with the production process, we will add updates to the page. Please check back for exciting announcements about cast, crew and equipment additions, as well as screening plans!\nNICOLAS HURT - WRITER / DIRECTOR / PRODUCER\nNick has produced multiple independent short films, including The Perils of Growing Up Flat-Chested, an official selection of the Palm Springs International ShortFest and winner of the 2012 Steeltown Film Factory competition, as well as First Kiss, an official selection of the 2012 HollyShorts Film Festival.

This will be a studio recording (not a live recording).  Our hope is to be able to obtain funding for our stretch goals so we can produce a full length live concert motion picture as well.  Over the past decade Video Games Live has helped to legitimize video game music and has shown the world the creative, cultural and artistic side of gaming. Although VGL has obtained a lot of accolades and success, the music industry and record companies are VERY different and no music or record company is willing to invest the budget needed to accomplish our goals and put out a top quality product that we and the entire game industry can be proud of. They don't believe in the culturally artistic significance of video game music and they don't believe that people are interested in listening after the game is turned off.  And that's where YOU come in!\n\nThis project is open for funding for EVERYWHERE AND EVERYONE in the world!  We will ship anywhere and there will be absolutely no region coding, etc.  PAL versions of the DVD/Blu-Ray will be made.\nVideo Games Live: Level 3 will be the 3rd album of symphonic & rock video game music from the award winning 10 year+ world touring Video Games Live concert series.\n\nThe album will be recorded in a world famous recording studio with a 60 - 72+ piece orchestra, 60+ person choir and full rock band consisting of world famous game composers from around the world.\n\nEach music segment in Video Games Live is personally arranged and orchestrated by the original composers and also uses input from the actual game designers & producers and game developers & publishers.\n\nThe album track list will consist of NEVER BEFORE RELEASED Video Games Live music arrangements from potential game franchises such as Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger/Cross, Shadow of the Colossus, Skyrim, Journey, Monkey Island, Destiny, DOTA, Assassin's Creed, Earthworm Jim, Silent Hill, Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, Super Smash Bros., Metroid, Donkey Kong Country, Mass Effect, Katamari Damacy, World of Warcraft, StarCraft, Diablo, BioShock, Beyond Good & Evil, Metal Gear Solid, Street Fighter II, Uncharted, Portal, Tetris, Red Dead Redemption, Devil May Cry, Megaman, Soul Calibur, Resident Evil, Pac-Man AND MORE!

Here is just a small sampling of some of the people whose work will be featured on VIDEO GAMES LIVE: LEVEL 3!\n\nWe want to film the new Blu-Ray/DVD/motion picture in Latin America during our big tour beginning at the end of September (Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Mexico City).  The fans in Latin America are VERY loud, VERY excited and VERY passionate about Video Games Live.  Here is just a small taste of what it is like at a Video Games Live show in Latin America!\nWHERE'S THE MONEY GOING?\nThe album will take at least 2 full studio days to record.  An orchestral recording of this nature is based on 3 hour sessions.  We will need a total of FOUR 3 hour sessions (12 hours total).  Salary costs for top of the line highly skilled orchestra musicians range between $350 - $500 per person per 3 hour session.  For a 72 piece orchestra the cost for a 2 day session (just for the musicians) can easily reach $125,000 - $150,000.  Choir is another big consideration and choir budgets can widely vary anywhere from a few thousand dollars to $20,000.  A top-of-the-line recording studio (including ALL costs) will be approximately $5,000 per day ($10,000 total).  Mixing with a top Hollywood film (& game) audio engineer (one week including studio and assistants) = approximately $15,000.  Mastering will take place at the most famous Mastering Studio in Hollywood (Bernie Grundman's) by one of the most highly regarded mastering engineers in the business... Patricia Sullivan. Patricia has personally worked with and mastered films by John Williams (including Star Wars & Indiana Jones films), James Newton Howard, James Horner, Danny Elfman, Hans Zimmer, John Powell and Mark Isham.  Mastering budget for this type of project could go upwards to $7,500.  Other parts of the budget will include things like Album Art ($5,000), CD manufacturing based on 7,500 initial units ($5,000), Music Licensing/Mechanical Licensing to the Game Publishers, composers, right holders, etc. based on 7,500 initial units ($15,000), Kickstarter & Amazon fees (10% = $25,000), hiring of a PR firm in both North America and Europe, Shipping & Handling of goods, added physical products at certain tier levels, etc.\n\nMusicians (symphony & choir) = $130,000 - $160,000\nRecording Studio = $10,000\nMixing = $15,000\nMastering = $7,500\nAlbum Art/Liner Notes = $5,000\nCD Manufacturing = $5,000\nMusic Licensing/Publishing/Mechanicals = $15,000\nKickstarter/Amazon fees = $25,000\nProject PR (Worldwide) & Marketing (Advertising) = $15,000\nDomestic U.S. Shipping & Handling of Rewards = $5,000\nPhysical Reward products (hats, print-outs, keychains, etc.) = $12,500\nLocation Rental & Celebration Events = $5,000\nTOTAL = Approximately $275,000\n\nVideo Games Live is not making any money from this project.  Our goal is to continue doing what we love and bringing it to the people who care (as well as introducing game music to people who don't!)  In fact, Video Games Live and Tommy Tallarico will be personally helping to fund the project outside of the Kickstarter campaign.  The initial $250,000 does NOT cover all of the expenses associated with the project.\nVideo Games Live has produced 2 highly successful and Top 10 Billboard ranked albums in the past as well as a Top 10 worldwide released PBS Special and DVD/Blu-Ray.  Tommy Tallarico was the very first video game composer EVER to release a worldwide video game soundtrack album (back in 1994 with Capitol Records) and has composed and produced 10 highly acclaimed albums since.  This project will NOT go over budget and WILL be delivered on time!\nThe main idea behind our project is to give back as much as possible to donors by AT LEAST QUADRUPLING THE VALUE of the amount pledged!  You can also view our epically long REWARDS VIDEO below that details, shows and explains all of the different Tiers (Reward video does not include the ALL DIGITAL tiers as they were not available when the video was created).\n\nRewards Video:\nNOTE: Reward video does not include the ALL DIGITAL tiers or the STAGE 1-3 tier or WARP ZONE 2 as they were not available when the video was created.\n\nHere's a handy text based matrix for all the Reward Tiers!

Upon funding of this goal, EVERYONE who pledges will get a special and exclusive digital version of this documentary (we ask our fans to please NOT publish this publicly out of respect for the people who backed the project).\n  $750,000 - A live full length feature film and documentary of the music, making-of, interviews with composers/designers, history of game music, etc. to be recorded during the upcoming Video Games Live Latin America tour taking place this fall.  If we hit the $750,000 stretch goal then all tiers from $25 and up will receive a digital version of the film and all tiers from $40 and up will include a physical Blu-Ray/DVD combo of the movie!\n\nTO BE CLEAR... The VIDEO GAMES LIVE: LEVEL 3 album will be a studio recording and NOT a live recording.  The movie on the other hand WILL be a live video recording (and documentary) of a number of shows filmed in Latin America.  Depending on funding and stretch goals, we may include a special download album of the live recordings from the film as well.\nThe main goal of Tommy Tallarico (23 year video game composer veteran and creator/producer of Video Games Live\u2122) has always been to prove to the world how culturally significant and artistic video games have become as well as helping to usher in a whole new generation of people to appreciate the arts.\n\nPlease watch this very informative and important video that will give you incredible insight as to what goes on in creating such an event and the passion behind it (courtesy of Game Informer).\nIncorporated in 2002, Video Games Live\u2122 is the first and most successful video game touring concert in the world having already performed over 275 shows in 27 countries on 5 continents. Over 1 million people have experienced the show live. Video Games Live\u2122 has previously released 2 albums worldwide (both of which debuted in the Billboard Top 10) as well as an award winning full length feature DVD/Blu-Ray. In 2010 the show aired nationally on PBS and quickly became one of the top rated PBS Specials of all time. Video Games Live\u2122 continues to break new ground and thrill audiences worldwide with brand new content each year.\nPress Quotes\n\"Captivating!

He is considered the person most instrumental in changing the game industry from bleeps & bloops to real music now appreciated worldwide by tens of millions of fans.  As a well-recognized on-air television personality, live performer and composer, Tommy brings his in-depth knowledge, years of experience, and love of cutting edge multimedia and video games to the masses.  Tommy has worked in the gaming industry as a designer, product manager, producer, writer, games tester and heads of both music and video departments.\n\nAn accomplished musician, Tallarico has been writing music for video games for more than 23 years.  He has won over 50 industry awards and has worked on more than 300 game titles; to date, they total sales of more than 100 million units and over four billion dollars in revenue.  No one in the history of the video game industry has ever worked on more titles and projects.  In 2008, he was enshrined in the Guinness Book of World Records with a two page feature article and interview and currently holds 3 Guinness World Records including the person who has worked on the most commercially released video games.  In 2012 during the Game Developers Conference he received a Lifetime Achievement Award and is also in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington D.C. for his contributions to the game industry.  In 1994, he founded Tommy Tallarico Studios, the multimedia industry's largest audio production house.    Tommy is a cousin of rock star legend Steven Tyler (nee Tallarico) and in 2002 Tallarico\u2019s music was used as the opening song for Aerosmiths' \u201cGirls of Summer\u201d world tour.  His top titles include Earthworm Jim, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Disney\u2019s Aladdin, Spider-Man and Metroid Prime as well as top selling popular game franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac-Man, Madden Football, Mortal Kombat, Time Crisis, Unreal, Lineage, James Bond, Blitz Football, Knockout Kings, Test Drive, Scooby Doo, WWE & Twisted Metal. His score for Advent Rising has been noted as \"one of the greatest musical scores of all time\" by websites such as Yahoo, Gamespot and others.\n\nTallarico has been featured on numerous national and international television shows, appearing repeatedly on CNN, FOX and MTV.  Tommy hosted, wrote and co-produced the top rated and very popular Reviews on the Run/Judgment Day television show as well as the longest running award-winning video game television show, The Electric Playground (www.elecplay.com), which has been on the air since 1997.  The show is syndicated worldwide and airs daily in prime-time.  The Electric Playground won the 2001 Telly Award for \u201cBest Entertainment Cable Program\u201d.  In 2006, Tommy hosted and helped to launch the worldwide Championship Gaming Series for DirecTV.  His national television debut came in 1994 when he was featured and asked to guest host ABC's \"In Concert\" television program which included artists Peter Gabriel and Todd Rundgren.  From 1991 to 1994, he headed Virgin Interactive\u2019s music and video division, and executive produced numerous video game green screen shoots for films including \u201cDemolition Man\u201d where he worked with Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes and Hollywood producer Joel Silver.\n\nIn 2002, Tallarico created the critically acclaimed Video Games Live (www.videogameslive.com), an immersive, audio and video concert experience celebrating video games.  Video Games Live features music from the greatest video games performed by top orchestras and choirs around the world combined with synchronized video footage, lasers, lights, special effects, interactivity and live action to create an explosive and unique one-of-a-kind entertainment experience.  Video Games Live is the first and most successful video game touring concert in the world having performed over 250 shows in 25 countries on 5 continents.  The debut performance was launched on July 6th, 2005 at the world famous Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles with the LA Philharmonic.  Over 11,000 people attended making it the biggest video game concert in the world at that time (since then they have performed to over 40,000 people in places like Taiwan and China).  Most of the game music played during the initial launch of the show (Halo, Sonic, Warcraft, Tomb Raider, Myst, Kingdom Hearts, Tron, Advent Rising, etc.) had never been performed live anywhere in the world.  Since then over 1 million people have experienced the show live.  On October 30, 2005 they broke new ground once again by putting on the very first video game concert in Canada (Vancouver).  They followed with groundbreaking first ever game concert performances in countries such as Brazil, New Zealand, Spain, Mexico, England, Chile, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Scotland, Ireland, Portugal, Poland, Wales, United Arab Emirates & France.  Video Games Live was also the very first American video game concert to perform in Asia (Korea) and the first non-Japanese game concert to perform in Japan.  In 2007 they were recipients of a major industry award in Brazil for \"Special Breakthrough Achievement\" following their performances in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo the year before.  Also in 2007 they helped to launch the $1.8 billion LA Live Nokia Theatre in downtown Los Angeles and had their national television debut on Spike TV.  In 2008 they released the highly anticipated album entitled Video Games Live - Volume One, recorded at the world famous Abbey Road Studios in London, the album debuted at #10 on the Billboard charts.  It was the first video game compilation album to ever be released worldwide and won BEST SOUNDTRACK ALBUM awards from IGN.com and the Game Audio Network Guild.  In 2010 a 90 minute national PBS Special was aired in over 90 million households across America.  A Blu-Ray, DVD and album were released.  It was the first time that music from franchises such as Mario, Zelda, Sonic and Megaman were released outside of Japan.  The second album (entitled Video Games Live - Level Two) debuted at #8 on the Billboard Charts.  With literally 100\u2019s of ticket buyer reviews on Ticketmaster.com, Video Games Live boasts an impressive and outstanding 4.6 (out of 5) rating.   There are currently over 30,000 unique videos of Video Games Live performances on YouTube which total over 100 million views.  Sponsored and endorsed by some of the top corporations in the world, the Video Games Live concert event continues to tour the world, break new ground and thrill audiences worldwide with brand new content each year.\n\nTallarico was the first musician to release a video game soundtrack worldwide (Tommy Tallarico\u2019s Greatest Hits Vol. 1 \u2013 Capitol Records).  He has released over ten video game soundtrack albums since, including the highly acclaimed James Bond Tomorrow Never Dies, MDK and award-winning Advent Rising and Earthworm Jim Anthology.  Tommy was one of the first musicians to ever use live guitar and 3-D audio in a video game (The Terminator), and was instrumental in bringing true digital interactive multi-channel 5.1 surround to the gaming world.  He has performed and sold out shows on the biggest and most prestigious stages in the world including London's Royal Festival Hall and Hammersmith Apollo, the Olympic Park Stadium in Korea, the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., WolfTrap, Hard Rock Live in Orlando, Pan-Chiao Stadium in Taipei, the Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas and multiple shows at the Hollywood Bowl attended by tens of thousands of fans.  In 2004 he performed the grand finale music act on national and worldwide television (E! Entertainment, G4TV) with BT & Mobius 8 for the G-Phoria awards show.  In 2007 he performed along with Kid Rock and the Foo Fighters during the nationally televised Spike TV Video Game Awards show.\n\nTommy is the founder, Chairman of the Board and CEO of the Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.), which is a non-profit organization educating and heightening the awareness of audio for the interactive world (www.audiogang.org).  With over 2,500 members representing over 35 countries since its inception in 2002, G.A.N.G. has quickly become known as one of the strongest and best examples of helping the game industry community.  Tommy is an Advisory Board member for the Game Developers Conference, a Governor for the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS/GRAMMY's), a spokesperson for the Entertainment Consumers Association, a proud member of the International Game Developers Association and a nominating peer panel leader for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences.\n\nTommy is involved in many community, non-profit, scholastic and charitable organizations which include the Hollywood Arts and GRAMMY In The Schools.  In 2007, Tommy's many charitable works were recognized by the Hollywood Arts organization when they chose him as the first honoree and recipient for their now annual Dream Awards.  The IDG video game industry white paper mentions Tommy (along with Bill Gates) as one of the people who contributed the most to the advancement and growth of the industry in 2003.  In 2009, he received the prestigious \"Ambassador Award\" during the Game Developers Choice Awards which was only the 2nd time the award had ever been bestowed.  That same year he was chosen as one of the Top 50 Game Industry People by Game Developers Magazine.\n\nBorn February 18, 1968 and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, he moved to Southern California on his own at age 21 to pursue a career in entertainment.  Homeless with no means of financial support, Tommy was discovered in a music store and started working in the video game industry within 3 days of arriving in California.  All 4 of his grandparents came to America from Italy in the early 1900's and instilled a great sense of hard work, compassion, appreciation, passion, dreaming, creativity, sense of accomplishment and love for others that he has carried with him his entire life.  Tommy is a proud vegan and has been a spokesperson, supporter and contributor for many animal rights organizations.  In his spare time he enjoys nature, photography, traveling, cooking, video games, comic books, backgammon, being a kid and meeting new people.  His popular website www.tallarico.com has received over 250 million hits by more than 10 million unique users.\nHere is the video of Tommy's recent TED talk explaining the cultural significance of video games and they're importance as art.\nTommy playing Intellivision circa 1982", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nVideo Games Live has produced 2 highly successful and Top 10 Billboard ranked albums in the past as well as a Top 10 worldwide released award winning PBS Special and DVD/Blu-Ray. Tommy Tallarico was the very first video game composer EVER to release a worldwide video game soundtrack album (back in 1994) and has composed and produced 10 highly acclaimed albums since. This project will NOT go over budget and WILL be delivered on time!\n\nBecause we have done this same kind of project multiple times in the past, we know exactly what the challenges for this project are (and how to overcome them). The toughest part in doing the project will be to get the game publishers approvals for the project. That being said, Video Games Live was the FIRST in the world to officially perform music from game franchises such as Kingdom Hearts, Halo, Warcraft, Sonic, Myst, Tron, Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider, StarCraft, Diablo, Civilization, God of War, Skyrim, BioShock, Mass Effect, Silent Hill, Shadow of the Colossus, Assassin's Creed, Uncharted, Street Fighter, Megaman, Resident Evil, Tetris, Earthworm Jim, Journey, DOTA, Red Dead Redemption, Destiny, Monkey Island and MANY MORE! Video Games Live was also the FIRST to license music and synchronized video for an album and DVD/Blu-Ray release outside of Japan from companies such as Nintendo, Capcom, Sony, Konami and Sega!\n \nVideo Games Live creator/producer Tommy Tallarico has been in the industry for over 23 years and has worked on over 300 video games (a Guinness World Record!). He has worked with and created games with every major publisher and game developer over the years. This is one of the main reasons why Video Games Live is able to get so many approvals and why it is the only show in the world with so many different games by so many different publishers and developers. But it is still a long process that has many time challenges. In order to get the album/motion picture out within the targeted time-frame (February 18, 2014) sacrifices to the preferred setlist may need to be made. This is part of the reason why ALL of the tracks listed in the description section will be sought after.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #67", "update_userinfo": "LEVEL 6 Album finished!

This party game will change the way you play beer pong and make for a unique experience each time you play. The wide variety of cards not only change the way you throw the ping pong ball, but what happens to the cups, whether a shot counts or not, and many more exciting effects! This game gives you control over when you play the cards, so that strategy plays a part in determining if you will win or lose.\nPong Tactics will be printed on 100% plastic cards so that they are waterproof and durable for many years of gaming. I have teamed up with Quality Playing Cards & Games to provide the best product possible. I hope the funding far exceeds the minimum so that we can include extras in every backer's game set, such as ping pong balls, better card quality and perhaps even additional gameplay components such as coasters and beer koozies!\nPong Tactics is designed to be played with the basic beer pong rules, but you may play the game with water in the cups and make your own choice on whether to drink or not. This way, people of all ages can participate in this exciting game that combines cups, ping pong balls and cards!\nPrint this flyer to help spread the word!\n10 plastic Formation cards\n90 plastic Action cards*\nInstruction sheet\n2 Pong Tactics pong balls**\nAnd potentially more!**\n* This includes the 5 custom cards from the $250 level or their replacement if all 5 are not claimed.\n** If stretch goal is reached.\nUndead Viking, video Gameplay Review (subscribe to his YouTube channel for tons of other great reviews)\nThe Little Metal Dog Show, written Preview (awesome gaming web site and podcast, member of The Dice Tower Network) \nRandy Snyder on Purple Pawn, written Preview (great web site with all kinds of news about gaming)\nTabletop Gaming News, written Review (great web site with tons of tabletop gaming news stories)\nPezboy of Asymmetric Publications, Video Review and Testimonials (he's a staff member of the online game Kingdom of Loathing)\nThere is a conference held every year in Columbus for the online game Kingdom of Loathing called KoLumbus. Many players gather here and have a great time playing board games, card games, drinking and carrying on. I attend this conference every year, since I play the game KoL as player name WhiskeyJack. \nI've also run a tournament at the conference for the past five years called Insult Beer Pong, a reference to the game of beer pong played by pirates on KoL. While planning for this event last year, the idea struck me to combine two of the activities from KoLumbus into a \"beer pong card game\". This is how Pong Tactics came to be. \nSo, I developed a prototype deck out of simple business card size card stock and brought it to the meet. Several other Loathers helped me playtest the game, and I received a lot of great feedback for changes, and encouragement to make this a reality. \nOne of the key things we learned during playtesting is that beer pong is almost a water sport! Many of the cards from the playtest got smudged and would likely not last long, so to finish out the playtesting we put some contact paper on the cards to at least partially protect them. In response to this, the game we are planning to produce will be printed on 100% plastic cards, so that water, beer and liquor will wash right off. I've since started contacting vendors to get prices for cards and various accessories. This is where you come in.\nIn order to successfully launch Pong Tactics and fund a high-quality print run of the plastic cards we need your support! I've researched the Kickstarter process, read numerous articles about developing a card or board game, and feel confident that with your help, we can create something wonderful and that's tons of fun to play. \nYour pledge will help us pay for the art design, the printing of the cards, high quality packaging, shipping, and all of the other miscellaneous costs that go into producing a creative work such as Pong Tactics. The minimum amount to fund is based on the very minimum amount (500 decks) that must be ordered for our vendor to produce the deck and custom box at a reasonable price per deck. This was a challenge since 100% plastic cards are a bit higher in cost than your average plastic-coated playing card, but they are much more durable and will last a very long time. And most importantly, they are waterproof so you can spill beer on them and just rinse it off later!\nThe project target goal includes all of the production costs, shipping and handling, Amazon fulfillment, custom box mold fee, UPC code and artist design costs. When we reach the minimum amount to fund, we will be able to print a quality game on 100% plastic cards designed for wear and tear at parties. \nIf we exceed the minimum amount needed to fund, we will be able to order larger quantities of decks and lower the price point per deck, freeing up money for enhancements to the game set for every backer. Only with your support, and the support of all of your friends and networks, will we be able to include all of the cool enhancements to Pong Tactics we'd like. So, if you pledge, be sure to tell every person you know to help pitch in and everyone's copy of Pong Tactics will be of higher quality. See the below section on Stretch Goals for more details on all of the enhancements we can provide with additional funding!\nI would like to briefly mention timelines here for the project. If we meet our funding goal, there are several things that will happen before we can ship the final game to you. The artwork must be completed for all the cards and the final game box, we must submit it to our vendor, get final proof approval, print and then the shipping process. We estimate that this will take us to February of next year. If at all possible, we will try to get it to you even quicker, but the important thing is that you all have it for the next college semester right? Party season!\nAs with any Kickstarter project, it's all-or-nothing, which means you only get charged if we successfully hit our minimum funding goal. I am confident that with your help, we will reach that goal and hit all of the stretch goals as well! I want you to know that your support means the world to me, since my dream of seeing Pong Tactics come to life will be a reality.\nThe rules are pretty much finalized, but there is still work to be done on the final design of the rule sheet. For a preview, check out this link:\nDraft Instruction Sheet\nPong Tactics is designed to be played with the standard beer pong set up, and unfortunately we were unable to fit a table, pong balls and plastic cups in the box! Luckily, most of these items are very cheap or something you already have. You can usually buy a pack of ping pong balls for several dollars, and a pack of 100 18-oz party cups for a few more dollars, and you only need 20-22 of those cups. You want to try and find a table that is as close to 8 feet as possible and a little over two feet high, though as long as you have a flat surface you should be fine. Most folding tables will work fine, and they also sell beer pong specific tables online in many stores if you're very serious about having a perfect playing area. You also need to have three friends who want to play with you, and form into two teams. If you only have one friend, you can play one-on-one; each person just takes the role that two players would have taken.\nOnce you've got everything you need to start a game, this is where the cards come in. The Pong Tactics deck has Action Cards and Formation Cards. Here are the backs of the two types of cards:\nThere are 10 Formation cards in the Pong Tactics deck. Here are a few examples:\nYou will randomly select one Formation card and both teams will set up their 10 cups in that formation. If you are filling the cups with beer, set up two water cups on the edge of the table, outside of the formation, to wash the ball off between shots. Now you may set the Formation cards aside, since you will no longer need them.\nThe remainder of the cards in the deck are the Action cards. These cards have three components: a title, a description of the action, and a bit of flavor text. Here are a few examples:\nAs you can see, some of the cards change the way you shoot, some affect the cards in your hand, some are played in response to something that has happened in the game, and many more other random effects. Some of the cards have multiples in the deck, while others (usually more powerful or unique cards) only have one copy in the entire deck. Action cards can be played at any time it is appropriate; some cards specifically say when they must be played, if the card does not, you may play it any time. Important to note: each Action card must be resolved before the next one can be played, unless the card specifically states that it overrides the previously played card (like a counterspell). This came up several times during playtesting, especially from some of my friends who play Magic: The Gathering; you'll notice there is a strong influence on this game!\nEach team draws five cards to start the game, and will draw one more card each turn. You may only have a max of five cards at the end of your turn, so if you happen to end up with more than five cards, you will discard down to five cards at the end of your turn. Each team has their own discard pile on their end of the table, but there is one draw pile in the middle of the table that both teams draw from. As cards are played, they are placed in their respective discard piles unless the card directs otherwise.\nNormal beer pong rules are used for the basic gameplay. For example, both players on the team shoot at the cups of their opponent. If a cup is made, it is removed from play and a player on that team drinks. The objective of the game is to shoot until you've made all of your opponent's cups. That is where the similarities end, because Pong Tactics cards affect nearly every aspect of the game.\nHere is an example of one turn of play:\nTeam A draws a card and adds it to their hand.\nTeam B plays \"Underhand Shot\" Action card. Team A must shoot underhand this turn.\nPlayer 1 (Team A) throws the ball underhand and makes a cup.\nTeam B plays \"Blocked\" Action card. This reverses the made cup so that it doesn't count.\nPlayer 2 (Team A) throws the ball underhand and their shot bounces right off the rim of one of the cups.\nTeam A plays \"Close Enough\" Action card. Since the ball hit off the rim of a cup, that cup is counted as a made shot and it removed from Team B's formation and they drink.\nTeam A has five or fewer cards in their hand, so they don't need to discard. Their turn is over and Team B's turn begins.\nAs you can see, a lot can happen in just one turn! And with the wide variety of cards, no game will ever be the same.\nGameplay Variations\nThere are a few variations on the classic game that I've included on the instruction sheet, but would like to share here also so that you see some of the other ways you can play Pong Tactics:\n1v1 - The classic game may be played with only two players as long as they simply take the role of both players.\nTen Card Draft - In this variation, you do not draw or discard cards. Instead, the two teams take turns drafting cards until each team has ten cards. Cards that make you draw or involve drawing cards are not to be drafted. This adds a bit of strategy before you even start playing the actual game!\nOne is the Loneliest Number - Both teams start the game with only one card in their hand. Starting on the 2nd turn, if a team has a card in their hand, they must discard it before they can draw a new card. Basically, you either play that one card you have in your hand or discard it the following turn.\n\nIf you'd like to discuss the gameplay, feel free to leave a comment and I'll address it there.\nAll backers will be personally thanked on our web page. In addition to that, here is a more-detailed breakdown of each reward level:\n$1 - Thank you! - For each dollar pledge, a cup will be added to an epic game of beer pong played by Whiskey Jack Gaming LLC and several friends. The full game will be recorded, edited and posted to YouTube in a series of videos. Standard beer pong (house rules will be explained at beginning) will be played, but after each cup is made, the backer who donated for that cup will be thanked personally for their support of Pong Tactics. Anyone who would like to participate, but has pledged at a higher level, can add $1 to their pledge.\n$10 - Print-and-Play - Each backer at this level and above will receive a print-and-play PDF version of Pong Tactics when final artwork is completed. I encourage everyone to support the printed version, as that version will contain all stretch goals and contain the waterproof plastic cards. However, this is a great option for anyone who cannot afford the full game or if international shipping is too much of a burden, and it's also a way for backers of the published copy to play the game prior to receiving the physical game box. I recommend printing this on business card stock and using either contact paper or lamination to seal the cards to help resist water or beer damage.\n$22 - Early Bird Special! - The first 100 backers who pledge at this level receive their copy of Pong Tactics at a discounted price. All additional copies are $25 each.\n$25 - Pong Tactics - One copy of Pong Tactics, with all stretch goal content included.\n$45 - Tee It Up! - One copy of Pong Tactics plus a Pong Tactics T-shirt.

They will be able to submit an idea for one Action card that will be added to every printed copy of the game released (not the print-and-play version). This idea must be approved by Whiskey Jack Gaming LLC, in order for the card to be balanced and not too similar to another card already in the game. The backer's name will be credited at the bottom of the card. Only five custom cards will be developed. If any of the spots remain unfilled, Whiskey Jack Gaming LLC will develop the remainder of the custom cards and include them in the final card game. The backer at this level will also receive two copies of Pong Tactics and two Pong Tactics T-shirts.\n$1000 - Pong Fanatic! - This reward level is for beer pong fanatics only. The backer will receive ten copies of Pong Tactics, 50 Pong Tactics custom pong balls, five Pong Tactics T-shirts, and one customized portable beer pong table with the Pong Tactics logo and built-in speakers! Five backers may pledge at this level; U.S. backers only.\nIf you would like more than one copy of Pong Tactics, please add $25 to your pledge amount for each additional copy. If you are a retailer and would like to stock Pong Tactics at your business, please contact me directly for options.\nIf you would like a Pong Tactics T-shirt, you may add $20 to any pledge level per T-shirt.\nAlso, if you would like to participate in the $1 backer \"Epic Beer Pong Thank You Video\", but have pledged at a higher level, just add $1 to your pledge and I will include you. Thanks in advance to anyone who participates; it should be a blast and a really fun way to say thanks to those who support this project!\nIf we go beyond these goals, additional stretch goals will be added to further the project and make the game even better!

I will hopefully have another shot at Kickstarter down the road, maybe even with this same idea, just repackaged and with different goals. If not with this game, then with another, since I still have several ideas floating around my head and maybe I should go with a traditional board game or card game next time, smaller goal, less cost involved, that sort of thing. I was being quite ambitious and maybe I should have just approached some publishers to begin with? Some people were critical of the artwork, others were critical that all of the artwork wasn't complete, that some of the wording was unclear in my presentation, that my video made me look like a doofus (sorry, I am what I am! but I probably should have put more effort into getting it right, I see that now), that the cost was too high, that it'd be easier (and more cost effective perhaps?) to just print the game out themselves and laminate.

Design your company logo and color scheme, and watch your company stock rise and fall against your competitors! \nI put our stretch goals here for easy viewing. A more detailed description can be found here.\nWe are a two-man team of amateurs making the game of our dreams in our spare time. After developing this game for almost a year, we are looking for backers to help us make releasing this a reality. We are also looking for feedback and potential collaborators. We'd love to hear from you!\nBack in the Dwarven Motherland across the great sea, the Dwarven King, Dunold the Wise, has chartered a number of Dwarf Companies to explore and colonize strange new lands beyond the sea. As a Regional Manager in one of these companies, it is your duty to scout out one such island and make a foothold for Dwarven civilization there.\nAs regional manager, your duty is to oversee a colony of worker Dwarves for the motherland.\nThe King of the Dwarves commissioning the company's Royal Charter.\nBack home, the Dwarves are at the beginning of an industrial revolution. With newly invented gunpowder weapons and steam engines, the Dwarves have quickly overcome their ancestral enemies in the motherland, and have spread across the earth in search of profits and expanded market opportunities.\nThe Dwarves are a hardy race, and with access to gold, a warm hearth, and ale, can overcome any challenge -- and this colonization business is going to be a major challenge. The strange lands beyond the sea are uncivilized wilds, and full of unknown dangers. Competing companies see profit in these lands as well, and they don't take kindly to other firms edging in on their territory. Dwarven companies are ruthless competitors, demanding profits for their shareholders at all costs. If that means sacrificing a few measly workers for that extra ton of gold ore, so be it!\nA balloon arriving in the strange lands across the sea.\nThese are trying times for the Dwarves. Will you manage your company well and gain profit and glory? Or will you be driven back to the motherland by the hordes of savage Goblins, Elves and Mole Men, and thrown to the dustbin of history?\nDwarfcorp is played from a free-floating overhead perspective. The game takes place both above and below ground, and so is a truly 3D real-time strategy game. You can go up and down slices of the terrain, all the way from the fiery underdark to the snowy mountain tops.\nYou can go up and down horizontal slices to view different parts of the terrain. You then build underground by constructing tunnels.\nYou command a company of Dwarves by assigning them tasks such as Building, Mining, Gathering, or Attacking. Dwarves are pretty smart. Using symbolic planning-based AI, the Dwarves seek out unique ways to meet their own goals. Tell a dwarf to build a wood wall, and he will determine the best way to do that might be to chop down a tree, or else to grab the wood from a stockpile.\nDwarves take great pride in hoarding resources.\nThe goal is to gather resources and send them back to the Dwarven Motherland for profits, and grow your colony from a tiny enclave to a huge fortress. Generally, the more valuable the ore, the deeper it is in the earth.  \nSend your resources back to motherland for great profit!\nUsing the money from gathering resources, you can promote your Dwarves, or make them happier by paying them more. You can also hire more Dwarves with special skills such as Craftsdwarves, Soldiers, Wizards, and Musketeers to join your colony.\nA small one-level fortress is shown with some of the starting rooms. Each room allows Dwarves to engage in different industries or build weapons and spells.\nWith your profits, you can upgrade your colony by constructing rooms. Training Rooms can give your Dwarves the edge in combat -- The Forge can be used to construct a wide variety of mechanisms and weapons to make your operation more efficient, The Laboratory allows your magical Dwarves to research powerful spells -- and of course Drinking Halls and Bedrooms allow your Dwarves to rest and relax (like they'll be doing any of that!)\nDwarves need ale and song at the end of every hard day!\nYou can choose to pay whatever you want to your Dwarves, but if you pay them too little, or treat them too poorly (say, by not giving them enough ale), they may go on strike! Unhappy Dwarves may choose to stay in bed rather than go to work, and will write you a bad manager's report to the corporate higher-ups. Happy Dwarves will be more efficient, and will even sing while working!\nA horde of Goblins.\nBeware! The surface is full of dangers. Hostile Elves and Goblins aren't too keen on the Dwarves coming and stealing all their stuff. Underground, it isn't much safer, as Mole Men and Demons dwell there.\nMole men are sort of anti-Dwarves. They live miserable lives of savagery digging tunnels beneath the earth. They will hoard resources you need for Dwarven industry. Demons, on the other hand, are rare, devious, and should be avoided at all costs!\nDefend your colony with the most humane deterrents: deadly spike traps!\nLeverage your technical superiority over the local savages! Defend your fortress by constructing traps, hiring mercenaries and building a dazzling array of walls and channels. \nDwarves use their superior technology and crafting skills to their advantage!\nA randomly generated mountain.\nBefore starting play, you may generate an island on which to build your colony.\nMany aspects of the world are simulated.\nThe islands in DwarfCorp are procedurally generated and fully simulated.They are different every time you start playing. Fault lines, air currents, moisture, temperature, rainfall, rivers, lakes and oceans are all simulated through the passage of time -- which gives rise to forests, deserts, snowy tundra, jungles and grasslands. Additionally, civilizations of Goblins, Elves, Humans and Demons are randomly generated and given time to \"fight it out,\" so to speak, on the island. So you, as the Dwarven outsider, will make quite a splash as you arrive.\nDifferent terrain types arise from the simulation.\nAnd speaking of splashing, DwarfCorp features a finite liquid simulation system. Drain entire lakes for Dwarven industry! Power water wheels with the flow of rivers! Direct channels of lava from volcanoes! Just take care that none of your employees drown.\nMining too deep can get your Dwarves into some deep trouble!\nDay and night are simulated in the game, with the sun, moon, stars, and clouds dynamically moving across the sky. During the day, your employees may want to forage for food, but at night they had best stay underground -- where they can find caves, ores, dungeons, and other treasures.\nA full moon rising over the Dwarves.\nVolcanoes!\nIslands!\n\nWe are Completely Fair Games Ltd : a newly formed game company from Pittsburgh, PA. We are just two guys coding and pixeling for fun. In the past, we've made many smaller games with groups of friends from Carnegie Mellon University and elsewhere. We've been associated variously with the Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society, Dr. Fishbowl, and \"Team Danger\". We also participate in game jams from time to time. We both have day jobs in academia.\nMatthew Klingensmith - Programmer. Day job: PhD candidate at the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon.\n\n\nWilson Pei - Artist. Day job: Master's student in Electrical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon. \n\nHere are some obscure games we've been involved with in the past:\nGet Pumped! (Winner of the 2013 Pittsburgh Global Game Jam!)\nRedux (Winner of the 2012 Microsoft Imagine Cup!)\nHydraman (2011 Global Game Jam!)\nBeestruction (Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society Gold Winner!)\nA Day in the Life of Danger (Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society Gold Winner)\nMoonwalk (Carnegie Mellon Game Creation Society)\n\nWhat are we Delivering?\nIf we get this project funded, we hope to have a playable beta available by this time next year. The beta will have the basic parts of the \"sandbox\" version of the game fully implemented: colony-building, combat, traps, Dwarf classes, world generation, and an economic system. The beta will be Windows only (7 / XP), and will be available for less than $20. Purchasing the beta of the game entitles you to free updates for life. \nFrom there, we hope to have the game grow organically over time through numerous updates and community involvement. Depending on the level of initial funding we are able to acquire, we may opt to add more features or gameplay modes (i.e. stretch goals). \nOne of our main stretch goals is to port the game to other platforms like Linux, Mac and mobile via MonoGame or Unity. Another stretch goal we have in mind is to expand the game with a singleplayer campaign, complete with a storyline, cutscenes, and more. Should we meet our funding goal, more details on the stretch goals will be revealed.\nWhat do we Have So Far?\nRight now, we have what amounts to a small toy with basic implementations of some of the parts of the game. You can see screenshots of this toy on this page. Basic world generation, AI, building, mining, and economy exist, but they are in an extremely incomplete and early state. \nWe have released a simple pre-alpha prototype for you to play with to get a feel for the game. You can find it here.\nWe have a video of the prototype in action:\nFully developing the game from here will take quite a bit more work.\nWhat do we Need the Money for?\nThough we've been developing the game for free over the past year or so, we've been doing so purely as a hobby. Any time we spend on the game is currently time taken away from friends, family, work, and graduate school. We have considered working on this game at least part-time, but without any income, that is hard to justify. We want to make this game the best that we can possibly make it, and as quickly as possible.\nOur estimate of how the money will be distributed.\nAdditionally, development of the game would go much smoother if we could purchase licences to better tools (particularly to content creation tools and professional code profiling and analysis tools), better content (by commissioning professional artists and designers), and better equipment. \nFinally, the cost of actually publishing a game, even with self publishing methods, can be prohibitively expensive. \nWhen we worked out how much of an investment this would be on our part, it broke the bank! That's why we need you! If you want to see this project get off the ground and onto your laptops, become a backer! \nCheck out some of the rewards we're offering for becoming a backer! Our rewards fall into four basic categories, \"Fluff\", \"Digital\", \"Physical\", and \"Creative\". \nFluff rewards give credit to backers in the game. All backers can have their names or nicknames put into the credits. If you're extraordinarily wealthy, and have a few thousand dollars to blow on this venture, you can be named as a \"producer\", have your name appear in a subtitle on the game's main screen, or even be named as the deity of the dwarves! They will sing songs in your honor!\nDigital rewards include the alpha, the beta,  and the sound track, which you can download DRM-free. The alphais the \"feature complete,\" \"playable\" version of the game which has most of the promised game features. The alpha will be out much sooner than the beta, (probably by Christmas 2013) but will be much less fleshed out, and will be quite buggy. The beta is \"feature complete\", \"playable\", and has most of the content of the game already created. Only minor bug-fixes and tweaks remain. The beta will not be released for some time. The sound track of the game is being created in-house. You can hear a sample of one of our tracks on the video. Digital downloads of the sound track will contain 12-18 high quality, uncompressed audio tracks, and/or high quality MP3 versions.\nPhysical rewards are custom items which we will ship directly to your door over the next few months. First, you can get a glossy 7 x 5 inch postcard featuring one of five randomly generated terrains on the front, and a message from the developers on the back. We're also offering an 11 x 17 inch poster featuring artwork from the game, as well as two T-Shirt designs. Finally, we will be offering a physical CD of the game in a jewel case with custom-printed artwork on the case and CD face itself. (art by Emily So: http://emilyso.com/)\nCreative rewards allow you, as a backer, to design elements which will appear in the game. DwarfCorp allows players to customize the logo, motto, and name of their Dwarf Company. We will have several pre-set companies that players can choose from. Non-player companies will be randomly generated from these pre-sets. Taking one of the creative tiers will allow you to create one of these pre-set companies. If it's within taste, we'll include it as a pre-set! The higher creative tiers allow you to name physical features in the randomly generated world (such as oceans, lakes, rivers, mountains or volcanoes), and even design monsters and/or Dwarf classes!\nA table of rewards. Here's how to read it: each column is a donation tier. Every row with an 'x' in it is a reward you can get for that tier. If the 'x' is inside a \"pick one\" box, you may choose only ONE reward from that box.\nT-shirt, 8 color print!\nPremium T-Shirt, full color!\nMake a 32 x 32 corporate logo!\nA glossy postcard!\nThis 17 x 11 inch poster on your wall!\nSome of the Creative Tiers allow you to put a name of a company or its motto into a random pool.\nAs more people back the project, the little Dwarf will climb a ladder from the depths of the earth to the top of the mountain. He's very tired, and would desperately like to get to the top of the mountain to meet his friends! He needs your help!\nAs the Dwarf goes higher, stretch goals  may be revealed. When the Dwarf reaches a stretch goal, we will be obligated to add that (awesome) feature to the game. These will include technical features (like a larger number of available platforms) as well as gameplay features.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDwarfCorp is unfortunately nowhere near finished! We are nothing but two starving grad students working on this game as a hobby. We are NOT professional game developers. We have full time jobs, research, conferences, and all the miscellaneous bits of life to deal with in addition to making this game. And a game of this ambition and magnitude is not easy for just two people to make in their spare time.\n\nWe plan on dealing with these issues in several ways:\n\nFirstly, at the end of this project, we plan on only having a limited playable alpha available, which will be updated (slowly) over time with new features. This is the kind of game which can never be said to be \"fully finished,\" but is a kind of game which organically grows.\n\nSecondly, depending on how much funding we get through the kickstarter and other sources, we will be able to commission artists, programmers and design people to help us build the game. In addition to the general population of independent game developers we could call on to help us, we also have many talented friends and acquaintances who would love to help -- with a little funding.\n\nThirdly, if there is enough interest, we might be able to work part-time or completely quit our jobs over a couple of summers to finish this game. Trust me, I would like nothing more than to spend all day creating the game of my dreams!\n\nFinally, we hope to generate a vibrant community alongside this game and develop easy-to-use modding tools to help with content creation.

Many other reviewers loved the feel of the game's revolutionary swinging system, and the Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences nominated it for their Excellence in Gameplay Engineering award. \nYou can\u2019t find gameplay like it these days, so I've decided to bring something like it back. And Energy Hook is that something.  \nWorking on Tony Hawk games gave me an appreciation for games that reward you for style, and something I never really got to do with the mechanics in Spider-Man 2 was explore that. So this is an opportunity for me to do just that, create a swinging game where style is just as important as speed, where mixing up wall-runs and loops and big air with your swings is more important than just getting from point A to point B.\nSo imagine a future in which the 'energy hook'\u2014a tractor-beam device normally used in construction\u2014is re-purposed by young athletes out for a thrill. Energy Hook becomes the extreme underground sport of the future\u2014the players use their home-made energy hook gauntlets to swing through obstacle courses, racing in winner-gets-your-tech competitions, competing in speed and style.\nAnd did I mention you\u2019ll have a jetpack?\nEnergy Hook will be for PC, Mac, and Linux.\n\"I know how to make you want to spend money. Imagine if I told you the guy who wrote the rope-swinging for Spider-Man 2 was making a new game using the same mechanic. See! You want to spend money right now! \u2026. You'd have to be dead to the core to not be at least interested in giving that a go.\" - Rock, Paper, Shotgun\n\"I'm going to go ahead and back this, just because Spider-Man 2 was one of my favorite games of the last generation, and the video on the Kickstarter looks amazingly fun. I'm not saying you should give him money, but I really think you should give him some money.\" - Penny-Arcade\n\"Man makes fun part of Spider-Man 2 game, makes new game from just the fun part? I can dig it.\" - Yahtzee Croshaw\n\"Bugger. There goes all my money.\" - NerdCubed\n\"I'd play that game for sure! ... Can't wait to back it!\" - Tim Schafer, President of Double Fine\n\"I really think you should at least vote this up on Steam Greenlight and if you want to see this maybe get some cool stuff added in pitch a dollar or two on the Kickstarter ... I wouldn't be saying this if it wasn't a cool game. Do it for Peter! And do it for me because I want to play this game. I want to play this.\" - Rockcock64\n\"It's really quite fun. I've been playing it nonstop ... I just want to swing, and swing some more ... It's so satisfying. Lovely.\" - Sproginator\n\"...it\u2019s possible that the finished game will literally have our jaws on the floor while we swing around a city running up the side of buildings...\" - ShogunGamer\n\"Have you ever been playing a Spider-Man game and thought to yourself \"Man, this game is great, but would be much better with JETPACKS.\"? Well, your dreams have come true...\" - gamrReview\n\"It's super satisfying to nail successive swings.\" - Chris Jurney, Supergiant Games\n\"The mechanics work. Beautifully. It's all the exhilaration I thought it would be ... Keyboard-mouse is beautiful. Tight, responsive, correct default controls.\" - Vartul Srivastava\n\"I enjoyed the game enough to hunt down every virtual geocache in the final level, and to keep playing for quite some time beyond that.\" - Alec Lofquist\n\"Even if it is PreAlpha, it is still fun enough to play for several hours ... I am really looking forward to seeing where you are going with the game!\" - H1bbe\n\"The game's already excellent fun ... I've had a real blast playing it.\" - Andrew Dinmore\nYou've probably noticed the one dollar funding goal and are wondering WTF? \nI did an interview with Polygon where I explain it in detail.\nIn short, as I\u2019ve been working on this game I\u2019ve fallen in love with it, and I\u2019m going to finish it, no matter what, even if I don\u2019t raise a dime. Now, since I went indie years ago I\u2019ve been bleeding money, and I don't know how much indie resolve I have left. And having a family to support, it would be irresponsible of me to keep working on the game for too much longer or blow what\u2019s left of our savings on it, which is why I\u2019m trying to raise some money\u2014to get an idea of how much people want this game, and find out how much more time and money I can responsibly spend. So it\u2019s up to you: whether I\u2019m going to spend just a few months tying a bow on this and shipping it, or, in my dream world, spend many months, bring more people onto the team, and do something super-extra-awesome.\nIn a way, this is what a lot of indie games, like Overgrowth, Prison Architect, and Desktop Dungeons, do to fund development\u2014through preorder campaigns\u2014but I\u2019m using Kickstarter to concentrate it into one month so I can get a good idea, right off the bat, what budget I have for this project.\nI already love this game and think it's easily going to be worth your money\u2014at the very least it\u2019ll have five levels, thirty challenges, and give you hours of enjoyment. But it could be so much more. And it's up to you to make that happen!\nIn other words, I don\u2019t need your money. But I need your money.\nI\u2019m a jack-of-all-trades programmer and game designer who has been making video games for over twenty years. I was the second employee at Treyarch, where I worked on games like Die By The Sword, Tony Hawk, and Spider-Man, and helped that company grow to the behemoth it is today.\nHere's some nice things some pretty cool people have said about me:\n\"Jamie has a great game design sensibility and a knack for thinking outside the box. He is one of my favorite people to work with - and I am looking forward to whatever he comes up with!\" -Richard Garfield, creator of Magic: The Gathering\n\"I loved his work on Die By The Sword, still one of my faves.\" - Brian Fargo, CEO of Inxile Entertainment\n\"Jamie was the rock on which the Spider-Man 2 team was built.\" -Greg John, producer on Spider-Man 2\nIt Looks Like The Character Is Automatically Grappling. Can You Control What Your Energy Hook Attaches To In The Game?\nI've been getting asked that one a lot, and the answer is yes! The way you point your character is the direction the hook attaches. The cone of green lasers shows how your energy hook searches for something to attach to.\nYour Energy Line Always Connects To Something, Right? It Would Be So Uncool If It Just Attached To Empty Air.\nThat would be uncool. Not on my watch. There's always something solid your energy hook attaches to, be it building or cell tower or sky bridge. Not only is that more \"realistic\", but it's a better game as well - the terrain around your character matters.\nDelilah's grappling the feed horn of the radar dish\nWhat's the Game-Game-Type-Game Part Like? How Do You Win? How Do You Keep Score?\nPlayers familiar with early Tony Hawk games and SSX will recognize the \"macro game\"\u2014as a player in the underground Energy Hook league, you'll participate in a series of challenges: some races, some score-attack, and some 'Can you do this?' Completing the challenges unlocks more challenges and, if we make our first stretch goal, new gear. There are multiple challenges to choose from, so if you get stuck on one you can work on another.\nLike in SSX, doing tricks fills up a meter that lets you use your special powers, in particular your jetpack's speed boost\u2014but we have an in-story justification for it: your character is always playing in front of an online audience, and when you do tricks, they Like and +1 and Upvote you the energy you need to use the specials. (They'll also like it when you bail, if we hit that stretch goal. They're fickle that way.)\nI don't have a gamepad. Will it support keyboard & mouse? Will it suck that way?\nI've already implemented a keyboard + mouse control scheme, and I'm happy to report that about half of my playtesters so far prefer it to the gamepad version\u2014therefore it must be about as good. Mission accomplished!\nIs there a story?\nThere is, though it's subject to change, and whether it's all just subtext or presented as in-game narrative depends on how much money is raised. \nYou play as Delilah, one-time Energy Hook great who has been out of the competition for years--raising her daughter--and now needs to get back in to pay for her daughter's medical bills. Maybe not as daunting as it sounds, with the anti-aging medical technology of The Future, but still, she'll have to learn the ropes all over again, as she competes to earn her way back up to the top of the Energy Hook league. An old friend, crippled in an Energy Hook accident, will help her through these tough channels and the changes that have happened in the sport since her heyday. \nI\u2019m making the stretch goals a bit conservative, because I don't want to make any promises I can't keep, and because I want to leave enough slack in the schedule to respond to Alpha player feedback. But rest assured, every dollar raised buys more time to make more game!\n$10,000: Social leaderboards and trophies, plus Gear Customization feature. REACHED\nUnlock new capabilities and adjust parameters on your jetpack, energy hook, and gravity boots that let you play the game the way that feels best to you.\n$20,000: Linux support and new feature: zipping. REACHED\nBe able to play on Linux, and adjust the length of your energy hook in mid-air, or push a button to retract all the way, zipping you up to dizzying heights.\n$30,000: Original music and audio by Brian Luzietti. \nBrian Luzietti is a veteran game musician and sound effects designer who has worked on an insane number of titles, including Descent, Fallout, Die By The Sword, and a nearly endless list of NBA, NHL, NFL, and ESPN sports titles. (Which could just come in handy here.) He\u2019s the $30,000 [\u2248 Average in-state public tuition (four years) (2009)] stretch goal, and if we raise that much, everyone who backed the game at Beta level or above will get a digital copy of the soundtrack. \n\"Dude, what do you mean I'm just a stretch goal!?\" - Brian Luzietti. \n$40,000: New Level: \"Wallrun Heaven\"; First Person Mode; and Oculus Rift Support\nDoesn't this sound like it would be cool with VR? A handful of people have suggested they'd like to play it with the Oculus Rift. \nSounds cool to me, too, but doesn\u2019t that mean it ought to be First Person instead of Third Person? So there\u2019s going to be a lot of work to do to make it work with the Oculus Rift. And I\u2019ll be honest with you: I bet it\u2019ll be too hard to control, and could induce motion sickness. Finally, most people don\u2019t have an Oculus Rift, so I don\u2019t want to spend their money pursuing an experiment that might not even work.\nSo what I decided to do was this: yes, I\u2019ll make Oculus Rift support part of an early stretch goal, but also only give it to the people who support at the Beta level or above. In other words, if you want the Oculus Rift support, you need to kick in a little extra.\nSide note - the first-person mode should be...interesting...even without the Oculus Rift, and everybody will get to try that.\nAlso: additional level, one with lots of long walls pointing at each other to make for a wall-running paradise.\n$55,000: Midair Tricks and Animation Makeover\nThis used to be the $110K goal but now we have Spider-Man 2 animation director James Zachary offering to help us out. \nNot only will we be able to improve the animations that are in there now, we'll add flips, grabs, spins, \"boneless\" and more. \n$70,000: Rail sliding/grinding. \nBe able to grind rails and ledges; retrofit all the existing levels, including the bonus ones, to put opportunities to grind everywhere. Will be great for lining up stylish chains.\n$90,000: Additional, seventh level: Sky City! & ragdoll bails.\nA floating city in the sky. A whole new set of building assets and floating platforms to create this cloud city with a whole new look.\nThe ragdoll bails will be a mode where you eat it when you hit a wall or an edge too hard, and let us do a sort of 'stair dismount' mode where you get points for breaking bones.\n$110,000: Additional, eighth level: Underground City & slides & ziplining.\nA city built in a giant underground cavern. The cavernous roof will mean there's always something to swing from.\nSlides and ziplining are two features I experimented with early in development that have fallen by the wayside. Slides are like baseball slides - when you hit a wall or roof at speed, you can go into a slide for style points. Ziplining is a mode when you attach to a slanted ceiling your energy hook can slide down it - like a zipline. I'll be able to bring these experimental features back and make them a proper part of the game.\n$130,000: Art Makeover\nWith this much funding we can afford to bring on a full-time artist for several months to make across-the-board improvements in the game's look. \nI'll provide more details on this as we get closer to the goal.\nAnd More.\nAnd there's more I'd love to do after that. But I don't want to jinx it, so I'm going to stop there for now, and leave those future stretch goals locked, until we see how the Kickstarter does. Wish us luck!\nI will absolutely be Kicking it Forward. 5% of profits will go to help crowdfunding other projects.\n\"I can't wait to play it!\"\nIf you can't wait to play Energy Hook, you want to be backing at the Alpha level. As you can see, the game is playable right now, and after just a little more work I'm going to let my baby out in the world. In June, in fact, less than two months away.\nThere's an additional benefit to being an Alpha: you'll be able to give feedback and help steer the direction of the game while it's still in its early stages. Maybe your sweet idea will make it into the final game!\n\"I came, I saw, I bought the t-shirt!\"\nAn incredibly scientific poll I did on the Energy Hook Facebook page let me know that the only physical merchandise Energy Hook fans wanted was t-shirts. So t-shirts you shall receive. Exclusive, backers-only t-shirts that let the world know you are a supporter of the Videogame Arts. These will be made by Forward Printing (forwardprinting.com) and therefore really nice. (These designs are not necessarily final.)\nNew Physical Backer Reward - The Happion Labs Logo Felt Hoop\nCatshy Crafts (aka my wife) will make you, with her own sweat and tears, a hand-stitched felt replica of the Happion Laboratories logo. It will look something like this, but made of wood, felt and stitching: \nCheck out her website to get an idea what her stuff looks like.\n\"I Can Make A Level For The Game!?\"\nI was looking at other Kickstarter projects and thinking it was a bit lame that people were donating a thousand dollars to get, like, a tavern named after them or whatever, and then did exactly that with my own. (At least there's only five taverns in my game - it's valuable because it's rare!) But I also thought, \"Wouldn't it be cool if they got to create a whole level?\"\nBut wait: not everyone knows how to make a videogame level. Which is why I then thought, \"What if I offered one-on-one online (or in person, if they happen to be in the Seattle area) instruction and worked together with these budding level designers to make these levels?\"\nSo that's what I'm doing.\nWhat I'm imagining is at certain times the Energy Hook protagonist, Delilah, has to sleep. And when she sleeps she dreams about Energy Hook. And those dreams are the Bonus Levels that you all will make. Maybe sometimes they're pretty much like the regular Energy Hook levels; maybe sometimes they're COMPLETELY CRAZY. It's up to you. (But I get final cut.)\n\"But wait,\" you say, \"that means I'd be paying you to work for you?\"\nOh, no, you're onto me! Yes! Yes, you would! But it still could be a good deal! You're getting experience and credit working on a game with a veteran developer for a lot less than the price of going to game design school.\nAlso: you'll be keeping the rights to the stuff you make\u2014so you can use what you create in your own games. \nMake sure you have several solid days to work on your level before signing up for this - if your level isn't done in time we just might have to ship without it. \nI know, it's a crazy idea. So crazy it just might work!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOld-timers like me might be wondering how we can make a whole 3D game with almost no funding. Don't they cost millions to make? That's what I used to think until I started working on this\u2014I can't believe how easy modern tools, outsourcing, and stock assets make it to make a game these days. You kids have no idea what it used to be like! I would have needed a team of a dozen people or more to make this game ten years ago.\n\nAlso, you can see yourself from the pitch video (and on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH?view=0 ) how far the game has already come. So far I've just spent about six person-months on the project (working part-time for almost a year), and feel I'm 99% of the way to something I'm willing to put in your hands to try. I've already let some players try it and once I've responded to some of their more important feedback I'll let those of you who are backing at the Alpha level have a go.\n\nExperienced game developers know that a game still has a long way to go after its first playable. Fortunately I have a lot of project management experience and have shipped a lot of titles. While several of the games I've led have come in a little late or a little over budget, I've shipped all of them, with two exceptions : a game that ended up never getting greenlit by the publisher we were chasing (RIP Torpex Games), and an RPG that I couldn't finish because the publisher went out of business first (RIP Mindcraft.) Also, I used to write the \"Manager in a Strange Land\" column for Gamasutra, and have given several talks on the subject at various conferences. So this project is in good hands.\n\nThank you so much for your time and attention.

The 5 most popular colors voted on will all be yours!  \nPURPOSE\nThis fundraiser is intended to provide us with the investment capital necessary to produce an initial production run of nuplug.\nIn order to do so, there are several major initial expenditures that we must incur; some of which include:\nAdditional product testing \nRe-engineering for injection mold manufacture\nProduct safety certification (eg. UL listing)\nProduction scale tooling costs\nAdditionally, we must budget for our unit production costs and shipping costs.  At our funding goal, we will have enough capital to manufacture a minimum order quantity (the minimum quantity that a manufacturer requires to actually bother making the product) which is a few thousand units.\nMany of our internal components will be sourced overseas- this is inevitable as there are no longer manufacturers in the USA that make these products.  However, we do plan to manufacture the product housing, and assemble the product, here in the USA.  In fact, if we vastly exceed our funding goal, it may be possible for us to perform the assembly in-house.   \nStrategic relationships have already been established with local parts manufacturers as well as overseas component suppliers.  When we reach our funding goal, we will be able to put our plans into immediate action.  \nPROJECTED PLAN (major milestones)\nHOW IT ALL STARTED\nI can remember one of the first times the need for nuplug became abundantly clear.  One of my friends came over and brought his laptop to do some work.  As he pulled my sofa away from the wall to plug in his charger cord, I started thinking about a better solution.  I tried using a regular extension cord, but it ended up being more of a nuisance than anything else, since it was always hidden among the dust bunnies under the couch- or something I would hurt my foot with as I stepped on it.  I soon found that this problem was not just mine, and it was not just with my sofa blocking the outlet behind it.  From this point I started messing with some designs for a solution.  A basic illustration of our design progression is shown here:\nAlthough this is somewhat of an abridged version, the major concepts and changes are shown.  After a few ideas and designs were thrown around, it was clear that this product needed to be less bulky than its predecessors, it needed to have as few moving parts as possible- for ease-of-use and durability, and needed to be versatile- to handle many situations and diverse furniture. I wanted nuplug to be a solution that was better than all the items sitting on the store shelves these days- and although there are many of them, there's really nothing out there that provides a clean, compact, intuitive, and versatile solution for this new need- I call it 'an impulsive need for convenient access to power'.  \nGoing back to the original time when i saw my friend wrestling with my couch to plug in his laptop cord- it became obvious that this was not going to be the only time when someone might want to have convenient access to power while sitting on the couch.  The explosion of smart-device prevalence in our lives has created a new level of behavior; that is, that we are no longer just setting down a cell phone to charge at the end of the day, then picking it up again in the morning.  We find ourselves desiring continued use of the device- especially when it needs to charge!  Therefore, we need a new solution for this relatively new problem- and that's how nuplug was born; nuplug is power within reach.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project has a comprehensive business plan behind it.

The film explores Aaron\u2019s arrest, the prosecution\u2019s tactics in bringing the case to trial through the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the CFAA, and the impact a seemingly small hacking gesture had on Aaron\u2019s life and the future of information access on the internet.\nWE NEED YOUR HELP!  Independent documentaries created outside the studio or traditional broadcast system face an uphill battle getting made and distributed.  If we are able to raise the funds we need for this film, we hope to get creative with how we bring it to audiences.  In addition to finding as many new ways as possible to share the final documentary, we have decided in the spirit of open access to release the film digitally through a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.  Aaron gave a lot of his time and energy to Creative Commons.  We also hope to find other outlets as well as live screenings, a small theatrical run and bringing it to college campuses and libraries.  We think this is the best way to share this powerful story!\nHELP US MAKE IT HAPPEN!  Any contribution gets us closer to the goal.  Obviously the way it works with Kickstarter, if we don't make the goal we don't get anything.  \nDirector Brian Knappenberger\nA lot has been written about Aaron, some of it very good, but I felt that taken as a whole it represented a fractured picture of him. I wanted to hear from the people who knew him, explore each chapter of his life and go through his numerous video appearances to have him tell his own story as much as possible. I was well aware of Aaron long before the news broke. I happened to be attending a social computing conference in New York at the time and surrounded by dozens of people who knew Aaron personally. Through their stories it became immediately clear how many diverse corners of the internet Aaron's work touched. A few days into the conference I started recording people\u2019s memories of him on camera, and weeks later I knew I had to go deeper to fully understand what caused such an accomplished and inspired person to take his own life. As became obvious in \"We Are Legion\" many internet activists are so frustrated with existing systems that they consider them unfixable. But Aaron didn\u2019t fit into this category. Countless friends describe him as someone who wanted to work within the system, to \u201chack\u201d or use new tools to fix problems in our society \u2013 everything from internet freedoms to health care. \nThis documentary is an opportunity to explore the influence one incredibly talented programmer and celebrated internet visionary had on the discussion of information access, what his involvement in such a volatile subject means for all internet users, and what his trial has shown us about the cracks in an outdated legal system that lead to such tragic consequences.\nWE HAVE ALSO DECIDED AFTER THE FILM IS COMPLETED TO RELEASE THE RAW INTERVIEW FOOTAGE AND POST IT TO THE INTERNET ARCHIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO THROUGH A SIMILAR CREATIVE COMMONS LICENSE.  \n\u201cThe Internet\u2019s Own Boy\u201d is currently in production. Money raised will go towards setting up further shoots, conducting interviews, facilitating research and collecting archival footage. The project also reunites Knappenberger with We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists soundtrack composer John Dragonetti, who will compose an original score for the film.\nYOUR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE CRITICAL to bringing this powerful story to a wider audience!\nNEW STRETCH GOALS!  \nWe have been VERY moved by the outpouring of support for the documentary.  YOUR support has pushed us over the top of our goals after just 12 days!  We hope to keep up the momentum and reach our full goal.

All we'd have left would be any finishing and distribution costs!  \nWe anticipate the full film will cost us around $175K to complete, not including distribution, so this is just our first round of asking for funding.

When you send a message, anyone that subscribes to your current Tin-Can ID can get it. However, unlike services like Twitter, Tin-Can messages do not spread via the internet (or cellular network). Instead, they must hop from phone to phone.\nWe are building Tin-Can because we want it to exist, and think the world would be better off for it.\nIn many ways, Tin-Can is silly. However, if the internet goes down, Tin-Can is not affected. This could be very useful in a disaster area, or possibly in a protest.\nTin-Can would also be useful at a festival, sporting event, or a concert. Many large gatherings have a lack of adequate network coverage due to so many people being in the same area at once. Tin-Can can would work great for quick communication within the crowd.\nAlso, because of the nature of Tin-Can's design, it could be used for anonymous chat.\nTin-Can is being built by JakobVirgil. He and mk (Mark Katakowski) devised to build it in a thread on hubski.com.\nTin-Can will be a free Android app. Our modest proposal is to feed JV while he doesn't work on anything but Tin-Can.\nWork on Tin-Can has already begun, and we plan to be finished by June. You can follow our progress on Hubski with the tag #tincan.\nWe've had a number of questions about Tin-Can works, so here are some more technical details:\nHow do I exchange messages with other Tin-Can users? To the outside observer Tin-Can looks like a wifi-hotspot with the ssid TINCAN. Whenever anybody tries to log in, it will politely tell them that they used the wrong password no matter what password they use. When one Tin-Can finds another Tin-Can, the messages are automatically sent. This will appear only as two phones not syncing up.\nHow does Tin-Can identify users? Tin-Can doesn't identify users for delivery. Each message has a sender, and if you subscribe to that sender, the message will display if it hops onto your phone.  \nHow are messages connected to the sender? Tin-Can messages are signed and your signature will be unique. Even if both of us want to be called Steve, Tin-Can will keep us separate by assigning a 2 utf-16 suffix on your tag. I may be steve-\u5c71\u86cb and you steve-\uc0b0\u0ca1\u0cbf (\u201cSteve mountain eggs\u201d and \u201cSteve acid D\u201d) the suffixes are optionally hidden.\nHow will messages appear on my Tin-Can? Messages are public by default, and you can read messages going through your phone, making the experience akin to Twitter or IRC. There will be different options that range from seeing only messages from users that you subscribe to, to a \u2018firehose\u2019 setting that will allow you to see all messages in your \u2018lump\u2019.  \nHow long are messages stored on my phone? Older messages will be deleted based upon the age of the message, and possibly the number of hops the message has made. We are discussing the possibility of extending the life of messages based on other metrics or user signals, and are open to ideas.  \nHow many characters can a Tin-Can message be? It will be short. Our working length is 128, but that might change.  \nWhat about iOS? Not in the near future. However, Tin-Can for Windows (laptops and such) is a real possibility.  \nIf you have any questions, we\u2019d be happy to answer them.

Perfect for when you have had an unexpected delay, or haven't been able to fully charge your phone, and you need to make a few calls, send a work email or use your GPS and maps function to find your way home.\nTiny Tiny Tiny \nSo we believe the Fuel Micro charger is the world\u2019s smallest cell phone recharging device. And it is absolutely tiny- just 1.3 by 0.9 by half an inch. It\u2019s so small that it can sit easily on your keyring, you can slip it into the 5th pocket of your jeans, or even have it hanging off your cellphone.\nThe Devotec Fuel Micro Charger is an emergency back-up solution. The Micro Charger is fully rechargeable, and is able to keep it\u2019s charge for at least 1 month before needing to be recharged (our calculations suggest closer to 3 months, so we are being conservative!)\nHow it works \nCharge up the Fuel Micro Charger from the supplied cable or any AC micro-usb wall plug. Then just put it in your pocket, on your key chain or in your car and forget about it. \nTo Use: Turn the power switch on and plug into your phone, the same as you would your charger. Your phone will start to recharge straight away.\nA more in depth look at the Fuel Micro Charger \nComponent selection\n Part of our background is in component sourcing. So we spent months searching, testing and evaluating the smallest and most efficient parts to use with the Fuel Micro Charger. The components we use are the smallest available, and we have used innovative features like flexible-PCBs to shrink component size, in order to make Fuel as small as possible, and to have as big an internal battery as we can.\nHowever, the electronics are controlled by a premium Texas Instruments platform, and we have included multiple safety redundancy features, such as a PCM on the battery and a battery management IC on the PCB to make no compromises on the safety of Fuel.\nHousing \nThe body of the product is pure die-cast aluminium. This means it is incredibly strong but still light weight. The aluminium is painted, lacquered and then baked to give a semi-gloss finish. The housing weighs around half an ounce.\nInternal\nBattery\n The majority of the space inside the Fuel Micro Charger is taken up by an energy dense lithium-ion rechargeable battery. This battery is a 5C battery, rated at 220 milliamp hours. This should provide around 20\u201330 minutes extra talk time, or a few hours on standby, although that is dependent on what type of phone you have and how you use it.\nBattery safety \nThe battery itself has an integrated PCM and there is a battery management IC on the PCB, so the fuel micro charger is extra safe.\nPCB\n The PCB itself is very small, using specially sourced low-profile components, to keep its volume down to an absolute minimum, allowing us more space for a bigger battery inside the Fuel Micro Charger. However, it is a fully functioning PCB, with regulated inputs and outputs by micro-usb. We also use a Flex-PCB, which is even smaller than a regular PCB to connect the micro-usb male to the main board, again to cut down on internal space, so we have more room for the biggest battery we can use.\nLEDs and Switch \nOn the outside of the case, you will see three LEDs. These help tell you if the Fuel is turned on, fully charged, or charging. Each of the Three LEDs will Light up to tell you different information about your Micro Charger:\nRed: Charging\nGreen: Fully Charged\nBlue: Power On\n\nThere is a switch to turn the Fuel Micro Charger on and off, keeping the battery from needlessly discharging when not in use. \nMicro-USB\n Micro-USB is the standard charging connector for all phones apart from iPhone. We use specially sourced low profile components, which while being the smallest on the market, are also certified to work with any existing micro-usb connector- so you can charge almost any Android, Samsung, LG, Sony, Motorola, Nokia or Blackberry phone.\nCharging the Fuel \nThe Devotec Fuel Micro Charger has a rechargeable battery inside that is recharged via its female micro-usb port at the bottom of the device. Any standard micro-usb cable, or AC wall charger you have at home can recharge the Fuel Micro Charger, and the battery inside is rated for a minimum of 500 cycles.\nLet us tell you about who we are \nWe are a dedicated team of entrepreneurs and industry professionals, including Phd scientists, MIT graduates, Harvard MBAs and ex Motorola employees. We work at Devotec Industries, where our day jobs are to design Solar Powered Bluetooth speakers and Solar Chargers for cell phones.\nSo we have plenty of experience in designing charging circuits, and have shipped thousands of units over the last 7 years. The Fuel Micro Charger is an off shoot of our main work, and we are looking to launch it into the market pretty soon after our Kickstarter funding ends, if we are successful.\nWhere are we? \nAs you can see from the working sample, we have all the PCB design finished, with schematics and Gerber files ready. The CAD drawings are fully finished and we are ready to go into production. Through our other work, we have strong links with manufacturing in China, and have agreed pricing and lead times with an aluminium molder for the housing tooling who we have previously worked with.\nWe have been testing the samples for several months now, and it is based on a mature design we have been using for some time with our existing products.\nWhy do we need Funding?\n Where we need you to come in is to help us raise funds to put the Devotec Fuel Micro Charger into production. We need to buy the aluminium toolings, pay for the first production run, and pay for all the certification like CE, RoHS, and WEEE.\nAction! \nWe think this is an awesome product and we are really excited about it, but we need your help to turn it into a reality. We have lots of exciting discounts and offers available to our early backers, and we hope that we can turn this product into a something special that you are going to love!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny technology project will carry certain risks, and surprises can occur at any point in a project.\nWe have done our best to mitigate and minimize the risks associated to bringing the Devotec Fuel Micro Charger to market in several ways:\n\n- We have well tested and working prototypes. We started work on the Fuel Micro Charger project in November 2011, and had our first housing in August 2012, and our first working PCBs in September 2012.\n\n- We are experienced. Many projects fail not because of lack of enthusiasm, but due to lack of knowledge by the entrepreneur outside their core-competency. Part of our team is based in China and has worked in the country with multiple factories for many years, and has developed lasting relationships over the last 7 years with many of the manufacturing partners we intend to use for the Fuel Micro Charger. We are therefore much less likely to fall prey to the \u2018teething problems\u2019 that many other American companies have when first approaching China for manufacturing.\n\n- We use high quality components. We are using a standardized and high-quality American Texas Instruments platform as the basis of our design. We chose this design over using lower cost Chinese alternatives, even though they were multiple times cheaper. Quality first.\n\n- We know how to ship product. We have sold and shipped our previous Chargers and Speakers to the US, Europe, Japan and globally for seven years. We understand issues like shipping and logistics, merchant payment terms, insurance, safety certificates and the many other issues that can delay or harm a new entrepreneur\u2019s business.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "Holiday Present - Fuel is the perfect stocking stuffer!", "update_content": "Hi Guys, this is a preview of our next project.

It is a gamepad with a trackball. Why is that relevant? Because gamepads don't have trackballs - they have joysticks. Because a trackball is not like a joystick - it's like a mouse. It provides the same kind of 1-to-1 input when you move your hand or fingers around. Joysticks don't provide that kind of input. Otherwise we might use joysticks to control our computers instead of a mouse or trackball or touchpad or those kinds of things.\nThat isn't to say that one is better than the other. In fact, I think in the last ten years, consoles have done very well to evolve the game software along with the joystick to create a pretty good gameplay experience. It's actually a lot of fun. \u2026But it's not the same experience. When you play a similar or the same game on the PC, where the control system may have originated with a mouse, it's a bit different. It's a bit more like, just moving your head around wherever you want to look.\n\nSo, here we have this concept. This provides that kind of input. You can move your view around with a little movement of your thumb - the same way as you would with a mouse. But! It also does it with all the same ergonomics and comfort of a gamepad. The buttons are always right where you need them, and you can do it from the comfort of your favorite chair or the couch. If you are the kind of player that would like to sit in front of your big-screen TV but also would like that type of input, then that is exactly what this concept is for.\n\n(Now, a lot of people have approached me saying this would be really excellent on a console, and I agree. This would make an incredible evolution for a console gamepad. In fact, it was originally designed to be a console gamepad. Today however, it exists providing native PC gamepad input as well as mouse input, both over USB. This is more than enough to get a sense of how it feels to use this controller. I am continually exploring every possibility of providing this experience directly to consoles.)\nWith this project,\nWhat we want to do is take this controller as it exists, and we are going to make it wireless. And we're going to do it over Bluetooth, and that's really important, because not only will it connect to PC's everywhere, but it will also be able to immediately provide native mouse-type input to millions of Android based devices. And that's BIG. Because in some instances where those devices are beginning to come up to speed with \"console-like\" gameplay experiences, it creates a new opportunity for players to sit back in their own space, with their own type of controller, and play the games that they want, the way they want. This is part of a major shift that has begun to form in the types of games people play and how they play them.\n\nSo here we are. We have this fantastic controller. We have the opportunity to get it produced and to put it into players hands and to begin a whole new trajectory of gameplay into the future. So join with me. Let's kick this thing off, and let's start the REvolve revolution! Thank you.\nCurrent wired REvolve prototype\nREvolve Prototype\n\n\nREvolve is supported by Tenfold Games.

In the fall, they produced and released their first project together, a pair of short films titled 'Coming to Terms.'\nEnjoying and learning much from the process of their first project, they were eager to move on to 'bigger' and 'better' things. Enter stage left: 'Change on the Table'.\nIn 2010, the one-act play 'Change on the Table' was performed for the first time. From the pen and direction of Colin O'Brien, the play featured a minimalist cast, set, and plot. Action and dialogue focused on a series of interactions between two college students at a local diner.\nThe Present\nNow, it's time to bring the lens in even closer... quite literally. Based on an updated and revised script by Colin, and adapted into a screenplay by Scott, Perspective will be a faithful but fresh cinematic twist on the original play.

With your help, that is all about to change.\nOver the past 2 years I have been developing a new, revolutionary, cross-platform video editing \"engine\", designed to power the next version of OpenShot.  My goal for this project, is to raise enough funds to complete the final features of this new engine, integrate it into OpenShot, and release it simultaneously for Windows, Mac, and Linux.\nThe OpenShot Timeline\nOur Kickstarter as seen on:\nOur Kickstarter campaign has already been featured on many popular websites, and we look forward to other websites covering this story as well!\nCross-Platform Engine\nThe engine has been built from the ground up for cross-platform, multi-threaded performance. It is written in C++, uses cross-platform build tools, and utilizes many amazing open-source libraries, such as FFmpeg & LibAV, JUCE Audio Library, and ImageMagick.\nFor the first time in OpenShot's history, it will spread its wings, and include Windows and Mac versions.  Our project was originally built to address the lack of open-source video editors available on Linux, but over time, we have come to realize that Windows and Mac also have a serious lack of quality open-source video editor options.  Not to mention, we receive a constant stream of requests for Windows and Mac compatibility.\nAnimation & Time Curves\nJust about every setting in the new engine can be adjusted over time with the use of an animation curve and key-frames.  These curves can be b\u00e9zier, linear, or constant, and can control things such as volume, position, scale, rotation, alpha, and even the direction and speed of a video (called time re-mapping).\nFor example, here are three different ways a curve could control the volume level of a clip on the timeline:\nExample animation curves, controlling volume over time.\nControlling the speed and direction of a clip has never been easier or more powerful.  A simple curve can represent the speed and direction, as demonstrated in this video, which is built in the new OpenShot engine:\nCompositing & Layers\nVideos and images can be layered, and arranged in a stack, much like a stack of papers on your desk.  As pixels on these layers are hidden, the lower layers show through, which can create some amazing effects, especially when the layers are being adjusted by animation curves.\nThis diagram illustrates how the next version of OpenShot handles complex & overlapping layers.\nThis video demonstrates 4 layers of compositing, including animated colors, animated waveforms, and sub-pixel precision for smooth motion.\nStability\nNot only do we want OpenShot to have the best animation and compositing features of any open-source video editor, we want it to be the most reliable and stable one as well. This new engine addresses 99% of the stability issues that previous versions of OpenShot encountered, and I would like to improve that even more before I'm done.\nIn fact, a comprehensive and automatic testing system has been built into the new OpenShot engine, which already contains hundreds of tests and easily understandable reports if errors are detected.  This allows myself, and other developers a very quick and easy way to check the entire system as we develop it.\nAs a demonstration of the improved stability already achieved, we recently ran a demonstration at the largest Linux conference in the United States, SCALE 11x. A live, interactive chrome-key / green-screen demo ran for 9 straight hours, capturing live HD video, mixing multiple layers of 1080p in real-time, and never crashed or dropped a single frame.  The demo was also sharing the captured images in real-time to mobile devices using Python, Django, and Apache.\nOpenShot booth at the Southern California Linux Expo, running our new engine for 9 straight hours.\nInterface\nOpenShot's timeline has always been one of its strongest features, due its simplicity and flexibility.  Much of the power is initially hidden, to not overwhelm new users, but through context menus, keyboard short-cuts, and wizards, its true flexibility is revealed.\nDue to cross-platform compatibility issues, our timeline will need to be re-built, using a new, and much improved canvas.  Utilizing HTML5, JQuery, CSS, and WebKit, the new timeline out-performs previous versions of OpenShot by many magnitudes, and is much easier to \"skin\" and \"theme\", due to the power of HTML and CSS.\nMain window in OpenShot, using our new theme: holo.\nTake an early look at our new timeline, which already boasts an impressive number of technical and work-flow advantages over the current one. It is still missing much of its functionality, and I have not revealed the improvements to clip trimming, transitions, audio waveform manipulation, or the animation system yet. So enjoy, but know this is just the beginning of a great new work-flow for OpenShot!\nPython API\nAlthough our new engine is programmed with lightning fast C++, and uses many C libraries under the hood, we have hand-crafted a beautiful and simple Python API, which exposes 100% coverage of the capabilities and features available. This will enable a new generation of video editing applications, websites, scripts, and tools to harness the power and flexibility of this engine, with just a few lines of Python.  Yeah, it's just as cool as it sounds.\nSuper simple API, which can be used by anyone to automate video editing tasks.\nOpen-Source\nOpenShot has always been, and will always be a free, open-source application.  The source code is freely distributed, licensed under GPLv3, and contributors and fans from around the world can help improve it.  To learn more about the project, you can visit our official project page at http://www.openshot.org/.\nStretch Goals\nWe need your help to make OpenShot even better than our original goal!  At each of the following funding amounts, a new feature will be added!  Each of these stretch goals makes a dramatic improvement to OpenShot!  The final stretch goal is especially awesome, and I look forward to reaching it!\nRewards & T-Shirt Design\nAlthough our best reward is the final delivery of OpenShot to Windows, Mac, and Linux, we have tried to select some fun, additional rewards as well.  Certain reward levels contain a small USB Flash Drive, featuring the OpenShot name.  Perfect for storing video files on, and transferring them between computers.  Other reward levels contain a 2-color, custom designed T-Shirt, featuring the OpenShot timeline (pictured here).\nA preliminary design of the OpenShot T-Shirt reward, offered to some reward levels.\nThe Plan and Budget:\nOpenShot's community of developers is very small (just a few of us), and the time and money commitment to bring OpenShot to Windows and Mac is very time consuming and expensive.  In the past, this has prevented us from attempting such an ambitious project.  But now that we have tools such as Kickstarter, it's making projects like this more realistic and achievable.  \nI have created a detailed development plan, with budgets built in for additional artwork and user-interface design work, some light outsourcing on a few specific areas, a Mac development system, and enough funds to cover my costs during the development, along with the taxes and fees. \nOpenShot Studios, LLC will handle all software development tasks, legal obligations related to Kickstarter and your pledge, and manage this entire Kickstarter project.  This company is owned by me, and currently owns and oversees the majority of OpenShot source code copyright, trademarks, and all other intellectual property of OpenShot Video Editor.\nCan You Do It?\nI have dedicated my past 5 years to building OpenShot, and the past 2 years on developing a revolutionary video editing engine.  I have a proven track record for developing successful, award-winning applications, and I feel extremely confident in my ability to deliver on this project.\nIn February 2013, I gave a presentation on the new OpenShot engine (referred to as libopenshot) at the Southern California Linux Expo, where it was very well received.

We'll make 500 at the $10k Stretch Goal!\n*UPDATE: Everyone contributing $25 or more than the price of their chosen reward will also receive the Creation Kit.\n----------------------------------------------------\nWe here at Genshin Souzou K.K. [Phantom Creation Inc.] would like to create a completely free and open set of emoji that anyone can use and distribute in any way without any particular requirements. Our licensing model will be the same as the Font Awesome project which is a combination of the SIL Open Font License, MIT License and the CC 3.0 License [CC-By with attribution requirement waived]. Distribution will be from a github repository and we will provide a fork of gemoji that replaces all the unlicensed emoji with our liberated versions.\nThe repository can be found here: https://github.com/Genshin/PhantomOpenEmoji\nHere are the sample replacements Jun Tohyama created, also seen in the video above replacing their non-free versions.\nSample Set\n*Check out http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/ for a semi-complete preview of the standard set in copyrighted and licensed Apple flavor.\nThe word \"emoji\" is Japanese, written \u300c\u7d75\u6587\u5b57\u300d. The 'e' in emoji \u300c\u7d75\u300d means picture, painting or image, specifically one that is drawn or painted and not a photograph or generated image. 'Moji' \u300c\u6587\u5b57\u300d means letter or typographic character. So \"emoji\" literally means \"picture character\" or \"picture letter\".\nEmoji are basically like \"smileys\" or graphical representations of emoticons. The difference here is that emoji were created for a specific purpose and they actually have a sort of pseudo standard. The Unicode 6.0 standard actually has large block of over 800 characters set aside for emoji specifically (here is a list of them and how they map to Japanese mobile carrier standard sets) They were first created for Japanese cell phones to be used in cell phone e-mail. This was back when cell phone carriers had a packet charge and when transmission speeds were not so great - so in order to save space each emoji was stored locally on the device and a code was assigned to each one. This way packet charges were a tiny fraction of a yen per emoji - the same as a normal multi-byte character, whereas actually sending an individual tiny little graphic could have been tens of yen.\nEmoji are usually distributed as a font or as a packaged set of glyphs or images. Just like fonts and image libraries they are copyrighted and licensed. Looking at commercial distributions we are convinced the people who create and sell fonts are insane con-artists because they want to charge hundreds or even thousands of dollars to use their new version of Times New Roman where they made the little serif decorations pointier, but only if one person uses the font and only for printed material and only in 80%+ saturated black. Emoji licenses are likewise expensive and have unrealistic and crazy license conditions and restrictions. All the \"free\" emoji we could find were either awful or incomplete. And as it stands now a lot of people have decided to just hope Apple wouldn't sue them and started using the Apple set without permission (that we know of).\nWe want to create a full set of ~900+ emoji completely free to use, free to distribute and open to modify without any restrictive conditions or terms. We want this emoji set to NOT be based on the \"new\" international look with yellow smileys and multiple emoji referencing one generic image; but rather to be based on and more closely resemble the high quality Japanese emoji sets. The issue of political correctness does arise, but check our reach-goals for a solution.\nAs soon as we reach our goal (before the project ends) we'll start putting one a new emoji every day. Once the project finishes we'll work full blast to create the remaining emoji. If we end up with an amount between two goals we'll create one emoji for every $30 over the previous goal.\n$5,000[Goal]: 125 of most commonly used base set emoji in source SVG and 64px * 64px PNG.\n+ All custom emoji.\n+ A JSON index of all emoji with their character, source file name, names in English and Japanese, category and Unicode character code.\n+ Conversion and management scripts to convert source SVG to any size in a variety of formats and to check for and list missing characters.\n$7,500: A cross platform emoji chooser/pallet that will run on Linux, OS X and Windows. Using this tool you can enter standard set (unicode) emoji in any application anywhere. This app will also have an editor/preview window to re-emojify text improperly rendered due to a lack of support in an application or at the system level.\n$10,000: Another *375* [was 125] (sum *500* [was 250]) of the most commonly used emoji.\n+ All custom emoji.\n+ Racial variations for all human emoji. Racial variations will include: standard-generic-tan-pinkish, creamy-white, silky-black, golden-middle-eastern, refined-asian and rich-ethnic-brown.\n+ Conversion scripts to convert and export all racial versions at once from their SVG sources with the ability to tweak to output your own custom racial variations.\n+ A jQuery module to convert blocks of text or HTML, replacing emoji codes with their PNG versions. Every site using this module will be able to seamlessly display emoji on any browser regardless of any lack of native support.\n+ A jQuery module with an emoji picker, listing all emoji available or by category and inserting into a selected textbox upon selection. Every site using this module will be able to allow users to browse and insert emoji into specified text boxes regardless of any lack of native support.\n$15,000: Font rendering scripts and official rendered fonts of the full color set and a fall-back black-and-white outline font set for systems that do not natively support multi-color fonts.\n$25,000: All standard emoji (over 800).\n+ All custom emoji.\n+ 50 animated versions of common emoji.\n+ Plugins for Chrome and Firefox to standard Unicode and extended set emoji to their graphical representations on any site, and to provide a pop-up emoji picker to insert emoji into any block of text.\n$30,000+: MOAR EMOJI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n+ An central hosted conversion system that will convert any block of text or HTML to HTML with embedded image links for each emoji. This site will also allow for the registration of custom extended set emoji by anyone.\n+ For every $30 over the 30k mark, one extended set emoji (to be chosen by vote by backers).\nOR\n+ For every $50 over the 50k mark an animated version of an emoji (to be chosen by vote by backers).\nWe're calculating work time at roughly $20 per work hour for Tohyama, which is lower than what we usually bill him at and way below market rate. Obviously we won't be making any money off this project beyond funding, so we've agreed to re-invest as much of our individual takes as we can to continue funding Scroll Ninja (which is also open source).

In Haxel there are planets to fight on. Every planet has it\u2019s own physical properties like gravity and friction, and each planet can have unique interactive features.\nPlanets are destructible, can be inhabited by lifeforms, and are divided up into districts.

Haxel is a galaxy hosted by us, it\u2019s the main galaxy in the universe and players can compete on it to be universally ranked against other players.\nDestruction & Creation\nWhen playing haxel the very planet you are playing on can be destroyed by explosions, special weapons, bullets, and vehicles. To combat this destruction there are special guns for building and special bombs that can spawn defensive structures like walls.\nGame modes built into Haxel\nThese are the default game modes that will be available in the Haxel Galaxy (however new game modes can be user created).\nFree For All \nTeam Death Match\nCapture The Flag\nLast Man Standing \nKing of the Hill\nOne on One Tournament (ranked)\nDefend The Base\nToken Hunting\nThe Hunter and the Hunted\nA core feature to Haxel is empowering the user to create his or her own planets and districts. Users will be able to host their own Galaxies on our servers, and can selectively choose which planets they want in their galaxies. They can also decide which of the available districts they want on those planets. Every Galaxy will have its own ranking, as you visit galaxies and play on the planets you will be placed on their ranking board.\n\nWhen you finish creating a planet, you will be able to submit it to the universe. We will have a simple approval process, and once your planet is approved, any galaxy will be able to request your planet. Even Haxel could request the addition of your planet!\nGame-Play\nSniping in single player mode against 100 AI opponents. (graphics and models are subject to improvement)\nPlayers compete in battle using a large arsenal of guns, explosives and by setting traps. Some game modes will require lightning fast reflexes and precise marksmanship where others may involve coordinated strategy and a patient and deliberate attack against a base.\nIn addition to the wide array of guns and other projectile weapons in Haxel, there will also be some guns that serve a specific purpose, such as building or destroying a specific set of blocks. For example in a fortress defense game, some players may chose to coordinate reinforcing the fortress while others are involved in combat.\nWhen will Haxel be available to play?\nAnyone who chooses the first reward or higher will be able to download the BETA of Haxel and the Map editor in July and will receive all future updates to Haxel for free. Those who chose the second reward level or higher will get access to the ALPHA version of Map Editor in May. The ALPHA Map Editor will have online map collaboration and all of the currently available shapes, skins, editing modes and maps built in.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe have spent more than a year creating the Haxel map editor and several years creating the game engine, and now we need to transform it into a finished game.\nWe are a team of two developers who have created the Haxel prototype using our spare time, and know that with some support, we can deliver a truly awesome gaming experience to the world!\nWe are asking for help for three main reasons\nWe want to dedicate more time and resources to Haxel. \nWe need to purchase Textures, higher resolution models, musical compositions and sound effects in order complete Haxel.\nWe need to host dedicated servers for match making, game-play, to integrate it all into one great website.\nWhat are you working on?\nFinishing multi-player support; the client and server are coming together.\nThe planet creator interface is being modified to make it more user friendly.\nWe are adding more highly detailed models and animations to the game.\nWe are improving game-play mechanics and working on developing content.\nDeveloping an interactive website to explore Planets in the Haxel Galaxy.\nWhat is the Planet Creator?\nThe Haxel Planet Creator is the map editor we have developed over the last year. The Planet Creator is a next generation voxel editor, capable of rendering endless shapes. Using the Haxel planet creator, you can create amazingly stunning and complex 3D structures using a wide array of skins and shapes that are built in, or by creating your own custom shapes.\nThe Planet Creator has many high level editing features which are designed to allow you to create highly detailed worlds with ease. Some of the key features are:\nSingle Selection, Multi-Selection, Mirror, Copy, Cut, Paste, Stacking, Addition, Subtraction and Brush mode.\nCopy and Paste an entire section of architecture or terrain.\nUse terrain brush to add landscape\nUse multi-selection to add or subtract sections of blocks\nModding\nThe map editor has been designed with total moddablility in mind. Virtually every aspect of planet creation may be easily changed or extended to alter game-play. We will fully support planet creation and will merge the most popular planets directly into the Haxel Galaxy.\nShapes\nShapes are the geometric definition of a voxel that make up the world. All blocks in the editor have a shape, skin, behavior, shape rotation, texture rotation, health, and RGB light values.\nBy modifying the characteristics of shapes, you can make things such as stained glass, lighting effects, trap doors, blocks that boost or slow players down.\nPlanets you create using the Planet Creator can be loaded into Haxel and shared with your friends or submitted to us for promotion into the Haxel Galaxy!\nA Shape has a set of faces, side profiles (for face visibility), and how light passes through each side. We have defined eighty shapes for use in the editor.\nShapes available in the Haxel Planet Creator.\nDestructible\nEnvironments in Haxel are fully destructible, which allows for many interesting and fun possibilities for game-play. By changing the health and other characteristics of a block, map designers will be able to create virtually any building material in the physical world, and also adjust how easy or difficult it is for a player to destroy them.\nBlocks after being hit with RPG\nThe Haxel website\nThe Haxel website is a place to exchange ideas, and suggest mods. Once Haxel is released, we plan to add the most highly voted Planets directly to the Haxel galaxy. We plan to deliver the Galaxy Explorer, Wiki and forums at the same time we release the Alpha Map Editor. \nPlans for the Future\nThe ability to create interactive stories in the Planet creator is something we would love to be able to add. Imagine being able to create scripted sequences, or facilitate a massive battle between NPCs and actual players. This is something that would add significant value to Haxel, but it is also a significant undertaking.\nAnother large feature we want to add is Vehicles. We can't make any guarantees about this with the scheduled release, but we are going to try really hard to fit this in. Otherwise we plan on adding this in a future release.\nNews\nhttp://holygrenade.com/2013/02/the-blocky-and-map-building-chaos-of-haxel/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have overcome many challenges already by creating the engine that Haxel is built on.We have layed the foundation for Haxel and have moved far into its development.

Wait \u2013 there's more.What if you had the ability to upload different configuration to Mycestro, converting it from advanced functionality to your traditional Bluetooth mouse, no application necessary....? I thought so!\nHere are the application bullets:\n1. Create an application that can support multiple Mycestros. We decided to create the application so that you will be able to support up to four Mycestros at one time.The application will have the ability to assign a Mycestro to right hand, Primary (index finger), and right hand secondary (middle finger).The same goes for the left hand, so, will be able to assign left hand primary (index finger) and left hand secondary (index finger).\n2. Make the application so the user can assign keyboard and mouse functions to each of Mycestros functions.Example: left hand, left button could be set to control function key so when you use the middle button on the right hand you could rotate a 3D model or holding the left hand control key and rotate turns into pan/zoom.\n3. Since we are going to be able to connect at least four Mycestros to one PC or laptop thru a single dongle, why not have a Collaboration Mode? Now, we are going to try to get this in the application with time permitting, but, if we run out of time by the delivery date in October, we will have this feature shortly after. With Collaboration Mode you will be able to connect Mycestros from other users, allowing those other users to take control of a mouse and cursor function. Only one controller at a time permitted.\nHere are the hardware bullets:\n1. Modify the PCB design to support two Mycestros connected together thru a very short micro USB cable.We will come up with the cable and make it available to everyone as soon as I get pricing.I am imagining that it will not be that expensive. No worries though, we are going to add the code so you could still get the functional benefits of two Mycestros without the interface cable, you just won't gain in the added benefit of extra battery life.\n2. Add 128K of extra flash to Mycestro to support embedded applications and anything else we can think of.\nHere are the Embedded Code bullets:\n1. Add in the ability to update software on your Mycestro.We are going to focus on a wired connection first and then in the future try to incorporate a wireless updater.\n2. Add the code to support multiple Mycestros connected together thru a short USB cable. The battery on one Mycestro will back up the battery on the other Mycestro.Twice the battery life, twice the features. That's pretty cool!\n3. Add the code to be able to use multiple Mycestros thru a wireless connection. Here you get all the same functionality of having more than one Mycestro on a single hand, but without the added benefit of extended battery life.\nYou may ask why would you need two Mycestros on one hand. Imagine the possibilities! I'm excited about FPS games and a lot more.\nKnow, in order for us to meet these goals and provide you with the best possible wearable human interface device in the world, Mycestro, we will need to add resources and spin another set of prototypes.I am asking all of you to help us reach a stretch goal of $400,000.Since you are going to be able to use at least two Mycestros on one hand we are adding another pledge amount for a combination two pack with a single dongle for the Kickstarter special pledge of $149.00 for the classic white version, or $189.00 for a color version.\nKnow for the Pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: Left hand version of Mycestro.\nI have been getting a lot of email for a left hand version of Mycestro.Yes, we are supporting the left hand version in our application so that should show our commitment to getting one out. With that I am happy, even ecstatic, to announce I got the go-ahead to offer the left handed version. One thing though, we need to change the delivery date for the left hand version to Jan 2014. I know it seems like a long ways off but we need the time, just in case. The last thing I want to do is promise a goal that may be hard to reach. Of course, if it is possible to deliver left hand version sooner we will. So, there will be pledge amounts for left hand version in classic white and color at the same pledge amounts as the right hand. We are also going to offer a left and right hand combo which will include one dongle and one USB cable for charging. Remember, you will be able to set up each Mycestro as left hand primary and right hand primary, and set keyboard and mouse functionality individually on both. Very exciting stuff!\nAdded bonus Mycestro carrying pouch:\nAs an added bonus we are going to offer everyone, if we reach our goal, a handy travel pouch to store your Mycestro, cables and dongle.\nWell that's It. I can't express more how thankful we are for your continued support.I know Mycestro is going to change the way you \"Conduct Your World\"\nTHE STORY\nWhile flying home from an SIA trade show in Denver, I noticed a gentleman across the aisle. His laptop barely fit on the seatback tray as he struggled to use a traditional mouse on the limited space of his laptop. Right then, the idea came to me \u2013 wouldn\u2019t it be cool if I could control my PC functions just by moving my finger?\nI immediately pulled out my project notebook and started drawing \u2013 and the concept for a wireless, 3-D mouse that fits on your finger was born \u2013 the Mycestro.\nSince then, the Mycestro has been featured on Engadget and was selected as a semifinalist in the COSE Live Your Dream contest. It also gained the honor of semifinalist at the prestigious TiEQuest, an international entrepreneurship competition.\nYou can also check out these videos on YouTube: Mycestro and IPTV, Mycestro using 3D CAD, and the Mycestro Introduction.\nHOW DOES IT WORK\nMycestro is a 3-D mouse, which means it has the ability to track hand motion in 3-D space.\nMycestro is activated by your thumb. When you\u2019re not touching the Mycestro, the cursor and cursor function pause until you begin to use it again.\nThe touch-sensitive panel initiates cursor movement. To use the Mycestro, simply touch anywhere on the panel. You can control the cursor position by moving your hand in the direction you want it to go. To make selections, release the touch panel and then tap it again on the left, middle or right button section.\nRange: Mycestro has a range of up to 30 feet.\nWireless: Mycestro incorporates Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Protocol, making it compatible with Bluetooth Smart Ready devices like iPad\u00ae3 and newer iPad Mini, iPhone\u00ae 4S and newer, iPod Touch Gen5, Apple\u00ae MacBook\u00ae Air, Mac\u00ae mini and MacBook Pro, and any PC with a compatible BLE dongle. Android devices should be available by the end of the year.\nFeatures:\nMycestro is about the size of a wireless earpiece.\nMycestro is very light, weighing next to nothing.\nIts internal battery can be charged via USB.\nBattery life is estimated to be eight hours depending on usage.\nTwo different replaceable clip sizes.\nWHERE ARE WE\nMycestro is a patent-pending technology. The Mycestro project was started about two years ago. Since then I have made significant product enhancements, conducted dozens of demonstrations and received publicity via Engadget and COSE, to name a few. I also have a few videos on YouTube.\nI knew that in order to get Mycestro into the hands of consumers, I needed to enhance our corporate team and our strategic alliances with professional organizations and educational institutions. I put together a terrific management, business development, technology and strategic team and continue to strengthen our professional staff and alliances.\nWHO ARE WE\nDavid Greenspan, Chief Executive Officer and Director\nThe company is led by David Greenspan, CEO.

Unlike other games which use a class system or skill trees, Project Awakened leaves every choice and ability up the player. Likewise, players will have the opportunity to completely customize the appearance of their characters. Comical or serious, rough or polished, nearly any character imaginable can be created using the Project Awakened Player Creation system. The result is a game with seemingly limitless gameplay and replay potential based on which abilities players choose.\nWhile Project Awakened allows for players to make typical videogame heroes such as Ninjas, Snipers, or Urban Warriors, what makes Project Awakened truly unique is the potential to craft gameplay experiences and challenges that have never existed before. An invisible hero who can charm enemies to fight for her. A non-violent hero with super speed and agility racing past enemies to the goal. A man who spontaneously combusts at will and touches everyone to incinerate them. The possibilities are endless, and allow players to craft a gameplay challenge unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. The only limit is the player\u2019s imagination.\nUE3 Prototype\nMTV: \u201cPretty damn impressive\u201d \nPresent day world with tomorrow's technology\nA world that responds to player creations/characters\nMissions that can be completed from multiple approaches\nPons and Fleischmann stabilized cold fusion in 1989. The Human Genome project was completed in 1993. Merritt and Rodrigo solved implant rejection in 1996. What if the scientific breakthroughs that awaken the human potential did not occur in some distant fantastical future, but in our recent past? Small ripples in time and space profoundly affecting the meaning of being human today. Black market superpowers. Breakthroughs in genetic engineering, implantation and nanotechnology have blown through the limits of human potential. Super strength, speed healing, psychic abilities, telekinesis and far more are now on the menu - but these breakthroughs are as closely and carefully regulated as weapon technology or nuclear science. Of course, that's not going to stop anyone with the will and the means to get their hands on it. But where has this bounty come from, and what is the price humanity will pay when we discover the source?\nOur objective with Project Awakened is to create a robust world of incredible beauty where you can play with your powers, see real effects of your abilities on a thriving modern world, and yet still get the tight, story-driven experiences that make action games so compelling. We will build a hub-and-spoke game world, where players will explore a rich city environment, and then venture off into more linear storytelling areas that have specific puzzles and combat scenarios that can be approached differently depending on the character. The AI in the game and the world itself will be built in such a way that they will respond to any potential power the player has at their disposal in a realistic environment. Each playthrough with different characters and different powers will feel different than the last. \nUE3 Prototype\nAs a player, you will be caught between a number of factions: a government that wants to lock down and control physical augmentation, corporations that are constantly (and perhaps recklessly) trying to invent the next big leap in augmentation, rebels who believe we are descending into a police state and want to unlock human potential for all, and those who believe that, for a select few, augmentation is the next step in human evolution.\nThe world of Project Awakened is our world, today. Our governments, our lives, our struggles\u2026but standing just past the tipping point of the technological evolution of humanity, and all the power and chaos that results. Governments and corporations wage covert wars with super soldiers. Police department budgets struggle to combat crime lords unhindered by constraints of money or ethics. Gods rise among us with the same fallible minds, inside superhuman bodies. And you, in our world today, are among the Awakened. Look up for a moment, look around you. What would you do in your world, if you were a god?  \nJoystiq: \u201cPhosphor Games' upcoming 'Awakened' looks powerfully promising\u201d \nCustomizable Multiplayer scenarios\nUnique character creation enhances team building strategies\nPlay with the characters you design\nMultiplayer in Project Awakened will open players\u2019 eyes to the creative potential of what videogames can be. The myriad of abilities and weapons available in the game will allow players to craft teams of characters never before seen in multiplayer games and specially suited to countering enemy strategies or achieving objectives. While multiplayer will take inspirations from other competitive team-building and objective based games, the focus will be providing an action-packed online experience that players can customize to their liking.\nUE3 Prototype\nDifferent gameplay scenarios will call for different character makeups. A capture-the-flag game might involve one character with stealth abilities sneaking past the opposing team and grabbing their flag, while another character with freezing powers stops the enemy flag carrier. A point defense map might inspire players to create an entire team of stone-skinned tanks. There will be tradeoffs and counter strategies to every combination of abilities, and only through solid strategy and teamwork, as well as individual player skill, will a team's potential be truly unlocked.\nVG247: \u201cBloody brilliant\u201d \nGame editor ships with the game\nPlayer created abilities and gameplay scenarios\nCommunity driven mods promoted and shared with everyone\nProject Awakened has huge potential to foster a robust Mod community. If the Stretch Goal is achieved, Project Awakened will ship with the editor exposed, and the game itself will be built in such a modular fashion that it will be easy to modify any values on any abilities, weapons, maps, etc. to the player\u2019s liking. Craft new weapons, new character outfits, and create entirely new maps and gameplay scenarios using the easy to use editor and our massive art library.\nSwap out soldiers for orcs or skeletons, use medieval armor, place it in a castle setting and create a fantasy game.  Swap out street clothes for sci-fi and create a space epic. Pit one powerful Awakened character vs a team of simple police officers trying to take him down. Create a brutal power-laden game of rugby. By defining the playable characters, objectives, and settings, players can make anything they want. Add robust game rules and objectives, and players can create any sort of multiplayer scenario they can conceive of.\n\nMod Prototypes\n\nThese can be created, uploaded to our frontend, and shared with the world. The best mods will be featured so that everyone has a chance to share their vision, and won't need to be a master modder, artist, or programmer in order to make something incredible.\n\nGame Industry Veterans\nCritically acclaimed mobile games Horn and Dark Meadow\nAn Unreal Engine 4 Developer\nPhosphor is a team of industry vets, many coming from Midway Chicago, where we worked on titles like Psi-Ops, Stranglehold, and Mortal Kombat. At Midway, many of us started working on a project called Hero, which was ultimately the nucleus for many of the concepts of Project Awakened. Since then, we\u2019ve bided our time making our critically acclaimed mobile games like Dark Meadow and Horn, and even worked on Gears of War 3. It\u2019s in our DNA to make this game. Phosphor was created to bring Project Awakened to the masses.\nIn addition to creating our own original games, for several years now Phosphor has worked closely with Epic Games to help develop Unreal Engine 4 itself. We are excited to announce that we are making Project Awakened with UE4, and our goal is to deliver the best experience possible by leveraging the most powerful next-gen engine available.\nPublishers are afraid to make Project Awakened, gamers want it\nThe return of the PC to the forefront of gaming\nA game for players, funded by players\nThe idea of Project Awakened is so different from what is out there, publishers don't know how they can fund it. We've pitched this idea to every major publisher, and while they all like the concept, they are also afraid of uncharted waters. Their data shows that studios can only sell a familiar gameplay experience or a sequel, not an innovative new IP. \nWe disagree. And we think gamers do, too.\n\nProject Awakened has been a dream and passion that we've been working on for the past few years, but now we need your help to finish it. PC games are now a thriving, dominant market of innovation - with all new distribution models and available services- it really is a better way to get new ideas to gamers than through all the middlemen and barriers in the retail console markets. The more we raise, the more we can bring to you, and the possibilities for unique abilities, stories, tools we can put into your hands, and dreams we can support is almost limitless.  Help us bring all this to you, so you can finally show the world\u2026\nWho do you want to be?\n\nThe potential for Project Awakened to grow and allow even more amazing content and tools is enormous. Any amount we raise over the base goal goes directly into making more for you to make your video game dreams a reality!\nIn addition to the above stretch goals, we are pleased to announce some awesome rewards for your pledge.

With that comes challenges we are aware of, and have been working on for years.\n\n- This powerful and open ended Character Creation tool allows for vast visual and ability combinations, which will be difficult to balance and implement at the scale which makes this project truly unique. Fortunately, we have been prototyping such systems for over 6 years now, knowing it was a cornerstone of delivering the vision of Project Awakened. Furthermore, we have a veteran team of passionate designers with lots of experience designing games on this scale.\n\n- Unreal Engine 4 is new and incredibly powerful engine technology. Phosphor Games is in the position of working with Epic Games to help develop UE4, so we are in the best possible place to make such a game, but using a new engine comes with some inherent risk. We will mitigate this by working closely with Epic to use the engine as it has been intended, and unlock its full potential.\n\n- There is a lot of content in this game for us to create. Luckily, we already have a huge backlog of content that we've built for other games, or prototyped for earlier versions of Awakened, that we can use as a starting point. This should allow us to achieve the variety we are shooting for without falling short in terms of scope, as we already have a significant head-start.

Curiosity is what drives us, and our mission is to create exceptional craft beers for a growing community of people who share that constant sense of curiosity.\nSince starting the company while still in college, we have found a location, tested and perfected our recipes, and laid the necessary groundwork to get the business off of the ground. Our next major step is to renovate our facility and install a larger brewing system. To achieve that, we need your help.\nHow Kickstarter Works\nTo accomplish this, we\u2019re seeking to raise $25,000 or more within a 40-day time period. We\u2019re incredibly grateful for any amount contributed toward funding our project, and we\u2019ve created a large amount of handcrafted rewards (explained below) to thank our backers based on their level of support. If you can help us fund our project in time, we receive the funding. If we don\u2019t meet our goal, you as a supporter are not charged a penny. If our project is successfully funded, we will be eligible for a number of grants and alternative funding options, so the success of this campaign would be the difference between a walk and an all-out sprint. We can\u2019t do this without you!\n*** UPDATE: STRETCH GOALS ***\nSince meeting our goal, we've come up with some stretch goals with some ideas of what we can accomplish with the additional funds. \n\u2022 $30,000 - Our first 50+ kegs. We wil be able to buy 50+ sixth-barrel kegs. All backers who have pledged over $200 will be given the opportunity to name a keg (name will be displayed on the side of the keg). We have a longstanding tradition of naming inanimate objects, and this is an opportunity to see your creativity in action. Obviously we have veto power, as we\u2019d rather not have a keg named \u201c[Insert Bar Name Here] Is The Absolute Worst Establishment Of All Time Oh And By The Way This Beer Sucks\u201d showing up at [insert bar name here].\n\u2022 $35,000 \u2013 Repurposed machinery bartop. We will be able to build our bar, which will feature our building\u2019s relic of a conveyor belt (a leftover from its days as an Italian market). No, the bar will not be a conveyor belt; the non-functional machinery will inset into the bar under a glass countertop, complimenting the modern-industrial feel of our taproom.\n\u2022 $40,000 \u2013 Giving back to Braddock, somehow. If we make it this far, we want to find a way to give back to the Braddock community. We\u2019re still trying to figure out the best way to do this. We don\u2019t want to just put it into a charity, as we\u2019d rather put it towards something tangibly beneficial\u2026 more info to come soon.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThis Kickstarter campaign is a catalyst for future development. By funding our project, you will be setting us well on our way towards building a unique facility for us to brew - and for you to enjoy - excellent beer.\nWhere The Funds Will Go\nThe main portion of funds we receive from our Kickstarter will go towards renovating our space and beginning production as soon as possible. This entails installing our brewing, fermentation, and refrigeration system, as well as building and furnishing our taproom. We have existing relationships with a variety of bars and restaurants in the Pittsburgh area, and we will start distributing kegs as soon as our renovation is completed.\nWe have the good fortune to be part of a larger redevelopment program initiated by ACED (Allegheny County Economic Development), with additional county funding going towards the buildout of our facility. With our infrastructure costs largely covered by this source, we will be able to use the Kickstarter funds (as well as a great deal of our own funds) to outfit our space with the highest quality equipment and furnishings.\nHere's a graph that breaks down our funding allocations:\nOur Space\nOur brewing facility is located in Braddock, PA, a small town just outside Pittsburgh. It will house a 3.5-barrel brewing system, as well as a spacious taproom and lounge area. Also occupying our building will be Magarac, the latest restaurant from acclaimed Pittsburgh chef Kevin Sousa, as well as Springboard Kitchen, a non-profit that provides food service based job training for disadvantaged individuals.\n\"Richly historic, large enough to matter, small enough to impact, Braddock presents an unparallelled opportunity for the urban pioneer, artist, or misfit to join in building a new kind of community.\" - 15104.cc\nOur facility at 800 Braddock Avenue, with an entrance at the corner of 8th Street and Woodlawn Avenue.\nThinking Bigger\nOur long-term goal is to create a competitive regional brewery that helps put Pittsburgh on the map for craft beer. Once we outgrow our pilot facility, our intention is to expand production to a larger space within Braddock, enabling us to brew on a much larger scale and begin canning our beers in order to reach a greater audience. Our pilot brewery and taproom will still remain an active part of our operation.\nAs we build our company, we also want to fuel the revitalization of Braddock. A successful business venture will not only provide an economic boost, but also pull more small businesses to the area. Braddock was once a thriving shopping and manufacturing district in which a person could find anything they needed to buy; a handful of successful local businesses would bring the town closer to how it looked during its golden age.\nWe fell in love with Pittsburgh as college freshmen, coming from Hawaii and Boston to Carnegie Mellon University with nearly zero prior knowledge of the city. Although we lived on the same floor and joined the same fraternity that year, it was two years later when we fully committed to following our shared passions for Pittsburgh and craft beer.\nThe Brew Gentlemen Beer Co. was created in 2010, the fall of our junior year. We began researching, brewing, and learning as much as we could about the industry, and had formed the beginnings of the company before we were even of legal drinking age. We both decided to switch to self-defined majors, taking more business, entrepreneurship, and marketing classes in order to better prepare ourselves for starting a commercial brewery.\nWe decided on Braddock as the location for our facility, and had found a suitable building by the time we graduated in May 2012. The gritty environment and historical significance of the old steel town provides the perfect backdrop for a modern-industrial brewery. Although its population and economy nearly disappeared following the collapse of the steel industry in the 1970s, the town currently embraces a period of redevelopment and revitalization.\nMatt Katase & Asa Foster\nUPDATE: BONUS REWARD\nAll backers pledging $100 or more will be eligible to be part of a Sgt.

Although the structure itself is perfectly stable, it requires a good deal more work to turn it into the sleek, modern-industrial space that we\u2019re going to be building. Given the age of the building, there could be some small surprises along the way. Luckily we have access to the architects and consultants that are part of the project to address such concerns as they arise.\n\nThe high cost of fixed assets is a common challenge for brewery startups, as equipment accounts for a large portion of a brewery\u2019s startup costs. However, because of the county funds being applied towards the buildout, our costs are significantly lowered.\n\nLearning to brew on a commercial scale is an inevitable growing pain for us as young brewers. Fortunately, we have the mentorship of Jake Kristophel, head brewer of Full Pint Brewing Co., a local brewery that has been immensely helpful to us thus far. \n\nInitial distribution will be fairly difficult, as we will be self-distributing until we partner with a distribution company.

It's a wifi-enabled, energy efficient, multi-colored bulb that you control with your iPhone or Android. LIFX gives you unprecedented control of your lights, reduces your energy costs, lasts up to 25 years and delivers an amazing range of experiences we think you\u2019ll love.\nSets up in Seconds\nLIFX is incredibly easy to set-up. Simply replace your existing bulbs with LIFX smartbulbs, download and install our free app from the App Store or Google Play and you're good to go.\n\nWe Need Your Help!\nWe [Phil Bosua, Andrew Birt, Andy Gelme, John Bosua, Ben Hamey, Dave Evans and Guy King] have designed, redesigned and reimagined LIFX many times during the past six months, pouring countless hours into thinking about the user experience, the technical aspects of the project and how to deliver the world's smartest lightbulb to you at an affordable price point. You can help bring LIFX bulbs to the world by being the very first to own them!\nWhat is LED Lighting?\nLED lighting is the future of home and commercial lighting around the world. LED's have reached a price point and level of consistency where they're now the best alternative to incandescent bulbs for their energy efficiency [they use approx. 1/10th the energy of standard household bulbs].\nThese bulbs will not only bring you a great experience, but are one of the easiest ways to reduce your energy bills and impact on the environment.\nIn addition they're unbelievably long-lasting. Just like standard LED light bulbs, LIFX smartbulbs are rated to 40,000 hour / up to 25 year standards.\nEnvironmentally Friendly\nLIFX is a revolution in home lighting and will allow you to save money and reduce your environmental impact. With up to 20% of homes power consumption coming from lighting, it makes sense to switch to LED technology and even more sense to switch to LIFX LED smartbulbs. But this is just part of the story, LIFX is about the experience.\nWhat can I do with LIFX smartbulbs in my house?\nControl your lights from anywhere\nChoose any brightness for a specific bulb, a room or your whole house\nCreate the colors to match any mood or decor\nGet notifications such as Twitter, Facebook, Texts and more\nReduce your energy consumption and save money\nVisualise your music with animated colors\nMake an impression at your next dinner party \nGet creative with colors and effects \nCreate a night light for your kids\nSecurity mode when you're on holidays \nCreate groups of lights \nRobot dance like it's 1999\nThere's many more things you can do with LiFX smartbulbs in fact we're creating a software developer kit (SDK) and a hacker kit so hackers and developers alike will be able to release more and more apps to do things we haven't even thought of yet.\nThe LIFX App\nThe free LIFX App will be available on the App Store and Google Play and we also have plans for a Windows, Mac and Linux app. If we achieve our goal we'll fast track the development of these apps across each platform.\nThe LIFX app is one of our favorite aspects of the entire project, and we've spent countless hours thinking about how you can interact with your lights. We have mapped out a very smooth configuration UX from the app to the LIFX master bulb. In essence you place your LIFX smartbulb into a light socket, turn the switch on and then launch the app. You will be guided through a process of choosing your home network from a list and then entering your password. The LIFX master bulb will then auto configure itself to your router and all the slave bulbs will auto connect to the master. If you add more slave bulbs down the track  these will also auto connect. Each smartbulb can be controlled individually. eg. they don't just mirror the master bulb.\nRegarding security: LIFX will be as secure as your WiFi network. eg. without the WiFi network password you can't control the smartbulbs.\nWe're aware that while the hardware is the most visible and interesting part of this project our software is the soul.\nWhat do I get?\nLIFX comes as either a single bulb or can be purchased in packs. Each LIFX bulb is ready to install straight away. Simply choose the type of bulb you need (Edison Screw, Bayonet Cap or Downlight) and you're ready. If you ever need to purchase additional bulbs, these all form part of your mesh network, meaning every LIFX you buy can be controlled via the same app without reconfiguring.\nWhat types of smartbulbs are available?\nBayonet cap [B22]\nEdison Screw [E27]\nDownlight [GU10]\nSome backers have recently asked for specific fixture model numbers.\nAfter the project has finished we will be sending out surveys to all KS backers asking which type of the above LIFX smartbulb casing you want. You will be able to mix and match bulbs styles in any combination. We are preparing more details on the above casings and other options that will be available in the next few weeks including dimensions and more. The more pledges we receive the more options will be available. Please direct message us if you have a preference for casing style/type that is not on the above list.\nThe Tech\nLIFX uses a master/slave concept to connect to your home router via 802.11n and then onto all the other LIFX smartbulbs via 802.15.4 mesh network. Each LIFX can connect to all country electricity systems from 110V to 260V. This includes USA, Canada, UK, Germany, France, Australia and 95% of other countries around the world. \nYour light switch needs to remain on for the smartbulb to be accessible with the LIFX app. However you can use any light switch to turn your smartbulbs on and off like you do with traditional bulbs.\nLIFX uses a mesh network. The standby power usage of each bulb is very small, in fact a AA battery would keep a LIFX smartbulb in standby mode for approximately 1-2 years. [note: The master bulb requires a WiFi connection which uses approximately 2-3 watts. Only 1x master bulb is required in each home/office.]\nThe LIFX prototype uses an RGB phosphorous COB LED lamp which is approx. the equivalent of a 60 watt incandescent bulb or 50 watt halogen downlight. We are looking into all the options on the best type/brand of LED lamp to use in the production model. Getting this right is something we are very passionate about. (real world comparison - actual lumens of LIFX rated at higher levels than 60w incandescent bulbs)\nWe couldn\u2019t have done this without our distributed systems hacker Andy Gelme who is the lead engineer on LIFX. He\u2019s been at the forefront of automation technology for many years creating systems that run on top of open industry standards.\nWe will be releasing a LIFX Software Development Kit (SDK) that will allow mobile App developers and home automation hackers full control over their LIFX smartbulbs. This includes using a small scripting engine that runs within the LIFX smartbulb. Stay tuned for more details. We can't wait to see what amazing hacks you come up with.\nWe have set up a LIFX Tech blog where you can interact directly with our lead software engineer Andy. Just pop on over to that page if you have some curly questions.\nhttp://tech.lifx.co\nComments\nWe are receiving lots of awesome comments. Keep them coming. One of our favs below.\n\"Out of all Kickstarter projects I have pledged for the LIFX is the first one which, when I showed my wife the intro movie, she immediately said \"Oh, I HOPE you're backing THIS!\" - so, LIFX is as of now officially WifeApproved (tm) in our home, which kind of makes me want to up my pledge to about three dozen lamps.\" - KS LIFX Backer - Nick Sakellariou\nEdits\n- On the back of questions and information we are receiving from the Kickstarter community regarding wattage and lumen output of bulbs in general we have adjusted the video to more accurately reflect this new information. One of the things we love about the Kickstarter process and community is it allows people like us to crowd source funding but more importantly ideas and smarts. We are committed to creating the worlds best smartbulb and will adjust our thinking and approach to achieve this. Given the overwhelming response to our project we are also now planning to hire the best darned LED experts we can find!! Thanks again for your support - we're glad we can share this journey with you.\n- Removed IPV6 from the main info page. Our aim is to use IPV6 but we prefer not to guarantee this until our development matures over the next few months.\nThe Internet of Things\nWe love the internet of things, home automation and the overall concept of the smart home but we also understand for most people it is a large chasm to jump. This understanding has been one of the guiding forces in the design of the LIFX smartbulb - to start with one commonly used household item and make it smart, easy to use and accessible to everyone.\nManufacturing \nLIFX Smartbulbs have been designed and prototyped in Melbourne, Australia and San Francisco, USA and we plan to manufacture via a trusted partner with operations in based in Melbourne and Shenzhen. We realise that whilst we're reinventing the lightbulb this doesn't mean we have to reinvent the manufacturing process. We are using as many standard LED lighting components as possible. These components have undergone rigid testing and stood the test of time. We are also very excited to create our own LIFX customised computer board \"the brains\" of this project. Also fully featured FREE apps will be available on the App Store\u00ae and Google Play\u00ae designed by Bonobo Labs.\nOur Vision\n\"LIFX answers a need that is well and truly overdue. Everyone in the world needs light bulbs. Existing light bulbs are based on an archaic technology that threatens our environment. Light bulbs consume approximately 20% of electricity in homes around the world. They need to be more efficient, smarter and last longer. In the twenty-first century, people need lighting that matches the \"smart culture\" and eco aware sensibilities of our day.\"\nPhil Bosua - Inventor of the LIFX smartbulb", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "mini update - correct shipping addresses", "update_content": "It's been a pretty exciting couple of weeks at the LIFX office.

Check UPDATES for latest news, and visit www.wattvision.com for more info.\nRecent Media Coverage: Mashable - Jetson Green - Treehugger - US 1 Newspaper\nWhat\u2019s Wattvision?\nWattvision is an energy sensor and mobile app that helps you save money on energy by giving you a live view of your energy use. By setting goals and tracking your spending in real-time, you\u2019ll never be surprised by your energy bill again. Wattvision is designed with a great end-to-end user experience in mind. How much money are you spending on energy right now? You\u2019ll always know with Wattvision.\n\u201cIf Apple created an energy monitor - it would be the Wattvision. I love it.\u201d - David G, real Wattvision user\n\u201cThe Wattvision monitor has already paid for itself in the first 3 months and now I receive credits on my bills.\u201d - Brandon D, real Wattvision user\nHow does it work?\nSensor > Wattvision Cloud > Your Phone & Web\nWattvision works by gathering data from your electricity meter -- that funky device that wasn\u2019t designed by user experience experts. Setup is easy: just surface-mount your Wattvision Energy Sensor to the outside of your meter, connect the Wattvision Gateway to your network, and then go online on your computer or mobile device to see and analyze your real-time energy data.\nIf you have an analog meter, our analog sensors will watch and time the rotations of the disk inside your meter. Each rotation marks a fixed quantity of energy used by your house. If you have a digital meter, our digital sensor will read the infrared pulses emitted by your meter that also mark the energy coming from the grid. Your sensor sends the data through your home network (via the Wattvision Gateway), to Wattvision servers. You can then view the data live on your mobile device, on your computer, or anywhere you choose. Look at historical trends in your energy use, receive e-mail and text message alerts, and track your home\u2019s overall efficiency compared to similar homes.\nUnlike most systems, there is no electrician required to set up Wattvision! Because we connect to your meter, we track your whole home's energy use -- not just one outlet or one appliance!\nHow can I use Wattvision?\nSave money by setting daily energy spending goals, and track your progress against these goals in real-time. \nSee if the green changes you make are actually making a difference.\nCompare and rank your home with similar homes across the country.\nFind energy-draining devices, including faulty appliances.\nReceive alerts and catch problems before you get an unusually high energy bill.\nUse our API to integrate data into your home automation system or send to other 3rd party services for detailed analysis.\nThe Project: Wattvision 2\nWe have great feedback from our amazing early adopters across the country, and we\u2019re ready to act on this feedback and expand Wattvision to more users. That\u2019s where you come in, Kickstarter.\nWe\u2019ve started work on Wattvision 2: a complete remake of our hardware from the ground up, that features broader compatibility, more networking options, higher reliability and even easier setup. But we can\u2019t make this happen without your support.\nWith a successful kickstarter campaign, we\u2019ll be able to:\nComplete development of Wattvision 2\nMake a large production run to get Wattvision 2 in your hands\nExpand our reach to more types of power meters -- our goal is ALL meters\nSupport Ethernet and more types of wireless networks (specifically g and n)\nFeatures and Specs for Wattvision 2\nWattvision 2: You'll get a Gateway and one sensor appropriate for your meter\nHardware\nDurable, heavy-duty sensors designed for outdoor use\nSet and forget (no batteries involved)\nCompatible with most analog and digital power meters\nAccurate to within 2 watts\nData updated ~ every 10 seconds\nQuick and easy to set up\nManufactured in the USA\nSoftware:\niPhone and Android support\nE-mail and text message alerts and recommendations\nData download into Excel or any other software\nDeveloper API for custom and 3rd party applications\nShared community energy graphs\nTop Energy Savers Rankings\nBecome a Wattvisionary by pledging to our Kickstarter campaign today. Your pledge will help us create the hardware and software needed to realize our collective vision for a more energy efficient future!\nAt a glance, see how you're doing\nPlan\nCase Studies\nWe sold out of the first version of Wattvision on Amazon, and received a solid 5 stars across 8 user-submitted reviews. Here are some excerpts:\n\"Simplicity wins compared to the competition\"\n\"My New neurosis\"\n\"Simple, Effective Energy Monitoring\"\n\"It paid for itself in 3 months\"\n\"The one that works great\"\n\"Super cool device great value\"\n+Most of our customers have discovered phantom loads, appliances which periodically turn on and off and cost money in the background, and then added schedules or made adjustments.  With Wattvision you can see how much it costs you to run anything from a light bulb to a microwave to a hair dryer.\n+A customer calculated the cost of drying a load of clothes, and decided to air dry his family\u2019s clothes after discovering the high cost (hard to beat sun and wind power!)\n+An industrial customer in Michigan uses Wattvision to avoid a higher cost of energy that can kick in when their industrial equipment draws too much power.\n+A customer with solar panels had been unable to zero his energy bill, but with Wattvision he was able to make the changes that now allow him to get paid by his utility each month\nAPI\nWattvision allows you to download data as fast as we receive it, through our download API. Pretty neat stuff. Researchers and third parties have already shown that it\u2019s possible to take whole house data and break it down by appliance, a scenario we\u2019re excited to enable.\nWhile we make strides to use clean and renewable energy in the future, it\u2019s vital to remember that the cleanest energy is the energy we never use. One of the most important steps towards improving our energy habits is simply to cut down on our existing energy use, and we can do that by first knowing where we stand. Wattvision makes this possible by showing you your real-time energy use on the web or on your phone. We want everyone to take charge of their energy lifestyle and bring the future to the present!\nSee QA below.\nSpecial Thanks\nJared Flesher - videography - http://www.sourlands.com.

Keep an eye on our Facebook and Twitter pages as the campaign unfolds! You can also sign up for our email newsletter. \nTake a peek at what you can design with the Lumi Process:\nWhat is the Lumi Process?\nThe Lumi Process is a revolutionary photographic print process for textiles and natural materials. The process is based on Inkodye, mixable, dilutable, water-based dyes, which develop their color in sunlight. Currently available in three colors: red, orange and blue.\nInkodye can bind to any vegetal or animal fiber, such as cotton, linen, wool, silk, suede and wood. Once fixed, the color becomes permanent and can go through repeated machine washes without fading.\nInkodye's light-sensitive properties open new possibilities for artistic and commercial uses:\nTrue photographic prints that show a range of tonality rather than half-tone patterns. Turn your smartphone pictures into beautiful designs.\nPermanent. Your prints will be soft and machine-washable. The dye actually becomes part of the fiber.\nWorks on any natural fiber. Great on 100% cotton tees and delicate materials like silk, suede and wool which are not capable of going through pH or heat-setting stages. \nPrints over rough materials such as burlap, jute and sewn garments, into recesses that typical screen-printing could not reach. \nUses the sun! No need for electricity, silkscreens or high-end equipment.\nThe System\nStarter Kit\nThe starter kit includes 4 ounces of each color (118ml), instructions, a vignette-shaped stencil and a negative that you can cut out and start experimenting with. \nThis kit will allow you to print between 12 sq ft. and 48 sq ft. (1.1 m2 to 4.4 m2) depending on how absorbent your material is, and whether or not you dilute the dye. \nTransparent Film\nThe film provided in our Full System Kit is 11x17\" (equivalent to A3 paper) specially coated for laser printing. It absorbs more toner than typical transparencies allowing you to print dense negatives. This will ensure that the whites in your image stay white. Each transparency is connected to a carrier sheet of paper which makes it run through typical copiers more effectively.\nIf you prefer to use your own transparency, there are a few ways to get dark negatives. The easiest we've found is to print two negatives on your home inkjet printer and double them up.\nTextile Detergent\nTo make sure your prints don't continue developing, you'll have to wash out the unexposed dye in hot water with a strong textile detergent. The one we provide is specifically made to clear residual dye. However, it is possible to use regular laundry detergent, but you may need to run your print through the washing machine twice.\nHow can I use the Lumi Process?\nDesign photographically-printed garments.\nCreate colorful artwork on natural materials.\nGive the objects around you a new life.\nStart a business printing with light.\nMake shadow prints, like this design by Jessica Jones from \"How About Orange\".\nWhat's the app for?\nLumityper is a simple utility that helps you create negatives from your smartphone pictures. It also gives you mobile access to printing instructions and troubleshooting guides.\nOnce you've turned your image into a negative, you can save it or email it to yourself. The file can then be printed directly on a copier such as the ones found at Kinkos/FedEx.\nThe app was designed for iPhone, and will be available soon after the campaign ends. Thanks to your support we will be working towards an Android version too! If you're an Android user please fill out this form which will help us decide which devices to develop for.\nNegatives can also be made on your computer, using Photoshop, or even web apps such as Pixlr.com. We have a guide that helps you through the process. \nThe app will be free to download for all backers.  \nWhy are you using Kickstarter?\nWe've been selling Inkodye for the past 6 months and it has already been shipped to customers in over 60 countries! Some of them have already created amazing things. Along the way we realized that additional tools, like clear films, textile detergent and apps could help make printing with Inkodye even easier . We're using Kickstarter because it's the fastest way to bring the Lumi Printing System directly to the people who want to use it. \nOver 2 years ago we ran a Kickstarter campaign to fund research on this project. Thanks to all of you, we made our printing process a reality. Now it's time to share that technology with the community that made it possible!\nIn order to provide this system of tools at an affordable price, we need to buy supplies in large volumes, which is why we are raising $50,000. Any funds that exceed that amount will be dedicated to improving the process, like developing new colors, and bringing the Lumityper app to Android and desktop computers.\nTake it further...\nWe've created several great options if you want to take your Lumi printing projects further. These rewards offer savings up to 20% off retail price.\nShare with a friend! Includes the $70 full system, plus an extra kit.\nPrint it all. Get an additional 48 ounces of Lumi printing power. Enough to print over 40 t-shirts!\nHost workshops. Includes 30 extra bottles of Inkodye to help you teach photography, chemistry, textile arts, and more.\nStart a printing business.

It's how most of us grew up gaming. \nBut maybe people are missing out.\nWe get it \u2013 smartphones and tablets are getting all the new titles \u2013 they're \"what's hot.\u201d The console market is pushing developers away. We\u2019ve seen a brain drain: some of the best, most creative gamemakers are focused on mobile and social games because those platforms are more developer-friendly. And the ones who remain focused on console games can\u2019t be as creative as they\u2019d like.\nDeep down, you know your best gaming memories happened in the living room.\nYou busted your ass just to find out the princess was \"in another castle.\" You fought bosses that told you repeatedly how much \"you suck.\" You taped a blanket to half of your screen so your friend couldn't see where you were. You traded the best players onto your team just so you could have the perfect season. And you did it all on the TV.\nIt's time to upend console gaming.\nLet\u2019s open this sucker up! It's time we brought back innovation, experimentation, and creativity to the big screen. Let\u2019s make the games less expensive to make, and less expensive to buy. With all our technological advancements, shouldn't costs be going down? Gaming could be cheaper!\nWe're handing the reins over to the developer with only one condition: at least some gameplay has to be free. We borrowed the free-to-play model from games like League of Legends, Team Fortress 2, Triple Town, and many others. Developers can offer a free demo with a full-game upgrade, in-game items or powers, or ask you to subscribe.\nOUYA: The revolution will be televised \nOUYA is a new game console for the TV, powered by Android.\nWe've packed this little box full of power. Developers will have access to OUYA's open design so they can produce their games for the living room, taking advantage of everything the TV has to offer. \nBest of all, OUYA's world-class controller, console, and interface come in one beautiful, inexpensive package. All the games on it will be free, at least to try.\nGreat games come from great developers.\nDevelopers can wave farewell to the roadblocks of bringing a console game to market. Anyone can make a game: every OUYA console is a dev kit. No need to purchase a license or an expensive SDK. It's built on Android, so developers already know how it works. \nThat doesn't mean OUYA is an Android port. You can create the next big title in your bedroom \u2013 just like the good old days! Who needs pants!? \nOUYA could change AAA game development, too. Forget about licensing fees, retail fees, and publishing fees. \nAnd developers agree:\n\"This has the potential to be the game developer\u2019s console. It's about time!\" -- Brian Fargo (founder of inXile) \n\u201cWho wouldn't want a beautiful piece of industrial design that sells for $99, plugs straight into your TV, and gives you access to a huge library of games?\" \u2013 Jordan Mechner (creator of Prince of Persia, Karateka) \n\u201cIf OUYA delivers on the promise of being the first true open gaming platform that gives indie developers access to the living room gaming market, yes that is a great idea. We will follow the development of OUYA and see how it resonates with gamers. I could see all current Mojang games go on the platform if there's a demand for it.\u201d \u2013 Mojang (developer of Minecraft) \n\"I'm excited for OUYA! I am a firm believer that there is always room to challenge the status quo.\" -- Jenova Chen (thatgamecompany, creator of flOw, Cloud, and Flower)\n\u201cThe prospect of an affordable, open console -- that's an idea I find really exciting.\u201d -- Adam Saltsman (Semi Secret, creator of Canabalt)\n\n\"Our games will work so well on a TV, we just need an easy way to get them there. OUYA could be it.\" -- Marek Rabas (Madfinger Games)\n\n\"An open game console that gives independent game developers the flexibility to experiment with their games and business models on the TV, is something that's long overdue.\" \u2013 David Edery (Spry Fox, creator of Triple Town)\nDesign matters.\nWe believe a great console requires a great user experience. We are working with the award-winning designer, Yves Behar, and his firm fuseproject (designer of the Jambox).\nWe are designing the controller to be a love letter to console gaming. It will have everything you've learned to love: fast buttons, triggers, laser-precise analog sticks, a D-Pad \u2013 and it will have a touchpad for any games making the trek from mobile or tablet to the TV. It'll be just the right weight. We are working with select developers to play-test the controller through development.  We call it 'the Stradivarius of controllers,' and we hope developers will be inspired to take gameplay to a new level with it.\nHackers welcome.\nHave at it: It's easy to root (and rooting won't void your warranty). Everything opens with standard screws. Hardware hackers can create their own peripherals, and connect via USB or Bluetooth. You want our hardware design? Let us know. We might just give it to you. Surprise us!\nSpecifications:\nTegra3 quad-core processor \n1GB RAM \n8GB of internal flash storage\nHDMI connection to the TV, with support for up to 1080p HD \nWiFi 802.11 b/g/n \nBluetooth LE 4.0 \nUSB 2.0 (one) \nWireless controller with standard controls (two analog sticks, d-pad, eight action buttons, a system button), a touchpad \nAndroid 4.0\nETHERNET! (Announced by Muffi 7/18)\nStandard OUYA Console\nLimited-Edition Kickstarter Console\nIt's entertainment beyond gaming. \nBecause OUYA is based on Android, any app developer could publish their Android app to OUYA. The possibilities are limitless, and conversations with potential partners are already underway. Here\u2019s our first: do you like watching StarCraft, or League of Legends? Watch Twitch.TV on your OUYA. \nWe've come a long way already. The user interface and industrial designs are far along. Our prototype is up and running. What we have left to do is simple, but it's expensive. (We\u2019re looking at you Mark Cuban! Woz! Help us out.)\nAll we need is you. \nWith your help, we need to: \nConvert our prototype to production-ready models and get all the regulatory approvals (yeah, we need these to sell them)\nDeliver developer kits (for early developers so we can have games on day one, though every console will include an SDK once we launch)\nPlace our first production orders (we are working with a manufacturing firm with lots of game hardware experience, but we need to know how many to make!)\nIdeally, fund some initial game development (i.e., 1st-party games)\nAnd if you\u2019re international, we want your help too\u2026gaming is global, and we will get you OUYA. We still have a lot to figure out in regards to rights and countries, but it can be done. Look what we've accomplished already! \nShow the world, through your numbers, that you're out there.\nShow them you're ready to level the playing field. Enlist others. The more we raise, the more we can do. \nOUYA: THE REVOLUTION WILL BE TELEVISED", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 29372, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ouya/ouya-a-new-kind-of-video-game-console", "project_name": "OUYA: A New Kind of Video Game Console"}}, {"backer": "Colin Dean", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Story\n\nYour husband cheated on you. That mean neighbor lady ran over your dog. Someone cut you off in traffic. I'm sure if we really thought about it, each of us could pinpoint a moment in time when someone did something so heinous or stupid or mean that we just thought (or maybe screamed) \"I could kill them.\"\nBut if you were given the legal right to do it, would you? Are you capable of killing someone? What would push you over the edge? What would life be like after you did it?\nOne started out as a fake movie trailer which premiered at a Halloween concert, but we (the filmmakers) soon realized the topic was begging some more serious questions, and it intrigued us. Two years later, we had an exciting script, a team of eager cast and crew, and a desire to see this on the big screen. \nAnd we need your help to make it happen! Need more inspiration?\nWatch the No-Budget Mock Trailer (and imagine what this could become with your support) \nOur Philosophy\nWe believe that a good film doesn\u2019t have to cost millions of dollars to make. With a solid script, a cast and crew who are dedicated to the project and willing to do whatever it takes to see it come to life, and a host of grassroots supporters, we can make something to rival the best Hollywood has to offer.\nOne is a smart script. The characters are strong, the story is tight, and we've written it in such a way that we can film it on a next-to-no budget. \nEvery dollar you contribute will go into making this film look better, sound better, and be all around more excellent and entertaining. We promise.\nYour Contribution\nUsing local actors and crew, we're planning a 21-day shoot to take place before the end of 2012. Your contribution will go directly into the actual filming, editing and promotion of this project. We need to pay cast and crew, rent gear, buy meals for everyone, secure locations and props, edit, promote the movie, print it -- all the normal costs of a normal production. We feel that with this great movie idea, access to local talent and other resources, our success with shorter projects, and just a lot of drive, we can produce a film that looks like it cost 10 times as much as it did. We've learned to work smart and use limited resources as an opportunity to be more creative.\nWanted:Films\nMichael Savisky and Michael Fuller (the producer/writer/directors) have been working together for seven or eight years (they lose track sometimes). They've made award-winning short films together, and a host of business films for companies like Whole Foods and AT&T. They've honed a look and style that has gained them recognition far outside of Pittsburgh. Michael Savisky made a short film that got him into the semi-finals of the Steven Spielberg and Mark Burnett production On the Lot and traveled to South Africa to work on a short documentary Shoes To George.\nAs a professional actor, Michael Fuller has appeared in numerous stage productions, including Death of a Salesman directed by Arthur Miller\u2019s son Robert Miller.

The cutters currently available on the market are big and bulky and not very interesting to look at. My design was meant to be simple to operate, easy to store and more aesthetically pleasing; something you wouldn\u2019t mind keeping in your kitchen.\nSome of my favorites:\nThe evolution to the Kinkajou:\nCutting a bottle is an easy 3-step process\nActually it\u2019s a 4 step process if you include consuming the bottles contents first :)\nScoring: While the Kinkajou is called a bottle cutter it does not actually cut the bottle. The tool is meant to create a score line on the bottle at the location you wish to cut the bottle. You simply need to put the Kinkajou around the bottle, tighten it to create a snug fit and align the cutting wheel to the location you want to score the bottle. Once it is snug and the cutting wheel is at the proper location, start slowly turning the bottle. You only want to go around once.\nSeparation: There are many videos on the internet showing different methods to separate the two sections of the bottle but after trying them all, the method that produces the most consistent results is simply to use hot water (doing this over a kitchen sink is recommended). Boil some water and pour it over the score line. After a few seconds, use a faucet to pour cold water over the same score line. This cycle of hot and cold will cause the bottle to crack along the score line. The bottle should separate after one or 2 cycles of hot and cold, thicker glass may take additional cycles.\nFinishing: Now that you have separated the two halves you will be left with a sharp edge. To remove this edge, you simply have to sand it down with a piece of sand paper. The sand paper needs to be made of silicon carbide or aluminum oxide (I will include the proper sandpaper with every Kinkajou I ship). Using water to keep the sandpaper wet will help keep the dust to a minimum. There are 3 sections to sand: the outside edge, the inside edge and the flat surface. Using an 80 grit sandpaper to start, will quickly remove the sharp edge but will leave the glass scratched and frosted. If you want to bring this edge back to a smooth clear like finish you will need to use multiple sheets of sandpaper with a different grit. These are the grit levels I would recommend. 80, 120,180,220. Once you\u2019ve sanded the glass with a 220 it should be very smooth, if you want to make even smoother you will need to use glass polishing compounds (found at your local hardware store).\nColor Voting Option\nWhile the Kinkajou will be available in 2 standard colors, bright white and deep black, there will be a third color. This color will be decided via a majority vote by all those who have backed the color voting option. If any of these backers are unhappy with the winning color they will be allowed to select one of the two standard colors in its place.\nDesign Changes\n1. To ensure that no additional tools are needed to operate the Kinkajou, the securing mechanism has been redesigned. It now includes two small handles to lock in the bottle once it has been hand tightened.\n2. The cutting wheel has also been redesigned to be spring-loaded to ensure the correct amount of pressure is applied to the bottle at all times.\nHow will the money raised be used?\nThe Kinkajou will be manufactured using a process called rapid injection molding. This process requires me to first create a master mold.\n\nI need a large enough initial order to take advantage of the economies of scale. My initial order needs to be in the thousands in order to bring the per unit price down enough to make this product affordable. Every Kinkajou will be made up of approximately 35 separate parts.\n\nThe majority of my rewards include shipping. I did this to simplify things but my actual cost to ship Kinkajou\u2019s across North America is substantial. Approximately 25% to 30% of a typical $50 pledge will be used for shipping.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "3 Years has passed since the Kinkajou Bottle Cutter was funded !!!", "update_content": "Hey Backers, \nIt has been three years since the Kinkajou launched and I wanted to check in here, where it all began.

There\u2019s a reason for that I would now like to explain.  Back in December 2012 I placed an order for my second batch of Kinkajous. At the same time I was getting feedback from those who had already received their Kinkajous. Over all the feedback was great, except for one issue that kept coming up.  Some people (not the majority) were having difficulties getting a perfect score line. The perfectionist in me could not let this go. So I stopped the second production run and took the first flight to China to further investigate this issue. A few months later I\u2019m happy to report that the Kinkajou has been improved.

It features levels designed to force players to think off the ground and out of the box.  Its pacing is similar to classic shooters like Quake and Unreal Tournament, and agile movement is at the core of the experience.  Retrovirus also features a unique arsenal of weapons that do more than just dish out damage.  By scanning residual weapon effects in the world, you can create gravity wells, knock enemies around or trigger charged blasts on groups of enemies.\nIn Retrovirus, you are the Agent of an anti-virus program fighting against a viral army that has rapidly taken over parts of your system.  Called on to respond to the crisis, you must defend the system and remove the virus before it can corrupt and destroy your world.  In doing so, you'll explore a surreal software environment that pieces fragments of human reality into the fabric of its own world.\nRetrovirus also features a dual narrative, bringing in the fictional people to whom this computer is important along with their personal dramas and real-world implications if the system is allowed to fall.\n5 to 6 hour single player / co-op campaign\na world designed around the unique features of six degrees of freedom movement\nweapons designed to give players both damage and control of space\ndecision-based AI for unscripted level encounters\nDOTA-style FPS MOBA multiplayer\nclassic Domination / Deathmatch / Team Deathmatch multiplayer\n\nIf we're successful with Kickstarter, we'll be guaranteeing the release of our Paragon design tool for the community.  With Paragon, you'll be able to author your own mods and levels, extending the life of the game and enriching the player community.\n\nParagon's basic level design tools are intuitive, based on FPS controls rather than a wholly separate set of editor controls.  You'll be able to play with assets from Retrovirus, or create your own and design a wholly new experience using Paragon as your toolbox.\n\nWe look forward to seeing what the community can do with this!\nMost importantly, Kickstarter will give us the extra development time we need to finish Retrovirus' single player campaign as it exists on paper.  Without Kickstarter, about an hour of single player content is set to be cut.  We're also pursuing professional voice acting and in-engine cinematics to help bring the Retrovirus story to life.  We'd also like to have a large-scale beta to gather community feedback prior to release, and Kickstarter will give us the funds to accomplish that.  A successful Kickstarter will allow us the time to polish the game to the level we know we can achieve.\nCadenza Interactive is a company with real gamers at the controls.  In 2008, the company was formed with the goal of producing the sorts of games we'd want to play at LAN parties.  We released our first game, Sol Survivor, on Steam in 2010 to warm critical and public reviews.  We've learned a lot since Sol Survivor, and we've spent the past two years burying ourselves in the craft of making games.  Retrovirus is a real thing that we've seen grow from nothing into what we're showing you here with Kickstarter.  We want to continue this momentum and finish strong, with the polish and style that our players deserve!\n----------------------------\nWe at Cadenza are all thrilled you took the time to read this far into our Kickstarter.  The making of this game has consumed all of us.  Before Retrovirus' development is through, there will have been two new weddings, four new full-time additions to the Cadenza staff, and many nights shooting at each other in a digital world we've come together to create.

GameStop was not an obvious choice of an initial release platform; even to me! So, why did we decide to release on GameStop\u2019s PC Digital Downloads first? Lets start at the beginning.\n\nWe needed some funding to finish Retrovirus and make it into the game that we had envisioned. So we put together a Kickstarter. One of our backers was a huge Descent fan. When the kickstarter did not succeed, he put his money where his mouth was and financially backed our project. He saw what we saw.\n\nAnother one of our backers was a manager at GameStop. He fell in love with Retrovirus and wanted to see it succeed. He too saw what we saw. He went to his boss and they both approached us about a week after the kickstarter closed and offered us an incredible deal.\n\nFor small, independent, game studios like Cadenza Interactive, our greatest challenge is reaching out to gamers. Even though we are working on tech and gameplay that is competitive with much larger studios, we struggle to reach out to gamers who have not already heard of us. Our new friends at GameStop offered us that very ability.\n\nIf you live in the US, go to your nearest GameStop store and you will see fliers for Retrovirus on the counter. The store manager will happily talk your ear off about the project. The TV in the corner will periodically show video of the game. If you use the GameStop PC Download App, you will see our banner take over the entire page right after Borderlands 2. If you go to GameStop.com/pcgames you will see Retrovirus appear in the Ad banner rotation next to Darksiders II and Elder Scrolls.\n\nWhy did we release first on GameStop? They offered us a deal that only AAA games get. The success of Retrovirus will be largely thanks to the exposure we are now receiving. More than that, we are releasing first on GameStop because I speak with the higher-ups over there every other day and they are as passionate about Retrovirus as I am!\n\nI know that some of you don\u2019t have access to a GameStop store and don\u2019t use GameStop PC Downloads, and I promise that we have not forgotten you. We will be coming out on other platforms. For now, the GameStop platform is actually very friendly to indie games. Unlike some other platforms, GameStop does not require DRM, they allow users to download their games over again for an unlimited time, and they even allow us to give out keys for other platforms.\n\nFor those who are able, we would appreciate your support by pre-ordering Retrovirus on GameStop and continuing to spread the word about our project to your friends and family. These pre-orders allow you to play the Alpha (and soon the Beta) and get access to updates as soon as we make them!\n\nThank you for your continued support!\n\n-Spencer Roberts-\nPresident, Cadenza Interactive"}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 122, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cadenzainteractive/retrovirus", "project_name": "Retrovirus, a six axis shooter"}}, {"backer": "Colin Dean", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Who is ShuBrew? \nIt's magic time and we need your help! \nShuBrew is a concept for a craft brewery based in the northern Pittsburgh area and your next local brew pub! We not only promise excellent brews, but also high quality food offered to you in a relaxed, fun atmosphere. Just because we say high quality does not mean we are serving fine dining; we want to offer more simple, seasonal foods that are made with fresh, flavorful, local ingredients and taste great with your beer.\nDon't have time to stay? Take a growler of one of our small-batch handcrafted brews to go and enjoy your favorite ShuBrew at home.\n(These are the tasting glasses offered in the $25 level)\nWhat ShuBrew Will Be...\nJust like our branding we are fun, creative, and open-minded ready to take on the challenges of operating a brew pub. During our first few years of operation we will run the brewpub and serve beer in-house or growlers to go. Our menu will be small, but continuously updated and will change with the season. We will initially offer four constant release beers and one rotational beer. As a family of Shumakers we found it fitting to name our beers after a different style of shoe and had a local artist draw the logos for each. You can check out more details about each beer and its' shoe on our web page! Our initial beer offerings will be the following:\nThe Great Valenki, Russian Imperial Stout \nTillie's Ghillies, Scottish Ale/Wee Heavy \nGalosha Raptor, American Pale Ale\nBlack Beard's Booties, Black IPA \nJungle Boot IPA, American IPA \nMurphy's Paw, TBA\n(these are the posters you get to choose from at the $100 level)\nWhy Should You Invest? \nMaking the beer or food is not a problem; however, buying the equipment and supplies needed is and we need your help to fund our dream. This is a win-win situation.....you get a great local brew pub to hang out at and we get to follow our passion. ShuBrew will also support the community by purchasing ingredients for both the food and beer from local suppliers and farmers. We would also like to become involved with activities that support the surrounding communities such as hosting beer tasting events to help benefit other local organizations. \nNot only will we offer an establishment quite unlike any currently available in this area, but we are also innovators and will always bring you something new and creative to eat or drink without compromising our standards of quality.  We have the business acumen and brewing knowledge that is necessary to bring this project to you and make it a successful venture.  By brewing smaller batches we give ourselves the freedom to experiment with new tastes and are open to using non-traditional ingredients, as in our Galosha Raptor Pale Ale which features tangerines and pink peppercorns.  We also want to get involved with collaborative brewing efforts.  We never look at other craft breweries as competition, but rather as partners in an ongoing effort to progress our industry.\nIf we raise the funds we need, ShuBrew would like to be open for business by 2013.  We are currently looking at real estate in the Cranberry Township and Mars/Seven Fields area. \nPlease help us to do something we love!\nHow Do I Help?\nIf you've never used Kickstarter before, here is the scoop.  We need help getting our project off the ground, so we reach out to people like yourselves that may share a similar interest in making ShuBrew come to life so you have a really awesome brewpub to hang out at.  \nWe have 60 days to reach our goal.  If we don't reach it we don't get any of the money that was pledged.  If we do reach it, we get to keep it and make our brewpub your reality.  If we go beyond it we are going to be able to do it faster and better (so that's what we are really hoping for).\nRead over the incentives on the right-hand side and decide which perks you are interested in.  The benefit to you is that the more you offer the better the value because the prizes are cumulative.  The only exception to that is if you get one of our Shmug Club memberships you don't get every membership level offered below.  For example, if you choose Platinum you don't also get the Gold, Silver and Bronze memberships.  You do however get all the other cool rewards in the previous levels.\nAnything helps, so even if you can't reach our lowest reward level you can make it up to us.  Every dollar counts.. so donate a dollar if that's all you can do :)  The other big way you can help is to tell EVERYONE about this page and what we are doing.

My career as an author of science and historical fiction has turned me into a swordsmanship geek. As such, I'm dissatisfied with how swordfighting is portrayed in existing video games. These could be so much more fun than they are. Time for a revolution.\nIn the last couple of years, affordable new gear has come on the market that makes it possible to move, and control a swordfighter's actions, in a much more intuitive way than pulling a plastic trigger or pounding a key on a keyboard. So it's time to step back, dump the tired conventions that have grown up around trigger-based sword games, and build something that will enable players to inhabit the mind, body, and world of a real swordfighter.\nCLANG will begin with the Queen of Weapons: the two-handed longsword used in Europe during late medieval and early renaissance times. This is a well-documented style that has enjoyed a revival in recent years thanks to the efforts of scholars and martial artists worldwide.\nAt first, it'll be a PC arena game based on one-on-one multiplayer dueling (which is a relatively simple and attainable goal; we don't want to mess this up by overreaching). Dueling, however, is only the tip of the sword blade. During the past few years, we have been developing a rich world, brimming with all manner of adventure tales waiting to be written--and to be played. In conjunction with 47 North, Amazon.com's new science fiction publishing house, we've already begun publishing some of those stories, and we have plenty more in the hopper. Once we get CLANG off the ground we intend to weave game and story content together in a way that'll enhance both the playing and the reading experience.\n\"How will this be different than SoulCalibur?\" you ask. .....\nLow-latency, high-precision motion controller: Critical to a satisfying sword fight is fast, accurate response. This is especially important for CLANG given the depth and complexity of moves that are used in real sword arts. Initially, CLANG will make use of a commercial, third-party, off-the-shelf controller that anyone can buy today\nDepth: Roundhouse swings and crude blocks just aren't enough. Real sword fighting involves multiple attacks delivered from different stances, pommel strikes, grappling, feints, and parries.\nExpandability: Implementing the longsword style will oblige us to construct a toolkit that can then be used--by us, or by others--to create other examples of what we're calling MASEs (Martial Arts System Embodiments). If your thing is Japanese kenjutsu or Viking sword-and-board, then in principle CLANG should support it.\nRaising an army (or, in this case, building an enormous story-driven video game) is an expensive proposition and can take a number of years. In keeping with the scrappy, ragtag band of adventurers model, we are building this larger vision one step at a time. The next step is to build a functional proof of concept in the form of an exciting prototype we can share with you and use to achieve our next level of funding--which will enable us to provide more character models, more environments, and more MASEs. Which is to say, other weapons and styles from other places and eras. We are building a framework that can be expanded as far and as deeply as possible. We have, after all, several thousand years of martial history to draw from.              \nIn Which Neal goes into detail, as is his wont, regarding Clang:\nPlease read Technical Update #1 for details on CLANG design elements such as MASEs and In/Out of System movements.\nTechnical Update #2 covers our plans for the combat UI.\nIn Technical Update #3 Neal discusses timing, lag and tachypsychia.\nTechnical Update #4 goes more deeply into Sword Sync and Force Feedback.\nVideo update for reaching 50% of our goal.

An essential purchase.\u201d \nEscape Magazine 6 out of 6\n\u201cThe gameplay is spot on and anyone with a dark enough sense of humour should give it a go.\u201d \nComputer Gaming World 4 out of 5\n \u201cSo next time you gun down coppers on GTA VI, just remember, Carmageddon\u2019s controversy was there first, and you have a lot to thank it for.\u201d RetroGarden\nBack in 1997 a small, independent game studio called Stainless delivered its first PC game to an unsuspecting world. Rich in humour, bathed in gibs, and relishing its instant reputation as the poster child for everything that\u2019s wrong with society (and therefore right in a videogame), the smash hit Carmageddon and its successors sold over two million copies worldwide. \nOf course the copyright and truck-loads of cash went to the EVIL publisher, but Stainless survives to this day, still independent, still kicking, and still releasing successful products. (Check out our other work and credentials at stainlessgames.com.)\nAfter years of negotiation, the original founders of Stainless recently bought back ALL the rights to Carmageddon. So now it\u2019s back in its rightful home, Stainless Games Inc., we\u2019ve embarked on the journey that will reboot the brand, and we want YOU to join us on that journey.\nCarmageddon featured real-world environments that had been turned into killing fields, where the locals stay out on the streets at their peril. As well as using your car as a weapon, every level was sprinkled generously with power-ups that had a vast variety of mad effects: gluing pedestrians to the ground or rendering them blind so they couldn't see you coming; turning your suspension to jelly or your car into solid granite; arming you with the awesome Pedestrian Electro-Bastard Ray or the Pedestrian Flame-thrower - and a whole lot more!\nCarmageddon boasted a bunch of stand-out innovations: true 3D physics; dynamic car damage and repair; a feature-rich action replay system; and big, free roaming environments. Most of all, you were free to do what YOU wanted to, when YOU wanted to do it, however SILLY it might seem to anybody else.\nWith a host of crazed opponents and a wide variety of loopy locations, the single player game was a blast. And things got even more fun with the multiplayer games and the opportunity to send your friends to a fiery death.\nCarmageddon: Reincarnation is a re-boot of everything that made the original games such a blast to play. The new game will be inspired by the classic environments, cars, drivers and power-ups from the original, but dragged screaming and kicking into the current state of the rendered art. And of course, there will be a bunch of brand new STUFF too, including true rag-doll pedestrians and physics-based power-ups that let you mess with their limbs whilst wiping away the tears - of laughter!\nMultiplayer was the hidden-treasure of Carmageddon back in the dark days of LAN parties, but will now be able to be enjoyed by almost all of our players, thanks to the entire planet going online since then. The single player game will be brilliant too, thanks to demented opponents with demented A.I. brains made from demented code written by demented programmers.\nAnother cutting-edge feature that our loyal fans loved about the original game was the Action Replay facility, and this is also going to be coming back - but with a modern twist: You'll be able to post your clips on YouTube and other such sites. And of course we will be embracing the Social Media revolution and linking up to your Facebooks and Twitters with in-game integration so you can disturb your parents without even leaving the game.\nThe Carmageddon community means the world to us, and over the years a dedicated army of Modders continued to develop content for the original games. We\u2019ll be making sure that the tools we use to craft the game are developed in such a way that we can release them as well, thus making player-generated content a central part of the Carmageddon: Reincarnation experience.\nThanks to in-house tech that\u2019s been in constant development at the studio for more than a decade, we've been able to get prototyping under way. It helps that of the 8 man team that worked on the original game, 5 of us are still with the company and raring to go! This means we've been able to tune the driving experience, test new power-ups, and start creating the initial game assets. \nBut there's so much more involved in making a full game... it takes a lot of time, and flock of talented and committed (in every sense...) people. This requires a stack of money, as try as me might, they seem to insist on salaries at the end of every month. EVERY single month! We've tried paying them in cake and small bags of chocolate, but they keep coming back for more.\nWe\u2019re a modest-sized indie developer (around 50 trapped souls), and we've already invested well over a third of a million dollars getting the rights back and beginning design and prototyping. This represents all of our profits from our other work - but we think it's worth it. We currently have a small team working on the project - but without some sort of dedicated funding, that can\u2019t continue indefinitely. We can't put this game into full production without a sizeable team dedicated to it. So we need a pile of CASH to get the game made. Or more chocolate and nicer cake. But CASH is more likely to work, to be perfectly honest.\nNow we have our baby back we really don\u2019t want to have any creative control of the new game wrestled from us by a corporate investor, a publisher, or space aliens trying to subvert humanity using subliminal messaging in video games. We want to make sure that the game we make is the game that we (and Carmageddon\u2019s fans, and a new generation of Carmageddon fans who don\u2019t even know they want it yet) want to play. \nWhat Do I Get For My Hard-Earned Dollars?\nWe've planned Carmageddon: Reincarnation as an iterative development project. This means that if we just make it to the $400k target, we'll be able to deliver Release #1 in February 2013. Kickstarter backers of $15 and above will receive Release #1 plus all subsequent releases.\nIf we exceed the $400k target, it'll allow us to include even more content in the first release. And if we smash the target, it'll also allow us to greatly expand the scope of the game, and to roll it out across more and more platforms, with Kickstarter backers getting to select their delivery platform of choice: consoles, tablets, phones, Macs, toasters, vibrating pillows, bananas... errrr..... \n.....anyway! The higher our budget, the more it accelerates the development of major game features and get them in the game sooner, and the greater the ultimate scope of the game's content and delivery platforms. Wahoo! We all win!   \nWe\u2019re not just doing this because we saw what happened with Double Fine Adventure, Wasteland 2, and the other oldies around here that are making great comebacks; we were already working on Carmageddon: Reincarnation as a skunkworks project. What happened is that these other projects opened our eyes to the fantastic opportunity that crowd-sourced funding represents. We have an opportunity to make Carmageddon the game it always wanted to be - and to do so with the help of our fans. How perfect is that?\nAnyway, other games don't let you glue a penguin to the ground and then fire it through a plate glass window with a giant spring. We do. We offer a unique service to humanity. Messy, but unique.\nKickstarter has now proved itself to be the perfect place to fund a project in The Modern Way. And so, with a realistic target budget to get the first release of the game out, and pledges made through Kickstarter, we have the opportunity to make the game that we want to make, and that our fans want us to make too.\nPlus we can also repay the dedication of the community at the same time, through the rewards system.\nWell, talking of rewards \u2013 we have a great bunch of those lined up for you guys. What\u2019s also GREAT about the Kickstarter funding model is being able to also offer a range of cool STUFF and even some THINGS to our backers, as a way of thanking them for their involvement in our shared goal. STUFF including early access to the project beta, plus a whole bunch of cool physical product THINGS, from t-shirts to stickers to posters and limited edition lovelies, right on up to actually being in the game as a pedestrian, billboard star or even a driver!\nYou can even come and get drunk with the team! (Hospital bills are NOT included.)\nYou'll notice that we aren't asking for Shipping costs to be met by our backers. That's because we're covering the cost of shipping, out of the goodness of our hearts. Aren't we lovely. BUT - if you'd like to add a little extra to your pledge to help us meet the commitment, then obviously we'd be very grateful, and we'll talk about you in a respectful way during our tea breaks. \nIf we reach our Kickstarter target of $400,000, we'll be able to deliver the first release of Carmageddon: Reincarnation by February 2013. Following that, our backers will get every update of the game as it's released, for FREE. You get it all for the minimum \u201cget the game\u201d pledge of $15. You get to download the first release via Steam, and your updates will occur automatically after that.  \nSo, in summary, this is an opportunity to be a key part of bringing back one of the pioneering titles in videogame history. Better than it was before; badder, shinier bloodier, sillier, and even more outrageous, with celebrity appearances by YOU and a bunch of other cool STUFF included because YOU made it possible. Plus MORE small WORDS in BOLD capitals. YES! And some LONGER ones too!\nWe're incredibly happy to be working on a project that's so close to our hearts, and we're thrilled that we've got the opportunity to do all the cool/stupid/fun stuff that we've discussed and planned over the years. We hope that you're excited at the prospect of being instrumental in bringing the next game in the Carmageddon series to life.  Thank you very much for looking, and thank you IMMENSELY for your pledge!

Additional funding will give me more time to obsess over making this perfect and add more and better features. Thanks to my backers for funding me $20k -- now I'm working on this for a full year!\nI wrote git-annex to make git usable with large files. And for archivists, scientists, and regular geeky folks with many photos, music, and videos, a git that can handle big files is perfect. Now I'm going to make it easy to use too.\nYou'll be able to drop large files into a folder and have them automatically checked into git, and synced out to your personal cloud of other computers, sevices like Amazon S3 and rsync.net, and removable hard drives. \nBuilding git-annex was the hard part. I holed up in a cabin, learned Haskell, and coded for a year, blazing new trails. It's done, and it works.It's been reviewed by publications like Linux Weekly News (http://lwn.net/Articles/419241/). Now I need your help to fund three months more work that will turn it from a geek power tool into an app everyone can use.\nThe first step will be to make git-annex watch for changes to your files, check them into git, and automatically sync them to your other repositories. I have a prototype of this using Linux's inotify. It will be extended to also support Mac OS X.\nThen I will build a web app that can be used to control and configure things. Watch files as they upload and download, set priorities, etc. No command line needed. I plan to use Haskell's amazing Yesod web framework.\nFinally, I will add configuration assistants to help you get the most out of the system. Easily set up syncing to remote computers, store encrypted copies of your data in Amazon S3 or other cloud services, automate moving  old files to archival drives. There are many possibilities like these, and I will prioritize the ones my backers need.\nI'll spend around one month on each of these steps. Then I'll spend another month or two on an Android port, and additional time I'm funded for to add more features. At the end of the year, I'll spend a month porting it to Windows, too. I'll be blogging about my progress all along the way, and each new feature will immediately be available in git-annex's own git repository. \nProject wiki, roadmap, and design: http://git-annex.branchable.com/design/assistant/\nDevelopment blog: http://git-annex.branchable.com/design/assistant/blog\nNow that my work is funded for a full year, I'm setting aside any further funding received, and using it to pay for things that will make the git-annex assistant even better:\nGet a professional web designer to polish the web app, so it looks and feels great!\nAccess to a wider variety of Android gadgets to ensure that port works well.\nNecessary Windows license (seems I don't have one anymore!)\nUsability testing.\nArtwork.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "the end of the kickstarter campaign, and the start of something new", "update_content": "My year funded by this Kickstarter to work on git-annex is over.

By integrating our embdSocial WISPs into your electronic designs, you open up a world of social media, essential web-services, and real-time global accessibility.\nVisit us: http://www.embdsocial.net/\nWhat is a WISP?\nThe embdSocial WISP is an amazing little device that will literally change the way you work with, and talk to, your electronics. Each WISP has an industry-standard 802.11 wifi interface allowing for easy integration with your existing wireless network. If you've setup a router you can setup a WISP. It's as simple as connecting to a wireless network, opening a webpage, and answering a few questions. Once online, future configuration is done through your account on the embdSocial website.\nWhat can I do with my WISP?\nYour WISP will allow your embedded project to do anything you can imagine! We provide a lot of functionality right out of the box:\nTweeting/receiving @messages\nUpdating Facebook statuses\nSending/receiving emails\nSending/receiving SMS text messages\nManipulating files in your Dropbox\nThe key here is simplicity! We take all of the complicated configuration, and authentication processes for popular web services and consolidate them into our web site. Once configured, common tasks (such as tweeting, sending an e-mail, saving a file to dropbox) are performed using our simple embedded API.\nNeed to send data to your WISP? Don't worry about setting up firewall rules or dynamic DNS...your WISP connects automatically to our servers. All you need to do is send an HTTP request to our publicly accessible XML API and your message will be automatically routed to your WISP (and your embedded device).\nStill need some ideas? Check out these actual \"weekend\" projects from the embdSocial team (using real WISPs):\nSee the details: http://www.embdsocial.net/projects/coffee-maker\nSee the details: http://www.embdsocial.net/projects/garage\nSee the details: http://www.embdsocial.net/projects/turret\nArduino Integration\nBringing internet capabilities to your Arduino has never been easier or more affordable. Your WISP coupled with an Arduino using an Arduino shield adapter ($89 donation level) yields a tightly integrated package that allows you to bring the internet to any embedded project. Tired of breaking out that huge USB cable every time you want to program your Arduino? If your WISP is online simply upload your compiled sketch and your WISP will take care of the rest...that's right, over-the-air updates for your Arduino project!\nA collaborative community\nIn addition to our \"core\" plugins, we are working to provide the ability for you to create your own custom plug-ins. Your custom plug-ins can then be submitted to an open community repository where others can use them in their own projects. Popular plug-ins will be refined, standardized and integrated into future versions of our API for all to use.\nWhy we need YOUR help\nWe have everything we need to go to production and start making your WISPs right now:\nTechnical design package (schematics, layouts, BOMs)\nQuotes from numerous fabrication/assembly houses\nPackaging + shipping material\n...but in order make your WISP affordable, we need to order parts in bulk and pay upfront costs for electronics assembly. Even though we're technically a company, we're really just a few guys who care a lot about this project...we have the time and the dedication...but we don't have the finances to start production. We need your financial support to jump this fabrication hurdle and start delivering your WISPs.\nWhen will I get my WISP?\nAs soon as we have enough backers to pay for our production costs, we are going to pick our fabrication house and give them the green light. Since we already have working prototypes, you can expect your WISP and Arduino shield adapter this July!\nSo who are you guys?\nembdSocial is a close group of college friends who have since made their way into industry. We are comprised of Embedded Systems Engineers, Electrical Engineers, professional Web Programmers and one PhD Candidate. Projects like embdSocial and the WISP are what we do on a day-to-day basis, only in various other industries.

Your school is overrun by the undead, and it's up to you and your friends to do whatever it takes to survive!  \nOriginal Zombie Playground illustration by Jason Chan\nZombie Playground is an online, team based, action arena game with RPG elements.  Gameplay will be deep, challenging, and rewarding.  The game combines childhood nostalgia with horrific monsters, visceral combat, and a unique atmosphere straight out of a child\u2019s nightmares.  We do want to make it very clear: this is not a game for kids!\nThe initial release is planned for PC/Mac, but we\u2019d certainly like to support Linux and hand-helds if there is enough demand and support.\nInitial Concept Art - look and feel exploration.\nThe mood we want to capture Zombie Playground is the feeling that you had as a child when you were completely immersed in your imagination fighting monsters, shooting guns, and doing things that you thought were cool from your favorite movies, comics, and video games.  For Zombie Playground, the setting is inspired from popular Zombie franchises and will take place in the local middle school.  We aim to deliver all of the horror and tension associated with zombie titles, but spiced up with some good old childhood nostalgia.  It can be easily explained in the following formula:\nGoonies + Attack the Block + Walking Dead = Zombie Playground\nEarly Concept Art \u2013 combat and gore exploration.\nGameplay in Zombie Playground will be a hybrid of third person shooter and action RPG mechanics set in a cooperative zombie survival horror arena.  This is not a mindless hack and slash!  Players will have their teamwork abilities, battle tactics, and survival skills put to the test as they fight to survive against hordes of the undead.  As players progress, their characters will level up, allowing players to unlock invaluable new abilities to help them take on increasingly dangerous challenges.  Acquiring new weapons, items, and articles of clothing will allow players to further customize their characters for even more variety and tactical versatility or specialization.\nCharacter Concept Art\nYou will be able to select from a number of characters with a wide range of weapons, abilities, and personalities. From brutal close range fighters to agile gunslingers, we want to make sure to ultimately give you a large variety of characters to keep gameplay fresh and cater to different play styles.  Acquiring new abilities and finding new weapons and equipment will help you tailor your character to better fit your play style or to better fill the needs of your party.  As long as the game is successful, we plan to continue to offer new weapons, items, equipment, and even characters long after the release of the game for maximum replay value.\nWe have been doing our best to make and fund this game ourselves so that we can stay true to our vision, but working full time on other projects to pay the bills really cuts down on what we are able to achieve on a timely basis.  We have been actively seeking out outside funding, but that is hard to secure without strings attached.  Keeping true to our vision and raising money are difficult things to accomplish in tandem, but with Kickstarter, we hope that we can solve that problem and deliver the TRUE Zombie Playground experience.\nIt needs to be said that every penny donated to this project past the $100k goal also goes into making Zombie Playground bigger and better.  We would love to take you beyond the walls of the zombie infested school and out to other locations in the city.  We want to introduce you to crazy new characters and arm you with all kinds of zombie-slaying weaponry.  Realistically, we would need millions of dollars to fully realize Zombie Playground in all of the glory that it could be.  There is so much potential for content, the material we have to work with is literally endless.  So, what can we possibly offer at $100k when the complete game vision would take a few million?  Here is our wishlist:\nPC and Mac support\nAlpha version of the game with 2 Player Cooperative Online Play\n4 Player Cooperative Online Play  \n2 Playable Characters: one melee and one ranged combat\nA variety of weapons for each character\nA variety of clothing customization options for each character\nVarious consumable items to help in combat\nCharacter specific abilities\nCharacter leveling system\nA variety of enemy types\nClassroom Building Arena (Enclosed building with hallways, classrooms, storage rooms, bathrooms, etc) \nAdditional Player Characters with different weapon and ability sets\nThe Gym and related areas will be added to the Classrooms environment\nAdditional enemy types will be added\nMore loot and goodies\nLinux support! \nEven more Playable Characters!\n2v2 competitive online play will be implemented.\nMore loot!\nAn in-game Player store will be available, offering items (clothes and consumables) for purchase with gained experience points or actual money.\nThe game will adopt a Free to Play model.\nNow we\u2019re getting somewhere!\nLoads of Playable Characters!!\n4v4 competitive online play!\nClassrooms environment expanded and finalized for competitive play!\nThe Playground level will be implemented in alpha phase!\nCustomizable Player Clubhouse/Treehouse lobby!\nThis is ZOMBIE PLAYGROUND!\nComplete vision of the Zombie Playground school world.\nTons of characters and classes to choose from.\nThe complete School level available to traverse:  Classrooms, Gym, Playground, Cafeteria, Library, Administration Offices, Computer Labs, Nurse's Office, Principal's Office, Music Rooms, and of course, the Basement/Boiler Room.  \nIn-Game Lobby system\nTons more weapons, clothing, enemies, consumables.\nLadder Ranking System.\nUltra Rare loot drops, and rare spawns.\nNew Games Modes, and much more!\nBEYOND $2 Million...\nIf by some miracle we hit and surpass $2 million, be prepared to spend a lot of time in Zombie Playground!  Further funding through Kickstarter or other means will allow us to continue to expand the game world beyond the boundaries of the school where we can take on new monsters in new locations, explore new game mechanics, and enjoy even more of what the world of Zombie Playground has to offer!\n\nWe invite you to join the Zombie Playground community!  We are very passionate about this game and want to make it the best that it can be.  We will try to keep you updated on the games progress as best we can and encourage discussion on our forums on what you would love to see in the game.  Who knows, maybe we\u2019ll put it in!\nwww.zombieplaygroundgame.com\n\nJason Chan - Massive Black Senior Artist - is leading the Art Direction.

Get better quality images here.\nLimb.al Compatibility\nThe limb.al is compatible with any modern smartphone.  With both Apple and Micro-USB connectors, the limb.al works with any iPhone, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone or Nokia.  No matter if your phone's port is on the top, left or bottom, the limb.al is flexible enough to put it right where you want it.\nFAQs\nQ: For the $40 and $55 pledges, can I choose both Android and iPhone Limbals? A: Yes, for pledges $25 and greater, you can choose either iPhone or Android Limb.als, or a mix of the two.\nQ: I'm confused, am I supposed to keep my phone ON the whole day? A: Why the hell not?!  Phones are running down their battery 24/7 anyway, so get some use out of them as a chat window, or a live rss feed, or a picture frame.  The point is your phone should have to work for its $100/mo carrier bill.\nQ: My phone's port isn't on the bottom, will the limb.al still be useful? A: Of course, while the hardware you own, like monitors and laptops, will determine USB port availability, any phone can still be used on the desktop with the limb.al as a kickstand.\nQ: Will my phone fall if held from a top-side Micro USB port over a long time? A: nope, Micro-USB ports require 8 Newtons of removal force minimum, which is more than any phone can be pulled by gravity.\nQ: Will the Limb.al damage the ports on my phone? A:  With thoughtful care your phone will be fine.  iPhones have more support, so those with Micro-USB ports should take care to not stress the connectors.  You will get a feel for what positions don't work well with your phone after use.  Unfortunately, there is no way for me to cover the liability of damaged devices, so use at your own risk.\nQ: What's all this about Apple displays and rear USB ports?  A: The Limb.al works very well with most rear USB ports on monitors, especially Dells.  However, most rear USB ports on Apple monitors are pointed inconveniently and make using an iPhone with them kind of... not fun.  Anyways! you can still use the limb.al for a desktop charging kickstand, or with your Macbook, or in your car.\nQ: Will the limb.al work with my case? A: Of course! It's no more than a stiff charging cable so plug it in like you would anyhow and enjoy.  If you use an iPhone battery case that has a Micro-USB port, then make sure to buy the Micro-USB limb.al.\nIf you have a question you don't see here, email me  Bill@Limb.al or visit the website, Limb.al\nProcess and Manufacture\nThe Limb.al currently has a manufacturing partner that has been working with prototypes to make sure the final product is both durable and consistent, even for smaller runs.  Having extensively prototyped here in Brooklyn, all that remains is for the initial tooling of the plastic molds and then typically two periods of sample review from the factory.\nHaving dealt extensively with manufacturing partners in my daily work, I am currently projecting an early September ship date for the limb.als.  While others may be more aggressive with their scheduling I know the necessary back and forth that has to happen with the factory in order to deliver a truly quality product.\nThe current funding price is a sort of minimum order quantity for both the manufacturer and myself, who have spent the past 5 months building, tweaking, revising, improving and finally demonstrating the limb.al to the market.  About half the $11,000 is covering the fixed costs of business, including prototyping, tooling, and samples.  The other half is covering the variable costs of design and engineering over the past 5 months, including legal fees for patents and trademarks.\nFor more information about my own design practice and experience, please visit my portfolios here and here.

In addition, the two thousand extension cords and car chargers included in your rewards have already arrived and are waiting to be shipped with the limb.als."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Is So Close You Can Taste It", "update_content": "Production has finished the final production samples have exceeded our expectations! Below are some in-process shots taken during December showing the production line.\n\nWe have finalized the contract with the freight forwarder and the items will be picked up from the factory floor on January 4th. There was an unexpected two week delay stemming from carton packaging at the factory floor, intermediating the factory with freight forwarder and the Holiday season in general. In addition, because the Limb.al will be a new product coming through the port, it will likely get held up in customs for up to two weeks. We adjusted plans to minimize holdups and are using an agent who has more experience navigating customs, but there may still be delays."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Freight and Fulfillment", "update_content": "Thanksgiving has passed and it is time for another update!\nFull Production\nThere was a slight delay from nailing down packaging specifics in early November, we are currently running the full production order right now with the order ready to ship Dec 22nd.

You can see below the revised coloring on the white goosenecks now match the plastic body much more closely.\nIn addition the stiffness on the goosenecks has been much improved through some engineering efforts between us and the maker. Right now we are ready to move into production, but in order to sufficiently satisfy the demand for both black and white colored limb.als I will be releasing surveys to a single tier of pledgers."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 1136, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1782458858/the-limbal", "project_name": "The Limb.al"}}]
