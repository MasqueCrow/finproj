Hilfinger with music by Joan McMillen\nDirected by Tracy Ward\nWorld Premiere Produced by BootStrap Theater Foundation\nOctober 23 - November 15, 2015              Z Below, San Francisco, CA\nThe powerful and true story of the first climate change refugees in the United States and San Francisco lawyer Luke Cole comes to the stage in this riveting drama from award-winning team Sharmon Hilfinger and Joan McMillen. \nKivalina, Alaska is an Inupiat Eskimo village still practicing the tradition of subsistence living. Today, that tradition and the village itself are threatened by pollution, rising seas and storms due to climate change. Ignored by their own tribal corporation and betrayed by the EPA, the villagers turn to environmental justice lawyer Luke Cole. Deep and unlikely friendships evolve between Luke and the Inupiats as they stand together against greed, corruption, prejudice and pollution in an arctic environment whose transformation may be irreversible. \nHilfinger and McMillen bring their trademark mix of narrative and music to the production. Building on the success of their last two dramatizations of the lives of Georgia O'Keeffe (\"Hanging Georgia roils and twists across the stage like a Texas Lightning storm,\" San Jose Mercury News) and Emily Dickinson (\"surprising theatrical bliss,\" Palo Alto Weekly) the playwright and composer apply the tools they've honed for dramatic biography to the most urgent story of our time: the fight against climate change. Acclaimed director Tracy Ward (The Shaker Chair, Hunter Gatherers) heads up the team of Bay Area notables. The all-Equity cast includes Damon K Sperber, Michael Torres, Lynne Soffer, Cathleen Riddley, Lawrence Radecker, and Gendell Hing-Hernandez. Choreography by Christy Funsch, Musical Direction by Alva Henderson, and Dramaturgy by Brian Thorstenson.   Our top-notch designers are: Giulio Perrone, set; Jim Cave, lighting; Callie Floor and Megan LaFleur, costumes; Devon LaBelle, props.\nWe have recruited some of the most respected theater makers in the Bay Area.Your donations will go directly toward the salaries of our artists.  The play is written, but to come to life it needs actors' hearts and minds, designers' eyes and ears, and a director's guiding hand. For us, nothing is more demanding, nor more rewarding than this collaborative work. In a time when funding for the arts has been drastically cut, whatever level you can pledge toward the care and feeding of our creative team will be most appreciated.\nDonations are tax deductible.

We plan to solve this issue here on Kickstarter and allow all gamers in the world a chance to own an amazing and affordable three dimensional dungeon. Thanks to the expertise of Maki Games with plastic kits, the realistic designs of Manorhouse Workshop will be produced in high quality hard plastic at an affordable price.\n Modular Underground Project is a brand new hard plastic terrain to create three dimensional dungeons for 25-32mm games. Players will be able to quickly create a dungeon for their RPG sessions. It also works perfectly for wargamers seeking battle in different settings, since it can be assembled into a traditional dungeon, an intricate set of sewers channels or a combination of both.\nMiniatures shown for scale purpuse only!\nMiniatures shown for scale purpuse only!\nMiniatures shown for scale purpuse only!\nModular Underground Project is much more than a simple three dimensional dungeon.

For example if a stretch goal gives 2x FREE Dungeon floor the following parts will be added:\n1 OBLIVION STARTER SET: -\n2 OBLIVION STARTER SET: 4x FREE Dungeon floors\n3 OBLIVION STARTER SET: 6x FREE Dungeon floors\n5 OBLIVION STARTER SET: 10x FREE Dungeon floors\n10 OBLIVION STARTER SET: 20x FREE Dungeon floors\nUnpainted pledge levels will receive unpainted freebies while painted pledge levels will receive painted freebies!\n Maki Games has already fulfilled one Kickstarter project and has learned where are the obstacles in the whole chain from design to production and distribution. According to our plans an estimated delivery within 12-13 months after the end of the Kickstarter campaign is an achievable goal.\nThanks to our previous Kickstarter project we have already shipped hundreds of rewards to our backers and have a realistic estimate of the shipping costs to deliver the rewards.\nCUSTOM FEES:\n\nWe will cover the shipping costs to our warehouses and all customs fees for EU, US and Australia.\nBelow you can find a table of rough estimates for shipping the different pledge levels. NOTE: these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nShipping Costs Estimates\nBe aware that all rewards that are confirmed after we officially close the pledge manager will be shipped from the EU warehouse at a later date.\nWe are a small company that was created thanks to the support of our backers. Our strength lies in the quality of our products that is comparable to those of the biggest companies in the market. However to speed up our growth we need to increase our customer base rapidly and Kickstarter is the best tool to achieve this goal. Below are three good reasons for you to support our project:\n1) You will help us to bring the product to market faster!\nWe need your help to pay for the expensive steel molds necessary to create this finely detailed kit in hard plastic. Without Kickstarter it would take several mcuh longer to launch our first product.\n2) You will get new items and freebies!\nA successful Kickstarter will allow us to speed up the production and eventually unlock new items for our terrain. In addition you will get a lot of free items by unlocking our stretch goals, expanding your dungeon and saving money.\n3) You will get the product before everyone else!\nBacking this project you can be the ambassador of our new line of products!

We are prepared to face the issues and to minimize the delays.\n\nThe real challenge is to develop the product in the shortest time possible and to stay within the estimated delivery time.\n\nWe already have the CAD files of all the parts in the main box, but we might unlock new parts if we reach our stretch goals. If many parts are unlocked it might take longer than 1 month to complete the CAD files of additional parts.\n\nWe have already created the first mold to confirm the quality of the details is good enough and that all the parts fit perfectly. \nThis means the optimization process of the mold (the most time consuming task) has already started. \n\nThe Estimated Delivery Date is June 2016 but note that this is an only estimate. Note that this is the Estimated Delivery Date for most of the backers but some backers might receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nRefund Policy:\nWe expect to refund pledges if our Modular Underground Project can't be delivered for an unforeseen reason. However we don't think this is a likely scenario given our past experience.\n\nTERMS & CONDITIONS:\nOur terrain has not been produced yet and for this reason by pledging to this Kickstarter you acknowledge that the final design, material and content of the rewards might be subject to change.\nAlthough it is very unlikely, the final product may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active. \n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system.

So began the world of \"The Legacy of Jiraiya\".\nI focused on a small story at first, but as I considered newer characters and different agenda's, my world began to grow. I began incorporating in more than just the fantasy world I was inspired by in \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Wheel of Time\" series. I began to bring on my studies in Norse Mythology, Greek Mythology, Roman Mythology, Celtic Mythology, Egyptian Mythology and even some religious inspirations from Christianity. \nI have a story to tell. Some of you may think it's clever, others may think it's involved, and a few of you may even see the deep-seeded emotions; but to me the most important thing is that you are surprised. If I can surprise you all, even if it's just once, that would be enough for me.\nThis particular kickstarter is for the Soft-cover exclusively! I'm not looking to over-complicate things on my first go. I want to make sure that you the investors know exactly what it is you are kickstarting. It's the first book in a series. It will be roughly 150 pages long, double sided. I've already written the second book, so if this does well there will be a sequel kickstarted hopefully next year!\nWe live in a world full of bright people with creativity and imagination! Well this is great for us as consumers, it makes those of us who are creating new material have to jump through hoops to find a way to get our ideas seen. I hope that this kickstarter will give me an opportunity to finally get my work out there for the world to see!\nI would like to supply you all with a small blurb from my book. So I am supplying you with the prologue to give you a feel of my writing style;\n                                                    Prologue\nA man stands, alone; four others stand across from him. The room is large, and built with white marble; the columns stand side by side like brothers, each reinforcing the others. A bright light, the brightest of light, shines through the openings, splashing across the man\u2019s face. He\u2019s much younger than the others in the room. He\u2019s tall, and well built. He has long, crisp brown hair. It falls just past his shoulders. He\u2019s wearing a strong, but light armor. A sword is down his right side, and a dagger on his left. He wears a shield on his back. A family crest is upon it, the same as that upon each of the shields of the four men before him. Their shields lain upon the table in front of them, on top of their swords. One of them is much older than the others, he steps forward to speak. \n \u201cThe king is dead! We, his sworn protectors, shall avenge this injustice. If we can no longer protect the king, we will protect his ideologies, practices and all that he stood for. Caedmon, my brother; you are the youngest of we five, and full of all the potential in the world. We know little of the impending danger to this world; its plan is far from revealed to us yet. That will not deter us though. We will stand strong, and find a way no matter the trials, to stop this war, and protect this world. You will go to Jiraiya, he was entrusted with a power that shall not be ignored. His land will fall first, of this I am sure. You will go there now, and you will wait.\u201d \n Caedmon was shocked by this startling news. \u201cFor how long brother?\u201d His brother looked down on Caedmon, who stood as exposed as a baby fawn separated from its mother. \u201cThis task will not take shape overnight, or even in the years to come. This is a plan that will take generations. Our enemy will not be hasty, so neither can we. We must be calm, and fully commit to this path. We will have to make the oath.\u201d One of the other brothers turned to them, focused on the task at hand. \u201cThe Oath! Brother that is something we cannot undo!\u201d The older brother let each word sink in. \u201cI know, but do it we must. To protect this world, we must offer ourselves to it. It is our only choice, the only way to truly protect our fallen king. He will be avenged, of this I am sure.\u201d They all nodded, and then took up their swords. They began to chant aloud, and suddenly men in white cloaks entered the room. They held large staffs, and green smoke billowed from them. They slowly circled the brothers, and the smoke filled their lungs. They chanted louder as one \u201cWe five brothers offer ourselves, in service and in gratitude, for all of eternity, to the cause of our king! Our path was his path, and shall remain the same until his path is clear of all obstacles!\u201d They repeated this over and over again. Then they slowly began to raise their swords. Finally they turned them, and each impaled themselves right through the stomach. \nThey fell to their knees, unable to breathe. And then each hit the ground, their exhales forced through their lungs as they struck the marble floor hard. The cloaked men finished circling the table, and made their way out of the room. The day passed, and the light began to fade as the sun began to set. As the last ray of light left the room, the five brother\u2019s bodies glowed a bright green. The green smoke residing in their bodies reacted, and headed straight to their swords. Suddenly Caedmon sat up in a rush, and inhaled like it was the first time he had ever felt the breathe of life on his lips. The others followed, and they each began to stand. They one by one pulled out their swords, no wounds left behind to treat, no blood to clean. Then they each laid their swords upon the table once more as Caedmon held his to his chest. \nThe eldest brother looked  on Caedmon, before speaking. \u201cMy brother, our commitment to the cause has been sealed. We shall walk this world for as many years are needed, until we have stopped this evil! Our bodies will not age nor wither; our wounds will not bleed or falter us. We will not be beaten so easily. We will use this time to train, and prepare. But you, you must set out on your journey. You will fight the first major battle, and when it ends, you will make the first stand for or against our cause. We cannot hope that we five alone will be enough to win. You will have to find heroes, warriors, armies, and scholars if you are to prepare and win this impending battle for the future of our world. I dismiss you, and will see you at the end. You have our love and respect brother. Good luck.\u201d Caedmon nodded in understanding, how highly his brother spoke sometimes was of no surprise. He had been the one entrusted with the knowledge of ceremonies and oaths. Caedmon had no intention of ever questioning him though, this was his task.

Join a faction, capture castles, and fight for supremacy on the premier battleground of the universe.\nYour world, Your rules\nAs Voxelnauts spread across the universe from Oasis, they craft new planets to be explored and conquered.\nOnce you've terraformed a new planet, it\u2019s up to you to determine the style of gameplay, as well as the items and creatures that inhabit it. You can purchase items, creatures, and even the design of the planet itself from other users at the Galaxy Bazaar, or sell your own. Other players can travel to your planet and experience it in real-time VR. Don\u2019t worry--you can decide whether other players can alter your creations to protect your hard work.\nMaking your visions a reality: Voxels and You!\nYou can design your own furniture, items, and even yourself using the building block of the universe, the High-Definition Voxel. Gather raw materials and use them to alter your appearance and that of everything around you. The Voxelnauts suit is infinitely modifiable, so your armor, clothes, and weapons can all reflect your unique style. The quality of the HD Voxels allows for high-fidelity luxury designs of everything around.\nVoxels are building blocks that allow anyone to \u201cdoodle\u201d 3D modelling, the modern advancement from 2D pixel sprites. They\u2019re easy to use, but provide gorgeous payoff. You can even directly alter 2D pixel art into 3D Voxels to use in the universe using our tools, or integrate your preferred tools like Blender, MagicaVoxel, and more.\nWe know that building a world from scratch can be a daunting task, which is why we are open sourcing Oasis for free to everyone. With a great starting code base we hope developers and modders alike will create amazing experiences for everyone to enjoy.\nHyperion PVP Planet - Stretch Goal\n400k - Fueled by his love of carnage, an Ancient Berserker forged Hyperion for the ultimate Voxelnaut-vs-Voxelnaut experience.

We are nerds.\nJambon with the Team\n*does not include travel/expenses.\n Concept Artwork\n Soundtrack Samples\n The Team\nWe are a core team of nine developers with years of experience in gaming, who have worked on projects such as Starbound, Oculus VR, Firefall, and Guitar Hero. Fusing the knowledge of the virtual property experts we have on board and 50 years of combined experience in gaming, our team is built of talented, dedicated people with the desire to bring a new era into the video game world.\nComing from the background of living and loving games, we set out to make what other sandbox games should have been. We are demolishing every boundary and making a game that transcends genre. Whether your taste is for collecting, combat, or creation, Voxelnauts will satisfy it. But we need your help.\nKickstarter Funding\nVoxelnauts was initially funded by $1M in capital from angel investors.  Most of the primary platform is complete; all screenshots and game footage were recorded live in-game, we have a functional multiplayer server and we are already using our own in-house tools to build content for the metaverse.  A number of team members are currently unpaid and we would like to be able to be able to compensate them for their contributions.  Our Kickstarter goal of $200,000 will be entirely allocated to pay developers and bring interns onto the team.  We are entering the final stretch to launching the Voxelnauts alpha and with your support we can make it happen!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs most of you probably know, game development is never a guaranteed process. There is always some sort of risk involved in this type of project. In fact, statistically only 37% of successfully funded projects deliver a finished product to backers. There is no 100% guarantee that we will be in that 37%. However, we are an experienced team and have shipped many games across many different platforms and collectively have decades of game development (including MMO development) experience. \n\nWe are building a metaverse - which hasn\u2019t been done before at this level. About half our team has made MMOs before, and so we have a good understanding of what to do and we are confident we can succeed. We have a solid plan for how a metaverse can work, however there are always technical hurdles that can get in the way and delay the development process. We are confident that any problems that crop up can be solved with the expertise of our team.\n\nWe have had strong financial backing from dedicated investors throughout the development process, which mitigates the chances that we will run out of money before completing our project, even if unexpected obstacles arise. Moreover, because this is a MMO, if time constraints necessitate removal of some features from the game in order to meet our release date and stay on budget, we would likely be able to include these in a future release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Retro Ronin\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nFounded by industry veterans from Starbound, Oculus VR, Naughty Dog, Id Software, Neversoft, and Red 5 Studios - RetroRonin is a games...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #18", "update_userinfo": "Voxelnauts Demo Update + Salamandria Swag!", "update_content": "Hello Voxelnauts!\nIt\u2019s been awhile, hasn\u2019t it? \nWe\u2019ve been super hard at work one the demo, new website, and store. \nSooo, on to the updates! \nWe just launched a our new website, with tons of new information, pictures, and screenshots from the Graveyard.

Countries stockpiling global thermonuclear warheads have entrusted the nukes to supercomputers. Two such computers, DEEP RED and BLU9000, have both had their launch sequences input. Fearing mutually assured destruction, the computers race to hack one another so they can launch unimpeded and destroy their enemy.\nRESISTOR_ is a fast and intense two-player competitive card game that relies on hidden information and tactical decision-making. Through the manipulation of double-sided cards on the table and in your hand, you create a connected line of your color that goes across the board into your enemy's base to score a point, increasing their DEFCON level. Score four times to push the enemy past DEFCON 4 to successfully launch your nukes without a counterstrike.\nEach turn, you have three different actions to change the state of the board. You must take all three before you can score a point. This means even if you have a connected line at the beginning of your turn, you must figure out how to keep it while still performing the actions.\nBut even when it's not your turn, you must pay attention. When your opponent performs their actions, you will learn more about the cards in play, which is information that can be used when your turn comes around again.\nOn top of that, there is the Resistor card, which can be used to chaotically change the entire face of the board, or to strategically heal yourself while undermining your opponent's plans. Beware, though, because whenever Resistors come into play, the board is going to shrink, speeding up the scoring and intensifying the gameplay.\nWant to watch us play the game?

The heavy duty cleated zip tie system installs quickly to get you and your passengers out of harm\u2019s way. Traditional tire chains are cumbersome to carry and difficult to install.. ZipGripGo is an excellent alternative that is easily stowed under a seat or in the trunk.\nZipGripGo Alternative Traction Aid\nA limited first run and extensive testing has proven the effectiveness of ZipGripGo and Popular Mechanics gave it their Editor\u2019s Choice Award for best new car technology.  With a full patent now secured the team manufactured a small run of version 2, which is now ready through this campaign! \nZipGripGo really is as easy as 1-2-3\nPLAY\n\n FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\nHow durable is  Zip Grip Go?\nIn one word - VERY! After 3 years of extensive research and development, we were able to produce a specially engineered grade material that performs beyond our expectations in both warm and cold climates. We know that actions can speak louder than words, so see just how durable they are here in our research and development video.\n How long does it take to install Zip Grip Go? \nThanks to its unique patented design, Zip Grip Go is not only durable, but light enough to be easily handled by anyone. It takes less than 5 minutes to install, and can easily be installed even after you get stuck, making our product the most unique on the market!\nCan Zip Grip Go be used in forward or reverse direction?\nAbsolutely! We understand that either forward or reverse could be required, so we engineered a product to tackle both situations. It is our special double tiered design that allows for both forward and backward mobility. \nHow many Zip Grip Go's should you install per tire?\nThere is no exact number to install, but we have you covered! It truly depends on your rims and your situation. Some rims accept 5 and others 6. We supply 12 per pack to play it safe! \nWhat size tires will Zip Grip Go\u2019s fit on?\nZip Grip Go was designed to fit on most cars, SUV\u2019s and trucks. The adjustable feature on Zip Grip Go will fit on rims up to 22\u201d. \nAre they reusable? \nOur goal was to develop a product that can easily allow you to use your own vehicles power to get you unstuck and back on your way. This not only avoids the need for costly towing service, but it gets you and your passengers out of harm's way without having to wait for help in a dangerous spot. We tested the product for years and found that after getting unstuck, our test market preferred a quicker method of removal for safety reason versus re usability and for that reason they recommended for a onetime use. That said we continue to appreciate feedback and we hope for great things in future products! \nCan I purchase these outside the United States? \nOur current KickStarter campaign focuses on the United States, but we will be launching to other areas of the world soon. In the meantime please contact us at kickstarter@zipgripgo.com so we can see how we might be able to help.

A fast, fun game of bluffing, deduction, and cute cat pictures!\nUncertainty didn\u2019t kill the cat, but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not dead. Dr. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger and Werner Heisenberg taught us that. We\u2019ve all heard about the cats in boxes experiment and maybe we're even curious about the results -- but attempting such an experiment would be INSANE in real life! Now you can try your hand at challenging the uncertainty principle without risking the lives of innocent kittens or exposure to radioactive particles! Awww!\nIn Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats players run experiments, form hypotheses, and try to one-up each other\u2019s research. Players take on the role of a Cat Physicist such as Albert Felinestein, Sally Prride, or Neil deGrasse Tabby! Using their special ability to help prove their hypothesis, or at least debunk someone else\u2019s, each cat physicist tries to determine the minimum number of alive cats, dead cats, or empty boxes across all the boxes in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s lab.\nYou may not be certain your hypothesis is valid, but if you love cats, science, and games you will be certain to love the Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats card game!\nCats are a curious lot, Cat Physicists doubly so. Their desire to discover the secrets of the universe overwhelms their shaky catnip-influenced ethics. While Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger is away the cat physicists will play\u2026 in his lab\u2026 with their colleagues.\nCheck out the video play-through below for a detailed description of game play or read the full overview below (including the current rules link and a low-res print and play version you can play right now).\nGame Play Overview\nFor the complete Game Rules < RULES LINK > For a playable low-res, b&w Print and Play < PNP LINK >\nEach Cat Physicist (i.e.Player) is dealt a hand of cards equal to the number of players (i.e.Cat Physicists). Each card in your hand represents a box in Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Experiment. In a game with 6 players, each player is dealt 6 cards, making 36 boxes in the experiment. \nPlayers are each dealt a Cat Physicist character card that they keep secret. It allows them to influence a variable in their experiment which can help to prove their hypothesis. The Cat Physicist cards add an additional layer of strategy, as only you know your special ability and it can only be used once per game.\nOn your turn, you present a hypothesis to the group by stating how many alive cats, dead cats, or empty boxes there are in the lab. If you feel that showing your findings will convince the group of the validity of your hypothesis, you may place any number of cards of the type bid face up for all to see. Meaning that you could show alive cats from your hand if your bid was alive cats, but not if your bid was dead cats or empty boxes. After you present your findings you may exchange the same number of cards as you revealed for new cards from the research deck which will (hopefully) help prove your hypothesis. \nWhen a questionable hypothesis is made the next player may choose to call the theory unfounded. In that case all players reveal their hands and a count is done to discover the truth. If a bid of 17 alive cats was made and there are at least 17 alive cats (including wild cards) then the hypothesis is deemed valid and that player is able to stay in the game. The player that called the hypothesis unfounded is now out of the game. If there were not at least 17 alive cats (including wild cards) then the player that made the 17 alive cat hypothesis would be out and the other player would stay. \nThe next round now has 1 fewer player and 1 fewer card is dealt to each player (now there are 5 players and only 25 cards/boxes). Play continues until only one Cat Physicist is left. Their research, emerging unblemished from the peer review process, is beyond refute and they are declared victorious! \nSchr\u00f6dinger's Cats also has a suggested 2 to 3 player variant in which no player is eliminated at the end of an experiment or round. Instead, the players face off until a certain number of wins or losses are reached determining the ultimate Cat Physicist!\nAs fans of James Stowe\u2019s Sidekick Quests, the Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats team was super excited about the chance to work with him. James was really excited to draw pictures of cats in lab coats, and the results are amazing!  One of our primary stretch goals will be adding additional art for the Cat Physicists cards, and James might be more excited to draw them then we are to have art for them!\nThe Cards of Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats\nGet the official Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats UNCERTAIN-TEE SHIRT! \nYou won't know if it's ALIVE or DEAD until you open the box (that comes in the mail).

However she had to put that promising career on hold to meet the rigorous demands of middle school. Chris and Heather O\u2019Neill showed Heather Wilson their fledging theory and after many hours of rigorous play-testing and scientific study, Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats as it is known today was born.\nOnce it was clear that \"the Heathers\" really, really wanted to make Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cats a reality, discussions were had about how to make that happen. Kickstarter seemed like the natural choice to get the game produced and into the hands of players quickly. 9th Level Games (of which Chris O'Neill is a partner) realized that Schr\u00f6dinger's Cats would be a great fit for expanding their catalog of humorous, universally-accessible games. Plus, 9th Level Games had recently run a successful Kickstarter for their role-playing game KOBOLDS ATE MY BABY! IN COLOR!!!\nThe Artist\nJames Stowe is a full-time illustrator, graphic designer, father of two, and cartoonist living in the Pacific Northwest. He has produced RPG fantasy illustrations for 20 years now with more than 100 published works to his credit.

This meant making ZANO small and lightweight, yet durable enough to take with you anywhere. Intelligent enough so no piloting skills were required, and most of all, pricing ZANO at a point that makes it affordable.\" Reece Crowther, Head of Marketing\nZANO next to an iPhone 5\n\"Right out of the box you can begin capturing and sharing stunning aerial photographs and videos, with absolutely no complex flight training required.\" - Ivan Reedman, Head of Research and Development.\nA plethora of sensors work seamlessly together to allow ZANO to avoid obstacles, hold its position and know exactly where it is in conjunction with your smart device, at all times. \nThis means ZANO operates on a virtual tether connected to your smart device. Allowing for simple gesture control of ZANO. Tilt your phone or tablet left or right, forward or backward and ZANO will follow. (ZANO can also be utilised in \"Free Flight\" mode, using on-screen Joy Sticks). On screen slide bars control rotation and altitude. ZANO will hold its position unless instructed otherwise (In both \"Capture\" mode as well as \"Free Flight\" mode), which allows for maximum control and creative freedom without the burden of piloting ZANO.\nIf ZANO senses it's strayed too far from your smart device or is running low on battery, it will automatically return to your smart device. \nOperating on a virtual tether also enables \"Follow me\" capability in ZANO. Which means once you set ZANO's hold position, it will register the distance it is from your smart device. You can choose for ZANO to hold this position or enable a \"Follow me\" feature, which will instruct ZANO to constantly maintain that distance from your smart device and follow you whilst avoiding any obstacles that may get it in the way during flight. \nZANO's GUI in \"Capture\" Mode\nExample of ZANO's GUI in \"Free Flight\" Mode\n An extended view of ZANO in action!\nRevolutionary Intelligent Flight and Autonomous Operation, complete with Obstacle Avoidance - Don't fly it.

The ZANO SDK will be available upon launch if we reach our \u00a31,000,000 stretch goal.\nThe ZANO SDK will be an incredibly well documented API, that will allow developers to task ZANO in the same way the ZANO app operates. \nA forum will be available to assist developers.\nIvan Reedman began breaking ground on autonomous, intelligent, swarming Nano UAV's in 2010. Starting with a 240mm x 240mm UAV, Ivan and his team of highly skilled engineers and developers at Torquing Group worked tirelessly to continue to reduce the size of this UAV technology, without impacting on its capabilities. Initially targeting the defence, industrial and law enforcement markets, the idea for a consumer version of this Nano UAV technology was first raised in October 2013 at the weekly Torquing Group team meeting. The team felt they were finally ready for the challenge to get this technology out to the consumer and make aerial photography and video capture truly accessible to anyone with a smart device. ZANO was born and the race was on to get this sophisticated technology to market affordably. \nSince then we have been working relentlessly to bring this technology to the consumer market. We first designed the development environments (DEV Boards) in October 2013 (which is essentially all the vital components on one big PCB), so we could test that each of the electronic components would work as expected and meet the strict requirements we knew we had to meet in order to make ZANO possible.  We selected components we knew we could not only eventually fit on a board 65mm x 65mm PCB board (with some skilful PCB layout) but also were readily available and at a low enough cost to meet the tight budget we had for each unit. Once we had selected all the vital components and our DEV boards were ready, we got to writing the firmware, an assortment of digital filters, complex mathematics routines, data fusing algorithms, video handling, obstacle avoidance and signal processing to allow for these components to work seamlessly together to achieve autonomous, intelligent flight. Many a sleepless night went by developing, until we were happy that we had selected all the correct components to bring ZANO to market affordably with all the functionality we wanted it to have.\nEnter March 2014 and we have our first 65mm x 65mm ZANO prototype PCB ready to rumble. Naturally, there were a few minor issues. However, we were encouraged enough with the progress we had made, we decided to commit our resources to going full speed ahead with ZANO. Revisions were made to the PCB and sent back for prototyping and we began conceptualising the user experience and designing the graphics for the GUI.\nJune 2014, and we're finally happy with the PCB layout and that all components are working together in cohesion. We can begin to design the ZANO aesthetic. As a consumer device, Head of Design, Thomas Dietrich (12 years experience in the Royal Air Force) knew ZANO's aesthetic had to ooze sophistication. Yet on a device so small, size and weight are of the absolute essence. How do you make a device look great with such narrow design parameters? Thomas and his team set about for the next 3 months designing ZANO's aesthetic. A sleek, sophisticated shell that fuses functionality with durability. \nWith all the vital components selected and our PCB layout complete. It was now time to find an EMS (electronic manufacturing service) with premium quality manufacturing capability, yet with prices low enough to maintain affordability. As a British company it was important for us to explore all options on our home turf prior to sending the production overseas. October 2014, the search was finally over and we were able to find the EMS partner we were looking for in the UK, to handle the initial production orders.\nSo, November 2014, where are we? \nZANO's aesthetic is complete and we have selected our plastics manufacturing company. \nOur supply chain is 100% ready to go, from vital components that make ZANO fly, to the very boxes that ZANO is packaged in are all priced and sourced!\nOur in house team has begun work on the GUI and the App integration. Over the coming months the team will begin development for Android and iOS, this will continue until March 2015, at which point the App's will be tested rigorously then submitted to Android and iOS App stores for download in May 2015.\nZANO is up and flying, holding position, avoiding obstacles, streaming live video back to a smart device, capturing video and photos. However, with as much capability as we've packed into ZANO, we are continuing to refine the flight, avoidance, video and photo capturing and user interface, plus we have relentless testing and refining procedures prior to us releasing ZANO to the market. We will begin our BETA testing in March 2015. With a view to enter production in May 2015!\nIt's been a long journey, but ZANO is almost here! From everyone here at Team Torquing, we hope you are as excited as us!\n-Reece Crowther\nWe need to get the production volumes up in order to get the price down! It's as simple as that. This first Kickstarter production run will also enable us to iron out any potential issues in manufacturing as well as streamline the process with our EMS for production runs.\n\nThe profits made from the Kickstarter campaign will allow us to hire additional engineers, software developers, app developers, product developers, etc. So we can continue to innovate and deliver fantastic products with even more capability! And yes, we are looking for talented people to join our team! So if you are passionate about producing the world's most advanced UAV technology (amongst other secret projects) and you have a set of skills that you think can contribute, drop us a line hello@flyzano.com!\n\n\nWorking in the Aerospace and Defence Technology sector since 2008, Torquing Group Ltd has built a reputation as one of the most innovative and forward thinking Unmanned Aerial System research and development companies in the world.\nRegularly acknowledged in the defence sector as the primary innovator in bringing autonomy, intelligence and swarming capability to Nano UAVs, Head of Research and Development, Ivan Reedman feels it is now time to bring such innovation to the consumer at an affordable price.\n\"For me, The real joys of creating are being able to share those creations with the world. The experience of opening a product and feeling true innovation is something that once experienced, never leaves you. I got the same feeling when I opened my first iPhone as I did when I opened my very first Casio Calculator watch in 1983. I can only hope that people will feel the same and be inspired when they experience ZANO for the very first time.\"\nWith a wealth of experience in Product Design, Manufacturing, Engineering, Software and Application Development, Torquing Group Ltd is well equipped to deliver ZANO to its Kickstarter backers on time.\n                        ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThrough innovation and diligent research and development, We are 100% confident in delivering an Autonomous and Intelligent aerial photography and video platform.

We have conservatively estimated a June delivery, however, Our component suppliers often need to order the raw materials to manufacture their components 12 months in advance, as a brand new product, it is difficult for us to estimate initial volumes and provide an accurate forecast to our suppliers. We want everyone to be able to experience ZANO experience, that's why we have not put a cap on the amount of ZANO's we are making available for the Kickstarter campaign. We have built fantastic relationships with our component suppliers who believe in ZANO and our vision to make aerial photography and video accessible to everyone.

It takes a world you think you\u2019ve read about before and turns it into something new and totally different.\nThis is the finest time to be a tabletop roleplayer since the dawn of the industry. With so many great choices on the market, your imagination has nearly infinite paths for which to choose and expand upon. With the recent release of the newest version of Dungeons & Dragons, players are chomping at the bit to exercise their imaginations and spread their ideas wide. With the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting and future sourcebook line, you can do just that. Seventh Crown is a narrative setting and sourcebook that can be used with the rules found within many popular roleplaying game systems.\nCover of Seventh Crown Setting Book\nWelcome to Seventh Crown\nBased initially within the heavily populated continent of Kanis, Seventh Crown is a setting that places the players in the middle of an epic time of change in a world controlled by a select few. What was once a powerful dwarven empire now stands as broken racial kingdoms not defined by borders or territories, but by the ironclad magical control bestowed upon them by the crowns upon their brow.\nIn Seventh Crown, six golden artifacts of unfathomable power \u2013 the Crowns of Leadership \u2013 give almost ultimate and untested influence over those of the same race. While wearing the Crown, they cannot help but be king or queen of their people. This has led to a world of kingdoms that are not defined on maps or in war rooms, but instead by the blood that runs in a people\u2019s veins. Authority enforced by magic across countless miles creates alliances, enemies and conflicts unlike those found anywhere else. When the reason for going to war is as simple as the will of who wears the Crown and the battlefield could be as complex as anywhere its people tread, life is a complex thing.\nThese six Crowns are the most powerful and important pieces of antiquity found anywhere in this world, and are watched and sought after by most of the people in Kanis. The dealings of the Crowns and the choices made by those who wear them are the talk of every town and city, and entire lifetimes have been spent trying to place a Crown on someone\u2019s head \u2013 or remove the head currently wearing one. Territorial governments, the constabulary, organized crime and other local powerhouses rule their corners of civilization for the most part, but everyone feels the pull of the Crown bearers\u2019 schemes and machinations.\nIt is the rumored existence of a seventh Crown of Leadership, the namesake of the game setting itself, which drives some people to scour the world for the mythic artifact. There have been six ruling forces on Kanis for thousands of years, many of which changing hands (heads?) over and over again, but the fact that there have always been six has been a constant for as long as the Crowns have existed. The discovery and donning of a seventh Crown of Leadership would change the world in an instant\u2026 or the discovery that it has already been found, and by what.\nThe continent of Kanis is large and varied in respect to the peoples that inhabit it, the history they have survived, and all of the interactions in between. Depending on the where someone is from, which King or Queen they serve willingly or otherwise, and how they plan to fill their purses or bellies day to day \u2013 that is where adventure will spring from in Seventh Crown.\nThe Surface of Kanis\nWhat is Different?\nAnyone can read through the newest game system and see what each creature, species or deity means to a \u201cnormal\u201d campaign setting. Seventh Crown takes a lot of these standard ideas found in several rulebooks and turns them into brand new ideas that come together to create a new and unique world where players can portray characters like they never have before. There are plotlines and narrative hooks found within Seventh Crown that will put players in unique new roles as well as give them interactions with the world not commonly possible in other settings.\nJust to give a number of good examples, the following are all samples of what makes Seventh Crown unique, interesting and a great deal of fun in which to roleplay.\nThe current King of the Elves is a sadistic dark elf warlock with the long term plan of breeding out the surface elves by forcing hospitality between the Surface World and the Great Beneath. Over the centuries dark elves have become a much more accepted sight on the surface, and travel to the depths of the Great Beneath is more commonplace despite its inherent dangers.\nThe halfling people suffered massive losses during a horrible war that forced their people into nomadic, extended families that travel Kanis in search of joy, profit and adventure. Their stories and culinary crafts are welcomed almost universally in Kanisi civilization.\nIcon of Vimbre Po; Laughing God of Halfling Nomads\nThe dragonborn of Kanis are primarily mercenaries and seafarers, with those of chromatic heritage leaning toward life as sell swords or pirates; metallic dragonborn finding more favor as professional soldiers and trading corsairs. The two sects of dragonborn are constantly at odds, and many conflicts have begun based solely on \u201cscale color.\u201d\nOne corner of the continent is currently dealing with a large scale guerilla war between the goblinoids and the kobolds, putting some local civilizations in strange circumstances for unlikely social situations and alliances.\nThere is a militant sect within the dwarves that harken to the days when their bloodlines ruled the entire continent as a royal Dynasty. These dwarves are old-minded, somewhat racist toward certain peoples, and belligerently aimed at returning the dwarves to former glory.\nThe gnomes of Kanis are willingly subservient to dwarves and have been for thousands of years. Their acceptance of a lower station in life is a key element to a larger meta-mathematical equation that their ancient scholars believe will finalize with the gnomish people ruling the entire world. Effectively, the gnomes believe they have discovered the formula for complete domination of Kanis; it only requires a few more centuries of servitude to come to fruition.\nAnd much, much more!\nSymbol of Foeslen, God of Thieves and Muggers\nWhat will be in the Seventh Crown core book?\nThe Seventh Crown core book, the goal of this Kickstarter, when published will be a hardcover tome of roughly 150 pages written, designed, illustrated and laid out by industry professionals to create a complete sourcebook for the continent of Kanis and the Seventh Crown roleplaying game setting. While it will contain some rules information specific to the Seventh Crown setting, it will NOT include a core system of rules. Instead it relies upon the player(s) to use it alongside obviously compatible rules systems.\nThe Seventh Crown Core Setting Book will include:\nA detailed History of the continent of Kanis, its many Cultures and its current Rulers\nA detailed Pantheon of Kanisi deities, including their effect upon Clerics, Paladins and Druids in Seventh Crown\nA detailed look at the Geography and Civilizations of Kanis\nNew Kanisi Backgrounds, Feats and Spells\nFull Color Unique Illustrations throughout\nFull Color Maps of the Kanis surface world and the subterranean Great Beneath\nNarrative Stories set in the world of Seventh Crown (some starring characters from higher-level Backers!)\nPlot Hooks and Adventure Ideas; including two detailed 1st-level Campaign Starters\nA Glossary of Seventh Crown terms to help with pronunciation and explanation\nWhat do you get for your backing?\nAside from being a part of the launch of a great new game setting, hopefully giving it enough fan backing to begin a full Seventh Crown line of sourcebooks and such in the near future, you faithful backers can get some really awesome rewards for helping us get off the ground!\nThe Copper Piece Level \u2013 For just $2 or more you throw in your attentions to the campaign and help keep the Kickstarter \u201cHot Picks\u201d eyes peeled on our little project here.

During these events we will be taking charitable food donations (Canned and sealed-boxed items only) from the players AND bystanders to be given to the local Food Finders Food Bank (http://food-finders.org/) to serve as points of Inspiration to modify the game in progress. The catch is that while the players can donate their food products to play as Inspiration for their own characters during the game, bystanders can donate food products to either help out the Player Characters OR give Inspiration for the rolls made by the DM! No matter who is getting the Inspiration played for them, Food Finders will be the true winners in the event.\nThe Platinum Piece Level \u2013 If you are one of the limited backers at the $100 level, you receive an electronic PDF copy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book, special thanks in the final product, access to Add-ons, all unlocked Stretch Goal Bonus Products, and a printed hardcopy of the Seventh Crown Core Setting Book signed and personalized by the author and lead artiste.

Should this campaign go well enough to show us a solid fan base in the works, we plan on getting Seventh Crown print runs into common distribution and hopefully into game stores all over the world.\nAdditionally, we have plans to write a series of Seventh Crown setting products that will better flesh out the world, its many plotlines and some major events that take place in the overarching story and expanding world setting.\nSome of the products we have planned are as follows:\nvarious Adventure Modules that cover specific plot arcs important to the Seventh Crown storyline\nBestiary of Kanis Sourcebook; introducing numerous native species of creatures to encounter\nFarsteader\u2019s Atlas Sourcebook; a guide to the lands beyond the primary continent of Kanis\nSeventh Crown novellas surrounding epic events within the world\nEssentially, we want this Kickstarter campaign to go well enough to warrant making Seventh Crown into a larger roleplaying setting capable of launching more products through future Kickstarters and eventually on their own merit. We need your help, support and some good old fashioned word-of-mouth advertising for that to happen!\nAdd-Ons\nThe following are all Add-on products that Seventh Crown backers may purchase using the Campaign Manager Backer Kit.\nSeventh Crown Tee Shirt ($15 and $5 shipping) \u2013 A simple, high quality black tee shirt with the Seventh Crown logo printed upon it.

Space is not only mysterious, but also at times, deadly. And in Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant, the galaxy changes each time you play, making every game a unique experience.\n Expand into new star systems. Build your base of operations on a wide variety of exotic worlds. Employ your Diplomats to make friends, sign treaties and influence alien cultures. Improve local economies by building Factories and Starbases. And defend your hard-earned gains with a Defense Base.\nExploit the weaknesses of your enemies. Improve your ship technology, and send your fleet forth to capture other worlds. Or work in the shadows with Agents, as they sow unrest, sabotage, and steal enemy events.\nWhat is Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant?\nTraveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant places you at the center of one of the most exciting periods in Traveller history. It is the dawn of the Third Age of the Imperium. The dark times of the empire are behind us, and the future is ripe with the promise of rapid expansion, untold adventures, and even danger, on the wild frontiers of the galaxy. But rewards come only to those who are bold enough to seize that once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\nTraveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant is a chance to carve out your own piece of the cosmos. You have been tasked by the Emperor to move into a new sector of the galaxy: Use your newly-acquired Imperial Warrant to Explore, to Expand and to Exploit this new area for the glory of the Imperium\u2026and for your own fame and glory.\nWith the approval and support of Traveller creator Marc Miller, Traveller Ascension marks a new series of products set in the Traveller universe. The events in Traveller Ascension all take place during the first several hundred years of the Third Age of the Imperium. It is a time of rapid Imperial expansion, vast exploration, and conflict. All of which makes a terrific background for a variety of tactical and strategic science-fiction adventures, set in a unified, award-winning universe that never runs out of rich, exciting stories to tell.\nWe invite you to help us launch the first of these adventures, the Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant boardgame. By supporting this Kickstarter project, your feedback and support will help us make a better game, one worthy of joining the classic Traveller universe. Best of all, when you play Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant, the decisions you make in the game let you create your own rich, exciting story, as you help determine the fate of the Imperium in this new age. And by getting in right at the beginning of the Traveller Ascension saga, you\u2019ll have the advantage of choosing game options that best fit your style \u2013 many of which are special bonuses or exclusives especially created for our Kickstarter supporters. Thank you.\nImperial Warrant is the first release in the Traveller Ascension series, which is set in the Third Age of the Imperium\n\nDesign Your Own Faction in the Game\nTo accomplish the tasks assigned to you by the Emperor, you lead a Faction, which YOU get to design online. Some Factions have the edge when exploring, others in combat, still others in diplomacy, or movement, or science. There are even Shadow operatives that can get things accomplished\u2026without too many questions being asked.\nThe key is that your unique skills affect play in the Imperial Warrant game and the Traveller Ascension universe. It\u2019s all based on what you choose as your background, especially the Corporation and Noble House from which you come. All have strengths and weaknesses, and each is a challenge to play and to master.\nPLAY\n\nSo, when you receive your copy of Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant, you will have the usual Actions granted to all players, but you will also have additional abilities granted to your particular Faction, based on your skill set. Playing to your strengths and minimizing those of your opponent is the key to mastering the game, and carving out a new sector of space to call your own.\nIf you want to expand your capabilities in the game even further, you can go above and beyond the capabilities of the various Factions by specializing in particular genres and abilities \u2013 all taken from the core Traveller Ascension universe. You might want your Faction to be led by a Master Architect, which gives you a major advantage over your rivals when erecting buildings. Or possibly you enjoy leading fleets of spaceships into battle, as a Fleet Tactician, or running diplomatic circles around your foes.\nWe\u2019ve made these key areas of specialization available in the Special Collector\u2019s Editions. Each of these versions comes with an actual Imperial Warrant, etched with your specific Special Ability. It\u2019s a great way you can affect the outcome of a game, and make the most of your own unique style.\nA wide variety of Special Abilities are available in the Special Collector's Editions\nFor example, Asteroids are a key obstacle in the game. Generally speaking, they slow down movement through the galactic sector, and can even damage your star-faring vessels. But by choosing the Asteroid Miner Special Collector\u2019s Edition, you immediately flip Asteroids from a disadvantage into something that really benefits your Faction: You can move through them and exploit them for economic gain. Not only can advantages like this make the difference in a close game, they really add to the enjoyment and replay value \u2013 especially when your opponent chooses a different area to specialize in.\nWe\u2019ve kept the number of each Special Collector\u2019s Edition category limited, both to reward our Kickstarter supporters, and to have the greatest variety possible in the combinations. So, choose your area of Specialization, and ride your special Imperial Warrant to fame and fortune. The possibilities for replay are endless \u2013 especially since any Special Collector\u2019s Edition will add a gameplay benefit not only for Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant, but also for other games in the Traveller Ascension series.\nPlaying Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant\nIn Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant, you aren\u2019t portraying a character in a role-playing game. Instead, you are the leader of a powerful Faction, with a variety of assets at your disposal. How you utilize those assets to foil your rivals and to achieve your mandate from the Emperor \u2013 to Explore, Expand, and Exploit into a new sector of the galaxy \u2013 is the heart of the game.\nPLAY\n\nTraveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant is a card-driven strategy game. While that may mean different things to different gamers, in the universe of Traveller Ascension, it means that each card in the game may be played either for its Action, or for the Event depicted on the card.\nCards are played for either Actions or Events, depending on the strategy you choose\nDuring this time period in Traveller Ascension, communication is not faster than space travel. So, ships and assets operating on the far reaches of space are much like commanders in the Age of Sail \u2013 it\u2019s hard to manage their every move. So, players must commit cards for each half of the turn, before the Actions and Events actually take place.\nThe particular order that Actions and Events occur depends on Initiative, which varies depending on the relative importance of the Action or Event being played. This means that players must strike a balance between planning their turn, and actually playing cards, which creates a lot of welcome tension and back-and-forth between the players, as each tries to seize the Initiative.\nThe variety of Action cards available, along with the 'Any' card, which can serve as any Action you wish to partake in the game\nThe Actions available are:\nMilitary \u2013 Consolidate Power, Attack Enemy Vessels, Build Defense Bases, etc\nDiplomacy \u2013 Make Friends, use Diplomatic Solutions to get new cards, Build Embassy, etc\nShadow \u2013 Undermine Enemy Power, Create Unrest, Steal Events, etc\nScience \u2013 Explore the galaxy, Map Star Systems, Improve Ship Technology, etc\nEconomic \u2013 Trade, Repair buildings and ships, Build Starport, etc\nMovement \u2013 Move Fleets, get new assets from the Imperium, etc\nPlus the additional bonus Actions that are available to each Faction\nTraveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant contents:\n96 Action and Event cards\n2x Player Factions \u2013 Including the Faction that you design\n(Both complete with Standard and Specific Faction Player Mats)\nOver 100 precision-cut playing pieces and markers\n20 Planet cards, from near-airless rocks to lush environs\nMore than 20 Space Terrain Tiles for you to construct a new sector of the galaxy\nMore than 2 dozen additional map borders, so your galaxy can look its best\n2 Player Action Mats, professionally coated to stand up to repeated play\n20 Mysterious Obelisks\n2 Spaceship tracks, so you can develop your fleet\n1 Turn Track\nTraveller Ascension Rulebook\nTraveller Ascension Playbook\n40 wooden cubes\nTwo 6-sided dice\nOne 8-sided die\nOne 10-sided die\nWhere Your Support Goes\nBy supporting us on Kickstarter, not only do you get your copy of Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant weeks before it\u2019s available to the general public, you also get to take advantage of all the Kickstarter bonuses and exclusives.\nAs we reach each funding level with your support, we will be able to create more assets and devote more art resources to the game. That means more varied star systems to explore, more asteroids, more gas giants, more nebulas \u2013 all to make exploring the galaxy even more of an adventure. We can provide a wider range of planets for you to find, exploit and conquer. We\u2019ll even be able to ship with more Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant scenarios right out of the box.\nOnce higher levels are achieved, we\u2019ll be able to unlock special Kickstarter bonuses and exclusives, such as special Action and Event cards, which will only be available for this Kickstarter campaign. If there is enough support, we\u2019ll even be able to debut some special new units in the game \u2013 which we are really excited about! Thank you for your support.\nOur first unlocked Stretch Goal! Thanks to everyone! Now it's onward and upward to the next Stretch Goal.\nAdditional Support Options\nTraveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant has everything you need for an exciting 2-player challenge \u2013 the standard for a card-driven strategy game. But we found during testing that a lot of folks were asking how it would play with 4 or even 6 players. We are happy to report that it works quite well, thank you. To meet this demand, we are offering expansions in our Add-On section for 3&4 players and 5&6 players, to create as much multiplayer mayhem as you can manage on the edges of the Imperium.\n New Collector's Editions!\nLike us on Facebook!\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TravellerAscensionGame", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame design, while certainly fulfilling, is not easy, and it does come with some inherent risk. The design for Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant is the first in a new line of Traveller boardgames. And while Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant is a new design, it does have the advantage of being a part of a well-designed, award-winning Traveller universe. The designer is a seasoned veteran, with published designs in both the video game and boardgame industries. The staff of Daring Play are also experienced in designing, developing, and producing boardgames, and are very passionate about the project.\nMoreover, the games are being manufactured in our own facility in the USA, which gives us the maximum amount of control over the quality of the game\u2019s components. This is critical as we move to fulfill the Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant for those pledging support. \nHowever, if we do have a huge success, those very strengths (internal design and manufacturing) could slow down the delivery of the project. This risk will start becoming evident if our project starts to exceed 3000 backers, at which point, we will have to add extra shifts in our factory. It is possible that the ship date could slip, by as much as 4 to 8 weeks. Alternatively, we may decide to keep the existing ship date to begin fulfillment, and continue shipping overflow product as those are completed \u2013 in which case, we would ship as close to a \u2018first-come, first served basis\u2019 as is practical.\nWe feel that we have done our best to mitigate the inherent risks involved.

Instead, we ran into some difficulties. The additional equipment we ordered, so that we could speed up the manufacturing process, took longer to get in, set up and get going than we had expected. In particular, it took more time than we planned to get everything working smoothly, and to properly scale up our production runs. Fortunately, the component quality when produced was always top notch, so that was a welcome relief."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 401, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/858784112/traveller-ascension-imperial-warrant-boardgame", "project_name": "Traveller Ascension: Imperial Warrant Boardgame"}}, {"backer": "Marc \"Traveller\" Miller", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "In 1995 Puppetland was a pioneer in the indie RPG movement.

(We're confirming the authors and titles now!)\nIntroduction\nThe skies are dim always since the Maker died. Once the golden lights of Puppettown were the brightest beacons in all of Puppetland but now they gutter under blood-red glass. Once the sun and the moon moved their normal courses through the heavens but now they are fixed in place, the faltering moon above and the cracked and peeling sun somewhere down below. The rise of Punch the Maker-Killer has brought all of nature to a stop, leaving it perpetually winter, perpetually night. Puppets the length and breadth of Puppetland mourn the loss of the Maker and curse the name of Punch \u2014 but not too loudly, lest the nutcrackers hear and come to call with a sharp rap-rap-rapping at the door.\nIllustrators include Raven Mimura.\nPuppetland is a diceless tabletop RPG in which the players take the roles of puppets in a fairy-tale paradise gone bloodily wrong. It's Punch & Judy taken to its logical extreme: Punch has killed the Maker of all puppets and transformed peaceful, magical Puppetland into his personal nightmare realm.\nCreated by John Scott Tynes \u2014 that's me \u2014 Puppetland trailblazed the Indie RPG movement back in 1995 when I first published it on my website. It wasn't just diceless; Puppetland sidestepped most notions of RPG game mechanics and went straight for the jugular of pure collaborative narrativism. It was reprinted in the British games magazine Arcane in 1997 and then expanded and reprinted by James Wallis's game company Hogshead in 1999.\nIt's now been out of print for about a decade. Punch & Judy and the Nutcrackers and Punch's Boys have been moldering, dusty and forgotten, in a shadowy attic.\nIt's time to bring them back to hideous life!\nCover painting by Alejandro Teran.\nA Word From the Creator\nI really love Puppetland. In all the years I worked in tabletop roleplaying games \u2014 founding and running Pagan Publishing and co-creating projects like Delta Green, The Unspeakable Oath, Call of Cthulhu D20, and Unknown Armies \u2014 none of my projects were more personal than this one. The tale of Punch, Judy, the Maker, and their friends and enemies was one I'd been destined for since I was a child, telling my own Punch & Judy stories with the finger puppets my mother patiently made at my request.\nAfter years of obscurity and escalating prices on eBay, Puppetland needs a long-term home. I don't want my freakish baby to go homeless again. It's time to spruce it up, wipe the goo from its cheeks, and send it out into the world \u2014 more beautiful and terrifying than ever. Thanks to Shane Ivey at Arc Dream Publishing and the generosity of Kickstarter gamers, that's exactly what we hope to do.\nInterior color paintings by Samuel Araya.\nWhat is Puppetland?\nPuppetland is a storytelling game with strings in a grim world of make-believe. In a land of puppets created by a benevolent Maker, the usurper puppet known as Punch has murdered the Maker and taken his face. Now Punch rules Puppetland as a violent despot, opposed only by a ragged band of freedom fighters led by Judy, who loved Punch once and now wants to see him fall. And maybe, just maybe, she can bring the Maker back to life.\nPlayers take the roles of puppets in this strange world: finger puppets, hand puppets, marionettes, and shadow puppets. With their limited abilities and boundless enthusiasm, they do their best to survive Punch, his nutcrackers, and his terrible Boys. Helping other puppets, having adventures, and maybe even overthrowing the Maker-Killer \u2014 not bad for a pack of fools in motley.\nWhen I created Puppetland in 1995, the field of experimental roleplaying games was very small. We'd seen Amber Diceless Roleplaying and Jonathan Tweet's Over the Edge and Everway. But Ron Edwards' Sorcerer wasn't out yet, nor was James Wallis's The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen \u2014 let alone the later wave of indie RPGs such as My Life With Master and Dogs in the Vineyard. And Puppetland was and still is very experimental: a diceless RPG that didn't even have a conflict resolution mechanic. I put complete trust in the GM and the players to collaborate in a simple, fun way \u2014 and then I capped playing time to one hour, knowing that this kind of rarefied improv was unlikely to sustain its momentum for very long.\nThe result was electric. Players all over the world began trying Puppetland and discovering they could tell and experience stories in a whole new way. The reviews at RPG.net are a good barometer of how the game was received; even today it's in RPG.net's top 100 roleplaying games of all time.\nPunch has his fun.\nSo What's New?\nFor this new edition I've cleaned up the manuscript and added new material. Puppetland doesn't really need a rules overhaul. Nor does it need to become a 300-page behemoth. But I knew people could use some help in constructing and playing Puppetland stories, so I sought out some of the most dedicated Puppetland GMs and players and asked their advice. Their thoughts and experiences led to new content in this edition to help a group get started, complete with an introductory adventure and specific instructions for creating your own. There's even information on running Puppetland as a LARP, based on a play style invented by one of the GMs I interviewed. I'm grateful to the community of Puppetland gamers for guiding and inspiring this new edition.\nThis new book will be gorgeous. We\u2019re making it a full-color, hardback storybook edition, like a children\u2019s book gone horribly wrong. Samuel Araya will fill it with color paintings, modeled after puppets he\u2019s scuplting just for Puppetland. The original interior artist, Raven Mimura, has agreed to let me use his black-and-white artwork from the 1999 Hogshead edition. Hannah Kennedy will provide wonderful new drawings. And Alajandro Ter\u00e1n has agreed that his beautiful cover painting from the Spanish edition will grace this one as well.\nNew illustrations by Hannah Kennedy.\nGraphic designer Jessica Hopkins will design and lay out the book. She\u2019s done great work with Arc Dream Publishing in books such as Progenitor and the Call of Cthulhu magazine I founded back in 1990, The Unspeakable Oath.\nThis color, hardback edition of Puppetland will be published by Arc Dream Publishing. That means it will be available to stores around the world. But you get the first chance at it.\nPuppetland will be available as an ebook, as a PDF, and as a full-color hardback. Or you can get it in a special edition, with a sculpted urethane resin cover wrap by Ann Koi or even a custom cover hand-bound by Simeon Cogswell.\nCan I Read It Right Now?\nSure! You don't need to listen to me talk about this. The original 1995 version of Puppetland is still available for free on my website and will stay there. Go read it. You can even print a puppet character sheet here. If you like it, come back here. I've added a lot more since then.\nExclusive Rewards\nRESIN COVER WRAP SCULPTED BY ANN KOI. Ann is a veteran sculptor and longtime friend with an eye for the intersection between the beautiful and the grotesque whose work is produced through Catalyst Studios. A few backers can get their copies of Puppetland wrapped in Ann\u2019s custom sculpt of Punch\u2019s mask of flesh and autographed by the author and artists. It's going to be . . . tasty. Reserve one of Ann\u2019s copies by choosing the \u201cNutcracker,\u201d \"Babysitter,\" \"Slapstick\" or \"Sausagemaker\" reward tier.\nHere are some samples of Ann's work.\nCUSTOM BINDING BY SIMEON COGSWELL. Simeon is a graphic designer whose first and greatest love is bookbinding. A few backers can get their copies of Puppetland bound by hand, each a custom work of art by Simeon, and autographed by the author and artists. You\u2019ll help Simeon decide what your book should look and feel like and what elements to include. Bones? Caterpillar stitching? Wood and nails? Metal and leather? Your copy of Puppetland will be totally unique. Reserve one of Simeon\u2019s copies by choosing the \u201cPunch\u2019s Boy or Girl\u201d reward tier. \nHere are some samples of Simeon's work.\nAUTOGRAPHED HOGSHEAD EDITION. A few backers can be mailed an autographed copy of the Hogshead edition of Puppetland. Reserve your copy by choosing the \"Judy's Baby\" reward tier. \nINSPIRE A BLACK-AND-WHITE ILLUSTRATION! A few backers can send their ideas for puppets to feature in Hannah Kennedy\u2019s black-and-white illustrations. You\u2019ll work with Hannah to see your favorite puppet as a part of Puppetland. Reserve a drawing of your own by choosing the \"Constable\" or \"Babysitter\" reward tier.\nINSPIRE A COLOR ILLUSTRATION! A few backers can send their ideas for puppets to feature in Samuel Araya\u2019s color illustrations. You\u2019ll work with Sam to see your favorite puppet as a part of Puppetland. Reserve a painting of your own by choosing the \"Clown\" or \"Slapstick\" reward tier. \nSAMUEL ARAYA\u2019S PUPPET-MODELS. Sam is sculpting puppets by hand as models for his Puppetland paintings. He\u2019s agreed to make a few of those sculpts available for backers! If you reserve one as part of your rewards, Sam will finish and paint the puppet and ship it to you anywhere in the world. These won\u2019t be fully functional puppets since they\u2019re built as models for paintings, but they\u2019ll be wonderful and rare keepsakes that you can hold at the table in Puppetland games. Reserve a model of your own by choosing the \"Crocodile\" or \"Sausagemaker\" reward tier.\nSally Red Buttons, partially sculpted.\nA Final Word\nPuppetland is a strange little beast. It grew directly out of my childhood obsession with puppets in general and Punch & Judy in particular. It's been used to teach kids creative writing at Rutgers Preparatory School, got bought by Hollywood for a G-rated CGI movie that never happened, was translated into French and Spanish, and kept on finding fans long after it disappeared from shelves.\nLet\u2019s bring Puppetland back one last time, in the form it deserves.

Your worst fear is that The Computer will discover that you are one of these enemies. \nParanoia: A light-hearted game of terror, death, bureaucracies, mad scientists, mutants, dangerous weapons, and insane robots, which encourages players to lie, to cheat, and backstab each other at every turn. \nIs that fun?

Let's fix that.\nWith your help we're going to produce a DRM-free ebook of each printed Unshelved collection: Unshelved, What Would Dewey Do?, Library Mascot Cage Match, Book Club, Read Responsibly, Frequently Asked Questions, Reader's Advisory, Large Print, Too Much Information, and Bibliovores. Each will contain all of the content of the original printed book (a total of almost 4000 strips!) with remastered art at Retina resolutions, in both EPUB and PDF formats.\nSample Unshelved Book Club strips\nBut that's not all. If we can sell enough we'll add an ebook of our upcoming eleventh collection and if we sell even more we'll collect all our Unshelved Book Club strips, including hundreds never before published, into a special ebook. And you have our permission to print out these high resolution book recommendations and display them in your library, school, or bookstore.\nJust for fun you'll have the option to get your ebooks on a custom 8GB USB drive shaped like a card catalog drawer. We have a small quantity of signed and numbered \"Early Edition\" drives on hand, which we will ship in November, perfect for holiday gifts. The rest of the drives will likely ship in late December, and may not arrive in time for the holidays (but we'll do our best).\nWe think Unshelved ebooks belong in libraries, so if we can meet our goals we will donate our ebooks to libraries to circulate for free!\n Finally, Gene and I have a lot to say about our work, and if we meet our most optimistic goals we will record a page-by-page audio commentary for each book. Follow along with us as we talk about strips we haven't read in years, recall the true-life stories behind them, and constantly worry that our best work is behind us.\nYou can enhance your order by adding the following items. Simply add the price shown below to the cost of your premium. After the campaign is over we'll confirm the details of your order.

Please stop by the d20E website ay www.d20entertainment.com  or Troll Lord Games for news on the Castles & Crusades  RPG at http://www.trolllord.com\n\"Beyond the River\" is a tale of Juergan of Astode, a knight of some renown. Weary and spent, seeking only the solace of quiet, he's retired to the Barren Wood, upon the banks of the Hruesen River, in the shadow of the Blacktooth Ridge. There he's built his home. and there he lives out his days in meagre comforts.\nBut now, he stands before the Baron Botkin . . . .\n\n\"My niece, Clarrisa, fell into the cold waters of the Hruesen River. The current was swift there, in the river's bend, and it pulled her down stream. It was so fast. Areth went after her, but he never came up. But she did. Clarrisa did. She crawled out of the water on the far side of the river, upon the feet of the Blacktooth Ridge. She called to me, but I could not hear her. I could not hear what she was saying. The water was too loud and my blood was rushing. That's my sister's daughter. She's only nine.\n\n\"We went to get boats, but it took us too long. By the time the fisherman had uncovered their craft and brought them down to the river bank, she was gone.\n\n\"As the light failed we found her trail. She crawled up the bank. This we know. But it was snowing already. Not much. Just enough to cover her trail. We lost her. But there's been no murder of crows, no circle of death, no wolf calling its mates to the feast. She's alive. I know she's alive. \n\n\"Juergan. You know the ridge. You know what dwells there. I charge you, as a knight of New Aenoch and servant of the Empress, to cross the Hruesen River and find my niece. Alive. Failing that. I want vengeance. But alive or dead, whatever took her, dies.\"\n\n\"Beyond the River\" is the title for episode one of d20 Entertainment's live action drama, the first of what we hope are many tales of Juergan of Astode. \n\nWritten by Stephen Chenault, the Troll Lord of Troll Lord Games, author of over 20 RPG supplements and the Codex of Aihrde, and Produced by d20 Entertainment. This is an epic moment in the history of Castles & Crusades and the World of Aihrde. Don't miss out!!! Only two days left!\n\n\nSir Juergan of Blacktooth Ridge was born the fifth son of a knight in the service of the King of Kayomar. As a young man he was farmed out by his father to the Knights of Haven who served many lords. Juergan quickly earned a reputation for his bravery on the battlefield, but more, for his skills with both lance and sword. He proved himself on many occasions and soon other knights wished to serve with him and he rose in the ranks, where he proved an even greater skill through calm deliberation and an iron determination both on the field of battle and off it. \nIn his prime he joined the Crusade called by the young Empress of New Aenoch. She called for all men of worth and courage to come to her land and drive back the vestiges of evil that ever lurked upon her borders. For two and twenty years Juergan served the Empress, as well as the many Dukes and Prelates who ruled under her. It was during one such foray for the Empress, upon the heights of the Blacktooth Ridge that Juergan unearthed a coven of witches. They served the black-hearted Unklar, the Horned God, bound to him by covenants both ancient and new. For many years he struggled with them. Some were slain, others fled, but not until he convinced one of their number, Ingrid, to cast off he Horned God, was he able to destroy the coven. It was perhaps his greatest deed. But it soured him, and he left the Knights of Haven. \nHe retired, with great renown, if little wealth, to a small plot of land near to Ludensheim beneath the shadow of the Blacktooth Ridge. There for years he has enjoyed the comfort of a simple life, but Juergan\u2019s fame carried to the many storied halls of lords and ladies and the powers of one such as he are not easily forgotten. They come to him, more often than not . . . .\nStarring: Rene LaVertu.\nProducer: Ken Whitman \nExecutive Producer: Stephen Chenault\nStudio: d20 Entertainment\n\nSimply increase your backing amount by the amount above.

Pilot)"}}, {"backer": "Marc \"Traveller\" Miller", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Introductions and Stuff\nEdge of Heaven is a d100 based Science Fiction Tabletop RPG adventure game. Set 400 years in the future, you play a character from any of 6 races doing whatever it takes to get by in the Galaxy. Rob banks, smuggle contraband, repel boarding actions. Or. Rescue trapped miners, protect politicians from potential assassination, stop dangerous criminals. Using a brand new system, because we didn't feel like the others we tested for it worked, Edge of Heaven blends simplicity, realism, and fun.\nWell, Hello there!\nWe've got the entirety of two books written, or very nearly so: The Core Rulebook and the Mission Module. The Core Rulebook explains the basics of how to play the game, as most Core Rulebooks do (or Player Handbooks as they're sometimes called). It addresses the core elements of the system (attributes, skills, combat, et cetera), provides useful information to players about the galaxy (sentient races, career options, items, pets, corporations, et cetera), and advises Game Masters on how to build games for Edge of Heaven (game types, session lengths, tips for new game masters, et cetera). The Mission Module provides a quick(ish) story to play through, centered around a bank heist. We've recorded a playtest of the Mission Module. Due to technical issues (read: flaky camera people), we were only able to set up for audio recording. It's ok, I'm sure; you didn't want to see our ugly mugs anyway. You can listen in below:\nWarning: These Audio Clips contain a fair amount of cursing and some mild innuendo. User Discretion is advised.\nPt 1.1: Introductions and Stuff\n Pt 1.2: Special Help and Stuff\n Pt 1.3: The Contract and Stuff\nRules of Engagement and Stuff\nSo, how do you play Edge of Heaven? Well, like most dice-based role-playing games, you play with dice. Like most roleplaying games, you sit around a table (or the floor) and play with a group of friends, each of you pretending to be someone else. The dice necessary for this game are 2d10, collectively referred to as percentile dice (d100 or d%). Every action you take that requires a dice roll, from building your character to gunfights to repairing your ship to Parkour, will require only the d100.\nEverything has a rate of difficulty, what we call a Hit Value (HV). Sometimes this HV is set by the difficulty of a task, other times it is set by the accuracy rating of the weapon in hand, other times it is set by an opposing check. When you roll the d100, if your roll, with all penalties added, meets or exceeds the HV, you succeed. If you roll high enough, you can epically succeed. If you don\u2019t meet or exceed the HV, you fail. If you roll low enough, you can critically fail.\nFeel free to ask about any of the skills or weapons you see in the Character Sheet that is Update #2.\nAs you go through life, often times, if you want to learn how to do something well, you spend hours training at it. If you want to learn to aim and shoot guns well, you spend hours at the shooting range. If you want to learn how to fix cars, you spend hours reading about and working on cars. If you want to learn how to drive a TARDIS, you steal one and spend millennia learning about all of its functions. The same is true in Edge of Heaven. Experience isn\u2019t gained from the mass murder of innocent wizards, kings, wizardkings, and their respective pets, but through training. As you play, you discuss with your GM which skills you\u2019d like to train and for how long, and you treat it as done. You cannot train skills whilst training other skills, or whilst occupied with other tasks. That is to say, if you sleep 8 hours a (telluric) day, you have 16 hours left to do what you need to do. Use your time wisely.\nThe last thing I want to talk about here, to give you an idea of our system, is movement. Every vehicle and every creature, and every race has a movement rating. For creatures and races, this movement rating represents the average walk speed. For vehicles, this movement rating represents the equivalent of an average walk speed, essentially the speed of the vehicle when you\u2019re driving leisurely and not gunning it. For humans, the average walks speed is 8 meters per 6 second round. Technically, it\u2019s 8.333 meters per 6 second round, but we want to make things simple and fun while we keep our grasp on realism, so we drop the decimal. If a Human runs, in Edge of Heaven, they do so at 3 times their walk speed, about 24 meters per 6 second round. It\u2019s not 25, because we dropped the decimal, remember?\nRacial Profiling and Stuff\nSo, enough about humans. I\u2019d like to showcase for you, briefly, the five other Races available for play in Edge of Heaven. C\u2019mon, we\u2019ll do it alphabetically. It\u2019ll be fun.\nCyborgs\nThe Vanguard Robotics Military Grade Cyborg is a labgrown creature made from organic and cybernetic materials. This term does not refer to your cybernetically enhanced humans, as it once did. These are creatures purpose built to serve as soldiers, law enforcement officers, and bouncers, among other similar things, of course. They are made in the likenesses of each other sentient Race, as requisitioned by the contract holder. There are, of course, Cyborgs that are made for other purposes, but Vanguard\u2019s are the only Cyborgs we\u2019ll be dealing with in the Core Rulebook.\nDroga\nThe Droga were re-engineered by Dunni scientists from fossil records on the planet Isis during the initial stages of planning for a Coup D\u2019\u00e9tat against the Matriarchy. The Droga rebelled against the rebels, and the Matriarchy granted them their sovereignty. It\u2019s believed that their original culture died out tens of millennia ago, before ever discovering space flight. Still, these little buggers are cool. They\u2019ve skin that can excrete a potent neurotoxin and change color and texture to match its surroundings. Shown is one of their natural colorations.\nDunni\nThe Dunni are subterranean proto-amphibians with a Matriarchal Empire. Think of them as (Nuclear) Steampunk Salamanders. Aside from the Victorian feel, one of the coolest things about the Dunni for me is their symbiotic relationship with a silicate colony lifeform. It presents in those glowing crystal markings in their skin.\nEdhir\u00e9di\nThe Edhir\u00e9di evolved from the one of the top predators on their planet. You would think that would make them ornery and gruff, but the opposite is true. These decidedly vulpine creatures are playful, intelligent, and kind. They\u2019re also very, very pretty.\nKelesti\nFinally, the Kelesti. Humans have been interacting with the Kelesti for millennia; they just didn\u2019t know it. The Kelesti have influenced every story of divine or semi-divine beings from \u201cHeaven\u201d, especially the stories of Angels. When Humans began to venture outside the solar system, they came upon a Kelesti vessel and, of course, fired upon it. It was largely unharmed and followed the humans all the way back home. Since then, the Kelesti have been helping humans develop in a much more overt way.\nArt Slavery and Stuff\nSo why are we asking for money? Well, writing an RPG is really only half of the work. We've got to put art in it and publish if we want to see it in stores and successful some day. \nWe've commissioned an amazing Artist in Emilyann Cummings. You can see some of the work she's done for the races and the Cover for the Core Rulebook below. As you can see, they're not entirely finished products. This is because we ran out of money to pay her, the poor girl, and she ended up doing this much for free. I was pretty tough on her, too. The budget as listed, $2500 USD, will cover the completion of the work she's done already only. We'll be able to pay her to finish the Races, the Covers of both books, and to start and finish the Twelve Stock Characters we intend to include in the Core Rulebook. Essentially, this fund is to end Artist Slavery here at Edge of Heaven. If we meet that goal and go no further, we'll be publishing out of our own pockets. But at least we'll be publishing.\nCover\n That said, let's move on to our Stretch Goals. \nIf we reach $5k, we'll be able to commission images of the important (and some of the unimportant) NPCs in the Mission Module and in the Skirmish at the back of the Core Rulebook. We'll also be able to commission chapter headers for both books. \nIf we reach $10k, we'll be able to commission all of the items and vehicles we'd like to see depicted in the books, as well as the basics of trim and page numbering. \nIf we reach $15k, we'll be able to commission some basic miniatures. We don't know who we'll be producing miniatures with yet, but we do know the preliminary cost for us appears to be about $5k (plus the $10k from the other stretch goals) with each of the three miniature makers we've looked at. This is to produce the preliminary molds for 12 distinct characters and to produce some of the product for shelves. \nIf we hit $20k, we'll be able to go to GenCon 2015. That would be super cool, no?\nOnce we hit $30k, we'll be able to produce an extra book, called the Tech Manual. This book would give a much larger list of available items and would be organized by Manufacturer. \nAt $50k, we'll be able to produce another extra book. A second Mission Module. This book bears specific significance because it introduces a new race, and because it is the first Mission Module in a slated Campaign Series tentatively entitled \"The Inquisition\". \nBeyond $50k, we've no current stretch goals. We'll see what happens and what we'll be able to come up with in the next month for reaching that goal.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAfter funding, we'll go through the publishing process. We'll be self publishing through Amazon, which presents a relatively smooth process. \nThe challenges we face here are about how much product we produce and who we send it to. \nChallenges:\n1) How much product do we produce initially? Is there/will there be enough demand to produce, say, 50 copies? If so, how long will it take us to produce and ship those fifty copies?\n2) How do we get our product into the hands of the consumer, aside from through the Amazon Store? How do we generate demand?\n\nSolutions:\n1) Honestly, the best way to deal with this initial question is to wait and see. We'll need to deal with Challenge 2 before we can adequate deal with this. Once we face and rise above challenge 2, we'll be able to produce product in anticipation of consumer demand.\n2) I have already started reaching out to stores. Many of them are intrigued, but cautious. They want to make sure we have a product to give them and a product that will sell before they commit to putting it on their shelves. It's entirely understandable. The hope, and the unspoken understanding, is that the success of the Kickstarter will go a long way towards building their confidences.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Zane Ian Aparicio\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nI don't really know what to write here, to be honest.

When you have enough stuff, you can return to the Adventurer's Club, to tell your stories and trade those cards for points.\nThe game will come with roughly 100 cards (still working on the precise count) as well as six player pawns, one pawn for the Professor, a six-sided die, and a rules sheet.\nYou'll need a little strategy to make the most points in the fewest moves, and to manage your risk of running into the Professor! The game handles 2 to 6 players, ages 12 and up, and takes about 60 minutes. You can download the full beta version here. Or watch the how to play video below.\nProfessor Elemental is a \"steampunk-flavoured mad professor,\" a chap-hop artist from Brighton, UK. He's well-known for his lively comedy music and hilarious antics. Take a look at Professor Elemental's website.\nJames Ernest is the president and lead designer at Cheapass Games. He has designed more than 150 published games, including board games, card games, dice games, digital games, and gambling games. His best-known games include Kill Doctor Lucky, Lords of Vegas, and Pirates of the Spanish Main.\nHarold Fay is the artist for Stuff and Nonsense, a Canadian illustrator living in Paris, who draws silly characters for a living. You can check out some of his other work here.\nNote: If this theme sounds familiar, it's because Stuff and Nonsense is a remix of a 2002 Cheapass Game, Captain Park's Imaginary Polar Expedition. The new game has a similar story, but the rules are quite different.\nWhy Use Kickstarter? Printing isn't cheap, so it only makes sense to print a game when you can make a few thousand copies at once. So we're looking to Kickstarter to help raise the money for this minimum size press run. \nThis is our fifth Kickstarter project. Our previous games were Unexploded Cow, Deadwood Studios USA, Get Lucky, and Pairs. If you've backed one of our projects in the past, thanks again for your support.\nWe have three basic reward levels: the Attaboy, the All Aboard, and the Earlybird Special. We also have three larger \"convenience\" levels that contain basic assortments of add-ons, listed below.\nFinal Stretch Goal Update: All levels $5 and above now also include the Professor Elemental bonus track \"Get High!\"\nThe Attaboy is a simple entry level, for people who want to help out, but don't necessarily want a copy of the game. The minimum pledge for this level is $5. We're offering an exclusive print-and-play PDF of the final game that goes out to all our backers at this level and above. Backers at this level and higher are also eligible for all of our add-ons (see below.)\nThe All Aboard is the basic level. For $30 you receive a copy of the game. You also get two Kickstarter-exclusive rewards: a lovely souvenir postcard of Professor Elemental, and a set of 12 exclusive bonus cards.\nThe Earlybird Special is a limited level that is nearly identical to the All Aboard, but costs $10 more, and includes one copy of a limited-edition Blackjack-style card game called Red Baron. This game has never been published before. The goal is to \"shoot down\" the dealer by ending with a total no more than three points below hers. Don't despair if you missed out on this level; we will do an alternate version of this game in 2015.\nConvenience Levels: We have added three \"convenience\" levels with some assortments of add-ons. These levels have the same price as if you added the items individually. We've opened them up to US addresses only, because we didn't want to overcharge for shipping, but International customers can pledge the same amount and add these items through the pledge manager at After the Crowd, which will also calculate the shipping cost.\nThe Game Master level contains just one copy of each of the major games in this list: Stuff and Nonsense, Unexploded Cow, and Give Me the Brain. This level is $80.\nThe Au Courant level contains only those things that are new in this campaign: Stuff and Nonsense, Give Me the Brain, the three new coins (Brain, Cow, and Stuff), the five custom dice, and the set of meeples. This level is $95.\nThe Completist level contains one of everything: Stuff and Nonsense, Give Me the Brain, Unexploded Cow, all six coins, all five dice, the set of meeples, and the Professor Elemental Pairs deck. This level is $145.\nYes, thanks for asking. Having raised more than the minimum for Stuff and Nonsense, we are able to print several other things alongside it. If one of our basic reward levels isn't exactly what you want, you can add extra items to your pledge to create the reward that's perfect for you.\nHere's how that works. For now, just compute the cost of your extra items, and add that amount to your pledge. We will use a pledge manager called After the Crowd, which is the same service we used for Get Lucky. This service will go online about two weeks after the campaign ends. At that point, you can use the pledge manager to tell us what items you want, and you can add more to your pledge at that point if you like.\nUS shipping is included in these add-on prices. After the Crowd will compute shipping costs for International orders, based on destination and weight. If you are concerned about shipping costs, the best way to get a decent estimate is to wait and add your extras through After the Crowd.\nThe Extras:\nStuff and Nonsense: Add another copy of the core game for $25. Note that all copies from this campaign will include the set of Kickstarter-exclusive bonus cards, described above.\nUnexploded Cow: Our first Kickstarter game is up for a reprint, and it is (not coincidentally) in the same size box, and from the same printer, as Stuff and Nonsense. We'll be reprinting this game at the same time (using our own funds, of course), and we thought it made sense to make it available as an add-on, for $25. Read more about Unexploded Cow here.\nGive Me the Brain! One of our oldest and most cherished games will be reprinted in a new edition that happens to have the same size box as Stuff and Nonsense. We unlocked this add-on at $55k, and now you can add it to your pledge for $25. Learn more about Give Me the Brain here. \nProfessor Elemental Pairs Deck: Pairs is a \"New Classic Pub Game\" from our previous Kickstarter campaign. This is the Professor Elemental deck, illustrated by Cheyenne Wright, for $10. Read more about Pairs here.\nMeeples: Our $30k stretch goal, this is a set of seven custom pawns (\"meeples\") for Stuff and Nonsense. They include Professor Elemental, his orangutan butler Geoffrey, his girl Sadie Bell, and a handful of colorful adventurers, all at \"mega\" 19mm scale. These meeples are made by our friends at Meeple Source, and you can add them for $15.\nCoins: We have six collector coins (some from this campaign and some from previous campaigns). They are described in detail in Update #6. Each one can be added for $5, and they are: Stuff and Nonsense, Give Me the Brain, Unexploded Cow, Get Lucky, Pairs, and Fish Cook.\nDice: We're also creating five custom dice, for $2 each, shown below. The game-specific dice will be for Give Me the Brain (pink, with a Brain on the 1), Stuff and Nonsense (bronze, with the Professor on the 1), and Unexploded Cow (black and red, with a cow on the 6). We will also make two dice with the Cheapass logo: one that is black with white numbers, and another that is white with black numbers. The Cheapass Games dice will have the logo on the 1. (This is prototype art, not necessarily final.)\nHow do you add items? You can include an extra amount in your pledge now, or you can do it with the pledge manager after the campaign closes. After the Crowd will handle our surveys and add-ons, and you'll be able to indicate which items you want to add when you go through that process.\nStretch Goals:\nWe've passed most of our stretch goals and unlocked many fun extras. Here's the rundown:\nMeeples: At $30k, we unlocked the set of Stuff and Nonsense meeples described above.\nCoins: At $40k, $45k, and $50k, we unlocked the collector coins for Stuff and Nonsense, Unexploded Cow, and Give Me the Brain.\nBraaaiiinnnns: At $55k, we have raised enough to print a second complete game: Give Me the Brain.\nDice: At $55k we also unlocked five custom 6-sided dice, one for each game (Stuff and Nonsense, Unexploded Cow, and Give Me the Brain), as well as two with the Cheapass logo, as individual add-ons for $2 each.\nBonus Cards to 12: At $65k, we upgraded the bonus pack, from 6 cards to 12 cards. This is a Kickstarter exclusive and comes with each copy of Stuff and Nonsense. \nBrains with your Brains. We've reached $70k, so backers now will receive a little rubber brain with each copy of Give Me the Brain. These are colorful rubber pencil toppers, suitable for gaming or for erasing pencil marks. \n$75k: Imaginary Expedition Travel Stickers. At $75k, we unlocked a set of five 2\" travel stickers for the destinations in Stuff and Nonsense, which will be included with each backer copy of that game. These stickers are shown in Update #8. Just another little thank-you for helping us climb so high!\n$80k: Speaking of climbing high... What a perfect stretch goal to close out the campaign: An exclusive bonus track from Professor Elemental, \"Get High.\" We've just passed this goal with only a few hours to go, so everyone gets this track for free!\nFrom the Professor: \"This track is entitled Get High and was originally recorded for the Giddy Limit Ep. I've always had a soft spot for it and love playing it out at shows with Dj Nick Maxwell where it goes down a storm. It won't be released in full on anything else, so this is your chance to own the track exclusively and use it to show off at parties and social functions.\"\nAbout EU Shipping:\nYes, Professor Elemental hails from Brighton, but Cheapass Games operates out of Seattle, and we print our games in the US. So if you live in the UK (or anywhere else outside the US) you're going to pay International shipping rates. We know these are high. \nWe have done some research on partnering with an EU distributor, but there are no great options. There is no real savings when a distributor acts as an intermediary for direct retail sales from the US, and we are not selling enough copies to print a run in the EU. So shipping directly from the US still seems to be our best option.\nIf you are concerned about the price of international shipping, we completely understand. Stuff and Nonsense, and all the game products in this campaign, will be available in general distribution soon after the backer rewards have shipped, so you might have better luck buying the games when they hit retail stores. Limited items, such as the coins and meeples, will of course be harder to find.\nThanks for your support!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStuff and Nonsense may actually be our most risk-free project to date. \n\nTypically our largest risk is artwork, but this time all the card art is already finished (and the cover art is underway). The game design is finished, we have reasonable quotes for the printing, and we have worked with all of the manufacturing partners before, down to the source for pawns. \n\nStill, delays and errors can occur, and no plan is completely airtight. We'll do our best to deliver a good product on time, but we aren't bashful about moving the deadline if it means an improvement to the final product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "Girl Genius: The Works on Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Greetings, explorers! \nWe hope you're still having having fun wandering the mean streets of London.

I serve a great variety of people in my community including children and adults.  Many people who come to see me have food allergies and/or intolerances.  There are so many who walk through my doors and tell me that my place is the \"only place in town they can eat\".  It is moving to watch the faces of little kids when they are able to order their first birthday cake that won't make them sick or pick from 3-4 desserts when they have never been given that option.  Many have cried at my counter as they tell  me of their long struggles with food and illness.\nMy goal is simple: to serve the people in my community by providing the most high quality food and cooking instruction I possibly can.

Author Shannon Appelcline guides you company by company through the history of tabletop starting in the 1970s all the way up to present day. This series is chock full of fascinating insider tidbits, company profiles, and yes\u2014enough drama to fuel a hundred campaigns.\nEvil Hat Productions is incredibly proud to produce this updated edition of Designers & Dragons. You may remember the first edition that came out from the lovely people at Mongoose Publishing\u2014we'd wanted to publish it then, but missed the chance! So we leapt at the opportunity to take it on once their one-volume version went out of print. \nEven if you own the big black book (aka, the first edition), there\u2019s still plenty of new material in this second edition\u2014over 50,000 new words in the first volume alone. Our edition is fully expanded and extensively updated, a multi-volume set that won\u2019t break your back, illustrated with pretty pictures of the games you remember fondly. RPG WIN!

Check out the GeekDad review here.\n\nWhy Are We Kickstarting Designers & Dragons?\nPre-press production on Designers & Dragons: The \u201970s is already complete, and it\u2019s so gorgeous that it got us all riled up. We\u2019re really excited about this project, and we want this first volume to have company. In short, we want to be able to print and release all four volumes at the same time. But...\n... production and printing on each volume costs $10k or more, and the idea of producing all four volumes at once gives our financial people a case of nervous twitches. We want to make this happen responsibly so we can continue to produce the high quality products you\u2019ve come to expect from Evil Hat Productions. \nThis Kickstarter will enable our goal of printing more than just the 1970s volume at the same time. It will help cover the print runs and some of the costs for Volumes 2-4 so that we can do this right\u2014and with full knowledge of how many of you out there are interested! Plus, if we hit our initial funding goal and our first two stretches, we'll be able to release the full set all at once. \nThis Kickstarter gives us an opportunity to spread our excitement in more productive ways than running through the neighborhood whilst festooned with streamers and blaring horns. (And with less of a chance of getting arrested, which is a double win.) If you\u2019re as thrilled as we are about the chance to dig into the history of our hobby, we hope you\u2019ll help spread the word to people who feel the same. Seriously, these books are addictively awesome. They nearly drove us to festooning and horn-tootery, which we think says a lot.\nProject Rewards & Goals\nEach volume in the Designers & Dragons series will be a 6\"x9\" softcover, several hundred pages long, with black and white interior. Each decade's volume of Designers & Dragons covers dozens of companies founded in that decade and follows them through to their end, or the present day for those still with us.\n\nPlease note: Companies are generally listed by their best-known, or at least most-recent, name. So you might see something like Margaret Weis Productions listed above where it was originally known as Sovereign Press, and so on.\n\nDesigners & Dragons: The \u201970s: Immediately available in multiple digital formats to our backers.

When the time comes, we will ask you to fully configure your rewards package over on backerkit.com\u2014a well known third party pledge configuration service. (If using a third-party pledge configuration service is a problem for you, it's probably best to wait and buy our books when they reach distribution.) \nBackerkit will also make it possible for folks to add on additional books in case you forgot to pledge for them while the campaign was active. Bonus!\nWhat Are My International Options?\nShipping kills, friends. Shipping kills. So be ready for that!\nWe've added a number of \"BILL MY SHIPPING LATER\" reward tiers for our international backers. Please make sure to read the relevant section in Update #3 so you can understand exactly how this will work and how high that later shipping charge will be!\nThe books will be made available for sale to the international market once they're in print, so if you'd rather wait, that's totally fine. There are also some other options to consider besides the BILL MY SHIPPING LATER reward tiers.\nIf you want to stay apprised of developments on this project, consider backing us at one of the digital levels\u2014even for $1, a low-cost way to \"subscribe\" to this project's updates. \nAnother good option is to contact a retailer closer to you and arrange for them to order the books you want!

We've produced multiple printed role-playing games in a variety of physical formats over the past six-plus years. This is a non-fiction book series, which is markedly *less* challenging to produce than a RPG book.\n\nEvil Hat's experience puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that arise\u2014as with any project, experience tells us a few problems and bugaboos *will* arise.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nTHE TEXT: While the editing and layout of several volumes is largely done, it's possible that we will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we've got an editor, a proofreader, and a historian going over every sentence in close detail, so we feel we have this under control. \n\nPRINTING: Our company has grown up alongside the big boom in digital short-run printing technology. Thanks to the advances made there, we'll be able to print the book in any quantity we need. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, or simply goofing up the manufacture or shipping of the books in some way. With a number of potential domestic printers to use, we'll always have a back-up we can go to in the event that our first choice printer has to be set aside. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you.\n\nSHIPPING: Packages get lost. We'll work with you to send replacements. Our shipper may take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until they've shipped out all backer copies. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFINANCES: Thanks to the success of the Dresden Files RPG and Fate Core, Evil Hat is\u2014for the game industry\u2014a perhaps atypically solvent RPG company. We've already spent thousands on getting Designers & Dragons to this point, and our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible. We intend to impress you.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Print-On-Demand Platinum Appendix Update", "update_content": "Hello!\nThe Platinum Appendix print-on-demand options are getting ready to go live on DriveThruRPG.

(The Bundle ends on July 31, 2014, so seize your chance to get a ton of awesome games.)\nAnd because of that, we're adding bonus content to No Soul Left Behind that we had originally planned for stretch goals. \nIn the book: An appendix full of new powers, aspects, and Devilish Devices from the campaign and from the Arc Dream blog. \nIn the book: Campaign report card handouts to track your supervillains' performance across the school year. \nIn the book: The Fiendish Four, properly laid out and illustrated with commentary.\nNOW SEE WHAT'S NEXT!\nStretch Goal Achieved!\nSTRANGE FATE: Thanks to our backers, we'll produce a downloadable conversion guide to run No Soul Left Behind with the Strange Fate rules from The Kerberos Club (Fate Edition) and Base Raiders!\nUpcoming Stretch Goals\nAT $10,000: TONS OF SCENARIO SEEDS.

You\u2019re a supervillain. As the other player\u2019s demon, you tempt that supervillain with more power in exchange for greater and greater acts of evil. But beware! If you\u2019re TOO evil, your demon can drag you kicking and screaming right to Hell. It\u2019s sort of like the Legion of Doom crossed with the Lucifer-centric parts of Sandman. (And maybe The Exorcist if you're not careful.)\nBetter Angels was published in 2013 after a great Kickstarter campaign. A standalone adventure is available, too, plus a ton of free online resources. \nNow we have the first full-size campaign book for it: No Soul Left Behind.\nEEEEVIL for a Cause\nWritten by Caleb Stokes (No Security), No Soul Left Behind features ten adventures covering an action-packed (and demon-packed) year at a charter school in a troubled neighborhood. The player characters start off as ordinary teachers or students just trying to get by. When things go really wrong for the previous batch of supervillains, these non-villainous normals inherit their demons.\nTime for a thought exercise. Let's say you\u2019re a more-or-less good sort who suddenly has superpowers \u2014 and you have a demon that constantly demands ridiculous acts of crime. What do you do? How about you commit those over-the-top superpowered crimes \u2014 and you try to save the world along the way. Or at least the city. Or maybe just the school. I mean, you do what you can, right? \nNo Soul Left Behind works as a perfect introduction to Better Angels, because it lets you introduce everything to the players at the same time as their characters. And if you\u2019re a Better Angels veteran looking for new adventures and villainy, how do you like the sound of TWO HUNDRED PAGES of new adventures and villainy? Yeah. We like the sound of it, too.\nNo Soul Left Behind is completely written and playtested but it needs cash for art, page design, and printing. We thought about invoking our own patron demon, Capitalos the Endlessly Demanding, for aid, but first we\u2019re turning to you. \nIf we hit our main goal, we\u2019ll produce No Soul Left Behind as a 200-page black-and-white paperback book, loaded with art by Brett Barkley and Kurt Komoda (the illustrators of Better Angels itself).\nBeyond the main goal, we\u2019ll have stretch goals for new chapters in the book covering supervillain powers, devilish devices, printable tools to help with play, bonus characters, and so on.\nAnd if we get enough stretch goals, we go FULL COLOR HARDBACK.\nAnd then we start adding conversion kits for Fate and Wild Talents and Mutants & Masterminds and Savage Worlds and \u2014 and who knows what!\nThe Power of Dice Compels You!\nStill not convinced?\nHow about you listen to ALL of No Soul Left Behind run by the author, Caleb Stokes, in 13 episodes.\nOr listen to the Better Angels scenario \u201cThe Good, the Bad, and the Hunky.\u201d\nOr listen to a Better Angels game run by the author, Greg Stolze.\nOr \u2014 no! You need no further tempting. Capitalos the Endlessly Demanding has already insinuated himself into your heart. Your mind burns to read this book. Your fingers itch to hold it, paperback or hardback. Your eyes ache to see it \u2014 and not just in black and white but in glorious color. These infernal hungers can be sated only by pledging! \nPledge now! And bring your friends, all your fellow gamers, to make certain that there truly is No Soul Left Behind.\nAdd-Ons\nYour base pledge gets you the book and maybe one of the high-end rewards, depending on how much you pledge and which reward you pick. Those are all listed to the right. \nOn top of that, you can add additional money to your pledge to get other books that we\u2019ve done. Because it\u2019s part of the Kickstarter project, it contributes toward hitting the goals. And because it's part of the project, the prices are down sharply.

After the Kickstarter, the main book and bonus settings will be sold separately. It's also your opportunity for specialty dice!\nDid you miss the Kickstarter?

Then choose one personal attribute\u2014Brawn, Grace, Wits, or Will\u2014to be your strength and one to be your weakness. \nNext, declare an occupation\u2014any occupation you can imagine\u2014to serve as your main skill. Then choose up to eight secondary skills from a list of 15 to 20, depending on the setting. \nBusiness card character sheets unlocked! (See the \"Mini Goals\" below.)\nFind Your Focus\nAdd up your number of skills, plus one for occupation, and the total is your Focus number, the only number you\u2019ll need in the game. Characters with just a few skills are very \"Focused,\" which improves their success with those things. Characters with many skills are less \"Focused\" in any, but they have a better \u201cJack of All Trades\u201d chance when trying unknown skills. \nFight It Out\nLayered onto this central set of rules is a fast, tactical combat system that can be played either as pure storytelling or with map and miniatures.\nExplore Countless Worlds\nAs a final layer, you can choose any setting, representing three dozen worlds so far from more than 30 professional authors. (More authors are waiting in the wings, finalizing details with their publishers.) \nEach setting chapter will provide its own skill list, from fantasy magic to starship piloting to ghostly powers, along with any special rules for creatures in that world, as well as an example adventure. \nThe CORE RPG is a great system for one-off adventures, but it also stands up well to campaign play. A draft of the main rules is online at www.corerpg.com, where you can also find my game-design credentials.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe purpose of this Kickstarter is to pay authors of the settings chapters, plus an illustrator and editor, and to fund print copies of the book. The game will also be available in multiple ebook formats. \nThe more stretch goals we reach, the more settings will be included, and we also have some special electronic rewards planned, which will be revealed later. \nSo please, scan the backer levels in the right sidebar, pick something that appeals to you, and spread the word to all your friends. The better our success, the more everyone will receive for their backing. \nAnd if you have any other favorite authors whose worlds you\u2019d like to see included, please point them our way.

This is real-time movement, and the experience only involves the book, the film and yourself.\n\nThe very same special film can be used on all pages in the book.

The internal power-supply and PC board continued to evolve in sophistication and functional capability. \nSecond POWERQUBE MINI Prototype\n3rd prototype\nThe POWERQUBE original was launched via Kickstarter in June 2013, and exceeded it's funding goal.  Based on the feedback from our funders the original product has evolved to what we have brought to you today, the POWERQUBE MINI.\nPOWERQUBE Original and POWERQUBE MINI\nPOWERQUBE MINI Left Side with 3 Smart-Charging USB Ports\nPOWERQUBE MINI Right Side with 125 Volt / 15 AMP AC outlets\nPOWERQUBE MINI Carry Case\nPOWERQUBE MINI Carry Case (Inside View)\nInside Components of POWERQUBE MINI\n3 Prong Detachable Cord\n3 Prong Grounded Detachable Cord Receptacle\nThe POWERQUBE MINI is a revolutionary smart-charging device that can fit into the palm of your hand.  The POWERQUBE MINI is an evolution of the POWERQUBE original, and has been engineered to charge ANY smart device on the market today with our patent pending SP (SmartPower) Technology.  The PQ MINI can charge up to 5 devices at once, via 3 (2.1 AMP) smart USB ports and 2 standard 3-prong AC outlets.\nThe POWERQUBE MINI dimensions are 4 inches (width) X 4 inches (depth) X 1.8 inches (height). \nIn today\u2019s technology driven environment, consumers are using multiple portable electronic devices, often of varying brands. This prompts the need for multiple charging devices of various types, and necessitates tapping into electrical outlets in several different locations within the home or office.  The POWERQUBE MINI solves this dilemma. The product is an innovative solution with novel technology, that allows for the charging of any smart device on the market today.   \nThe sleek design of the POWERQUBE MINI means you don\u2019t have to try to hide it. It is compact enough to fit into the palm of your hand, and can be placed on your desk, nightstand, conference table, kitchen counter, and dorm room desk; anywhere you need power management and USB charging capabilities. At 4\" x 4\" x 1.8\", the PQ MINI can easily fit into your backpack or briefcase. The PQ MINI allows you to charge any three smart devices, including 3 iPads, simultaneously, via any of the three USB ports. With 5 feet of cable and a detachable wall plug, you can easily plug in the PQ MINI behind a desk or piece of furniture, and still put the device directly on your desk, conference table, countertop or nightstand with ease. The charging technology in the PQ MINI is patent pending, and truly is revolutionary to any charging protocol that is available and on the market today. The POWERQUBE MINI SP Technology\u2122 enables each USB port to independently negotiate, \"shake hands\", with each device that plugs into it; allowing for independent charging specific to the device protocol as negotiated and determined by the POWERQUBE MINI; a true smart charger for smart devices.\nOur patent pending SP (Smart Power) Technology\u2122 is a game changer. The POWERQUBE MINI will not \u201cpush\u201d current to the device once it is fully charged. The POWERQUBE MINI USB ports are 2.1 Amps @ 5 volts max each, constant (when asked for by device), and isolated. The AC outlets are 125 Volts/15 Amp.  We have not identified any other device equipped with technology comparable to our SP Technology\u2122, allowing for independent negotiation with each device specific to manufacturer charging specification; other chargers on the market today are not sophisticated enough to have this capability. SP (Smart Power) Technology\u2122 determines the device charging requirements, and also isolates each device from others plugged into the USB ports.   With the POWERQUBE MINI, if you have a faulty device on one of the USB ports (bad phone, shorted charging cord), it will not impact other devices. We have yet to find a device it does not charge, including Chinese mainland brands, and international phones; devices that will not work with most other chargers sold in the U.S. today.\nThe funds from the POWERQUBE MINI will be used for the following:\nEnhance Research and Development efforts; increase efficiency and time to market for pipeline products\nBuild tooling and molds needed to bring the PQ MINI to market\nIncrease manufacturing capabilities\nBuild global distribution platform \nWe have developed a sustainable and long-term relationship with our manufacturer partner Apollo Wire and Cable in Dongguan China.  Apollo is ISO 9001, ISO 9002, and ISO 14001 Certified and is a top-tier manufacturer sought out by many US Companies.  We are fortunate to have a strong relationship with such a strong organization:  www.apolloelectrical.com.cn \nApollo lobby in Dongguan, China\nBoard and Power Supply Manufacturing\nOur fulfillment will be completed in house, as we want to have total control of customer service and delivery of our product.  POWERQUBE MINI rewards will be shipped out of our warehouse in Indianapolis, Indiana; a strategic central location for shipping within the United States.\nWe believe in delivering innovative products that meet true unmet needs in your daily life.  The POWERQUBE MINI was developed out of feedback from the Kickstarter community, and we are thrilled to introduce the revolutionary product to Kickstarter.

Become a Universal Geologic Explorer and discover or invent new things; or explore new places around the universe no one has ever seen before.  \nSimply select a pledge level to the right to support our project, and continue reading to learn more about the game!\n Introduction to the story line\u2026.. In 2040, after more than 10 years of exploration and research on Mars, an accident resulted in a significant discovery that forever changed life as we knew it. A research scientist was collecting samples of an unknown substance when the unsealed collection tube slipped from her glove and fell to the dusty surface of the planet. A small cloud of dust puffed around the tube as it hit the ground and suddenly vanished just before the scientist was able to reach it. Amazed and uncertain of what had just occurred, she searched the ground all around her as if she simply lost site of where the tube fell and was mistaken about what she knew in her heart she had seen.\nLater, it would be discovered that the combination of the unknown substance in the collection tube and just the right amount of protactinium contained within the fine dust particles produced a rapid and violent reaction. The Scientist had found the \u201cnew gold\u201d they had been searching for since the beginning of the new millennium. Reminiscent of the American gold rush of 1848, galactic pioneers clamored for an opportunity to strike out in search of new substances of value.\nThe game is played within the futuristic setting of Earth year 2045. While trying to understand the discovery and what occurred in that instant, scientists unlocked the key to space travel. In the years between the discovery in 2040 and the in-game present day in the year 2045, top scientists and engineers from around the world worked feverishly to understand the new things they were learning and develop new ways to exploit them and advance our way of life. A few of the significant developments during this short period of time resulted in the discovery of a new, completely unknown planet now called Aznon; and the ability to send space vehicles there full of supplies and people. These new capabilities opened the door to what is being referred to as the \u201cAznonium Rush\u201d, to which players will join in search of adventure, fame and fortune!\nPlayers will play a single specific character (themselves) within a broader, futuristic, science fiction storyline derived from a Christian worldview without all of the language and excessive violence of other games so younger children can explore and begin building the life skills required to be successful in tomorrows digital age. The storyline will drive the scenarios you respond to within the game. Play independently and build your own entrepreneurial empire or build a team and achieve your goals together!  You can become a Geologic Explorer, or work towards becoming a business owner in manufacturing or retail sales. \n\u2022 The game will have a rich and imaginative setting with beautifully unique features, never seen before environments that will make you want to play the game just to wander through them.\n\u2022 Excavate your contracted grid of land searching for substances, minerals, metals and precious gems of value. Discover something previously unknown and increase your wealth and character value. In your efforts, you may discover an underground system of caves, caverns, or who knows what! Stake a claim on it and reap the benefits of the discovery by exploring it yourself, contract someone else to explore it and earn a portion of the profits, or sell the claim to get a guaranteed profit. If exploring yourself be careful!! You never know what you might run into. New substances can be volatile and we don\u2019t yet know if there is any life on this planet\u2026.that\u2019s part of the risk involved and why there is so much potential reward for those daring enough to take part in the adventure. \n\u2022 Explore un-excavatable regions, passes, peaks, caves, caverns, lava tubes and more that may lead to unexpected, but fantastic results.\n\u2022 Take the leap into management and earn a percentage of the discoveries other explorers make when they contract with you, but make sure you manage the business well or your profits will dry up! You can still do your own exploring in addition to managing other explorers contracted through your exploration company.\n\u2022 Risk it all and launch your own corporation! You\u2019ll earn a percentage of the profits made by the work done through all of your franchises. Make sure you hire the right franchise owners, or it may not matter how well you manage the corporation!\n\u2022 Once the land is completely explored and graded back to code, the owner may gain authorization (by the Universe Governing Council) to use the land for another business opportunity, lease it, or sell it to someone else. Buy the property from the owner and develop it to add diversification to your investment empire!\n\u2022 Players will build a knowledge database that may help them during game play, or they may reference and use it to improve their character skills and experience. Knowledge is added to your database throughout the game during each new experience, interaction with another knowledgeable character or by acquiring fully collectable and numbered character profile cards and unlocking various levels of skill, experience and/or knowledge that profile contains.\n\u2022 Enhance your own character profile and improve your character value points by designing and submitting your own creation in the innovation lab. If approved by the Universe Governing Council, you can earn royalties on every sale and/or use of your creation by licensing or selling rights to your patent \u2013 or, open your own business selling your very own creation.\n\u2022 Sell licenses to the use of your own character profile and earn royalties as other players benefit from your knowledge and experience.\n\u2022 Enlist the assistance of others, either real players or invest in a Nanoid. Load a character or equipment profile key and profile into the Nano-cortex of the Nanoid to activate and benefit from its assistance. Bots will be available at different levels of capability to help you achieve your goals!\n\u2022 Successful players will balance the choices they make within the game to maximize their value and health meters. These meters will affect how much energy they expend to achieve their objectives as they explore, discover and grow their empire! Your strategy and your choices will determine your game experience.\n\u2022 Achieve greater levels of success and rewards; unlock new worlds as players achieve new levels of experience, skill and success. The game will evolve with the desires of the players!\nTo combine all of these pieces successfully, I\u2019ll need time to do some pre-production planning with the team. During this first phase, we\u2019ll incorporate all of our new character profiles (from the Backer rewards) into the broader storyline and make sure there are no awkward incorporations to the story. The target is to complete this phase in the first 3 to 4 months.\nPhase 2 \u2013 we\u2019ll strap ourselves in for a 6 to 8 month development cycle with targeted completion by summer 2015! During this time we\u2019ll be heavy into development and provide our backers with sneak-peaks of the private-closed beta version of the game and collect feedback on what you like and don\u2019t like \u2013 so you influence the final result of the game! In addition, we\u2019ll be giving updates and showing you our progress along the way.\nThe final production version will utilize a client game server model, keeping the local processor as free as possible to handle richer graphics and more interaction with other players. It will be optimized for tablet devices running iOS and Android platforms initially.\nTo really do this right and deliver a full-featured, top-notch gaming experience, we need to raise $800,000. That\u2019s a lot of money, but if everyone does something, we\u2019ll be able to reach and exceed this goal! Exceeding the target goal will allow us to shorten our delivery date, expand to more platforms, add more intricate detail, more exploratory quests, more environments, more characters, more complexity to the storyline, more uniqueness to individual game play, build more worlds, and increase interactivity between players.\n $1 Million: Move up the delivery date!! We can add team members and complete the work faster with an estimated delivery date in spring 2015 instead of summer!    \n$1.25 Million: More interactivity between players!  We'll take players ability to interact directly with each other and work together to achieve goals to the next level!  \n$1.50 Million: More uniqueness to individual game play! We will expand the player's ability to utilize their knowledge database and enhance their skills and strategic advantage over other players with lesser knowledge and/or experience.\n$1.75 Million: More unique environments with more intricate detail and more exploratory quests that add challenge and adventure (fame! fortune!) to the gaming experience!\n $2.00 Million: More characters and more complexity to the storyline.

Of the officers and men in both the squadrons that faced each other in these stormy seas far from home, nine of ten were doomed to perish.\u201d\n-- Winston Churchill\nThis autumn marks the centennial of The Great War. Among the most dramatic sagas in a dramatic season was that of the German East Asia Squadron under Rear Adm. Maximillian Graf von Spee. Stranded by the sudden outbreak of war on the other side of the world, Spee\u2019s squadron evaded enemy forces for months. Dispatched the raider Emden to harry British trade in the Indian Ocean and then handed the Royal Navy its first defeat in battle in 99 years off the shore of Chile near Cape Coronel. That devastating defeat sent two British armored cruisers to the depths with their entire crews at trifling cost to Spee\u2019s squadron.\nThe stunning defeat provoked the British into sending two of their new battlecruisers thousands of miles from the European theater to search for and destroy Spee\u2019s squadron. Spee and the British squadron met at The Falklands just five weeks after Coronel. This time it was Spee\u2019s squadron which was annihilated.\nFor a hundred years historians and naval officers have debated Spee\u2019s choices and those of his opponents and speculated about what might have been. Fatal Choices looks at the course of the actual campaign and considers how it might have played out differently. But more than that, Fatal Choices applies the discipline of authentic naval wargames to evaluate those what-ifs under realistic constraints. And it provides the reader with the tools to see for himself how the battles may have played out.\nBy special arrangement with noted author and wargame designer Larry Bond, Fatal Choices contains an extract of Bond\u2019s superbly authentic and comprehensive Fear God & Dread Nought naval wargaming rules providing the reader with all the rules, ship forms and tables needed to refight the historical battles and several credible what-ifs. See ForYourself scenarios examine historical battles such as Coronel and the Cocos Islands, as well as possible alternative fights such as Spee running into the Australian battlecruiser HMAS Australia or the old battleship HMS Canopus. Other scenarios examine what might have happened if the modern armored cruiser HMS Defense had joined the British squadron in time for Coronel or if Spee had a ventured to attack the British ships while they were coaling in Stanley Harbor instead of attempting to flee.\nFatal Choices also includes another entire set of rules, an extract of Minden Game\u2019s NavTac fast-play naval wargaming rules for those readers who are new to naval wargaming or pressed for time.\nThe Kickstarter edition of Fatal Choices also includes a special set of laser-cut ship counters including all the ships mentioned in the scenarios as well as play aids.\nHow KickStarter Works: If we don't make our goal by our deadline, your credit card doesn't get charged and we get zip, zilch, nada!\nSo: If you want to help Fatal Choices get published, please support us today!\nThanks!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are few risks aside from the kinds of delays that life can unexpectedly present.

But making a living raiding other starships is a hard life, and Jon must navigate this group of rogues and misfits in hopes of turning them into a legitimate far-trader business. Together, this band of unlikely allies must dodge competing pirates, navigate labyrinthian Imperial procedures, and the dangers of the empire\u2019s border sector. Once they do, then maybe Jon can turn a profit and finally get a passage ticket back home.\nOr maybe he might discover something more important than money out there in the frontier.\nStarring: Samantha Swords, Brian Lewis, John Wells, Kristin Pelletier, Alexandra Whitman, Jenny Simmons, Sawyer Krause & Jessica Russo.\nProducer: Ken Whitman\nExecutive Producer: Marc Miller\nStudio: d20 Entertainment\n\"Traveller\" is the grandaddy of all science fiction role-playing games, first published in 1977 by Game Designers' Workshop and subsequent editions by various companies remaining in print to this day. It is estimated that over 9 million people have played Traveller in its 35 year existence.  Characters in the game typically journey between various star systems and engage in activities such as exploration, ground and space battles, and interstellar trading. \nWe are d20 Entertainment (d20E), creators of the Brothers Barbarian Web Series (in its second season.) Our production company, located in Brandenburg Kentucky, is currently crafting a variety of entertainments specializing in niche markets. The KODT Live Action Series (our previous Kickstarter) is the first of several we are generating for the geek culture.\nPLAY\n\n Meet Ken Whitman\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nSpinward Traveller is classic science-fiction; a compelling story of misfits and heroes struggling to survive in the vast sea of stars that is the Traveller role-playing game universe. Based on Marc Miller\u2019s award-winning RPG Traveller, our story captures the essence of role-playing; of characters who have to work together in order to succeed. We wanted to stay true to Marc Miller\u2019s vision of the far future, and we have recruited cast and crew who are passionate about the Traveller RPG and getting the story atmosphere right. Making any show is expensive; making sci-fi is doubly so. We\u2019ll have hundreds of people and thousands of person-hours involved just for the 22 minute version.\n\nFunding this project is a monumental undertaking, and this is where you come in. Your support through the Kickstarter process is what allows us to make this happen.\n\nAt our base goal of $30k, we can produce a short theatrical format movie: around 22 minutes long. \nAt $60k, we can double the show length to around 44 minutes (which counts, under the various motion picture definitions, as feature-length).\nAt $90k, we can make this an extended story at around 88 minutes.\nAt $120k, we can make this a truly memorable experience at 96 minutes.\nThere\u2019s more: We have a few stretch goals in mind after we break $90k, but we\u2019re keeping that information under wraps until we get closer to hitting our goals.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: We\u2019re making a science-fiction movie. It has great characters and a great story, but it is also going to have what you expect in a story set in the far future: starships flitting through space, space battles, planets looming in the background, alien landscapes, alien beasts, strange cityscapes, and weird atmospheres.\n The base reward is a 22 minute video. With successful funding, every Backer at $15 or more receives the 22-minute video.  As we reach higher levels of funding, the base reward for backers improves.\nWhen (not IF, when) we reach the $60k goal, not only will you get the 44 minute movie/show, you will get a digital download of the Spinward theme song. If you pledged $30 or more, you will also get a genuine Beowulf Free Trader starship Crew ID card, embossed with (random) crew classification and (random) UPP.\nWhen we reach the $90k goal, not only will you get the 88 minute movie/show, you will get a full-color digital download of the crew characters with images and Traveller RPG stats. If you pledged $60 or more, you will also get a (printed) deck plan of the Beowulf Free Trader starship deck plan AND the secret appendix detailing the differences between the video\u2019s ship and the standard starship.\nWhen we reach the $120k goal, not only will you get the 96 minute movie/show, you will get a 16 page full-color digital download comic starring the Beowulf crew on an adventure in the Spinward Marches in Traveller universe.\n Below is a list of movie props that you can add to your Traveller reward/war chest. E-mail us here on Kickstarter and let us know what you are willing to pay for the prop.  However, other backers may outbid you. We will stop all bids at 10pm EST on July 15th.  You will simply add the winning value to your original pledge. (Note: all props will come with a Letter of Authenticity)\nSlug Thrower used by a Tam (resin) \n$70---- Keith Watt\nAslan facial mask and ears $50---- John runyan\nCaptain's Cutlass  $70---- Robert Stagmier\nMika's Sword  $55---- Christina Shirley\nDoctor's Medical scanner (resin) $50---- Lucas Amodio\nJon's Wristwatch  $50---- Lucas Amodio \nAndroid's Contacts (new-not used) $?---- Your name here!\nIf there are any other props you may be interested in, just ask!

We had surprising success with our first Kickstarter project and as such are back with more beautiful images ready to be printed and delivered to your gaming table.  All of our mats will be printed on 14 oz block out vinyl for durability and ease of storage.  The vinyl material we use has a texture to it which assists in preventing slippage of models during game play and also has very little \"memory\" to it so there is a lesser chance of the mat curling during use (especially if rolled and stored with the image side out). \nDS'tone Art mats in use at X-wing store championships\nWe will be offering two sizes of mats: 3' x 3' and 4' x 6'.  Each size has different images from which backers can choose.  We are starting with a funding amount of $1000 again this time as that is the minimum amount needed in order to cover the expenses associated with the printing of the mats, packing, shipping and the associated project fees. \nWe have some exciting options available in Wave 2 of DS'tone Art's space game mats, especially considering the new Epic Play format recently revealed by Fantasy Flight Games for their X-Wing Miniatures game.  Like our first project, we will start off with a fine selection of images to choose from with additional images that will unlock as we reach our stretch goals.\nOur first image is unique in that it is actually a 6' x 6' image that has been divided into four 3' x 3' quadrants.   These images will be perfect for use in Epic Play but will allow flexibility in that a player can use one in a regular game or join two of them together to form a continuous image on a 3' x 6' play area.  Each quadrant of the image is available for purchase separately so in actuality this image makes available four different mats from which to choose.\nChristmas Tree Nebula (1-4)\nWe also will start off with two other images sized for a 3' x 3' play area: the Lunar Eclipse and Sadr with Butterfly Nebula:\nLunar Eclipse\nSadr with the Butterfly Nebula\nFor those wanting a mat to cover their full gaming table, we are offering two 4' x 6' choices: the Orion Nebula widefield and M81 & M82:\nOrion Nebula Widefield\nGalaxies M81 & M82\nPlease note: Due to the USPS's restrictions on package dimensions, we are only offering our 4' x 6' mats to backers within the USA.  US backers can add a 4' x 6' mat to any 3' x 3' reward level by adding $70.00 to their pledge.\nOnce we reach our initial funding goal, we will move forward to unlock the following 3' x 3' images as options for backers.\nStretch Goal #1 ($2000) reached!  The California Nebula image is unlocked!\nCalifornia Nebula\nStretch Goal #2 ($3000) reached!  The Whirlpool Galaxy image is unlocked!:\nWhirlpool Galaxy\nStretch Goal #3 ($4000) reached!  The Elephant Trunk Nebula widefield image is unlocked!\nElephant Trunk Nebula (widefield)\nStretch Goal #4 ($5000) reached!  The Orion Nebula image is unlocked!\nOrion Nebula\nNEW STRETCH GOALS!!\nDuring our first Kickstarter, we offered a special additional reward: a picture of the Comet ISON printed on adhesive-backed vinyl. Tim and I went through his images last night and mocked up some prototypes to see how they would work out.  These are just printouts on glossy photo paper but the final product will be printed on adhesive-backed vinyl just like the comet.  \nWe're going to add to our \"Space Terrain\" offerings with THREE Stretch Goals:\nStretch Goal #5 ($8000) unlocked!!  We will add a 4\" Space Terrain element to the rewards of every backer at Redshirt Level and above!!\n4\" \"Temporal Fluctuation\" (prototype)\nStretch Goal #6: At $12,000, we will add an additional 4\" Space Terrain element to the rewards of every backer at Redshirt Level and above.\n4\" \"Subspace Tear\" (prototype)\nStretch Goal #7 - At $15,000, we will also add a 6\" Space Terrain element to the rewards of every backer at Redshirt Level and above.\n6\" \"Quantum Anomaly\" (prototype)\nEPIC PLAY UPDATE!\nDue to numerous inquiries for additional choices for Epic Play sized mats, Tim has cropped and reprocessed a few of the images.  Backers interested in Epic Play mats should know they take the place of 2 3x3 mats in your rewards.  We will be offering TILED and UNTILED mats.  \nAt the end of the Kickstarter, we will send out the survey to confirm your choices.  Those that want a continuous mat should respond to the survey that they want thier Epic Play mat UNTILED.  This will notify us that you do not want two mats that fit together. \nThe Christmas Tree Nebula is still a choice but we're proud to offer the following now as well:\nM81 and M82 (Epic Play - 3x6)\nOrion Nebula (Epic Play - 3x6) UNTILED ONLY!!\n Due to the layout of the Orion Nebula, we will only be offering it in an UNTILED format.

We have taken feedback from backers and have perfected our shipping and pack out model to ensure the mats will arrive in great shape and be ready for use right out of the tube.\n\nWe also are acutely aware that International Shipping is expensive. In order to accommodate as many backers as possible, we are only able to offer individuals outside of the USA the ability to back at the 3' x 3' levels. This is due to the fact that the US Postal Service has restrictions an shipping packages over 42\" to some countries. \n\nWe are also concerned that International Shipping to some countries is less expensive than others, namely Canada. As such, Canadian backers will receive a bonus mat due to the difference in actual shipping cost charged via Kickstarter as opposed to the actual postage expense we will incur.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #10", "update_userinfo": "Turn From The Stars and Set Your Sights On Earth", "update_content": "We would like to let everyone know we are launching a new project focusing on planetary environments for our next outing.

With its 200ft (60m) detection range and loud alarm, iFind will never let you down.\nThe iFind tag is ready to use in just two steps. First, place your iOS or Android device next to an iFind tag and open the iFind App for automatic pairing. Next, attach the iFind tag to anything you want to track. You can also assign a unique ID to each tag and pass it to anyone who may then locate that tag for you.\nWhat if you cannot find your phone? That\u2019s easy with iFind: you can locate your phone by shaking any of your iFind tags \u2014 No more frustration.\nAfter having dinner with your friends you get a notification on your phone. The iFind app tells you that your keys have gone out of range; they had fallen out of your pocket when you were in the restaurant. Without this Rope function, you would have gotten all of the way home before noticing that they were missing.\nHave you ever been desperately looking for your wallet in a large building or party? Even with iFind's impressive 200ft range and loud beep, it could still take hours to find it by yourself. Thankfully, the iFind App has the UHelp function to let you team up with friends. Share your wallet\u2019s tag ID, and your friends can use their own phones to quickly find your wallet.\nThe iFind tag is environmentally friendly as it uses no batteries and is made of a biocompatible plastic. You, your pets and your surroundings are completely safe with iFind tags.\nOur team spent almost three years in the research and over a year in development of iFind including design and market analysis.

You'll naturally sit up straighter, hunch less, and it's a lot more comfortable through the day. \nIf you've looked for a stand, you may have felt our frustration - cheap construction, distracting aesthetics, and they take up a lot of desk space.\nSo we designed our own. Strong unibody construction, seamless design, precision CNC milled, beautiful finish, hidden storage, ultra-secure, minimal, smallest footprint, gorgeous on a desk.\nSeamless. We'll use a 90 million pound press, one of the biggest in North America, to extrude its profile. Tesla uses it to make structures for the Model S.\nSmallest footprint. Elevation Stand takes up less space than any other stand.\nMinimal. No screws or parting lines. It's thick-walled and continuous.\nHides desk clutter. Store your hard drive, USB hub, cables, Field Notes, etc. - out of view with easy access. A chamfered hole in the back lets you run cords straight through.\nMore comfortable. With Elevation Stand raising your monitor 66mm, you'll naturally sit up straighter, shoulders back, and lean over less.\nMade the hard way.  Elevation Stand is made with the same expensive processes Apple uses to make their monitor legs. And they look perfect together. \nGorgeous 20-step finish. Every stand will get glass bead blasted, acid etched, electro-chemically polished, and deep anodized. It's the same finish we apply to Elevation Dock and Apple puts on Macbook Pros.\nExtra Secure. Using our NanoPad\u2122 material, Elevation Stand locks to your monitor with thousands of microscopic air vacuums. It's strong enough to prevent your Mac from getting knocked off, yet easy to peel off.\nPerfect next to a raised laptop.  It's more ergonomic and it brings the base of the screens to the same level. \nExcellent with iMac. They were designed for each other.\nGreat for standing desks. Stand tall - no compensating with a high typing height or bending your neck down. \nMatteBlack finish. A subtle, stealth finish that will reflect little light. Its deeply bead-blasted with a mil-spec finish and looks very cool with monitor on top.\nSpecial Edition Red. Put some fire under your Mac with this Limited Edition finish. Its beautifully textured and bright color anodized. Looks really beautiful paired with a Mac.\nCraftsmanship. This video can give you a taste of the care we put into manufacturing our last project Elevation Dock for iPhone. Made by us in Portland & shipped around the world.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAnd a little bonus: Let's end headphone clutter.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIntroducing Elevation Anchor. Keep your headphones out of sight & easy to reach. You'll get two when you back the project. It's made of solid medical-grade silicone, so it won't hurt if you bump it with your knee and will flex before you can knocked it off. Mounts anywhere under your desk with the same 3M adhesive GoPro uses. Great for hiding your headphones in the living room too. (Watch the super short vid below.)\nProduction Schedule. In June, we'll start building Elevation Stand's 4-part steel extrusion tooling, make fixtures for machining, build custom titanium racks for anodizing, and order tooling for the feet. July, we will extrude the aluminum, begin CNC machining, and order packaging. August, we will continue machining and begin the finishing processes of glass bead blasting, anodizing, and lasering. In August we will start QC and final assembly at our shop in Portland. And start shipping in September.\nSo that's ElevationStand: Apple-level quality, design that gets out of the way, and an investment in your posture. \nThank you.

However, when you want to add files from your USB thumb, or transfer photos, or other day to day uses for a USB port - accessing them in the back can be a hassle! \nThe iMacompanion solves that problem by giving you access to a front USB port while preserving the design of the iMac. \nThe iMacompanion is a USB 2.0 (USB 3.0 is a Stretch Goal) extension made out of sandblasted and anodized aluminum to seamlessly integrate itself at the foot of the iMac. Thanks to the ultra-slim cable (0.01 inch/0.25 mm) that passes under the foot of the iMac, it will keep your desktop cable free.\nTo install, simply remove the protective layer of the sticky tape below the iMacompanion, stick it on the tip of the foot, and pass the cable under the iMac. The cable will be completely invisible from the front. \nThanks to its unique design, the iMacompanion is fully compatible with all iMacs ranging from 2004 until Today! It also works with both the 21.5 inch and the 27 inch versions and it is very likely that it will be compatible with future iMacs. \nThe iMacompanion is also compatible with Apple's Cinema Display screens and other brands of screens with hard to reach USB ports in the back.

To control your uArm wirelessly as well as having the opportunity to be the first to play with our smart phone apps, you can back us with an additional $30 and send us an email to feedback@ufactory.cc \nSee more details about the Bluetooth here.\nThe Story\nWhen hearing the word \u201crobot\u201d, most of us may think of the giant industrial robot arms. They can precisely install the components at a very high speed, or handle many complex, even dangerous tasks. \nRobots are awesome, and wouldn\u2019t it be nice if everybody who wants a robot arm can actually afford one? After all, $50,000 is kind of a lot of money. This is when we, the UFactory come in. UFactory stands for \u201cYour Factory\u201d. We build various robotics products to make robots more accessible for everyone! That\u2019s why we started the uArm project - a desktop miniature robot arm.\nPhoto: ABB\nThe Robot \nWhat is uArm?\nuArm is a 4-axis parallel-mechanism robot arm, inspired by the ABB PalletPack industrial robot arm IRB460. \nIt is made up of laser cut acrylic or wood parts, powered by standard RC hobby servos, and controlled by an Arduino-compatible board. In parallel-mechanism robot arm, most of the masses concentrate on the base, making the robot much more stable and allows the upper Arm to react really fast.\nAbove are some of the prototypes we had so far.\nWhat can you do with uArm?\nWell, in two words: COOL Things!!!\nOnce you got your uArm, you can immediately customize it with your own components. For example:\nYou can add a LED to make a computer-controlled desk lamp!\nOr install it on the arm on a mobile robot chassis base and move it around.\nOr play music!\nOr help you to send business card!\nOr make a small assembly line at your desk!\nOr program it to do your homework!\nOK, probably not doing your homework. But the possibilities are infinite; there are many more fun applications that can be done by using your uArm kit. And as you try to make it work, you will learn a lot about robotics and coding.\nThe uArm can also be a great gift to get people interested in Robotics. Since it could be easily controlled with a smartphone, people with no programming background can also enjoy the fun of robotics.\nAfter all, even if you don\u2019t plan to do anything with it, a desktop robot arm will be a WONDERFUL decoration!\nHow do I use it?\nRight now we have already developed a Windows application that allows the uArm to be controlled with keyboard or mouse. \nA serial communication program that uses Processing to create a host computer program that displays simple OpenGL object to show the orientation of the controls and reads keyborad event then sends command to the uArm.\nUsing mouse to control uArm to play Cup Stacking via serial.\nWith some basic controlling skills, you can use basically any input device to control it, for example, we have also used other remote controller to control the arm. With our imbedded inverse-kinematics algorithm, the uArm can be precisely controlled using coordinates. \nWe are currently working with the Android and IOS apps as well, so you can control the uArm via Bluetooth as well. \nWe have also written an Arduino library specifically for controlling the uArm. So if you are familiar with Arduino, you can program it directly with Arduino IDE. By calling different functions, you can easily move uArm to your desired position without doing tons of hard math.\nUPDATE: We have just sketched out a new function for the uArm which allows you to simply dragging it around as the uArm records the critical coordinates for later playback! With this function, you can now TEACH the uArm to accomplish simple tasks without writing a single line of code, or even connecting to your computer\uff01\nFurther Details:\nThe basic design is Arduino-controlled with 4 degrees of freedom. Three servos on the base control the main movement of the arm and the mini servo on the top moves and rotates the object. The end-effector of the arm is always kept parallel to the ground.\nWe also made some other designs of the end-effector for applications and extensions.\nMechanical Parts:\nThe structure of the arm is made up of laser cut acrylic or wood parts.\nIn addition to some screws, nuts and brass stand-offs, we also provide some flanged bearings, one large bearing, and 4 suction cups for you to complete the assembly of the arm.\nBy adding the bearings the arm can work smoothly and stable.\nThese parts, along with the servos, allow you to build the arm and a gripper end-effector.\nElectronic Parts:\nThe micro-controller is an Arduino compatible board. And we also develop a shield for Arduino to drive the vacuum pump and the servos. In additional, the power supply board will be on the shield, too.\nThe electronic parts of the Basic uArm consist of 3 standard servos, 1 micro servo, 1 Arduino-compatible board, 1 uArm shield, 1 USB cable and 1 wall adapter power supply.\nThe electronic parts for the gripper end-effector consist of 1 micro servo.\nThe electronic parts for the suction cup end-effector consist of 1 small vacuum pump and 1 solenoid valve.\nThe electronic parts for EARLY BIRD & Gripper Kit\uff1a\nThe electronic parts for Suction Cup Kit\uff1a\nThe electronic parts for Replaceable Kit, Custom Message Engraved Kit, Complete Assembled Kit & Advanced Kit:\nMounting:\nThe uArm comes standard with 4 suction cups for the base of the arm, to allow you to mount the arm on any smooth horizontal surface, such as a smooth desktop or floor.\nYou can also install the arm on a mobile robot chassis base and move it around.\nuArm Work Envelope (working range of the arm):\nWhat is the payload weight capacity for uArm?\nIn our informal testing, we have found that the uArm can easily lift and move a regular can of soda. \nMore testing will be carried out later and more accurate data will be specified.\nOpen source!!!\nuArm will be completely open-sourced after the Kickstarter campaign completes! We will use the time in between to optimize our design and make it the best it can be. We are a company, yes, but we are also a group of robot maniacs. We want to share our joy with the rest of the world and make more people realize how fun robotics can be! All of the design files, hardware and software will be released in May, 2014. So you can build your own arm using a laser cutter, then add you own controller and servos to it. \nEven if this project fails, we will still release all the files online. If this project succeeds, though, we will be able to launch more open source robotics kits and mechanical platforms! Cheers!\nHow to assemble uArm?\nWe will offer a full step-by-step tutorial describing how to assemble uArm after we finish the finial design. Now we have a simple Assembly Diagram for the current version.\nEvolution of uArm\nMechanical Parts:\nThe major revisions of the mechanical parts are on the thickness of the Acrylic parts and the base of the arm.\nWe changed the thickness from 3mm to 5mm.\nWe have made an electronic module holder for the electronic parts and also made a case for the vacuum pump and solenoid valve in the latest version.\nWe have made 3 versions of the base of the arm so far. In the first version, the mounting is not convenient. So in the second version, we added 4 suction cups on the base and you can also use screws and nuts for mounting. In the third version, we added a bearing on the base, so the arm can move smoothly and stable.\nElectronic Parts:\nWith electronic parts, we have made 5 versions so far. In the latest version, we make a shield of Arduino for the arm to drive the vacuum pump and the servos. In additional, the power supply board will be on the shield, too. The micro-controller in the final version is still an Arduino compatible board.\nThe first version: A micro-controller board, a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\n The second version: A micro-controller board (Arduino Leonardo), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\n The third version:A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\n The fourth version: A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), a motor driver, a power supply board, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\nThe fifth version:A micro-controller board (Arduino UNO), an uArm shield, a vacuum pump and a solenoid valve.\nThe latest version we have made so far:\nWhy we need you  \nWe are robot maniacs with the goal of making robotics kits more accessible to the public and we want to help more people to see the beauty of robotics!\nuArm is our first developed platform. We now have several prototypes, but they can still be made better. Currently the uArm can\u2019t perform super accurate motion due to our tight budget; also if we can injection mold some of the parts, the assembly process can be greatly simplified; We are also planning to design and build the next version of the arm. It will be stepper-motor driven with metal frames thus it will be more accurate. And we will add remote control function on PC, Mac and Smart Phones as well. Furthermore, if we can get gather enough public attention, we can corporate with big companies to send these robot arms to schools, and give children access to robots!\nWe are eager to make the uArm better, cheaper and easily accessible. so more people can enjoy the fun of robotics. And all of these cannot be done without your support!\nRewards\nAs rewards, we will offer the parts or a complete kit to build your own uArm from acrylic or wood. Only Complete Assembled Kit and Advanced Kit are assembled.

It's easy for anyone to use, and it works on iOS, Android and Windows platforms. Use it with a variety of highly-rated apps that enable you to connect with your car like never before. OBDLink MX WiFi is like a swiss army knife for your car!\nDon\u2019t let its modest looks fool you: it is absolutely the awesomest device of its kind, for the following reasons:\nDozens of compatible apps, and more added all the time!\nIntelligent sleep mode: plug it in, and forget about it -- it won't drain your car's battery\nLightning-fast performance, MX WiFi runs circles around the competition\nEasy setup. Yes, even a caveman can do it.\nUncompromising quality, backed by the best warranty in the industry\nFirmware updates. Update MX WiFi with newly developed features.\nOBDLink MX WiFi's functionality is limited only by the imagination of the programmers that write the apps. Apps that exist on the market today, can be used to:\nImprove your gas mileage\nRemote start your car (on select vehicles)\nCreate a digital dashboard or a heads-up display\nBuy a used car with confidence\nLock/unlock doors (on select vehicles)\nClear the \u2018Check Engine\u2019 light, and investigate its cause\nMake your phone go \u201cVroom! Vroom!\u201d, in sync with the gas pedal\nImpress your friends, family, and significant others\nWhen you're checking out a used car, use OBDLink MX WiFi to see if the Check Engine light has recently been cleared, and see if any new trouble codes are pending.\nThe obdCANex app uses MX's advanced network support,.enabling you to control door locks and remotely start the engine on select GM vehicles.\nUse OBDLink MX with the Dash app and unlock enhanced performance, cost savings, and social driving.\nSadly, MX WiFi is not in production yet, and we only shipped a dozen of prototypes to our most trusted beta testers. However, to give you a taste of what to expect, here is what real people posted on Amazon after trying out its cousin, the OBDLink MX Bluetooth:\n\u201cThe greatest thing since sliced bread! ... This is SLICK!\u201d\n\u201cMy favorite feature by far is the auto shutoff, and this adapter is the only one I'm aware of which has it. I leave it plugged in 24/7 in my car and it automatically shuts off after I turn off the car, and comes right back on when I start the engine.\"\n\u201cThis adapter has the fastest response times and supports the largest amount of data out of any of the OBD/Bluetooth adapters. If you're using a program like Torque, you'll want the extra data capacity/speed, as each gauge you add to Torque uses more bandwidth.\u201d\n\u201cDevice worked great and paired with my windows laptop and android phone with no issues. I leave it plugged in all the time and have not had any battery drain issues.\u201d\n\u201cI've used cheapo adapters before, but this one blows them out of the water. This one from Scan Tool provides information at (according to my Torque) at around 40-50 PIDs/second, at least five times that of the old adapter.\u201d\n\u201cAfter reading through a roller coaster of reviews of the Chinese knock offs, I went with the most expensive option but I think I made the right decision. This thing reads PIDs at blazing speeds, it is claimed to be the fastest on the market and I believe it. I never have to worry about a dead battery because it automatically shuts off when the OBD signal stops. It took about 10 seconds to set up on my EVO 4g.\u201d\n\u201cThis is an excellent tool that I am very pleased with. It is fast, accurate, and very useful. It is faster and easier to use than the high dollar scan tools we have in the shop! For about $150, I grab it before the shop one ($2000)! That one is left on the bench!\u201d\n \u201cThis has saved me lots of money and worry. I run a small car lot where I do most everything. Being able to know what\u2019s going on with a car before I buy it is priceless. And knowing what my mechanic told me was true or not keeps him honest.\u201d\n\u201cOBD\u201d stands for \u201cOn-Board Diagnostics\u201d, a network of small rugged computers that control everything in a modern vehicle, from engine and transmission, to anti-lock brakes and climate control. You are likely familiar with one element of the OBD system, the \u201cCheck Engine\u201d light. Another element of the system, the OBD port, allows you to access the network for troubleshooting or other purposes.\nOBDLink MX WiFi is a pocket-sized, wireless device that enables you to access the data available on the OBD network with your smart phone, tablet, or PC. The device plugs into the standard OBD port found in all modern vehicles, and requires no tools to install.\n  The average installation time is 3 minutes, including the OBDLink app download. You can safely leave it plugged in: the unique BatterySaver technology will automatically put the device to sleep. Once you plug it in, MX will appear in the list of available networks as a secure WiFi Access Point.\nThe OBD port is standard on all 1996 and newer vehicles sold in the USA. Manufacturers typically locate the OBD port in the area below the dash, as shown.\nMX supports all legislated OBD-II protocols, plus advanced Ford & GM vehicle networks (Ford MSC and GMLAN). It works with all 1996 & newer cars and light trucks sold in the United States, and also supports EOBD, JOBD, and all other international variants of OBD-II.\nWith OBDLink MX Wifi, you can use your phone or tablet as a diagnostic scan tool, trip computer, heads-up display, and even as a remote control (on select vehicles).\n\n  Create custom digital dashboards\nMeasure and display fuel economy\nDisplay, graph, and log 90+ real-time parameters\nTurn off the \u2018Check Engine\u2019 light\nRead and erase stored, pending, and permanent trouble codes (both generic and manufacturer-specific)\nAccess freeze frame information\nYou'll also get our OBDwiz software, which offers the same functionality on Windows computers.\n  Compatible third party apps offer you a wide assortment of awesome functionality, including:\nControlling windows and door locks on newer GM vehicles\nDisplaying auxiliary gauges on Google Glass\nImproving driving habits, saving money on gas, and remembering where you parked\nAnd of course, making your Honda sound like a Ferrari\nMost WiFi-enabled OBD adapters only work in so-called \u201cAd Hoc\u201d mode. With Ad-Hoc, you have to manually configure your IP settings every time you want to connect to the adapter. To make matters worse, Android users have to root their phone for Ad-Hoc adapters to work.\nOBDLink MX WiFi dispenses with the Ad Hoc mode altogether, and provides you with 3 useful modes:\nAP (Server) mode\nInfrastructure (Client) mode\nWeb Configuration\nJust select 'OBDLink MX' from the list of available WiFi networks, and enter the supplied unique passphrase. Your phone can still use 3G/4G for Internet connectivity.\nIn infrastructure mode, MX connects to an existing WiFi network. The pairing process is simple: push the WPS button on the router, then press MX\u2019s multi-function button. MX broadcasts its presence on the network, allowing compatible apps to automatically\nOBDLink MX WiFi has a built-in web interface for editing connection settings from your phone, tablet, or PC.\nProven Technology\nOBDLink MX WiFi is based on the hugely successful OBDLink MX Bluetooth, launched in 2011. It has overvoltage protection, doesn\u2019t get hot, and reliably connects to all OBD-II compliant vehicles.\n\nUnmatched Software Support\nIn addition to the included OBDLink apps and OBDwiz software, OBDLink MX WiFi will work, out-of-the-box, with dozens of existing third-party applications, across multiple mobile and desktop platforms.\n\nOpen Architecture\nWe don\u2019t use a proprietary protocol in an effort to create a closed ecosystem. In fact, we published the programming manual and designed an inexpensive OBD simulator to promote the creation of new apps. If you\u2019re interested in developing OBD applications, contact us for help getting started.\n\nPrivacy\nLast year saw the launch of a number of OBD adapters that have a cellular radio, and save user data in the cloud as part of their normal operation. We encourage you to read their user agreements before you sign up. As for our part, we promise that when you use OBDLink MX WiFi, your data will not be analyzed, used for surveillance/tracking, or sold to advertising and insurance companies. And since the data isn\u2019t automatically saved, hackers won\u2019t be able to get at it, either. With OBDLink MX, you truly have full control over your information.\n\nNo Monthly Fees\nThere\u2019s no data plan, no subscription fees, and no hidden costs.\n\nSuperior Design\nYou don't have to look hard to find cheap wireless OBD adapters of all shapes and sizes. The vast majority of them are clones of our hugely popular, but by now largely obsolete ElmScan 5 ELM327-based design. Besides getting hot and sometimes catching on fire due to questionable workmanship, these clones have a number of inherent design flaws: excessive car battery drain, lack of security, difficulty establishing and maintaining a connection, complicated setup, and disappointing data performance. OBDLink MX has been designed from the ground up to address these shortcomings.\n\n\nUNLOCKED! Thank you for your incredible support!\n  OBDLink MX supports all model year 1996+ cars and light trucks sold in the United States, as well as vehicles based on EOBD (Europe), JOBD (Japan), and all other international variants of OBD-II.\nOBDLink MX WiFi is compatible with vehicles in the above countries. For imports, compatibility is determined by the country of origin. All-electric vehicles are not required to be compliant with OBD, but hybrids are.\nOBDLink MX WiFi can work with any WiFi-enabled smart phone, tablet, or PC. Officially supported platforms (this means, we verified that MX WiFi works with apps running under these operating systems) include:\niOS (iPhone, iPad & iPod Touch)\nAndroid phones & tablets\nWindows Phone\nWindows 2000 and later PCs\nGiven MX\u2019s open architecture and strict adherence to the 802.11 standard, we anticipate apps to be developed for other platforms as well. In fact, compatible third party applications are already popping up for several other platforms, including Blackberry and Linux.\nOBDLink MX works with Android, iOS, & Windows operating systems. Use it with any WiFi-enabled phone, tablet, or laptop.\n\nYou'll have lots of app and software options, as OBDLink MX is backwards-compatible with the popular ELM327 command set.

Jason earned his degree in Electronic Engineering Technology from DeVry University.\nIt\u2019s been a long journey, but we are nearing the finish line: the prototypes are meeting our expectations, and as soon as the remaining WiFi glitches are fixed, we will be ready to begin production. All we need, is one last push. Your pledges will be used to cover the cost of manufacturing the first batch of OBDLink MX WiFi\u2019s.\nDon\u2019t wait to make your pledge: we are practically giving away the first 100 units, and once they\u2019re gone, they\u2019re gone. Please support us by sharing this Kickstarter with your friends, and making a pledge, TODAY!\n Video by First Launch Productions", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe spent the last year field-testing and debugging OBDLink MX WiFi, and very few risks remain:\n\n* WiFi module firmware. While testing the prototypes, engineers discovered several elusive glitches that may negatively affect user experience. The engineers created a suite of automated tests, and are working with the vendor on tracking down the remaining bugs. If worst comes to worst, our contingency plan calls for implementing workarounds in the driver code.\n\n* New assembly-line tester. Using lessons learned from the previous generation testers, we designed a new tester to drastically reduce the time necessary to test each unit, and provide more details about the failures, which will enable the production manager to quickly identify and correct manufacturing problems. There is a small chance that it may not be ready in time for production, forcing the factory to fall back to using the slower old testers.\n\n* Unforeseen manufacturing difficulties. Over our 12 years in business, we\u2019ve seen projects get delayed for all sorts of reasons: from being unable to buy a particular transistor, to floods that keep delivery trucks from reaching the factory. To minimize this risk, we followed a stringent, proven pre-production checklist. Barring natural disasters, there should not be any delays due to manufacturing.\n\nOBDLink MX WiFi was designed by the same team of engineers that designed the hugely successful OBDLink MX Bluetooth, and will be manufactured at the same facility. The two devices have comparable complexity, and share many design concepts.\n\nThe STN11xx codebase that is at the heart of MX, has been road-tested on over 100,000 vehicles of every imaginable make and model, in every part of the world -- from Africa to Alaska.

His discovery is a gateway into entire new world of possibilities: developing a fuelless electric generator and designing a new type of propulsion engine capable to fly a spacecraft without burning a fuel. Electrogravitic technology will lead to a new industrial revolution and extensive space exploration. Below are some details of Brown's discovery.\nThomas Townsend Brown invented Electrokinetic Apparatus known as Gravitator (US Patent # 2,949,550 issued in 1960) and performed experimental researches on it. He observed the following effects what became a foundation of the new electrogravitic technology:\n\u00b7 Mr. Brown discovered appearing of directional electrogravitic force in a direction from negative to positive charges of the Gravitator.\n \u00b7 The power of the electrogravitic force was in proportion of the amount of voltage applied to the Gravitator.\n\u00b7 He observed that electrogravitics force is reactionless when producing its forward thrust in a direction of positive charges and suggested that this electrogravitics force phenomenon violates Newton\u2019s third law of motion \u2013 that every action should produce an equal and opposite reaction.\nThere is no any acceptable scientific explanation of this energy conversion phenomenon at present time.\nGravitator is a very important project. Gravitator's model is demonstrating the working principles of the electrogravitic technology what could be used to build a household fuelless electric generator. Gravitator's working model is the first step in a process of building a household fuelless electric generator (please go to www.ferl.us for details). By supporting Gravitator project you could actually make it happened. When we are pumping oil and gas from the ground we are acting like someone who is seating on the tree's branch and trying to cut off that same branch: someday the ground may fall down. Humanity needs free energy to survive. We don't know how match time we have so please show your support and do what you can! Below is the artistic concept drawing of FEG Fuelles Electric Generator. I'm giving it away as part of the project's rewards.\nConcept Drawing of FEG Fuelles Electric Generator by Andrei Ralko.

Brown's US Patent # 2,949,550 and using the model to demonstrate Brown's discovery of the electrogravitic force phenomenon: the directional electrogravitic force (directional gravitational force) could be created and controlled.\nThe project's duration is about 15 weeks and it has 3 phases:\nProject's phase 1. Duration: 13 weeks. Purchasing all required materials, supplies, equipment and manufacturing all required Gravitator's parts. Assembling the Gravitator from the parts and performing working test on it. Completing building of the working model of T. Brown's Gravitator.\nProject's phase 2. Duration: 1 week. Taking photos and videos of the Gravitator in action.\nProject's phase 3. Duration: 1 week. Uploading project's photo and video materials on to internet and providing web-access for it to all project's supporters.\nFunds will be used to build the working model of T.

A few years ago, I thought it would be amusing to make a special deck of playing cards, with four famous game designers as the four kings. I sold advertisements on the rest of the cards to pay for printing the cards. All the other cards are ads from game companies, game stores, and game conventions. \nThis is an ordinary deck of playing cards. You can use them to play poker or bridge or gin. If you are considering being an advertiser, think about this: most ads are glanced at and thrown away. People will play with these decks often, and most folks keep card decks forever. Your ad will still be here decades from now. Folks who participated in 2008 have had their link on my website now for five years and counting!\nI have done this project four times already - 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011. You can see examples of the cards on my webpage at www.flyingbuffalo.com/pokerdeck.htm - plus you can see how the included free links from my webpage work. The famous game designers honored in the past include Gary Gygax, Dave Arneson, Jim Dunnigan, Redmond Simonsen, Lou Zocchi, Duke Seifried, Tom Shaw, John Hill, Marc Miller, Rich Banner, Frank Chadwick, Loren Wiseman, Don Greenwood, Sid Sackson, Greg Stafford, and Steve Jackson. (If you don't recognize any of these names, you should get the decks and read the descriptions on their cards!) \nIn the past, I just selected the people who I thought were famous enough and who I wanted to honor on a card.  This year I thought I'd let the people who funded the deck (that would be YOU I hope!) decide who gets to be honored. If you spend at least $2 on this project, you get to vote on who is honored. You can vote for any game designer or game artist, male or female (women can be \"kings\" too.)  If the project is successfully funded, when I send out the survey I will ask you to vote. The four folks who get the most votes will be honored, if they agree to it. (If one declines, we will add the fifth vote getter, and so on.)\nThe table-top gaming industry would not be the same without all of these pioneers, and if you consider yourself a gamer, you should know who they are! Why not take advantage of the $30 \"get all ten decks\" option, and read about each of them on his card? If you wish to be an advertiser, and you want a specific card, email me and I'll let you know if that one is still available. (All the aces are already spoken for!)\nNote that our previous decks all had FIVE kings. One of our advertiser's name is King, and he wanted to be a king. So he is the king of \"coins\". If he doesn't advertise this year, we'll do something special with this card. Contact me if you are interested.\nFeel free to \"campaign\" for your favorite game designer or artist in the \"comments\" section!

I'll be happy to add names to the \"suggested\" list. \nHere are some of the past cards:\n You can advertise anything related to the game industry on your card including games, gaming support products, publishers, game stores, distributors, conventions, professional services and magazines or websites.\nTechnical details for advertisers:\n If you are one of the advertisers, in addition to the advertisement, and the decks, and the link to your website, if you have a booth at the Origins or Gencon game conventions, you may participate in the \"Poker Game Promotional Event\". You'll get your booth number mentioned in an ad in the program book, and hundreds of attendees will be directed to visit your booth and ask for a card. It adds a lot of traffic to your booth, and gets you mentioned in the convention program book. If you are an independent game designer or artist, and you buy a card, we'll mention your name in that ad!\nGive us a tif file if possible or a jpg or bmp if necessary. 300 dpi, make it 2 1/2\" by 3\" in size - we'll shrink it down a bit to fit on the card.

(But I have started early this year to allow extra time). If this happens, we'll just hold it over until 2015. And we'll give every advertiser some bonus decks for the delay.\n\nYou may note that there was no deck in 2012 or 2013. In 2012 I decided at the last minute to try to fund it with kickstarter, and didn't have enough time to get it funded or get it done. In 2013 I was too busy with two other successful kickstarter projects.

We are now at the stage where we can begin building the molds and start manufacturing  This is where we need your help.  Building the actual mold for the injection molding, can be very expensive.  Our dream is to one day manufacture the product in the U.S., and with your help, that may come true.   For now, our plan is to raise enough money to begin manufacturing and provide great value with a quality product at an affordable price.   We have made all the arrangements with manufacturing, designing, packaging and shipping.  \nIGS File\nWe have all of the designs and specifications finished, now we are waiting to raise the funds to bring this project to life.  We have considered outside investors, but we do not want the outside influences that go with them. This project is our brainchild and we do not want to cheapen the experience for our potential customers.   \nAction!\nWe think this is an awesome product and we are really excited about it, but we need your help to turn it into a reality. We have lots of exciting discounts and offers available to our early backers, and we hope that we can turn this product into a something special that you are going to love as much as we do.\nWho we are:\nFrom the video and story you probably have a good idea of who we are as inventors, professionals and family members.  As a company we want to be different and create a recognizable face to EyeShield.  The only way to do that, is to be better then any of our competitors. \n1.   We will do this with high quality products.  Our cases are made from polycarbonate and delrin, nylon 6/6.  This material is stronger more durable and twice as expensive to produce.  We do this to insure a strong durable case and shields.\n2.  We want to create long term relationships with our customers.  We plan on doing this with the first of a kind guarantee.  Most companies will guarantee their cell phone cases for a lifetime.  The truth is most people only keep their cell phones for 2 years.  Therefore we are not only going to offer a warranty but we are planning to offer an upgrade offer.  IF YOU UPGRADE YOUR PHONE WE WILL UPGRADE YOUR CASE.  For example if you had an iPhone 4 and upgraded to a 5, you just send in your iPhone 4 case with a shipping and handling fee and we will upgrade your case to a 5 for NO ADDITIONAL COST.\n3. We will listen to what customers want.  You can tell from our story we have made several improvements to the case from suggestions.  We never plan on stop listening to what you want and try to incorporate it into our case.  For example we are working on including a removable back up battery to store in the case.\n4.  We want to have fun.  If you're not having fun doing what your doing, you need to change what your doing.  I believe the only way to be the best is to enjoy yourself.  My father told me growing up, \"If you love your job, you will never work a day in your life.\"  I understand that more now than ever.  I love my job as a teacher, yet the excitement I feel when people use and enjoy the case is awesome.  I want to continue to chase that feeling.  Even the negative comments help propel us forward in ways to make improvements.\nThe Future: \nWe have met with a high number of injection mold makers and are set to produce the product.  We have the prototype dialed in and the drawings uploaded and created in Solidworks.  (Solidworks is the software used by manufacturers to create the molds to build the product)  \nSolid works file\nWe also have prototypes completed for the iPhone 4 and 4S as well as the iPad Mini.  We are excited about the iPad mini because it's shields can be removed and reattached both vertically and horizontally.  We created a slide feature in the shield to allow them to change widths. Hopefully, with a successful campaign around the EyeShield for iPhone 5, we can start another project on KickStarter to bring that product to market too!\nAs a company, we want to build our brand to become \"your last cell phone case.\"  We plan on doing this by creating the highest quality cell phone case at the best price.  We are always looking for feedback and ideas on how to improve out product.  As a business professor I know from research, the most successful companies give customers more in value then they pay in cost.  We are always looking to innovate and improve to give you the best and most affordable product.  \nTimeline:\nRewards:\nRewards\nAt $25,000 we unlock the iPhone 4 and 4s case.

The story began with me at the pool during summer break. I am a college business professor and teach classes at night so I can spend the days with my kids at the pool. So it is safe to say I don\u2019t really work for a living. Anyway, I got tired of shading my phone with one hand and trying to text replies with the other hand. I remember looking around and seeing everyone else doing the same thing. \nCan't see cell phone\nSo I bought an anti-glare shield, yet it did not work very well. So I thought about coming up with a cover that could retract back into the case. Just like the old boy scout collapsible cups.\nBoy scout cups\nThat night I searched the internet for a cell phone case that would shield the sun. Unfortunately, or maybe fortunately I couldn't find anything. Having no background in engineering and no artistic ability, I tried to draw out my idea. I created the original drawings and started showing them to people, who were to say the least,  not impressed.  I wonder why?\nmy original drawing\nBecause of my inability to draw, I downloaded Google sketchup and watched a couple tutorial videos on YouTube. I then began to design the product. After several attempts on the design, I felt like giving up because even if I came up with a good design, I felt like I could never finish it properly. \nEarly Sketch up drawing\nOne night I was watching the science channel and they were showing 3D printers and what they could print. I started to search the internet and found 3D printer Experience in Chicago.\n3D Printer Experience Chicago\nI called them and talked to Jackson about my design. He explained to me if I could design it on Sketchup, they could print it. So I brought in my design and to my disappointment, it is was unprintable.\nEarly Design\nI didn't have the money to hire a designer (because I am a business professor) so I dedicate myself to learning the software. Thanks to Jackson, he sat down and explained to me how to design the product without errors. I finished the drawings and sent them in to be printed. When the parts came back they were a disaster. The pieces didn't fit correctly and the original design was clumsy and bulky. \nThe Original Spartan Shield\nAlthough somewhere in there I could see potential. I kept designing and printing to figure out the flaws. Unfortunately for me, I am a spatial learner so I have to feel what 2mm is rather then see it on a screen. After 20 or more prints I finally got the prototype to work.\nspartan shield 1.0\nSpartan shield 1.1\nI was ecstatic with the design, but again my excitement was squashed. I designed it for an iPhone.  Oops,  I don\u2019t have an iPhone.  I have a Galaxy. I quickly searched Craigslist and purchased an iPhone to use with the case. As soon as I got the phone and case together my 9 year old daughter pleaded to have one, so I gave it to her and went back to using my Galaxy.\nDaughter using Phone\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY:\nThe excitement the case generated from her using it got me excited that maybe I have something to produce and sell. I then did a preliminary patent search and could not find anything like it. I then decided to get a professional search done, and still nothing. I filed for a patent in August 2013, and began working on the case to make it more sleek and functional. \nPatent Filing\nShockingly after my daughter had the case for a few days she had bent the top shield back and set it like a kickstand to Facetime with her friends. I asked her what happened? she said \"sorry dad I broke it.\" I said no you just gave it a new function,\" and the kickstand was born. \nKickstand\nA week later she came to me and asked \"Dad, could you put a cover on the back so I can keep my money in there when I go to dance.\" It then became apparent my daughter was much smarter than I, and the case storage was born.\nEarly version with removable back\nShe then complained she couldn't see the Apple emblem. \"Dad really, how is anyone going to know I have an iPhone?\" Wha lah the viewing window was born.\nback of case\nTwo days later she came to me and said \"Dad, I can't hear my speakers when I stand it up while I facetime\" she then asked \"could you move the speakers.\" Well I told her, I couldn't move the speakers, but I did put directional arches so they would reflect the sound towards her\". Proud of myself I asked her what she thought? she replied, \"I guess that will be fine.\" \nspeaker deflectors\nAfter I made a couple of different prototypes, I dyed them different colors and requested thoughts from my 4 teenage nieces and nephews. Kelly, a junior in high school could not decide what color to use as a shield? She then asked, \"Uncle, make it so I can take the shields off? I asked her \"why, they are there to block the sun, if you take them off they don't work.\" She replied \"No, I want to be able to switch out the shields, using many different colored shields at different times\" Duh, I should have known she was up to something ingenious. :) The removable shields were born!\nRemovable shields\nI am not sure what my family will come up with next for the new version, but I am anxious to find out. \nFrom there on I partnered with my brother-in-law and we began this process to bring the EyeShield to you. He has the experience and expertise on how to bring a new product to market. He previously worked for Fujitsu and was the driving force in selling the highly successful ScanSnap product line. He agreed to team up with me on one condition, I change the name from \u201cSpartan Shield\u201d to \u201cEyeShield\u201d being that the original prototype is for an iPhone. \noriginal idea for logo\nI agreed and we came up with the logo as the eye of Horas, who by the way is the Egyptian sun God. \nEye shield Logo\nIT IS NOW ALL UP TO YOU AND YOUR SUPPORT. \nTHANKS\nJEFF AND DOUG", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Challenges we face are similar to many other start-ups like funding, supply chain management, packaging and fulfillment. The good news is that we have planned ahead and believe we have mitigated much of the risks. We have spoken with several different manufacturers and collaborated with them to enhance the design, We have built solid relationships with two different injection molding and tooling companies, and both are ready to start as soon as we give the word. We chose two (with another on call) because again, we wanted to make sure that any mishaps with plant closings, natural disasters, etc. were limited.\n \nIf this campaign is successful we plan to bring this product to market both online and in stores. We will continue to design and produce new models for different cell phones and tablets. Our start may be slow as we build a client base and gain support by word of mouth from our users, but we won't let you down! \n\nWe plan to reinvest the profits into the company until we have created cases and shields for all cell phones and tablets on the market. As a business professor I have numerous students who are eager to help with design, marketing and packaging, which will help us succeed, and to pass their classes (LOL) :) just kidding!\n\nProjects fail because they never actually get started and/or because of a lack of outside knowledge and expertise.

Snooperscope Case color\nIf we hit this Golden Stretch Goal, you\u2019ll have the option of selecting the Snooperscope's case in the color of your choice: Camouflage, Original Hunter Green, Black, White.\nAs Featured on\nWhat is Snooperscope?\nSnooperscope is a special WIRELESS invention that, by using your mobile device as a screen and the infrared light as a source, enables you to see in low light conditions and in TOTAL DARKNESS!\nPlus, under visible light, it reveals hidden things that normally cannot be seen by the human eye.\nBy employing special optics, the user can see in the area covered by the light even though the naked eye only detects total darkness..\nA number of more practical applications have been developed with the Snooperscope because of its ability to peer through any opaque material that infrared rays can pass through.\nSnooperscope's case color choice: Camouflage, Original Hunter Green, Black, White\nSnooperscope is perfect for professional and personal applications, like:\nnight vision\nto see in dark places\nto see through objects like liquids, inks and textiles\nto see dust and motes in environments\nfor 101 experimental uses\n...and for fun.\nThe retail launch price of the Snooperscope is currently planned as $99 and the Early Bird as only $39, so you can make some great savings by backing us here!\nSnooperscope can be can be attached to any smartphone or tablet with a special magnet\n How does it work?\nSnooperscope is primarily a Night Vision device and whether by biological or technological means, night vision is made possible by a combination of two approaches: sufficient spectral range, and sufficient intensity range. Humans have poor night vision compared to many animals, in part because the human eye lacks a tapetum lucidum.\nSpectrum of visible and invisible light\nHuman vision is confined to a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum called visible light.\nSnooperscope enables the user to see objects in the dark by illuminating the object with infrared radiation and converting the reflected radiation into a visual image.\nThe resulting scene, which is apparently dark to a human observer, appears as a visible image to the Snooperscope, and this image and video are sent wirelessly to your smartphone or tablet.\nThe rewards\nApplications and experimental uses\nSnooperscope has virtually unlimited applications in experimental projects.\nSnooperscope Labs: some experiments made with the Snooperscope\nHere are some applications you can use with your Snooperscope:\nNIGHT VISION\nSnooperscope can maximize your smartphone and tablet in the dark, and improve visibility in low light conditions!\nUse Snooperscope if you are frequently alone at home and you feel uneasy when you hear strange sounds outside. If it is a cat or a dog, you can relax; if it is a two-legged prowler, you can call the police who can cope with the unsuspecting intruder!\nThe Snooperscope infrared light is not visible to the human eye\nIf you live in an area where it is wise to check the identity of a night visitor before opening the door, use the Snooperscope as an invisible security guard through your home windows, or position it where it can illuminate the doorway, and you can secretly observe the location. You can thus identify the visitor without turning on outside lights.\nA more pleasant theatre application of the Snooperscope, in both professional and amateur productions, is to study audience reactions in the dark as the play or other performance progresses. These observations may provide clues for smoothing the production.\nCreate eerie scenes inside a family household! With Snooperscope you can see the infrared tracking dots, a feature of the Kinect, like seen in the movie Paranormal Activity 4. Test it out to see how it really works and how it would look on Snooperscope. Turn off all the lights, turn on the Kinect, aim Snooperscope away from the Kinect and you will see there's this stuff going on in the house that you can't see.\nTheatre application for audience reactions and Kinect tracking dots\nAnd with Snooperscope right at home you can perform some starling theatrics. Hide the device in a convenient closet or cupboard before your guests arrive. When all are present, seat them at one end of the room and turn out all the lights. In the pitch dark, you can describe every little action of each individual on the far end of the room. Most people are unfamiliar with the Snooperscope and the night vision, and will be dumbfounded by your ability to see in the dark!\nPAINT\nSince the infrared reflection of pigments in paints and inks is different from that of white light, it is possible to detect forged paintings and checks by the way the color appears.\nSnooperscope is able to create revealing images using reflected infrared light, internal defects that are not evident in visible light, the use of different materials, and sometimes the artist's pencil.\nINFRARED TRANSPARENCY\nSome objects appear opaque in daylight, but with Snooperscope they are transparent!\nA jar of jam nuts appears transparent! A coke with an inscription hidden in the back of the bottle not visible in daylight as appears with the Snooperscope!\nJam and coke in the darkness are completely transparent!\nWith Snooperscope, Teddy's glasses appear transparent and he has bleached white tie and feet: nice effect!\nCRIME AND FORGERIES\nCrime detection laboratories are now using similar equipment for reading through certain types of material. You can attach Snooperscope to a microscope and greatly broaden your observation because many substances react very differently to infrared light than they do to visible light. Snooperscope's infrareds can penetrate deeper into some materials (e.g. animal tissues) and permit examination below the surface. Document forgeries can often be detected with infrared and many colored objects react strangely to the invisible light.\nWith Snooperscope you can see what is written under inks\nIn this example we have spotted some India ink on a page over some writing. Your eyes will only see the blackened spot, but the Snooperscope will peer through the top layer of ink and reveal the writing just as clearly as if there were no top coating. This method permits instantaneous examination which often is often of great convenience.\nNOCTURNAL AND WILD ANIMALS\nUse Snooperscope to study the behaviour of small nocturnal animals in total darkness. Naturalists and campers will find the Snooperscope an ideal instrument with which to study the habits of nocturnal wildlife. Unlike an ordinary flashlight, the invisible infrared beam of the Snooperscope will not frighten away the animals under observation. Another useful application is in photography of wild animals. Snooperscope can be used as part of your mobile device and it can be a valuable observation device. Many wildlife pictures can now be made by observing the animal from a distance and tripping the shutter when the creature is in the best possible position. Even a video can be made better. Farmers and ranchers may find Snooperscope a practical device for observing predators that harass livestock, chickens, etc. Ordinary lights will scare off such pests before they are properly identified, whereas their movements can be easily observed with the Snooperscope and more effective countermeasures can be taken.\nBOTANICAL\nUse it with a micro-lens to study bacteriological and botanical specimens under infrared rays. Certain large molecules may now be examined in a different way, since they become transparent using Snooperscope.\nENVIRONMENT\nSnooperscope can be an infrared optical air quality sensor, designed to sense dust particles. Snooperscope is especially effective at detecting very fine particles like cigarette smoke, dust, pollution and other particles in the air, and can be used as an air purifier system.\nTEXTILE\nMany colored textiles will appear in different colors; for example, some black or red textiles will appear white when viewed with the Snooperscope, while others appear very dark. The difference is due to the use of different types of dyes in coloring the materials. Uneven, poor-quality dyeing of fabrics can often be spotted.\nColored textiles and fruits-vegetables as they appear with the Snooperscope.\nCOMMUNICATION\nWith two sets of Snooperscope you can blink invisible Morse code signals over a distance of a mile or more. Momentarily cover each Snooperscope with your hand and then blink the invisible signals, which your distant partner can detect.\nSnooperscope has standard threads for installation on tripods, car mounts and universal stands\nThe story and the evolution of Snooperscope\nThe Snooperscope were designed originally for military use to enable infantrymen to secretly observe the enemy and aim rifles accurately in total darkness.\nWhen the infrared light source is turned on, the user, by employing a special eyepiece, can see in the area covered by the light, although to the naked eye total darkness still prevails.\nHowever, these same devices have countless peacetime applications, having nothing whatsoever to do with guerrilla warfare.\nThe Snooperscope has a lot of practical applications:  night vision, communications, botanical, environment, paint, observation and lot of others.\nAnd with this project, we are reinventing the Snooperscope for the 21st century using your mobile device or tablet.\nEvolution of Snooperscope, infrared and camera sensor, battery and power supply\nThe Snooperscope App\nThe Snooperscope App is available for iOS and Android.\nThe App is really easy to setup and use:\ndownload it free from the App Store or Google Play\npair Snooperscope with a direct Wi-Fi connection to your smartphone or tablet (no router needed)\nopen the App and you are done!\nWant to capture what you're seeing on your smartphone?\nSimply click the snapshot icon on the App to take still pictures or click the record icon to record an actual video and save it.\nThe snapshots will come up so it's easy to save them as a JPEG in your smartphone.\nThe recorded video will automatically save as an MPEG.\nSnooperscope: how the prototype works\nDevelopment Process\nSketches and 3D rendering\nMolding prototypes\nCamera sensor, lens, infrared leds: work in progress!\nAntenna prototypes, camera sensor testing with Arduino, the wifi chipset\nFirst and second version hardware prototypes\nSnooperscope technical specifications\nSnooperscope runs through a Wi-Fi peer-to-peer connection, meaning it's protected with a secure video feed.\nSnooperscope uses H.264 video compression.

D20 Entertainment wanted this same team to write the script for this project and have creative control. It is our goal, first and foremost, to bring the characters that the readers have known and loved to the screen and to remain faithful to the spirit of the comic strip. So what can you expect to see? Well \u2014 much of it is going to depend on the level of funding. The more that comes in, the more we\u2019ll have to work with. What you won\u2019t be getting is a simple rehashing of material from the magazine. Instead, you will see all new material. Of course, we do plan to draw from the wealth of material presented in the monthly magazine over the years. The two will be massaged, reimagined, rewoven and combined into an episodic story that flows together seamlessly on the big screen. Readers have come to rely on getting the best story for their buck every month in the strips, and as supporters of this Kickstarter project, you can be assured of getting the best screen adaptation possible. Everyone involved is passionate about the comic and getting it right. Again, just what that story turns out to be depends on our backers. This is where you come in.\nAt $60k, we will produce a short theatrical format picture around 60 minutes long. This will include more appearances by more familiar characters from the KODT universe. \nAt $125k, we get to make dreams come true and enter a whole new frontier. This will mean that the producers (with full creative control by the D-Team) will be able to fully make the movie they\u2019ve been bouncing around for the past six months. Viewers will be able to enjoy not only the classic characters, but also more of their favorites, perhaps even the lovable Squirrely. We have a very exciting story blocked out and would love the opportunity to bring it to life. \nEvery portion of this production will be under the watchful eye of Kenzer and Company and the creative control of the KODT development team who have been extremely protective of their creation over the last twenty-five years. Rest assured, the spirit of the Knights will be faithfully recreated. As funding increases, so can characters be added, and let\u2019s face it, everyone has a favorite character that they want to see on film. We need your help. All we ask is that you download the free comic and share it with your friends to entice them to visit and consider pledging. Help us spread the word. Share and post about the project frequently, and keep checking back for updates every few days. \nBelow is a list of movie props that you can add to your reward/war chest.

If you enjoy tinkering with things or are fascinated with the power of magnets, then this product is for you. We have found many fun and functional ways of using the POLAR Pen and we are really excited to see what you will come up with. \n  Polar comes in two high quality finishes: Pure Silver, purer than sterling (product will tarnish if left unused, any silver polish will restore finish) and 24 Karat Gold, an elegant deep yellow.\n Using the silver and gold magnets POLAR lends itself very well to the concept of modular customization; the ability to transform a standard product into something different and unique. Modular customization is often talked about in the design world but rarely executed. Polar accomplishes this by having a limited amount of unique components that repeat throughout each product. \n     Specifications\n    Magnets\nComponents\nThere are four unique components excluding the magnets: Cap, Clip, Tip and Stylus. These components are not magnets they are made from steel and coated with a black zinc finish. The components stick to the magnets due to their large content of nickel and iron.\nRubber Components\n  Stylus rubber tip - The stylus tip has been sourced from a leader in stylus tip technology. This is one of the narrowest tips available on the market with a width of only 5mm. The narrowness of this tip allows for greater accuracy in writing and also allows for it to fit inside a magnet cap for protection. The metal stylus component fits deep into the rubber tip to give the tool good pressure on your touch screen devices. The rubber tip can also be removed and replaced if needed.\nSilicone rubber tip protector - This component gets inserted into the top magnet in the cap. The tip of the gel pen nests into the silicone to prevent it from drying out or leaking. This component is removable and can fit inside any of the magnets. Every pen comes with one silicone rubber tip protector.\nRefill/Cartridge\nPilot Hi-tec-C - Each pen comes with one Pilot Hi-tec-C pen cartridge, either black or red. This pen is also known as the Pilot G-tec-C4. These are a excellent pens for sketching, drawing and daily use.\n\u201cThe writing experience makes the Pilot Hi-Tec-C one of the most sought after Japanese pens on the market today. Pick one up and you will see why.\" www.jetpens.com\n Uni-ball Signo UM-151 - For a more traditional feel, the pen will also fit the Uni-ball Signo UM-151 or Uni-ball Uni-Gel Grip refills.\nWere do the Pledge funds go\n100% of the money raised will go towards the first production run of the pen. These funds will allow us to meet the minimum order quantities set by our different manufacturers.\nManufacturing Process\nMetal Components - The metal components, such as the tip, clip, stylus and caps, will be made by a local machine shop located in Linwood Ontario. These components are all machined from solid steel rod, made on a high precision CNC lathe. The components are then electro plated with a black zinc oxide finish.\nMagnets - The magnets are made from neodymium otherwise known as \u201crare earth\u201d. Though this element is not as rare as it sounds, China has created a near monopoly on the global deposits. Meaning the best quality and most cost-effective magnets come from China. Presently this is where we are sourcing the magnets.\nAssembly - All Polar products will be assembled and packaged by us in Waterloo Ontario. This will allow us to keep a close eye on quality to provide you with the best product possible.\nUS and International Backers\nThis is one of the first Canadian Kickstater campaigns to collect in Canadian Dollars ($CAD). Please don\u2019t let this prevent you from pledging. The Canadian dollar is lower than the $USD making the reward slightly cheaper if you are paying in US funds and much cheaper if you are paying in \u00a3GBP or \u20acEUR.\nInternational shipping is included in all pledge prices.

Together we work to create products with local materials that can create jobs and better lives for local families. HERObike uses locally grown bamboo to build bikes that are fun to ride and create new economic development opportunities in the rural town of Greensboro, AL. \nHERObike enlisted the help of MakeLab to build the Semester.\nEngineering a better Bamboo Bike\nThrough the support of MakeLab, HERObike uses a propriety technology to create structural bamboo hex tubes that deliver a strong, vibration dampening ride for our newest model of bamboo bike.\nLocal & Community\nBy supporting the Semester Bicycle, new jobs will be created to put people back to work. Green small-scale manufacturing benefits individual families while strengthening our community.\nEnvironmental & Sustainability\nLocal bamboo is grown without irrigation, pesticides or chemicals right outside our workshop. It is both environmentally friendly and sustainable.\nOur Bike\nSemester Bikes are available in three standard sizes:\nThe specifications below are typical for the Medium frame:\n\u00b7 Seat Tube Angle: 73\u00b0\n\u00b7 Head Tube Angle: 73.5\u00b0\n\u00b7 Wheelbase: 99.2cm\n\u00b7 Headtube Length: 15.5cm\n\u00b7 Effective Top Tube Length: 57cm\n\u00b7 Seat Tube Length: 55cm\n\u00b7 Rear Dropout Spacing: 120mm\n\u00b7 Powder-coated CR-MO seat stays, chain stays, seat tube, headtube, bottom bracket and fork.\nHexTube Technology\nSemester Bicycles are made primarily from Bamboo and Steel. Our proprietary \"Hextubes\" make our bicycles truly unique. Each tube is actually a structural stressed skin composite: a bamboo core is skinned on the inside with carbon fiber and covered on the outside with a durable glass/epoxy lamination. The bamboo fibers run parallel along the length of the tube, while the carbon fiber and FRP skins are laid at 45\u00b0 giving torsional rigidity and protecting the bamboo. The resulting Hextube is incredibly strong and lightweight.\nBy laminating dissimilar materials, we have also successfully dampened road induced vibration. Other bamboo bikes use tubes that are inconsistent in size, weight, and wall thickness. Our engineered Hextubes are consistent in size, strength, and performance.\nThe \"rear triangle\" of the bike is made from powder coated steel, providing overall lateral stiffness and durability on all bearing surfaces.

His crew are his family, and among this rag-tag band of adventures is Skylla, a half-Enlightened slave who has worked her way up to being Kaleb's second in command.\nAfter our first volume, David and I knew what was next, and this painting became our inspiration.  'The Consultant' as it is called, show out intrepid hero, Kaleb, ready for action as an airship drifts behind him.  What better way to show fantastic steampunk action than with airships, and a pulp adventure that follows a crew in search of legendary craft and the treasures they hold.\nIn The Airship of Fools, Kaleb and his crew will be hired to uncover secrets thought lost in the final war between the Samaya and the Enlightened.  This will be an adventure of the highest order, and promises to be another page turning romp through the incredible world of the Gun Kingdoms.\nBelow, you'll get a look at 'The Consultant' and you must also remember that like all Art of the Genre books, illustrations will be key in propelling the tale to a whole new level of enjoyment.  For all you art collectors out there, David's original work will also be available at certain backer levels as well, so get these pieces of history while you can.\n'The Consultant' The painting that inspired the theme of Airship of Fools.\nAlso, if funding goes well, we've dreamed up some outstanding stretch goals just in case!\nAbout Art of the Genre: AotG is an independent small press founded in 2011 by editor Scott Taylor in an attempt to recapture what had been lost in today's bright lights and digital artwork driven marketplace.  The company is founded on the principles of delivering 'fast, fun, reads' just like the old dime store fiction from the 1960s and 70s while using illustrations from classic fantasy artists to capture the feel of the Nameless Realms universe where all company's tales are set.

But I am always in need of tools. There are always things that need to be fixed and I never have the right tool for the job. So I created this tool that can be with me at all times because it fits in my pocket with my smart phone. The Titanite Shield features 5 common wrench sizes from 1/4\" up to 5/8\", an Allen wrench, bottle opener, rope cutter, phillips and flat head screwdrivers, bike spoke tool and more. A metric version is available as well. Metric wrench sizes are 6mm, 8mm, 10mm, 12mm and 15mm. You will be able to specify standard or metric when we complete the orders. Due to the nature of the Laser cutting and bench finishing, we can customize the tool to your needs. This is available as one of the reward options. I have created this Kickstarter campaign so that we can get a large bulk order cut with the laser to keep costs down. We would need to cut at least 500 to make the bulk order cost effective.\nThumbnail sketches developing the idea\nAfter several pages of sketches and working through a few prototypes with the guys at our laser shop, we came up with a few prototypes. We tested them on bikes and my truck to see what would work best. We carried them around in our pockets to see how it fit with the phones.\nPrototypes\nWorking on a bike with the Titanite Shield multi-tool\nMy name is Mark and I am an Industrial Designer, I'm a bike rider and I'm an organic chicken farmer. I have worked in many different industries and have experience with a lot of manufacturing processes. Lately I have been doing a lot with heavy equipment where parts are cut with a high precision laser cutting machine. \nUsing the Titanite to work on my truck\nMulti Tool features\nAfter many hours brainstorming and sketching out ideas, I created some cad models of my designs. The Shield was the design that seemed to work the best and it was the design I liked the best.\nUsing the bike spoke tool\nThroughout the kickstarter process, I would like to get input from you on what you would like to see on the tool. From testing the prototype, I can see a few things that need to be changed.  The Allen wrench works but most allen heads are recessed so the Allen wrench needs to stick out like the screwdrivers. It would be good to have two sizes as well. We have tried a few different ways to hold it on the phone. The first plan was to use Paracord. It would be nice to have the paracord with you when you need it, but it did not hold the phone well. We went to an elastic band and it works really well, it is thin and holds the phone well and provides a soft interface  between phone and tool. We are also going to make available a leather pouch for carrying the tool and your smart phone.\nFirst Reward: $20.00\nFirst 150 backers can get the tool for $20. You get a brushed tool steel Titanite Shield Multi-tool with elastic band for attaching to smart phones\nSecond Reward: $25.00\nYou get a brushed tool steel Titanite Shield Multi-tool with elastic band for attaching to smart phones\nThird Reward: $32.00\nYou get a blue or green zinc plated tool steel Titanite Shield Multi-tool with elastic band for attaching to smart phones\nFinal production version in brushed titanium\nFourth Reward: $40.00\nYou get a brushed Titanium Titanite Shield Multi-tool with elastic band for attaching to smart phones\nFifth Reward: $60.00\nYou get a brushed titanium Titanite Shield Multi-tool with a leather pouch that fits the multi-tool and your smart phone\nSixth Reward: $75.00\nYou get a brushed titanium Titanite Shield Multi-tool made to your specifications with a leather pouch that fits the multi-tool and your smart phone\nSeventh Reward: $100.00 \nYou get a decorative damascus steel Titanite Shield Multi-tool with a leather pouch that fits the multi-tool and your smart phone\nWe have contracted with the Laser Jet cutting company that helped with the prototypes to produce the final production parts. We will also be working with one of their partners who will provide the finishing processes as well as precision waterjet cutting for some of the harder materials. I have been working with these companies for a while now on other projects and they are capable of producing these parts in large numbers. It will not take long to cut these parts in batches of 500 at a time. A laser  jet cutting machine or waterjet cutting machine can cut 250 of these parts out of a 4' x 8' sheet of titanium in a few hours.\nThe factory floor\nUsing the allen wrench", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSo far the challenges to this project have been few. Bench cutting the screwdriver bits into the tool will be the biggest challenge. The first few prototypes were cut with a laser using nitrogen gas.

The Asteroid Belt and the Earth\u2019s moon, Luna, are waiting for further exploration.

Wells should have written.\nEverything A. Conan Doyle thought of but never published because it was too fantastic.\nEverything you need for the adventures of the century.\nAlmost 25 years ago, well known game designer and author Frank Chadwick came up with the idea of a roleplaying game set in a world inspired by the fantastic novels of early Science Fiction authors like Jules Verne or H. G. Wells.\nSpace: 1889 was first published in 1988 by Game Designers Workshop, followed by several additional products, amongst them supplements like \u201cIronclads and Ether flyers,\u201d adventures like \u201cCanalpriests of Mars,\u201d or board games like \u201cTemple of the Beastmen.\u201d\nGDW is long gone but, nevertheless, the fan-base has hung on to this \u201croleplaying game in a more civilized time\u201d and with the growing popularity of 'steampunk culture' the time has never been better to reintroduce a new edition of the game for old and new fans alike.\nThe Space: 1889 Crowdfunding project is a cooperation between Uhrwerk Verlag/Clockwork Publishing, Chronicle City, and the master himself, Frank Chadwick.\nWe have several very cool stretchgoals planned and we will update this section as the project progresses.\nSpace: 1889 Gamemaster's Screen\nPlease see 'Update 5' for more pictures of the Screen.\n\u00a334,000 - UNLOCKED!!!!

Rocketmen were intended to combat the threats of tomorrow.  If those threats never arrive, what purpose will they serve? Who do they save now? Rocketmen want to know: are you in peril?\nWPA Poster Featuring Rocketmen\nThe Rocketmen are a fraction of a splinter in the body of the Federal Budget. The contemporary remains of a WPA jobs program, the Department of Municipal Rocketry employs men (who are maybe not employable anywhere else) to wear hydrogen-fueled rocket packs and spend their days on city rooftops, awaiting any peril that might befall the city. There is a lot of waiting. In the old days, there was the threat of Russians to battle and 50-foot robots to contend with. Now, they rescue cats, detain illegal skywriters, and start the occasional roof fire. Some of these Rocketmen haven\u2019t flown since their training session. Mostly, they kill time waiting for the emergency phone to ring, which never happens. Until one day, when it rings.\nOne of these rockets could be yours.\nOur series adventure begins when an emergency actually transpires; one newbie rocketman doesn\u2019t follow protocol and ... things go badly. What follows are a series of adventures as the rocketmen attempt to stay one step ahead of the FAA while they fight to clear their name. A motley group rarely called upon to do much of anything, they must rise to the challenge and use all their resources to prevent their department from being maligned (and likely cut entirely). They rescue people from modern urban peril, uncover a vast underground government bureaucracy, face monsters from their past, and suffer prolonged hydrogen narcosis while standing alone against the surprise enemy they were actually created to defend us from. This time, when the city is threatened, will they be ready?\nBen Laurance as Trenton and Ray Tagavilla as Quinn\nAbout the Artists\nWebster Crowell (Writer/Director) is an animator and filmmaker with over 15 years professional experience in Seattle. He makes tactile, complex short films and features, patiently weaving landscapes and characters in pursuit of an idealized reality. Each film has its own gravity, speed, and consequences. His award-winning films include the shorts Parasol and Last Call, and his feature Borrowing Time, which was a shoestring epic requiring five years to complete and tour the world. Webster has also been commissioned by a number of artists and nonprofits including Susan Robb, West of Lenin Theater, Artist Trust, Dina Martina, NW Film Forum and 826 Seattle. Webster was the first recipient of The Stranger Genius Award for Film in 2003. \u201cObjects take on personalities in Web's work, be they movie projectors, clocks, or robotic ants, breathing life into everything that falls before his camera lens.\u201d \u2013 The Stranger  Web's Reel\nAlycia Delmore (Actor/Producer) starred as Anna in Lynn Shelton\u2019s Humpday (winner of a special jury prize at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, Official Entry in Cannes 2009 Directors' Fortnight, and winner of the John Cassavetes Independent Spirit Award for 2010) and was featured in Megan Griffith's The Off Hours (Official Sundance Selection, 2011).

In short, we\u2019re serious.\nYour Mission\nWe\u2019ll tell you how we expect the project to work in a moment, but first a little about your mission, should you choose to accept it\u2026\nSpace is big - really big! Mankind has only sent a few dozen successful robotic exploration missions into the solar system since the start of the space age, yet there are millions of places waiting to be explored including asteroids, moons, planets, ring systems and more.\nThe 88 largest solar system objects (diameter >200 miles). There are more than a million planets, moons and asteroids in the solar system >500m in diameter. Graphic: kokogiak.com\nAlthough space agencies do an amazing job launching high end exploration systems to interesting places, there are many more missions proposed than can ever be funded as high end missions are typically one offs that cost many many millions or even billions.\nWe need your help to provide another option - to explore space at scale needs a generation of interested minds with access to affordable exploration tools. By supporting this mission you can help make this happen and be the first of this new generation of space explorers.\nWe want to demonstrate that thousands of technical and non-technical people can design their own spacecraft, send these spacecraft into space, land some on a planet with an atmosphere (Earth this time) and send the rest a significant interplanetary distance to a body without an atmosphere (the Moon), and do useful science while having fun.\nThat\u2019s bold, crazy some people might even say, but thanks to Moore's law and advances in flexible and printable electronics, it\u2019s now possible and we need your help to prove it. If we succeed, one day every child may be able to have their own spacecraft to take part in robotic field trips around the solar system as a normal part of growing up - and you'll have helped make it happen!\nYour spacecraft\nThe key to our approach are \u2018Pocket Spacecraft\u2019. These spacecraft (that can also function as landers and rovers to some degree), are small enough to fit in your pocket, both physically and financially - we\u2019re talking the cost of a nice birthday present here.\nYour Scout spacecraft\nPhotograph of a Pocket Spacecraft: Thin-Film Scout prototype consisting of a polyimide substrate, bonded solar cells and thinned die, printed passive components, antennas and images.\nYour Pocket Spacecraft will be a Thin-Film Spacecraft / Lander / Rover \u2018Scout\u2019. These will be loaded by the thousand into an Interplanetary CubeSat Mothership which will fly to the body of interest, send out the Scouts to explore it, and relay their discoveries back to Earth and amongst each other.\nPrototype Thin-Film and CubeSat Pocket Spacecraft hardware in the lab. We try and use consumer equipment whenever we can to make it cheaper for anyone to replicate our work.\nYour Scout is a polyimide disc (a material used for flexible circuit boards, spacesuits and, of particular relevance for this application, high performance solar sails) held taut by a NiTi memory metal hoop that can also double as an antenna. \nPocket Spacecraft are built from thinned system-on-a-chip dies and printed or offcut space rated solar cells to maximise performance at minimal cost.\nSolar cells, a thinned commercial off the shelf system-on-a-chip die (ground down with diamond sand paper) and support components, sensors and instruments are bonded or printed on the polyimide and protected with a conformal coating resulting in a spacecraft with an average thickness less than one twentieth of a millimetre (two thousandths of an inch), and a mass much less than a gram (a thirtieth of an ounce).\n5\u00b5m metalised and unmetalised polyimide substrate (Kapton\u00ae) with a penny for scale.\nThis thinness and lightness allows us to pack thousands per mothership, act as very small solar sails (when coated with a thin metal layer) to move about space, and potentially survive re-entry from orbit to the surface of bodies with suitable atmospheres.\nYour Interplanetary CubeSat mothership\nA CAD drawing of the CubeSat bus we will modify. The solar panels are in the process of unfolding to make room for a solar sail (centre) to deploy.\nCubeSats revolutionised low cost access to space a decade ago when professors Bob Twiggs at Stanford and Jordi Puig-Suari at CalPoly created a 30x10x10cm,<5kg \u20183U\u2019 spacecraft that could be launched inexpensively. 'CubeSat: An Unlikely Success Story' describing the CubeSat story can be watched here. \nSince then, 70+ have been launched to low earth orbit by companies, space agencies and universities. Two years ago NASA funded the study of interplanetary CubeSats, last year more than 120 researchers gathered at our first Interplanetary CubeSat Workshop, and this year NASA announced an interplanetary CubeSat pathfinder.\nYour mothership is a 3U CubeSat designed to inexpensively piggyback on pretty much any American, European, Russian or other rocket that supports CubeSats and is launched into a suitable starting orbit. We have to be flexible enough to hitch a ride along with a high end commercial or scientific spacecraft going in roughly the right direction, then we'll be dropped off and make our own way on to where we want to go. Think of it as interplanetary hitchhiking!\nAn engineering model of a 3U CubeSat, the largest most commonly launched CubeSat format.\nTo allow us to hitch rides on rockets going to as many different orbits as possible (we're compatible with upcoming GTO, GEO, LLO and earth escape launches), about two thirds of the mothership is a modular propulsion system plus control and communications systems.\nPropulsion systems we can drop in include a solar sail module (based on The Planetary Society/Stellar Exploration LightSail-1), which uses the force of light from the sun, and an electrolysis propulsion system, which breaks down liquid fuel (basically water) into hydrogen and oxygen using solar power and ignites it (like these systems from Cornell and Tethers Unlimited).\nWhich we use depends on the launch we book. If this KickStarter does spectacularly well, we would love to be able to launch CubeSats with each type of propulsion system. Your generous support can make this happen.\n(a) The 32m2 solar sail module we plan to use during a deployment test from a 3U CubeSat (Image: Stellar Exploration). (b) A bench top prototype electrolysis propulsion system.\nRadiation hardened/shielded avionics, solar cells and other subsystems to control the propulsion system, protect, release and photograph the Scouts, and to allow us to communicate with Earth and find where we are, complete the mothership.\nWe\u2019ll fly a low energy/weak stability boundary transfer from our drop off point to the moon that doesn\u2019t require much fuel but takes many months, unlike the days of the Apollo missions. This is the fundamental trade off of this mission - we can do interplanetary space exploration at very low cost, but everything takes much longer.\nNavigation and communication at lunar distances is challenging. We are refurbishing two high performance ground stations for the project, and work with amateur radio enthusiasts, universities and commercial ground station providers and will apply to use systems such as the Deep Space Network and the Very Long Baseline Array.\nIf you are, or would like to be, a radio amateur, we'll show you how to communicate directly with your spacecraft in space when it is nearby using inexpensive UHF and S-band equipment. Communication at (cis-)lunar distances is more expensive (typically requiring 5-24m+ steerable dishes), but available to some clubs and enthusiasts.\nWe\u2019re ready to do a complete demonstration mission, but need your help to fund it. If you\u2019re up for it, here\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do\u2026 \nConcept of operations\nYour mission has five phases taking place over approximately thirty six months (subject to launch windows and delays) and we\u2019d love you and your spacecraft to be involved every step of the way.\nThe (very much simplified) path to the moon using a Weak Stability Boundary (WSB) transfer from a Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) around the Earth.\nMission phases:\nProvide online tools to allow you to design/personalise your own Scout spacecraft and take part science and technology experiments using your web browser (~12 months)\nBuild, test and load your Scout spacecraft onto the Interplanetary CubeSat Mothership while you watch how it's done and follow the progress of your Scout from laboratory to launch pad (~6 months)\nLaunch the mothership into a suitable orbit with you following from your mission control. Once in orbit, the Earth Scouts will be released and test their ability to re-enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and (hopefully) land in one piece, transmitting their location to aid recovery. We hope you\u2019ll help us try to track and recover some of them (~3 months)\nWe\u2019ll then engage the motherships propulsion system and fly it and the Lunar Scouts on a Weak Stability Boundary (WSB) transfer (or similar) to an unstable Low Lunar Orbit (LLO). You\u2019ll be able to track progress every step of the way (~6-12 months)\nOnce we arrive, we\u2019ll release and photograph the Lunar Scouts and then they will land (at very high speed\u2026) on the moon (~0-3 months)\nYou and your spacecraft will have made history, and contributed to a system that we can then try flying elsewhere in the solar system such as Mars, Venus and to some asteroids.\nSo perhaps you\u2019re asking\u2026\nHow can I help make history and change space exploration for ever?\nSponsor one or more Scouts and encourage your friends and family to do the same! \nThis concept only works with mass participation and we need at least 2000, preferably 8000 or more people, willing to help make history and change space exploration forever.\nThe Scout we\u2019ve designed for you is a solar sail disc less than 80mm (about three inches) in diameter (there's a <34mm/1.33\" version for atmospheric re-entry only) and averages less than a twentieth of a millimetre (two thousandths of an inch) thick with solar cells, computer, radio transceiver and instruments. About three quarters of the Scout is available for you to customise. You don\u2019t need any technical skills, but if you have them, we\u2019d love you to help expand what Scouts can do.\nYou customise the appearance, software or hardware of your Thin-Film Spacecraft / Lander / Rover Scout using just your web browser and we do the rest.\nAt the simplest level, you upload a picture or message which will be printed on your own Scout spacecraft that will be sent into space. You decide where you would like your Scout to go \u2013 load it onto the Earth Scout deck, and soon after it is launched into space, we\u2019ll release it into Earth\u2019s atmosphere to attempt re-entry and recovery from the surface of the planet. Load it onto the Lunar Scout deck and we\u2019ll try to send it to the moon and release it to deorbit to the surface of the moon.\nYou can develop custom software for your spacecraft using a standard Arduino development environment on your computer, or just your web browser and our web based system.\nScouts are solar powered with integrated optical and radio transceivers and can have sensors including a single pixel optical sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature sensor, strain gauges and more. If you are comfortable with Arduino level software development, you can run your own software on Software and Hardware Development Scouts. We\u2019ll provide a web based integrated development environment (IDE) so you can write code, test on a Scout simulator and in a virtual solar system and upload your design to your own Software Development Scout.\nIf you are an educator or would like to support a school or club, the Software Development Scout Education Edition allows a group of up to 50 users with email addresses from the same institution to share a Software Development Scout and work on different types of customisation. The Scout can be placed in Crowd, Team or Earth/Lunar Scout customisation mode so users can customise their own part of the Scout or work together on a bigger design. Users have access to the online Scout software IDE, Scout simulator and virtual solar system allowing many software customisation ideas to be developed and one chosen to fly.\nYou can support a specific group or else we will provide a mechanism for people who have great ideas and people who wish to support them to connect. Your donation will be acknowledged on the outside of the Scout unless you wish to remain anonymous.\nIf you know others who might like their own Software Development Scouts then check out the Software Development Lunar Scout Party (a set of five Scouts, omnidirectional ground station and a swarm communications library) and work together on your own constellation or swarm of spacecraft.\nPerhaps you\u2019d like your Scout to be affiliated with others and share position and other mission data? If so, you can create or join a Scout Fleet just by pledging and filling in the fleet request form or emailing support@pocketspacecraft.com \nPassive components such as resistors, capacitors and interconnects are printed on your spacecraft with a materials inkjet printer and permit user customisable Hardware Development Scouts.\nHardware Development Scouts can be customised using the enhanced online IDE. You will be allocated 100 credits to specify what you would like to include from a palette of printable components, instruments, solar cell types, communications systems and other upgrades to the functionality of your Scout. The exact options and number of credits required will depend on the number of backers - more backers means more choice. With enough backers, if you want to add enhancements such as a printed fractal antenna, upgrade your optical communications from LED to laser diode, add GPS to your Earth Scout or add pop-up optics or memory metal actuators you'll be able to break out those credits and make it so!\nSerious fun\nWe believe a key element of this idea is serious fun. By that we mean we believe that it\u2019s OK to have fun while performing serious science and technology research. In fact, not only is it OK it\u2019s our duty \u2013 if you are going to be generous enough to help us make this mission happen, then we should entertain and inform you throughout the mission.\nPhotographing spacecraft for the KickStarter video. Our production team are going to help you follow behind the scenes throughout the project so anyone will be able to replicate our work.\nWe\u2019re going to do this in several ways. First of all, everyone who participates in this mission is going to know almost everything about it every step of the way. We\u2019re going to blog every week, release a video diary every month, have a webinar every quarter, document everything we do in sufficient detail for anyone to replicate it in the Mission Manual, a professionally produced e-book that will be released, chapter by chapter, in monthly instalments.\nThe Mission Manual will provide you with a personal record of your Mission to the Moon. It will be released as a Kindle and iPad compatible DRM free PDF eBook and as an archive quality special printed edition.\nThe Mission Manual will be both the definitive record of the mission which anyone will be able to use to replicate and reuse our work, as well as perhaps become a family heirloom documenting you and your families\u2019 first steps into the solar system to treasure for generations to come.\nWe\u2019re doing this responsibly, so we\u2019ll show you how we make sure we follow the rules for planetary protection, space debris, spacecraft and radio licensing and more, and make all our paperwork and protocols available to all.\nWe\u2019ve also teamed up with expert authors who have kindly agreed to make their books about various elements of the project available to you as part of your reward.\nFor example, we're pleased to be able to announce that Lou Friedman, Executive Director Emeritus of The Planetary Society has kindly agreed to allow us to give every backer an electronic copy of his book \u2018StarSailing: Solar Sails and Interstellar Travel\u2019 to explain the background and potential of the Scout's and one of the Interplanetary CubeSat Mothership propulsion systems. This book describes technical topics in an accessible way and we'll release it to all our backers, one chapter per month. We'll announce other titles as the mission progresses.\nYou will be able to follow the build and testing of your spacecraft in labs we will use such as semiconductor fabrication (left), materials testing (right) and spacecraft assembly cleanrooms.\nOnline, we\u2019ll put cameras in cleanrooms and labs when spacecraft are being built, in test facilities (such as thermal vacuum test chambers and on a parabolic flight), and in mission control. \nWhen we release Scouts into space, a camera on the mothership will photograph them and send a picture from space back to you of your Scouts historic achievement, hopefully with a picture of your Scout in the foreground and the earth or the moon in the background.\nA commercial off the shelf (COTS) camera halfway through our preparations to configure it for operation in vacuum (left) and testing two examples in a radiation chamber (right).\nWe want to make our public labs (kindly hosted in the Watershed's digital creativity technology studio) available for all our backers to visit as often as they wish. We may have to limit daily numbers, and you will have to come to us at your own expense, but our goal is to make this one of the most open and accessible missions ever and to allow you to see your spacecraft in person before it flies if you wish.\nThroughout the project you\u2019ll be able to participate - hands on. You\u2019ll be able to customise your spacecraft as described elsewhere, but we\u2019ll also hold public events in places around the world such as digital cinemas, planetariums and science museums when key events happen. For example, when we are launched on our rocket, release the Earth Scouts to attempt re-entry, arrive at the moon and so on, and you\u2019ll be able to see inside the mission, interact with mission controllers and be involved in your space mission.\nA proof of concept public mission control installation in a digital cinema.\nYou will have your very own mission control application for your spacecraft for Android and iOS that will allow you to keep an eye on your (and if they permit it, your friends) spacecraft every step of the way.\nStudents from around the world have worked on this app, building on work we created for the 2011 and 2012 European Space Agency Summer of Code in Space. The app allows you to monitor every aspect of your spacecraft and mission including telemetry, running apps, badges for online space exploration courses we'll run, ground station status, even where your spacecraft is in space - simply hold your phone up to the sky and the augmented reality feature will point it out for you!\nWe\u2019ve taken great care to balance our team with techies and creatives. Our engineers see a re-entry and recovery from orbit test on a planet with an atmosphere; our games designers see a global treasure hunt of \u2018find the Scout\u2019 with prizes! Engineers \u2013 an optical telecommunications system; games designers \u2013 laser tag in spaaacceee. \nEach group\u2019s point of view is equally valid and we\u2019re going to make sure we keep a healthy balance of fun and seriousness throughout the triumphs and setbacks that will inevitably occur throughout such an ambitious mission.\nWe have games and events designed to keep you entertained and informed throughout the three years this mission will likely last (we\u2019re keeping most a secret as we want to frequently surprise and delight you!), and through innovations such as on-orbit app upgrades and collaborative science exchanges, we\u2019ll be able to update these ideas, events and experiments as the mission progresses to incorporate our, and more importantly, your and the scientific and engineering communities innovations.\nHow your money will be used\nWe can\u2019t do this mission without you as this is a high risk, high reward mission that is too unusual for traditional funders \u2013 we\u2019ve tried!\nLapping (thinning) a pocket spacecraft chip die using diamond \u2018sandpaper\u2019 (left) and testing the final part (right).\nIf we raise enough money to do this mission, we\u2019ll use it for:\npurchasing, building and shipping the rewards using in house facilities and print on demand suppliers\npurchasing components, assembling, integrating, and testing the spacecraft using low cost in house facilities and rent capital intensive equipment and facilities from places such as the Cornell Nanoscale Science and Technology Facility and the Cornell Center for Materials Research.\ndocumenting and placing the project in the public domain for anyone to replicate. We\u2019ll publish online, in bookstores, by mail order and at scientific conferences as per ITAR definitions of public domain.\ncurating events and the community throughout the mission using in house and external producers and event organisers\napply for a free ESA or NASA CubeSat launch. Members of our team have written proposals awarded launches in the US and Europe and we qualify for both programs as currently structured.\nall so we can build and launch your spacecraft and start exploring at scale.\nGetting involved\nSo, that\u2019s what we\u2019d like to do with your help.\nAmbitious? Yes.\nDoable? Absolutely!\nCan we do it without you? No!\nWhether you sponsor a Virtual Scout or are Earth\u2019s Ambassador, support a single Lunar Scout or an entire Lunar Scout Party, any and all support is valuable and this mission won\u2019t happen without it.\nWe\u2019re up for the challenge \u2013 we hope you are too.\nLet\u2019s kick start the personal interplanetary space age!\nThank you to all who have helped us get this far with their time, resources and inspiration:\nAbdulla, Ad, Adam, Adrian, Alex H(1), Alex H(2), Alex N, Alonzo, Andrew H, Andrew K, Andrew V, Andy, Artur, Ashkay, Ashley, Ben M, Ben T, Beth, Bob, Caroline, Charles, Cheryl, Chris B, Chris C, Christina, Claire H, Claire R, Claud, Claudio, Colin, Craig, Dale, Dan, Daron, Dick, Dominic, Ed B, Ed G, Einav, Francis, Fraser, Giannis, Graham, Hannah, Heidi, Helen, Jacob, James, Jamie C, Jamie D, Jerry, Jim, Johan, Johannes, John, Jon D, Jon T, Jordi, Kevin, Kirsten, Laura J, Laura K, Lou, Lawrence, Mathieu, Matt G, Matt S, Melania, Merlin, Michelle, Michael, Mike C, Mike K, Mike S, Nadeem, Nancy, Nicholas, Pakizat, Radim, Ravi, Ritchie, Rob, Roger, Ronan, Rupert, Sammy, Sara, \u015eenol, Sergio, Seth, Simon B, Simon D, Stephen, Tanvir, Tom, Tomas, Vanessa, Verity, Victoria F, Victoria T, Waheed, Will, Willem, Woody, Zahra, Zoe, those who need to remain anonymous, and anyone accidentally forgotten!\nPledge levels\nX = single item included with pledge level. 1-50 = quantity of multiple items.

Some potential problems cannot be managed however much we raise.\n\nWe've designed our terrestrial rewards to be mainly electronic to avoid production and shipping problems (and costs) and to minimise the potential for out of control production and/or shipping costs. Where we will ship physical rewards we have identified multiple suppliers with sufficient capacity to deliver them within the timescales we have stated. However we may be let down and have to find alternative suppliers. This shouldn't be too difficult but will take extra time.\n\nYou as a backer may be providing content such as images, software and hardware designs all of which it will be your responsibility to ensure are legal and meet community standards and guidelines that we will post when the online submission system goes live. We reserve the right to reject any image, software or hardware design for any reason and substitute it with a default image of our choosing. This is a family friendly project. \n\nThe extraterrestrial stuff is trickier. Very roughly, 50% of the CubeSats that have been launched have failed for reasons known and unknown. Interestingly, very roughly 50% of the extremely expensive interplanetary space missions have also failed. Failure is an option. You need to be comfortable with the fact that rockets blow up, spacecraft get delivered to the wrong orbit, launches are very often delayed, vested interests may try to frustrate the mission, unforeseen events and 'force majeure' occur, we can get unlucky with a micro-meteor or some other calamity out of our control that could halt the mission. We will not be able to offer refunds if such things occur, but we will do our best to deal with such problems if we can. We are also working with technology that is new and has not flown before and may not work when push comes to shove. We test for a reason and if testing brings up problems then we will have to rework and/or reengineer designs which will delay things. To minimise reputation and financial risk, we will not apply for or book a launch until we have flight hardware ready to go which may delay delivery dates.\n\nWe may choose (if we make our stretch goals) or need (if we don\u2019t receive or qualify for a NASA, ESA or similar launch if the rules change) to purchase a launch or launches privately. That, for the sort of orbit that we need for the lunar part of the mission, will probably only be possible if we can raise at least nine hundred thousand dollars more than our minimum goal, otherwise we will have to keep applying for free launches until we get one. If we get into that situation then we might spread different elements of the mission across different launches to different orbits to increase the likelihood of selection.\n\nUnfortunately the above are all the downside to being a pioneer and you should not back this project if you are not comfortable with accepting this risk. On the plus side, you will be part of a great adventure and if we do fail, our commitment to documenting every step of the process will allow us (or anyone else who wishes to try) to pick ourselves up, analyse what went wrong and try again, although we will almost certainly need to raise more money to do so.\n\nOur minimum fundraising target is the absolute minimum we need to deliver a bare bones project using mostly volunteer labour and calling in every favour we have in the industry if everything goes more or less perfectly to plan. We'll be living on bread and gruel, we'll execute our basic test plan and won't be able to insure against things such as rockets blowing up. However, this is pretty much the standard description of a CubeSat project and is something we are comfortable doing if we have to. You should only participate if you are happy with this.\n\nIf we make our stretch goal of GBP 1.6 million (about USD 2.5 million at current exchange rates), then we can do things such as insure our rocket launch, buy a ride-share rocket launch to a preferred orbit (assuming current market prices don't change too much), do a lot more testing and have more full time people working on the project, all of which will improve, but not guarantee, our chances of success.\n\nWe also require that you hold us harmless against any loss or liabilities arising from your participation in this KickStarter campaign and acknowledge that everything regarding the Pocket Spacecraft: Mission to the Moon KickStarter project including the website and rewards are provided 'as is'.\n\nHopefully that hasn't scared you off and you are now fully informed of all the risks and are still ready to help change space exploration forever!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Pocket Spacecraft\nFirst created \u00b7 12 backed\nPocket Spacecraft is a JA initiative.

It\u2019s called FOIA Machine, it's almost ready to launch and we need your help. \nSTRETCH GOAL: We quickly met our initial goal after we launched our Kickstarter project on July 16th. We now have a new stretch goal of $50,000, which will allow us to build out FOIA Machine more robustly, adding additional features and working more closely with the community of users to make FOIA Machine even stronger. Read more about our stretch goals in Update #3. \nMATCHING GRANT IF WE GET TO 2,000 BACKERS: The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation, which gave the first prototype grant to FOIA Machine, is offering CIR an additional $10,000 grant if we get to 2,000 backers. Building the FOIA Machine community will be essential to making the project a success. The fact that you are donating, in this case, is just as important as the amount of money you give. \nThank you to the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute at the University of Missouri for matching every dollar you donated up to our first $15,000.\n\"Free\" information is not always free\nThe Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), called \u201cFOY-ah\u201d by journalists, is at the heart of public demands for government accountability. This federal law says anyone can make a freedom of information request. Many states have similar legislation, often called sunshine laws. \nSounds easy, right? \nBut there\u2019s a catch: FOIA is riddled with exceptions, its rules differ widely from agency to agency and state to state, it often requires legal expertise to surmount bureaucratic brick walls, and \u201cfree\u201d requests can end up costing a bundle of money. Those who have abused public trust often are able to hide behind all of this bureaucracy. Their secrets, held in millions of government documents, simply won\u2019t reveal themselves. \nAn open online solution\nMeet FOIA Machine, an integrated web platform developed by veteran investigative reporters and technology pros. It's sponsored by the award-winning nonprofit The Center for Investigative Reporting.\nIt\u2019s like TurboTax for government records. We\u2019re streamlining the complicated process of filing and tracking public record requests, putting all of the steps, rules, exceptions and best practices in one place and allowing users to track requests on dashboards, receive alerts, share request blueprints and get social support and expertise from the FOIA Machine community. \nThis new platform is open and free for anyone, from citizen groups to reporters, the public, commercial media and educators. And it can be used to extract documents no matter the issue \u2013 human rights, the environment, political reform, public safety, privacy and more.\nIf this sounds like a smart idea to you, you\u2019re not alone. At last count, almost 800 reporters have signed up to start using FOIA Machine when it launches publicly. The seed money for the project ($47,000) was provided by the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation. \n\u201cFOIA Machine will aid journalists and private citizens in accessing millions of important governmental documents around the world that are covered by freedom of information laws which exist in more than 90 countries.\u201d  \u2013 The Knight Foundation, announcing its 2012 funding for the prototype \u201cto advance innovation in media and journalism\u201d \nSo what's left to do before launch?\nWhen we started this project in late 2012, it was called BirdDog and we thought it was only going to collect statistics on government response times to public records act requests. With the support of the Knight Foundation, we were able to expand our scope to include sending and generating information requests. \nOver the next few months, we built out new features and tested them in the newsroom of CIR until we had a workable prototype, now called FOIA Machine.\nToday, FOIA Machine can generate, edit and send requests to government agencies fairly well. It's useable but it's not ready for the general public.\nFOIA Request screen shot\nStarting a FOIA request\nPicking a topic\nThat's where Kickstarter comes in: we're asking for your help to finish development, improve design and pay for servers and data curation. \nWe have 15 users currently sending real freedom of information requests through FOIA Machine, but almost 800 people are still waiting to use it. And when we launch, that number will grow. \nHere's what we need to do to open this up to everyone:\nWe need to build a notification system to tell users when an agency responds to a request and to notify users when they need to follow up on outstanding requests.\nWe want to better track requests sent using FOIA Machine, allow users to override the status of a request, and then add data if they choose to follow up with an agency outside of FOIA Machine.\nWe need to expose more permissions so users can share their requests with whomever they want to.\nOur designer will help smooth over some of the user interface quirks.\nFOIA Machine lives on data and we need to continue adding into the database laws and information on government agencies that we're missing.\nWe need $55 - $150 per month, depending on traffic demands, for servers and a database.\nUsers will need a page to change their passwords and update their account information. We'll build that!\nOh, and it'd be great to get rid of bottlenecks that would stop us from expanding when FOIA Machine is used heavily.\n\nGot more questions? See our FAQ at the bottom of this page and read Update #3 to see what we plan to do with the extra funding beyond our initial Kickstarter goal.\nWho are we? \nFOIA Machine is currently housed at CIR (more about us in a minute) and is being built by a team of people working at a variety of news organizations:\nDjordje Padejski is FOIA Machine's founding director and community manager. He is a founder of Serbia\u2019s Center for Investigative Reporting and was a 2012 Knight Journalism fellow at Stanford University.\nShane Shifflett is FOIA Machine's developer and a data reporter at The Huffington Post. Before that, he was a data reporter for CIR. \nMichael Corey, a news applications developer for CIR, is an advisor to FOIA Machine and occasionally contributes code to the project.\nCoulter Jones is FOIA Machine's project manager and a data journalist at WNYC. Before that, he was an investigative reporter for CIR specializing in data analysis. \nDavid Suriano is CIR's master of user interface design. He is working to make sure FOIA Machine looks good and is easy to use.\nThe FOIA Machine advisory group includes Chase Davis of The New York Times, David Herzog of the University of Missouri, T. Christian Miller of ProPublica, and Martha Mendoza of the Associated Press.\nCIR has taken on FOIA Machine because we believe that journalism that moves citizens to action is an essential pillar of democracy. To correct injustices, people need to know what's really happening. FOIA Machine is all about bringing previously hidden information to light. \nBased in the San Francisco Bay Area, CIR\u2019s reporters, editors, producers and data analysts produce deep investigative stories that make an impact. CIR\u2019s staff are experts at using freedom of information laws for investigations into important issues such as the mistreatment of U.S. veterans, abuse in state hospitals, incompetence and corruption at the U.S. border, and charity fraud. \nWe are the only nonprofit journalism organization in the country with the in-house ability to produce stories on every available media platform \u2013 from print to video, radio and interactive data applications \u2013 making our reporting accessible and engaging and presented for maximum impact. We have worked with more than 300 news outlets, including FRONTLINE, ABC, Univision, Al-Jazeera English, The Young Turks, Stars and Stripes, the San Francisco Chronicle, KQED, NPR, The Daily Beast, CNN, YouTube and more. \nCIR is home to FOIA Machine until it is ready to go public (that\u2019s where you come in!), when it will be handed over to the national, nonprofit Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE), which offers its hundreds of members around the world access to its extensive resource center, conferences and specialized training. \nWhat\u2019s this about a match for my Kickstarter gift? \nIRE is based at the University of Missouri, which is also home to the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute. The Institute generously offered to match all Kickstarter contributions up to $15,000, enough to launch FOIA Machine publicly. \n\"FOIA Machine is a tool that will have immediate and powerful benefits for all news organizations,\" said Randy Picht, the institute\u2019s executive director. \"We're excited to help get the project finished and into the hands of reporters and editors.\" \nNow that we've exceeded that goal, the Knight Foundation is offering CIR an additional $10,000 grant if we get to 2,000 backers on Kickstarter.\nWhy should humans help build FOIA Machine? \nFOIA became law July 4, 1966 \u2013 and it\u2019s been fighting for its life ever since. Presidents and Congress have tried to make it harder to use. Sometimes they\u2019ve been successful; sometimes they haven\u2019t. State sunshine laws frequently come under attack as well. CIR and FOIA Machine will help keep the laws strong by using them tenaciously and teaching others how to do the same. Now that you\u2019ve celebrated the Fourth of July with sparklers and picnics, declare your independence from government secrets \u2013 help us launch FOIA Machine. Not only will you feel good about helping to strengthen the democratic process, but you'll receive some pretty cool rewards to help you fly your freedom of information flag.\nFOIA Machine Stress Reliever\nFOIA Machine Tote Bag\nJ.

The POWERQUBE is a revolutionary, electrical power and charging system that allows you to charge up to nine devices simultaneously through three USB ports and six electrical outlets.  The sleek design of the POWERQUBE means you don\u2019t have to try to hide it. It is compact enough that you can place it on your desk, conference table, kitchen counter, nightstand, and dorm room desk; anywhere you need power management and USB charging capabilities. At 5.5\u201d by 2.75\u201d, it can easily fit into your backpack or briefcase.\nCharging my iPhone and iPad at my desk\nThe POWERQUBE is the only product on the market today that allows you to plug in 6 devices at one time while charging 3 devices, including 2 iPads, in any of the 3 USB ports. How does it do that you ask? It\u2019s a smart device that senses the additional power requirements and sends the power to the USB port eliminating the need to mark the USB ports with \"Standard\" and \"Tablet\" indicators.\nWith 5 feet of cable and a flat wall plug, you can easily plug in the POWERQUBE behind a desk or piece of furniture and still put the device directly on your desk, conference table, countertop or nightstand with ease.\nCheck out our demonstration video link below and see for yourself how the POWERQUBE works.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqtX__DYhA0\nWe started this project in February 2012.  Initially we set out to develop a retractable in home extension cord device.  Our first prototype was a crude initial proof of concept which did not really prove to be anything other than ugly.\nOur Proof of Concept Prototype #1\nOur second prototype was better looking but still way too big.  We realized it needed to be much smaller.  We decided to eliminate the retractor capabilities and go to a static cord storage system.\nPrototype #2 with retractable cable\nPrototype #2 Top View\nWe continued to make progress with our 3rd prototype but we still needed to reduce the size plus no one really liked the static cord storage feature.\nPrototype 3\nPrototype 2 Cad Drawing\nThat's when it hit us to change the extension cord to an all-in-one device that would revolutionize the power strip from an ugly under the table device you hide into the POWERQUBE...a beautiful device that would handle the power and charging needs of the 21Century home, office, business or school. \nThe POWERQUBE\nPrototype 4 is what you see before you.

Of the project's goal, every penny will go towards production costs--art, shipping, and component quality.\nThe intention is to provide three different KREMLIN games in one box.\n#1: The 'original' with fictional politicians, set in a USSR where KGB investigations send those found guilty to Siberia.  This version will have victory conditions based on the original Fata Morgana rules.\n#2: A version inspired by the Avalon Hill variant titled 'Revolution'.  Set in the 1920s, it uses historical politicians as well as fictional politicians.  It's a more violent game as those arrested by the KGB are shot and removed from the game\n#3: A new version, set in the modern USSR and Russia, an era of entrenched bureaucracy and alternatives for escaping KGB persecution.  This version introduces the concept of \"Going into Exile\" to avoid SIberia.  It also includes modern politicians from the 1960s onwards, whether it is Kosygin or Putin and Gorbachev.\n(Politicians from all three sets)\nKremlin is played for up to ten turns, ending as soon as the Party Chief successfully waves three times at the May Day Parade or when so many politicians are dead or in Siberia that the Party Chief can disband the Politburo and take complete power for himself.\nEach turn has phases.  The most important of these are the KGB trials (which can send party members to Siberia or the cemetery) and the Defense Ministry's Spy Investigations which can also force politicians on a winter's gulag holiday.  With the KGB, the catch is that the higher up the ladder the target, the more difficult to bring down, and Party Chief's tend to change KGB leaders who take shots at the top...  For the Defense Minister, his investigations require a trial to be successful--and a guilty vote, and that isn't always possible in the Central Committee.\nThe catch?  Players allot influence secretly at the start of the game and don't reveal it until it is used, meaning no one knows who controls the KGB or any other ministry, not until Influence is revealed--and even then, who knows who still has undeclared influence on that person?  It is possible that players can swap control back and forth over the KGB chief even as he is trying to determine who to assassinate!\nOnce the carnage is done, players have to survive the ravages of aging--and every time a politician takes action, he ages faster than normal...your 50 yr old star of the party?  Well, suddenly he's acting like he's 83, Comrade.  Life near the top will do that to you.  In the Health phase, politicians may die or grow sick--sick politicians can choose to go to the hospital, but while there, they exert no influence and their responsibilities pass on to other politicians. Sometimes this means your man must make the heroic sacrifice to the Rodina and remain on the job even while at death's door.\nArt from the top and bottom of the Politburo\nOnce we know who is still alive, the Party Chief is allowed to move politicians between posts.  After all, he's in control of the bureaucracy.  He can move people up and down, and when he's done, upper ministers do so as well--but can only affect politicians below them on the food chain.  Heck, politicians can even sponsor comrades in exile in SIberia to come back to the People.  Of course, each person you bring back ages you five years....want to bring back five?  Age 25 years in the blink of an eye, Tovarich.\n(This is a rough draft of one of the Intrigue cards)\nIntrigue cards allow you to take control of situations or foil other players' schemes.  In one of the older versions, you could have things like Chernobyl take place in 1920.  That's been corrected--so that while events may be the same, they have now been made era-appropriate.\nThe turn ends with the May Day Parade.  If the party chief is healthy, he can wave throughout the day making people happy--clearly our socialist union is prospering.  But if he's sick, sometimes he leaves early and is unable to wave, sending doubts through the ranks.  If a faction (player) earns three waves, they win the game.\nSo what are the goals?\n$9000: This is the campaign goal.  This goal will allow for printing and manufacture of the game, making sure to provide high-quality components, as well as the art and layout to go with.  Reaching the goal means all three versions of the game will be in the box along with the necessary politicians and action cards.\n$11,000: If the campaign hits $11,000, Kickstarter supporters ONLY will receive six additional fictional politicians for use in their games.\n$13,000: If we reach this level, ALL KREMLIN sets will have six player-aid mats included, meaning a handy place for the sequence of play and meaning you don't have to pass around the health chart from within the rules!\n$14,000: If we can reach $14,000, Kickstarter supporters ONLY will receive six historical politicians for EACH other era (the 1920s and the modern)\n$16,000: At $16k, we'll add in six additional event cards for Kickstarter supporters ONLY.\nTo be clear--the extra cards for these levels will never be available in stores.  They're only for KS supporters (and for Jolly Roger to sell at Origins)--nowhere else.\n$30,000: Kickstarter supporters will receive a sleeve for their copy of the game with different art than the box cover.  This cover will never be duplicated.\nFront of the $30k stretch-goal sleeve\n$35,000: It's inconvenient to share just a single d20.  At $35,000, copies of Kremlin will come with 6x d20, one for each possible player.\nIf you have American dollars, Tovarich, I can help you get what you want.\nDoes this sound fun?  I hope so--because KREMLIN is a lot of chaos, a lot of backstabbing.  It's one of my favorite games of all time.  We've got many different reward levels for people willing to support, trying to take into account the needs of international backers as well as those interested in other Jolly Roger projects....details are on the rewards page.\n$2: A postcard.\n$25 or $40: A copy of the game postage paid.\n$40 or $60: A copy of Kremlin and another Jolly Roger product, still postage paid.\n$96: A copy of Kremlin and Pirates vs. Dinosaurs (but in the US only I'm afraid)\n$120 or $160: Six copies of the game.\n$250: We'll send you a copy of the game and a print of one of the portraits used in the game.  The catch here is that we won't make any other prints available after this.  ...that's about as limited edition as you can get!\nJolly Roger Games is in its 16th year producing games.

This June, Patrick Mihalek and his friend Todd Trainor, both from Brighton, are planning to recover a 70-year old North American B-25J Mitchell bomber (USAAF # 44-30733) from her remote crash site in Alaska. \nFor years this famous World War II era bomber has been nicknamed \u201cSandbar Mitchell\u201d after she was forced to land on a sandbar in the Tanana River outside of Fairbanks after a double-engine failure shortly after takeoff in 1969.\nUsing parts from other salvaged B-25\u2019s and hunting for additional parts, the two hope to rebuild her to flying status.  She will fly as Sandbar Mitchell under the public trust for the non-profit Warbirds of Glory Museum.\nBecome part of the Sandbar Mitchell Support team through your donation.  As part of the Support Team your donation will bring the remains of Sandbar Mitchell to a Michigan workshop so she can be restored to flying condition.\nThe Passion\nMy name is Patrick Mihalek. I have been passionate about aviation since I was a child.\nMy entire life is about aviation. After college I received my A&P certification and started a small business with a big dream to restore warbirds. For the past five years I have done that. I have worked my way up from nothing. I now travel frequently to maintain warbirds and in my shop I am restoring a 1940 NA-64 Yale for a customer.\nI always dreamed about restoring a B-25 Mitchell bomber, but never thought it would actually happen, until now. I have found a B-25J Mitchell bomber that can be recovered from Alaska and restored to flying condition using parts that I have collected over the past few years.\nWe are two guys from Brighton with proven passion for aviation history and shallow pockets. We cannot do this by ourselves.  We need your help to make this succeed.  \nThe Airplane\nFirst let us tell you about the airplane. This plane is nicknamed \u201cSandbar Mitchell\u201d because she is a B-25J Mitchell bomber that crash-landed on a sandbar in the Tanana River.\nAfter serving her duties with the USAAF from 1944 to 1959, Sandbar Mitchell continued to serve her country as fire-suppression bomber, Tanker #8. Owned by Edgar Thorsrud, she was one of several B-25s used in Alaska in the late 1960\u2019s to help fight forest fires. On June 27th, 1969 she was called into duty to help fight the Manley Hot Springs fires. Shortly after takeoff she experienced double-engine failure. The pilot, Herm Gallaher had very few options, so instead of landing in the river or in the forest he landed gear up on a small sandbar in the middle of the Tanana River.\nHerm walked away, but the right wing was damaged and the forward fuselage was wrinkled. After her engines, propellers and wheels were removed, she was abandoned.\nPlease watch this 4-minute video to learn more about B-25J Sandbar Mitchell and our involvement in the education of our community's youth.\nPatrick and Logan forming a piece for a WWII airplane.\nThroughout the next 44 years many people visited Sandbar Mitchell. Unfortunately, many have taken souvenirs and sadly cut off her outer wings, forward and aft section. Fortunately the heart and soul of Sandbar Mitchell, the valuable center section, still remains on the sandbar today.  She is in remarkably good condition.\nThe Challenge\nThe crash site is now a tiny but heavily wooded island.  There are no roads nearby and the Tanana River can be very treacherous and wild.   The only way to get to the site is by boat or by helicopter.\nAlthough we have been involved in aviation our entire lives, we do not pretend to know how to recover a big, heavy World War II bomber from a remote crash site. We have spent months seeking ideas and suggestions from many aviation friends. We believe we have a creative plan to recover this aircraft and bring it back to Michigan.\nThe Plan\nThis is our creative idea: Our plan is to travel to the crash-site on a remote island in the middle of the Tanana River near Fairbanks Alaska. The Recovery Team will consist of 10 to 16 volunteers. We cannot afford a helicopter, so we will be using an airboat. There is no electricity, running water, shelter, or any modern conveniences on the island. Just trees, mosquitoes, bears, and moose. We will have to pee and poop in the woods. We will go there in June\u2026 so it will be daylight about 20 hours a day. Using basic tools and creative problem-solving we plan to remove as many parts from Sandbar Mitchell as we can.  In the end, we will be left with the core center section which cannot be easily disassembled any further. It will weigh about 2000 pounds and will be about 28 feet long, 8 feet wide and 7 feet tall. The parts that we remove we can put on the airboat and taken back to the mainland. But the large and heavy center section will be a challenge.\nWe have two plans. Plan A, the cheap plan, is to build a large wooden sled under the center section. Then we will wait until the Tanana River freezes next winter. Then like you see on Discovery Channel Ice Road Truckers, we will pull the sled and the heavy center section down the frozen river with a snow machines to the mainland. Talk about delayed gratification.\nPlan B would be to find somebody to donate time on a large helicopter to airlift the center section off of the remote island.  But that will be expensive. Not many helicopters can lift 2000 pounds.  But if somebody offers to provide the air lift service we will say \u201cYES\u201d!\nOnce we get it all back to the mainland, we plan to put all the pieces on a flatbed truck to transport to Michigan. We\u2019ll have to make crates and boxes for the small stuff, so it won\u2019t blow away.\nAlso, we\u2019d like to see if we can find some of the big pieces that have been previously removed from the wreck. If we can find them, we\u2019d like to see if we can buy them back so that as many of the pieces of Sandbar Mitchell are back together again.\nThe Team\nPatrick is 30 years old. He was born to love aviation. He is a certified FAA mechanic (with Aircraft and Power Plant Certification) He has his own little business called Legends of Aces Aviation where he restores and maintains warbird aircraft.\nTodd is 49 years old. He grew up with a father that tinkered with and flew a small two-seater airplane that was powered by a little two-cylinder engine. We have a picture of Todd at 2 years old trying to help dad repair his airplane with a pair of pliers. Todd now works in the IT industry as a certified project manager. He is also the founding Director of the Aeronca Aircraft History Museum, an online virtual museum that supports the preservation of antique civilian airplanes.\nThis whole project started in January when Todd received a phone call from a friend in Fairbanks. Actually, it goes back before that. Patrick knew about Sandbar Mitchell for over 10 years. She was always in the back of his mind, but recovery never seemed possible. You know how life always seems to have other priorities. Then in May of 2012 he stumbled across a 1992 magazine article that featured the crashed B-25. It was like a sign. Then when Todd got a call from our Fairbanks friend and asked him about Sandbar Mitchell. He knew about it! He gave us the name of another friend that knew more. And you know the rest. We have spent nearly every waking hour since that cold January day working on this.\nThe Excitement\nOur team member, 15-year old Logan was recently interviewed by our local radio station.  Unscripted, listen to his excitement about going to Alaska this June.\nThe Achievements\nWe have obtained the ownership rights from the Thorsrud family.\nWe have filed for and received approval for the necessary permits.\nWe traveled to Alaska in April to inspect the wreck for ourselves.(Yes\u2026 we brought home some pieces.)\nWe flew over it in a small airplane and took pictures from 1000 feet.\nWe talked to the chief mechanic of Sandbar Mitchell who was the person that recovered the engines after the crash. Luckily, he has pictures!\nWe consulted with many people in the Fairbanks area, built a lot of relationships and made many new friends in Alaska and within the aviation community.\nWe built the core Recovery Team. We are still seeking others who want to join the Recovery team. We have 10 slots to fill. Wanna go?\nWe created a Facebook page at www.facebook.com/sandbarmitchell\nWe created a website dedicated to this effort at www.sandbarmitchell.org.\nWe formed a museum, the Warbirds of Glory Museum, with the express purpose of restoring her to flying condition over the next few years.\nWe have been speaking at EAA meetings, and having open houses.\nWe started collecting donations for the recovery and future restoration from anyone that believes in us.\nWe created a video and put it on YouTube.  Yep.. that\u2019s Todd\u2019s voice.\nWe were interviewed by Public Radio at KUAC in Alaska and broadcasted on April 1st.\nWe were interviewed by several local newspapers.

It's an original story about a guy coming back to his hometown, getting back in touch with old friends, and trying to reunite his old band. It's a film based around the kind of intense friendships, emotions, and rivalries that only playing rock music can create.\nSince this is my directorial debut (and you only get one), I tried to come up with a project that I really cared about. Making a film is long and challenging, and I knew I would need a story that put some fire in my belly to keep going. \nIt all starts with a story\nThe genesis of We Had This Band was in my desire to make a documentary about the brilliant bands that I grew up with, many of whom got signed, toured, grew up, broke up, moved, and faded away. As I tried to plan a documentary, it became clear that there was a story here that I wanted to be telling. So I started looking at my inability to be objective as a strength.\nI came up with the first outline and beat sheet last August, showed it to  my good friend and actor/producer Andy Wagner, and right away we knew we were on to something. I wrote 69 pages of a first draft in a week, and Wagner said to me, \"Let's do this.\"\nI finished the first draft in October, cleaned it up, and after the holidays we Andys made it our mission to make a movie in 2013.\nWith an Executive Producer on board, we searched for other great collaborators. Right away, I thought of Jane Noseworthy and Julie Carlson. Both of them are gorgeous, talented actresses that I knew from appearing with them in plays in Los Angeles. Wagner and I also roped in our old improv teammate Omar Najam, whose 2 Broke Geeks Youtube channel has over 50,000 total views. We did a few readings of the script, I did 5 or 6 drafts, and things started happening.\nOur four leads Julie, Andy W, Jane, and Andy S.\nGetting the right music\nWe've already done a lot of work on songs for the film, since it's such a music-centered story. I was able to get some of my favorite bands that are either from Bloomington-Normal or whose members came from Central IL to contribute music. So far, we have been talking with Steven, Red Hot Valentines, Swim Ignorant Fire, the Spend, and HeWhoCorrupts to appear on the soundtrack(but I have my eyes on even more bands and singers).\nWe contacted Jonah Matranga (Far, Onelinedrawing, Gratitude) to play a role in the film and contribute some music and to our great pleasure he is joining us for the project(!!!)\nAnd since this was a music about a band, we figured... why not put a real band together? \nBurn Daylight performs at KING KING in Hollywood\nBurn Daylight is our new band, and we've been rehearsing with Murv Douglas (Lords of Acid, Cage9, RevCo) and AAron Rossi (Ministry, Prong) to get our songs ready for shooting this summer. In fact, we've already played in front of an audience and have gigs booked at the Whiskey A Go-Go and King King in Los Angeles.\nAn honest-to-goodness benefit show\nSince the film features a big concert, we have decided to put on a real show at the Castle Theater in Bloomington(where I watched Pinocchio as a child). The Castle has become a great music venue; Chris Golwitzer (Werepire Day, Steven, First Grade Crush) and Zak Etscheid (music booker for Firehouse Pizza and Pub) are helping us organize the show. Our concert, the Tornado Belly Rock Festival will be a donation-based free show to benefit charity held on July 7.\nOur show will be the second night of a 2-day festival; Jammin' for Hammitt will feature acoustic rock at the Castle on Saturday, July 6, with the proceeds to benefit Hammitt School at The Baby Fold. Tornado Belly will feature loud, electric sets with some bands playing their first local show in years. Sunday's donations will benefit Hammitt School as well, and sales of our movie-themed merchandise will benefit the Pratt Music Foundation, which gives music lessons to talented kids with financial need.\nWe've arranged for the great local record store Waiting Room Records to appear in the film, and I'm personally looking forward to highlighting the Central Illinois music scene that gave me so many of my formative experiences and friendships growing up.\nBuilding a great team\nWe're also going to be bringing in production personnel that I've worked with in film and television in Los Angeles, folks that have worked on sets of network TV like Scandal, live events like the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and even live theater alongside Neil LaBute. And we'll be bringing on board students at Illinois State University and Illinois Wesleyan University to provide them with professional work experience to add to their resumes.\nAnd I've teamed up with some extremely talented artists in Illinois, Michigan, Los Angeles, even Australia to create unique art pieces that will appear as our concert posters, album art, band logos, and more.\nSo in about a month, we'll be bringing our crew together in Bloomington-Normal to prepare for our shoot.\nI'm making the movie I always wanted to make.  But I could really use your help. And we've come up with a perfectly pleasing package of perks to make it worth your while.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom scheduling to permits to contracts to releases, making an independent film is a risky endeavor. Andy Wagner and I have done everything in our power to manage the roadblocks ahead of us. \n\nI have reached out to my colleagues from past and current Los Angeles-based jobs at TV Guide Network and Scandal (ABC), and Wagner at Castle (ABC) and The Newsroom (HBO) to assemble a talented crew. We will be shooting fast and cheap with a crew experienced in television (like Alfred Hitchcock did when making Psycho), and many of our department heads and crew members will want to finish on time so that they can go back to work after hiatus.\n\nIn addition, I have many friends and family members in Bloomington-Normal and Chicago who will be able to help this project become a reality. We have already cast several local actors, and will soon be having another casting call in Normal and one in Chicago.\n\nPlus, Andy Wagner has produced several short films, and I have directed a ten minute short and DPed several internet shorts. And after our readings, rehearsals, notes, and band practices, we know this piece like the back of our hands. So in a pinch, we can make this film with nothing more than we have now. \n\nHowever, our goal is to make a film that can be shown in a movie theater, than can make an impact at film festivals, and that has the power to speak to a wider audience. We can do that, but only with the support of other people who believe in this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Andy Steadman\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nAndy Steadman grew up in Normal, Illinois, where he attended University High School.

We really want to do all the research and drawings for the vehicle and artillery book. This will include railway guns and a variety of artillery weapons from the 1880-1914 period. Real world statistics and stats for The Sword and the Flame will be included. We intend to have at least 200 artillery weapons detailed. Some of this information will never have been published in English before! Certainly data on even the American artillery of this period has been very hard to come by. We will have illustrations including period pictures, pictures of modern surviving examples, period technical drawings and Arun's tremendous 3D technical drawings. The 3D drawings will allow us to produce 3D models in various scales using 3D printing technology.\n   Again, this work will be one that both historical and Steampunk gamers and modelers will enjoy and find extremely useful.\nThanks for giving us a final look, and helping us out in the last few days.\n__._,_.___\nSo here is what the Scarab Art for the sherry glasses looks like\nHow we are Different!

The reference is specifically written to support the role playing game Stars of Empire and The Hive and the Flame miniatures game-both of which are table top games. It can be used for any Victorian Science Fiction or Steampunk  settings as well as many traditional science fiction ones. Referees and Players will find this an extraordinary place to adventure, detailed and playable.\nWHAT HAVE PEOPLE SAID ABOUT OUR PREVIOUS GAMES?\nComments from Amazon\nFlying Machines of the Worlds 1902\nThis is fun book packed with info, loads of fun just to sit and read. Would work for almost any system.\n Stars of Empire\nI finally got to play in a game of this. It was great! The book gave the GM enough material to create a completely believable world and made it challenging to get through. The GM did the character generation and I felt that all were well balanced with skills and equipment. Great game all around. I can't wait to play it again!\nSettings are fantastic, yet realistic. Scenarios are engaging and well thought out. All in all a great work\n   Venus in Hive, Queen and Country\nUnlike that world in our reality the fictional planet supports complex life; the land has balloon trees and huge arthropods, the seas giant marine creatures, huge floating creatures fill its clouds.\nThe book will pull off the cloud cover and offer a detailed look at Venus.    This volume will detail the Climate, Cultures and Creatures of Venus. This planet will be dealt with in depth. Venus in the Hive, Queen and Country Universe is a world of deserts, oceans and cloud forests.  It has been partially terraformed by aliens in humanity's distant past. In addition to its native life there are many species transported from Earth and still more that have been genetically engineered. Finally the human slaves of these aliens were abandoned to a cruel fate centuries ago. Since that time the surviving humans have escaped extinction and formed cultures across the planet.\nInto this tapestry of alien creatures and exotic cultures the Great Powers of Earth land and begin colonization, weaving their complex stories into the fabric of Venusian life. \nThe Hive, Queen and Country Game Universe started out as fairly simple idea and it has just grown and grown. Initially it began as a few friends discussing how to spice up British Colonial gaming by adding giant arthropods. It has evolved into an extremely active Yahoo! Group with over 30,000 messages discussing every aspect of Victorian gaming, history, technology and society. Three products have already been published; the core Role Playing Game Rules-Stars of Empire, The Hive and the Flame miniatures rules, which won the Best Science Fiction Supplement of 2011 from The Miniatures Page and most recently Flying Machines of the Worlds 1902.\nSee we can dress in period outfits at conventions!\nHive, Queen and Country is Hard Science Victorian Science Fiction. Care has been taken to make the Hive, Queen and Country one of the most detailed and internally consistent role playing universes ever published. We have been doing this by making everyone on the Yahoo! Group a contributor, if they desire. They vet all the ideas presented and produce many of the ideas that have seen print. Members of the list offer expertise in many many fields, from Victorian history to technology, astrophysics and period military information. The list is open to anyone, and is extremely active, knowledgeable and polite.

It is that simple. Our first three books were put together with as little money as possible. We still put out products we are very proud of, but we want to raise the bar.  We try and get as much art as we can from public domain sources but we love to showcase the stunning work of our artist partners. We want our products to be visually appealing and well organized in addition to providing players with some of the most detailed and consistent Victorian Science Fiction role playing materials. We want our customers to have it all!\nWe strive to produce products that we would be pleased with if we bought them. We do everything we can to load them with useful information and keep the costs as low as possible.\nStretch Goal number one! Unlocked at 4,000.00\nOur First Stretch Goal will be our second technical reference; Land Fighting Machines and Artillery of the Worlds 1902. This volume concentrates on the various steam powered fighting machines and artillery weapons of the HQC universe. When we do the graphics for this though YOU get an added bonus! Our 3D graphics will translate into 3D printed models from http://www.shapeways.com/shops/objects. So if this project flies it will provide not only two books but a large number of scale steam technology vehicles. Arun has produced wonderful airship and naval vessel models in everything from 1/6000 scale to 15mm. We will be doing the same thing with the ground machines.\nRocket Armed British Steamtank\nThe second a technical volume Land Fighting Machines and Artillery of the Worlds 1902, covers the armored fighting vehicles of the HQC universe. In addition the book will also cover artillery weapons from 1880-1902. This will include a large number of historical weapons from the period as well as steampunk and alien ordnance. Up to this point the historical artillery of the late Victorian period has been poorly covered in published materials. We hope to do this interesting subject justice as well as presenting the invented vehicles and weapons of our fictional game universe as well.\n32 Pdr SBBL gun at Fort Nelson\nSecond Stretch Goal-Hordes of Bug Miniatures-Unlocked at 5,000.00\nOur second Stretch Goal is to find a caster for our line of bug miniatures and get them back in production!

They need a casting company to call home, so they can multiply and infest gaming tables across the land!\nHordes of bugs!\nOur third and fourth Stretch Goals will see production of additional source books. The two we have planned are Armies of the Hive Wars and Armies of Venus. These will detail the various military units in service between 1890 and 1910. These will include orders of battle, uniforms, equipment and tactics of the numerous armed forces of the various powers and other lesser nations. Also included will be details of the Hives, both the original one in Devon and the many that appeared in South and Central America at the turn of the century.\nArmies of the Hive War at 6,000.00\nArmies of Venus at 7,000.00\nIf we continue to do well we will be putting out additional books (we are a traditional sort of gaming company!)\nStretch Goal Five-unlocked at 10,000.00\nSpacecraft, Spaceports and Space Travel-1870-1915 \nStretch Goal Six-Unlock at 15,000.00\nCities of Earth, Venus and Mars\nThis is the Terrain being offered as a reward.

Well now you can!\n3Doodler is the world\u2019s first and only 3D Printing Pen. Using ABS plastic (the material used by many 3D printers), 3Doodler draws in the air or on surfaces. It\u2019s compact and easy to use, and requires no software or computers. You just plug it into a power socket and can start drawing anything within minutes.\nThe latest model 3Doodler\nOh, and it\u2019s also the most affordable way to 3D print\u2026 by a looong way! With 3Doodler we\u2019re making fun 3D creation accessible to everyone.\nHow does it work?\nIf you can scribble, trace or wave a finger in the air you can use a 3Doodler.\n3Doodler in action\nAs 3Doodler draws, it extrudes heated plastic, which quickly cools and solidifies into a strong stable structure. This allows you to build an infinite variety of shapes and items with ease! Most people will instantly be able to trace objects on paper, and after only a few hours of practice you will be able to make far more intricate objects.\n3Doodler is a brand new way of creating objects and artistic works. Whether you are an artist, hobbyist or 3D printing fanatic, we can\u2019t wait to see what you 3Doodle!\nSix little men and the other one said... 3Doodler! 3Doodler!\nWhat can I make with 3Doodler? \nThere are many ways 3Doodler can be used. 3Doodles can be created as flat forms and peeled off a piece of paper, as freestyle 3D objects, or in separate parts, ready to be joined together using the 3Doodler. The creative opportunities are endless, including:\nBasic 3D shapes and 3D models\nJewellery, pendants and hanging ornaments\nDecorative art and fridge magnets\nPersonalization of everyday objects (iPhone cases, laptops, pens, etc.)\nA mini Eiffel Tower or a soccer pitch for your Lego men\nAnd much much more\u2026\n3Doodler works on almost any surface, including plastic, allowing users to personalize items such as iPhone cases, or anything else they feel like 3Doodling on. 3Doodler can even be used for minor repair work.\n3Doodler \"stencils\"\nWe\u2019re particularly excited about 3Doodler \"stencils\" - sophisticated print-out stencil kits to help you create awesome objects (like our Eiffel Tower). We'll be making these available online for everyone. Simply print it out, 3Doodle each part according to the stencil and then join them with your 3Doodler. As time goes by we, and the 3Doodler community, will be able to create hundreds (maybe thousands) of stencil kits that can easily be emailed and shared with friends. We\u2019ll be hosting these on our website, the3Doodler.com, for anyone to download and use for free.\n2 ft Eiffel Tower Stencil\nWe\u2019re looking forward to seeing what people create and supporting 3Doodler communities everywhere.\nThe Sellers of Etsy Special\nWe're collaborating with some fantastic sellers on Etsy, all wire artists, to showcase how 3Doodler can be used to create beautiful objects and pieces of art. We're thrilled to be working with Bud Bullivant, Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight), Nakisha and Ele McKay to bring our vision to life. \nWire Art by Ruth Jensen (Sparkflight) - sparkflight.etsy.com\nWire Art by Bud Bullivant (wiredbybud.etsy.com)\nBud and Ruth will be creating a limited edition run of the first professional 3Doodles (see the Seller on Etsy Special Reward above). The ideas are already flowing, and we'll be working together to bring you a truly unique 3Doodle creation from these top artists. The expected size of the 3Doodle is approximately 4 x 2 inches. It will be beautifully boxed and shipped by August.\n\nNakisha will be producing an exclusive template for anyone ordering a 3Doodler. Created especially for you, the template will showcase 3Doodler's capabilities and allow you to make your very own artist-designed 3Doodles. And we'll be announcing a special collaboration with Ele shortly.\nWire Art by Ele McKay (elemckay.etsy.com)\nWire Art by Nakisha (wireanimals.etsy.com)\nMore to come on all of this in an Update! Bud, Ruth, Nakisha, Ele, we're truly grateful for your support!\n3Doodler Components & Accessories:\nThe pen: The 3Doodler pen is 180mm by 24mm. The pen weighs less than 200 grams or 7 ounces (the weight of a typical apple), although the exact weight will depend on the final shell specifications once in production. And we are using a universal power supply, so provided you have the correct adapter for your country, 3Doodler will work just fine on 110v or 240v.\nThe evolution of 3Doodler\n3Doodler is not a toy for children (it's recommended for ages 12+). While the plastic extruded from 3Doodler is safe to touch once it has left the pen, the pen itself has a metal tip that can get as hot as 270C. There is no reason for any user to touch the tip while in use, but safety comes first, and we are creating a video series that will explain how to use the 3Doodler, covering off the different techniques and safety precautions necessary.\nThe Ink (i.e. ABS/PLA plastic): The 3Doodler uses 3mm ABS or PLA plastic as its \"ink\" - just like a 3D printer. Each 3Doodler backed on Kickstarter comes with at least one bag of plastic; each bag will contain ten 1ft strands of plastic; and each 1 ft strand produces approximately 11 ft of 3Doodling fun... yes, you read that right, a foot of plastic goes a very long way in the 3Doodler.\nSome suitably attractive photos of ABS plastic\nABS is one of the most common plastics around. It's used in most of the plastic stuff around you. PLA is what we call a \"bioplastic\". It's made from corn, is biodegradable and has a lower melting temperature than ABS. We are offering both choices as each has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nWe plan to offer plastic sold in strands (making it easy to switch colours and create different styles), but 3Doodler-compatible plastic is also available in 1kg spools from between $30 to $55 from a variety of sources... such as here, here, here, here, and here. And for some stunning PLA have a look here. This is no ink cartridge model!\nFun Fact: The average 1kg spool of 3mm ABS contains approximately 360-370 feet of plastic. That's approximately 3,960-4,070 feet of 3Doodling, or 3 Empire State Buildings with enough to spare for several more weeks of doodling.\nThe Future of 3Doodling: We have a ton of ideas for add-ons and accessories that will make 3Doodler even cooler, more useful, fun, and generally awesomer (is that a word?). We hope that the 3Doodler will be a big success so that we can share all our ideas and offer you even more 3Doodling fun...\nPete & Max, Inventors of 3Doodler\nWe have a lot we want to tell you about 3Doodler, so we\u2019ve created an extensive FAQ to answer all of your questions. And we\u2019re on standby to respond to any other queries you may have!\n*The 3Doodler was created at the Artisans Asylum in Boston. The whole team would like to thank the Artisans Asylum for their help and support. Without hacker-spaces like this, projects such as 3Doodler could not happen.

We held back so that we could ensure the prototype worked perfectly (check out the video, it does!) and so that we could speak to more factories (and make related visits to Hong Kong and China). Comfortable that we can deliver this, we\u2019re now launching 3Doodler! \n\nBelow are a couple of the main challenges we will tackle:\n\nChoice of Factory: As with any physical item there are a number of challenges to getting it right. We have been part of numerous projects that have made it through development, into the factory production phase, and then into consumer hands. While our experiences have helped prepare us to avoid major pitfalls, we have been very selective in our choice of factory, choosing a partner that we know we can work with and that is perfect for our needs. They are large enough to scale 3Doodler, but without being so big that we'll be lost amidst the shop floor, and they have a great development team. We also intend to spend a large amount of time in person at the factory.\n \nQuality Control: Good QC is a major focus of ours. The quantity of orders on Kickstarter will help determine how we handle this. If we receive orders for under 1000 units, we will hand test each and every 3Doodler ourselves at 3Doodler HQ in Boston. If we received over 1000 orders we will carry out all QC in situ at the factory, with the assistance of dedicated QC personnel, and with relayed video footage of each 3Doodler going through testing.\n\nThis is about getting the best possible 3Doodler into your hands ASAP. So please go back to the top of the page and pledge now.\n\nThanks!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "That's a Wrap!

Since the game is complete (other than changes that will be made due to Kickstarter pledge levels), it will be released as soon as possible after the KS campaign is completed.\nThe funds raised are going directly for the game's production. If the funding level is reached, this means that the cards included will have the thickness of casino playing cards, the player pieces will be wood, and the rules will be color. Essentially, all of the money will be put into the production costs for the game.\nThe basics of the game: Your family wants to have the best vacation ever! Travel to famous attractions all across the USA, stopping at various cities along the way for activities your family loves. Each time you treat a family member to something they enjoy, your family earns more happiness points. If your family has had the most exciting vacation when the game is over, you win.  The real catch is that only one family can enjoy each attraction on the board, so that you need to be careful in your travel plans--driving cross-country to see something that's closed could drive you nuts! (Ask Clark Griswald about that!)\n1 - The game is finished, 99% of the way towards production.  If you want to see how the game plays: VIDEO \n2 - Philip duBarry is an established designer with a track record of producing fun games.\n3 -Jolly Roger Games is an established company and recent releases such as Founding Fathers, Parsec (an RPG), etc show a commitment to producing quality products--which includes our first KS campaign recently concluded--Pirates vs. Dinosaurs\n4 - Your support gets a good game out into the marketplace, onto gaming tables, where it belongs faster than it can get otherwise. With your support, this game is born in the summer of 2013, without that support, it doesn't come to life until 2014 or maybe 2015.\n5 - The more support provided, the more will be included in the game. The game comes with a map of the United States, but if the game is supported, additional bonus maps will be included--whether these are China, Canada, or Europe, etc--and each of those will be added with their own appropriate cards and necessary bits (a bit like Ticket to Ride, I suppose--except these will all be included with YOUR game...not as extra supplements to purchase!). And these are not just extra maps--they have different rules and different feels that go with them!\n6 - Your support means additional money goes into production quality rather than advertising to get the word out--spending that's important, but nowhere near as vital as putting out a game that looks good and has quality components.\nKickstarter supporters like stretch goals, bonuses if the game reaches its funding target and Jolly Roger with the artist and designer have created several of these:\n$15,000: The game will come with bonus adventure cards\n$20,000: In addition to the US map, all of the components necessary for Europe will be included--essentially a complete second game!\n$35,000: Not only will we include Europe, we'll include China as well--rules, board, cards, everything (yup, a third game)\n$50,000: We'll add Australia and New Zealand--and it'll come packaged with China, so that you'd receive four games)\nA comment from Philip duBarry, the designer: \"I am very excited to bring you this great new family game. We have worked very hard to make this game fun, quick to play and easy to understand--even for children and non-gamers. I love playing this game with my kids, non-gamer relatives, and even other more experienced gamers. Taking a turn is a simple matter of moving your car one space, but where you go and how fast you get there introduces some nice, challenging decisions. Players can also collect bonus points in a number of ways. And with the variable interest tiles and starting hometowns, no two games will be the same! I'm excited with the art by Jacob Walker, and the commitment to quality production from Jolly Roger Games. I hope you will consider pledging today!\"", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe challenge is ultimately getting the word out--Jolly Roger is a small company (one person, actually) with a tight budget. FAMILY VACATION is a great game, so there's no worry on that end.\n\nThe other challenge is that this is only Jolly Roger's second KS campaign, and the learning curve is steep--as well as the fact that you can't please everyone, one way or the other! But I think that gets better with experience--and with suggestions and constructive criticism, so that backers can compare and (hopefully) already see changes--changes that will show them that the company, designer, and artist are serious about producing a kick-butt product!\n\nWith the first project (Pirates vs. Dinosaurs), life's been interesting--as several life-altering events have personally taken place for me right as the campaign concluded. That's been rough and delayed things quite a bit--but if you go look at the campaign (or on boardgamegeek), you'll find I've been keeping supporters up to date as often as possible. With much (but not all) of that behind me, it makes it possible to go forward with Family Vacation--and I'm thankful for that (because it's been ready now since the start of 2013!)\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jolly Roger Games\n6 created \u00b7 2 backed\nI do a little of everything--I'm the author of multiple novels and a textbook on coaching sports.

Coordination with teammates is crucial to fighting back the enemy, with individual tactical precision contributing to the larger battle.\nAs games are completed, your Company earns experience after each match and eventually levels up allowing you to field more units and/or more powerful units. Additionally, you will amass global in-game currency that is used to unlock collectible packs of new units, special orders, and enhancements, expanding your continually-growing collection. The layered strategy of customizing companies offers infinite combinations so you can constantly experiment with perfect builds to suit your evolving play style!\nThe objectives in Victory are simple: capture, defend, and hold the victory regions on the map, or march down a winner-take-all path of total annihilation against your opponents. Multiple victory conditions  coupled with the vast possibilities of company build configurations guarantee that no two game experiences are alike.\nWith an extensive library of award-winning strategy game titles under our belts, why have we come here to Kickstarter?\nWe have been part of the Kickstarter community for about a year now, and have enjoyed backing other fun and amazing projects - the creativity and passion we\u2019ve seen is incredible! Now, we're delighted to finally have the opportunity to have our very own game on Kickstarter.\nIn addition, independent developers are often faced with many challenges in self-funding and publishing high-quality titles on their own, while larger, traditional game publishers remain focused on large-scale productions that aim to repeat the successes of the past. This is not the direction that we've chosen to take with Victory.\nNow we intend to charge forward, full speed ahead and pave the way for a persistent, online action strategy game that is both competitive and widely accessible. We are offering our decades of experience, proven talent, and enthusiasm on a mission to deliver a knockout game experience. With your support and collaboration throughout this production, we can realize this vision, and together, create a strategy game that is not what we think you want to play, but what you know and tell us you want to play.\nVictory is currently in the playable prototype phase, built on our established and proven GLYPHX Online game engine. The combat sequences from the introductory video were captured from actual gameplay footage. There are still a number of features and a good amount of content that we need to add to make Victory a stand-out strategy title in a class all its own. Additionally, we must also provide operational services such as server hosting and ongoing support to maintain the quality of your gaming experience once Victory has gone live. Content, features, and the necessities of online support - that's what the Kickstarter funds will be used to deliver.\nPlease join us in the march to Victory!\n\n\nPlease note that the pages linked below were not done by professional translators and may contain errors.

My name is Mark Melni and I have invented the Melni connector. My Invention has the potential to change the world of electrical connecting devices, making it extremely easier and faster to connect and reconnect power lines around the world! This connector will give any man or woman the ability to make an electrical connection in less than a minute! If you are an Electrician or Lineman you\u2019ll understand the impact this device will have in your industry - please check out our video and it will become clear what our invention is and how it will affect electrical transmission.\n*Consider this - If 1000 crimp connectors were down and each connector took 15 minutes to replace the total time it would take would be roughly 250 hours. The Melni connector is completely installed and waterproof in less than 1 minute \u2013 roughly 16 hours for 1000 connections! That equals 2 eight hour days as opposed to 31! Finished in roughly 7% of the time it currently takes\u2026 Crimps take so long because of the archaic tools, crimps, insulating tapes and hot or cold shrink insulators. The Melni connector is already insulated and uses very simple tools.\nWe will be using the funds we raise in our Kickstarter project to gain UL approval. Our goal is to be fully UL 486a-d certified by the end of the year!\nThe Melni Story\n\nAbout six years ago I was in my garage and looked up at a package of miscellaneous electrical crimps and thought, \"here\u2019s something that hasn't been changed in over 60 years! There's got to be a better way to do this!\" My idea came to me in a flash and I drew it up on the back of an old manual. When I showed this to my buddy (who's an electrician) he called me a choice name then told me \u201cyou might have something here - this is cool!\u201d\n\nBasically my invention uses a metal spiral that contracts down on top of the conductor. Once the conductor is attached, any force that pulls the conductor away from the connector creates more pressure (Think Chinese finger trap). We use compression glands to tightly seal out all moisture, air, gas and oil. The existing procedure for a 4/0 connector requires a crimp connector, crimp tool, tape, hot or cold shrink and about 15 minutes of labor!\n\nIn the past couple of years there's been numerous catastrophes where power has gone down and stays down for an extended period of time. I can't imagine the challenges these people face and the lineman working as fast as they can to restore power. My invention has the potential to minimize the time expended on these connections and make it so that stricken areas can get back on line much quicker. Occasionally linemen are required to make these connections while the power is still on. The Melni connector instantly insulates the conductor so the lineman is protected. Last winter I observed a lineman making a 4/0 connection in 9\u00b0 weather. He had to remove his gloves and apply heat packs in order to continue. The connection took him close to 20 minutes to complete, after setting up his tools and then putting them away. My hope is that with the Melni connector it will reduce that time immeasurably and make the lineman/electricians jobs easier.\nIn the video below we actually energize a 1,700 square foot electrical shop with an actual Melni 4/0 connector. Check it out!;\nThe Melni Butt Splice connector is the flagship product and the one that has been through the most development and testing. The Melni Butt Splice has several advantages over the crimp connectors currently in use.\nHere is a testing video from the Idaho National Laboratory.\nBelow is a picture of the connector that will be included with the rewards.\n\nEase of Installation: The Melni connector is easy to use. Just insert the stripped cable, twist the end caps to tighten the patented spiral insert, and then tighten the waterproofing caps. *(Larger connectors require an Inexpensive wrench set to cinch them down.The tools are required by UL to set a standard torque value. We found that the extra torque allowed us to reach almost 3 times the UL pull test standard. Recommended torque values are approximately 14 lbs., Still less than a minute to install.) Below are pictures of the wrenches.\nInstallation Time: A crimp-style connector can take up to 15 minutes to fully install. First the actual crimps must be applied, then layers of tapes and wraps to seal it out from the elements. The Melni connector can be installed in less than a minute.\n\nWaterproof Connection: The Melni connector is waterproof with sealing caps that compress a neoprene bushing around the cable.\n\nAvailable - Clear body design: This enables electricians and linemen to quickly spot a faulty connector by allowing them to look at the copper insert through the clear polycarbonate body. (Standard model will be black or color-coded to indicate size.)\n\nThe cable is saved when replacing a connector:  A Melni can be cut in half and replaced without having to cut out a section of the conductor. This is a huge plus when you're dealing with buried cable.\n\nWorks well on both stranded and solid conductors: It even works on 'ultra flex'  cables that have many more strands.\n\nToolbox Simplification: It\u2019s no longer necessary to keep a list of things needed to make a proper connection, like the barrel crimp, crimper, proper dies for the crimper, and all the tapes and shrink wraps.\n\nLess Excavation: The tools used for the large Melni connectors are only 9 inches long. This allows the connector to be installed in a 12 inch trench.\nMelni Production Process and Plan\nFor the last 6 years I have been working on this project. Right know we are at the point where we need your help to obtain the funds to get UL approval and to produce our first series of connectors. We have the molds and we are ready to go!\n2006 - Partner and Board member selection.\n2007 - First prototype tested, original prototypes were in 6 AWG.\n2009 - Introduction of 4/0 concept. Preliminary pull tests were performed at BSU.\n2010 \u2013 May I won the Idaho Tech Launch 7 \u2013 Entrepreneur or the year for the 4/0 connector.\n2010 \u2013 September 14th we received our first Patent.\n2010 to present \u2013 Preliminary testing the connectors to make sure they will pass all the UL testing.\n2011 \u2013 Water proofing gland introduced.\n2012 \u2013 First molded parts were made.\n2012 \u2013 Established workshop for preliminary electrical and mechanical testing including waterproofing.\n2013 \u2013 Prepare to submit connectors to UL for official testing.\n2013 \u2013 Prepare for commercialization.\n2013 \u2013 Manufacturer partner selection (in the USA).\n\nPlease see our website for testimonials from some of our local supporters that have been able to experience the way our connector actually works.

After many requests we are proud to present to you the WakaWaka Power, capable of charging practically any type of (smart) phone:  iPhone5, Blackberry, Samsung, you name it. And... tablets as well.\nhigh efficiency sunpower solar cell & USB in connector\nMobility is what our lives are all about these days. We use flexible workspaces, travel for fun, pleasure and work and unfortunately we\u2019re a lot on the run, so much to do. How inconvenient is it when  your iPhone or iPad dies on you again, right in the middle of that conversation you wanted to finish today.\nworking prototype\nYou need back-up power if you don\u2019t want to be slowed down by your device. Solar chargers are becoming increasingly popular, but most are still bulky and really many of them, if you tried any, really don\u2019t work that well, especially in the winter or on overcast days.\nThe WakaWaka Power is a pocket size mini power station with super efficient solar cells and a power management system which ensures efficiencies which are up to 200% better than any other product in the market.  Apart from charging your smart phone, WakaWaka Power is also a light source which can provide you with more than 40 hours of excellent reading light (on a single day solar charge!).\nyellow is the WakaWaka signature color (this is a proto)\nblack edition - 3D rendering\nSpecifications\nDon\u2019t underestimate The Power\nPlace WakaWaka Power in direct sunlight for a whole day and you will notice that the battery will be completely full, even if you live in New York or Seattle (where the intensity of the sun is far less than in Texas). The capacity of the battery is large enough to fully power most mobile phone from completely depleted, to practically full. On top of this, you will have 10 or more hours of excellent reading light as well. If you don\u2019t charge your phone or tablet, as said before, you can have more than 40 hours of light.\nprototype actually charging an iPad\nWe calculated that a fully charged WakaWaka will give you at least 2 hours extra surf & work time on your iPad (on full brightness). Just enough to finish that movie, send some mails in the train or bus or plane.\nTop engineers\nWakaWaka Power is engineered by a top team at Intivation. They are the creators of the chip which made WakaWaka the most efficient solar lamp in the world today. Their technology is used in over 90% of the solar powered mobile phones in the world, including well known brands. So\u2026 we\u2019re working with experts in the field! And because they simply love what we are doing with WakaWaka, they are supporting us all the way. Thanks Guys!\nLED's LED's LED's explain what happens...\nWakaWaka Power has:\nLED\u2019s to show you that your WakaWaka is charging in the sun\nLED\u2019s to show you how full your WakaWaka battery is\nLED\u2019s to tell you that your mobile phone is charging\nLED\u2019s to light up your life when the grid fails us again\nA lot of our backers asked us for indicator LED\u2019s, so we decided to add a few here and there. They\u2019re not only functional, they also look cool.\nWakaWaka Best in Class\nWe have claimed before that WakaWaka is the best solar lamp in the world. Recently we received an independent 3rd party test report where we compared a number of brands. First the lab depleted the batteries completely by keeping them switched on for as long as it took to deplete them. Than they were all placed together outside in the sun from sunrise until sunset (test was done in the UK same latitude as Calgary). So they all got the same amount of light. The report came with the figure below which \u2018says it all\u2019\nTake a look and I will explain.\nOn the left is the amount of light produced. You see that actually 4 other lights start off with much higher light output than WakaWaka, more than you need for reading a book, or lighting up a room. You also notice that practically all lights drop to nearly zero output within roughly 4 hours. The only exceptions is the dotted light blue one (which is almost twice as expensive) and the 2 WakaWaka samples. The WakaWaka\u2019s lasted 7, respectively 8 hours on a single days solar charge, before it switched to its 10% energy saving mode (the horizontal line at the bottom), indicating a low light output for several more hours, enough to keep you from bumping your head in complete darkness and it actually still allows you to read. \nThe graph shows that WakaWaka works in fact twice as long on a steady output than all of its direct competitors tested here (whom we all wish the best of course).  If it shows we\u2019re proud of this, you\u2019re right. We are. I can\u2019t wait to do a stress test comparison to compare life expectancy\u2026  WakaWaka is really one of kind.\nWhere are we now?\nWakaWaka Power is now in prototype phase. Much further than we were with the first WakaWaka when we launched on Kickstarter last year. We learned a lot from the first version, but the 2.0 version requires more components and more complex programming. Programming? Oh yes\u2026 you have no idea what goes into the chip which controls the power management inside.\nWith your support we can connect WakaWaka to your smart phone, tablet and MP3 player. We have already selected the factory where we will manufacture the WakaWaka Power. As a matter of fact, I have already been there!\nmodular design\nWith your contribution you can help us fund the tooling, design costs and most of the programming costs. Also it will help us placing a first significant component order so we can get the anticipated price level.\nConsumers vs Kickstarter Backers  \nWe expect the suggested retail price for WakaWaka Power will be $79, starting from May 2013.\nFor all you backers, the price will be $ 69 and for early birds even $ 49 ! \n(nearly 40% discount...)\nNEW REWARDS\nTHANKS for making a difference!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProduct development, production in general, production in China and logistics... If you have never done it before, they're all challenging. I am happy to tell you that I have been working in this field from 1997 already. For 7 years I worked at a company called 'The Invention Group' where I was responsible for developing literally dozens of products per year, getting them produced in China and shipped on time to customers such as Heineken, Bacardi, Procter & Gamble, Unilever and many other well known A-brands. Faillure was not an option. Too late? you think I got away with a slap on the fingers? Oh no... just in time delivery was of the essence. \n\nCurrently WakaWaka is being produced in China and we have shipped to more than 50 countries already. \n\nLast year when we did our Kickstarter campaign for the first WakaWaka, we initially mentioned that we expected delivery in May. Eventually we had to postpone delivery until July. Some backers even got their WakaWaka's as late as August. \n\nThis year we are further advanced with product development. WakaWaka Power is being developed in The Netherlands. Design for hard & software is done there. Engineering as well, in close cooperation with our manufacturing partner in China. I actually already visited the factory already. So there is a major difference with last year. Nevertheless delays are possible. May is already more than 1 month beyond the delivery deadline agreed with the factory, but you never know. Let's just say I hope we will be able to surprise you this year with an early delivery. \n\nIf you want us to address additional risks, then don't hesitate to ask for your reassurance.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Lighting up Haiti!", "update_content": "12 000 Lights have made their way to Haiti and have been distributed to recovering rural areas.

Still almost 370,000 people need to live in shelters, in the dark. Life comes to an end after sunset. Hardly any possibilities to ready or study, earn some extra income, no light to cook, or to simply have a good time. For nearly 50,000 people this situation is about to change. Thanks to \u2026 5,622 backers and 1395 Dutch crowdfunders! As a result of two incredibly successful crowdfunding campaigns we are able to donate nearly 10,000 WakaWaka Lights to 10,000 families (of 5 people average) in Haiti.\n\nAmazing results after an amazing campaign.$419,472 on Kickstarter + $275,000 from the Netherlands. A staggering total of $694,472. If you\u2019re interested, here\u2019s the campaign from a bird\u2019s eye view.\n\n\nFor several weeks we have been working towards this day. We produced a trailer movie to draw attention to our website which resulted in hundreds of people who asked for an email alert on launch date. Thank you Rob, Sjoerd, Aart and Lars for producing the trailer! Thank you Jaqueline, France-Love, Junior and Judelande for featuring in the movie. You are all stars now!\n\nWe were launching two campaigns separately. Of course we launched on Kickstarter \u201cthe\u201d crowdfunding platform in the world, where WakaWaka was successfully received last year already. But since we\u2019re based in The Netherlands and Dutch don\u2019t have Amazon payment accounts we figured it would be useful to have a Dutch platform as well. OnePlanetCrowd.nl just launched 2 months earlier, still we decided go live with them with a goal of raising \u20ac 25.000 in 30 days. On Kickstarter we announced we wanted to raise $50,000 in 30 days. Together that would allow us to get WakaWaka into production. Of course we hoped we would exceed our targets\u2026\n\nOn 3.11pm EST, 9 hours later than anticipated (we aimed at 12-12-12 12:12 GMT lol) we were live on both sites. We had some technical issues on Kickstarter, which got us all a bit nervous for a couple of hours. So much preparation and than not being able to launch on time, tough haha. But \u2026 within 20 seconds after we went live we had our first backer! (thanks Eric Ramirez!) seconds later another one and backers kept on coming! We started to send thank you notes right away, but right from the start it was already hard to keep up with copy-pasting thank you notes to everyone.\n\n\nReally really amazing! Within 24 hrs we hit our first goal on OnePlanetCrowd in The Netherlands: \u20ac 25.000 in a single day. Unprecedented in our small country. Less than a day later, some 48 hrs after we launched: 100% on Kickstarter as well! $50,000. We thought of stretch goals before, but didn\u2019t anticipate having to announce them so quickly already!\n\n\nWe were speechless because of the speed at which the campaign was evolving. New backers were joining every few minutes. This is turning into a real \u2018WakaWaka Community\u2019. We decided to offer everyone 25% extra battery capacity free of charge, backers only, as a reward for their confidence and involvement.\n\n\nWe promised we would offer a special color to all our backers once the Netherlands hit their stretch goal and we did! Within a week 400%.... quite amazing for The Netherlands. Let alone on the newly launched platform.\n\n\nOne of the many heard comments we read was the specific wish to make WakaWaka Power more water resistant. Because of the 2 USB connectors, it is more sensitive to rain, despite the clip which covers the connectors already. We figured it would be a nice solution to offer all our backers a water proof pouch if we would hit $250,000 (quite an ambitious stretch goal at that time\u2026). We thought it would be a good idea to ask people to make a choice out of 4 different options we found\u2026 haha\u2026 256 comments\u2026 people choosing, but also a lot of backers who wanted to know everything there was to know about the different pouches like, exact size, thickness of the material, were they UV coated, were the sonic welds strong enough and many many more\u2026 we ordered a bunch of different pouches and we decided to test them professionally in Camille\u00b4s bathtub. A few hours later we had a winner! Fortunately 95% of the community agreed with our preference after testing.\n\n\nWakaWaka was selected among the top 12 most successful start-up companies in the Netherlands. To include the voice of the reader, a competition was organized by the entrepreneurial business platform. A few days before the end of the campaign, WakaWaka was ranked #4, around 500 votes behind the# 1. We figured to ask our backers if they would like to help us out. To our great surprise we were ranked #1 less than 10 hours later! And that\u00b4s when our competitor woke up all of sudden, just before they sat down before their Christmas dinner\u2026 What followed was a fierce competition between discount website Scoupy and social enterprise WakaWaka. Literally hundreds of people tweeted about the competition! And hundreds of people voted. In the last few hours of the campaign Scoupy sent out a mail blast to their discount subscribers `vote scoupy and have a chance to win a Skydive\u00b4\u2026 although we were a mile ahead, after that mail blast we didn\u00b4t want to spam you any more than we already did. Without any marketing budget, we were proud to receive 43% of all the votes, putting WakaWaka on 2nd place as Best Startup Company of 2012. THANK YOU all who voted for WakaWaka.\n\n\nMuch sooner than expected we hit our $250,000 stretch goal on Kickstarter. This meant a water proof pouch for all Kickstarter backers and fast tracking our plans for an assembly line on Haiti! The final step in assembling the WakaWaka will be done in Haiti before we distribute the WakaWaka Lights which have been donated. The intention is to have a permanent assembly line, also creating jobs. This is work in progress, but the pilot assembly line will happen already.\n\n\nNormally a typical crowdfunding campaign peaks in the beginning and sometimes a little bit in the end. Our campaign didn\u00b4t just peak on the first day, but during the first 5 days around 300 people were backing us every day again and again. Normally the popularity drops quickly after 24 or 48 hrs. What\u00b4s even more interesting is that in the last 7 days or so we actually topped the average of the first week! That\u00b4s quite unusual behavior, but there is a reason for that\u2026 we have been working very very hard with a team of people to get as much attention for our campaigns as possible. Sooner or later we had to be picked up by some serious media and that\u00b4s what happened. A cool video presentation of our campaign on Mashable showed an incredible spike in the number of backers who found us. 2 days later a website called Neuerdings.de published about us in Germany which was picked up by Der Spiegel, a very popular magazine in Germany. So thanks to our newly found German friends we had the best day ever during our campaign! Also, we were very proud to let you know that famous climatologist James Hansen paid attention to WakaWaka in his article 'Galileo and the Fireflies'. Newly found friends in the US (mr. JR Gaillot) also made it possible that we got exposure on both the West Orlando News and NBC\u00b4s The Grio. Very cool!\n\n\n\u2026. $419,472 on Kickstarter and around $275,000 on OnePlanetCrowd, together practically $695,000 brought together by 7,017 backers from all over the planet. Many, because they wanted to get their hands on the most efficient solar charger & light in the world and wanted to get it first. Others because the wanted to make a difference in the world and got a cool gadget as a reward. You know, `the reasons why\u00b4 are so many and all are good since they help us to create impact. We are moved by the incredible support we got from you guys. Thank you all for your sweet & heart warming messages. It has been an amazing journey we embarked on and it feels like we are absolutely not alone out there\u2026 This is not the end for WakaWaka Power, but the beginning. And much, much is yet to come (we can\u00b4t disclose too much yet, but new adventures will be showing up on the horizon real soon). If you want to stay tuned, likes us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter, and we really don\u00b4t mind your retweets\u2026\n\n\nWe are still working on getting more exposure for our Let\u00b4s #LightUpHaiti campaign and until the moment when WakaWaka Power will actually be available on Amazon and other online shops, we will continue our pre-sale campaign on our own website. So don\u00b4t hesitate to tell people about what we\u00b4re doing and about the impact we are making.

This is great literature in what has to be the most accessible, friendly format ever.  If you ever struggled with wondering what was going on and what people's motivations were in the play, you will totally understand everything once you play through this book, assuming you make the same choices Shakespeare did when he played it.  That doesn't mean this book is written for children.  It just means it's easy to understand someone's motivations when you're the one making the decisions!\nHey speaking of that, making the same choices Shakespeare did will be easy as there will be little Yorick skulls beside the \"canonical\" choices.  So if you want to stick to the plot of the play, that's not a problem!  It's super easy!  But I'll warn you: Shakespeare's choices didn't lead to the best ending for the characters.  Not by a long shot.\nWhile the book itself is told in modern language, for each of the big speeches, you have the option to say it in the original beautiful and fancy language, or you can have told in modern language, like with Hamlet rapping it or whatever.  IT IS TOTALLY YOUR CALL.\nIF YOU LIKE THE POTENTIAL OF READER-DRIVEN NARRATIVE AND HAVE BEEN FRUSTRATED IN THE PAST:\nYep, I hear you.  The interactive books of our youth often suffered from arbitrary plotlines and capricious death.  This book puts you in a real, consistent world where your choices matter.  Also there are ghosts.  Also you can play as a ghost.  Also you can haunt the planet for generations because GHOSTS DON'T DIE.\nWHOAH REALLY??\nYep!  In fact, the first choice you make is to choose your character, and each character has their own storyline.  Storylines, actually: dozens and dozens of storylines.  You can play as Hamlet, his girlfriend Ophelia, and his dad Hamlet Sr, who (SURPRISE) dies on the first page and becomes a ghost.  And then we make fun of you for dying on the first page, but you can become a ghost and must INVESTIGATE YOUR OWN MURDER that you TOTALLY SLEPT THROUGH because you got SLEEPY IN AN ORCHARD. (Shakespeare wrote this part, I can't help it.)\nOphelia's adventure is as well-thought-out as Hamlet's, but rather than being a hero suffering from crippling inaction, you are a smart, self-sufficient woman who knows what she wants and is totally rad 100% of the time, and also you are dating a PRINCE.  You can choose what you want to do with your life: help your boyfriend who's crying about a spooky ghost, or I don't know TAKE DOWN INTERNATIONAL TERRORISTS INSTEAD??  It's nuts.  It's awesome.  Oh my gosh.\nIF YOU HAVE NO INTEREST IN HAMLET AT ALL BUT LIKE FUNNY JOKES:\nThen I can assure you this book is still totally awesome and chock full of those things you like.  You can (AND WILL?) love this book even if you've never had any particular interest in to being or not to being.  This is a book written for adults who like only the most awesome of things.  That is you.  I know it. \nI've used the story of Hamlet as a starting point, but a) that's already a great story because it ends with pretty much everyone in it getting stabbed in the body and b) the story can go in all sorts of fun, crazy directions when you make a choice that Shakespeare didn't.  \nTELL ME MORE ABOUT THE BOOK!\nThe book itself is already written: it's 80,000 words of comedy and mayhem that I lovingly crafted together myself over the past year.  80,000 words is about what you'd call an \"actual book-length book\".  So why the Kickstarter?  One reason, really:\n\nWe are going to decide how amazing this book is going to be.\n\nThe more money we raise, the better the book will be.  Paperbacks and hardcovers and nice paper stock are a given, but we'll also be adding PICTURES.  And not just any pictures: PICTURES DONE BY SOME THE BEST VISUAL ARTISTS AND ILLUSTRATORS ALIVE TODAY.  I say this without hyperbole, and as proof offer up this alphabetical list of Amazing People Who Are Doing Pictures For This Book, Look At All These Amazing People, I Love Them:\nAaron Diaz (Dresden Codak)\nAlex Thomas (Star Wars: The Old Republic)\nAndrew Hussie (MS Paint Adventures)\nAndy Runton (Owly)\nAnthony Clark (Nedroid)\nBecky (Tiny Kitten Teeth)\nBraden Lamb and Shelli Paroline (Adventure Time, Ice Age)\nBrandon Bird (What Nat Saw, so many amazing paintings)\nBrian McLachlan (The Princess Planet)\nCarly Monardo (so many good things)\nChip Zdarsky (The National Post, Extremely Bad Advice)\nChris Hastings (The Adventures of Dr. McNinja)\nChris Jones (Snowflakes)\nDanielle Corsetto (Girls With Slingshots)\nDavid Hellman (Braid, A Lesson Is Learned But The Damage Is Irreversible, Second Quest)\nDavid Troupes (Buttercup Festival)\nDave Kellett (Sheldon)\nDavid Malki (Wondermark)\nDustin Harbin (Dharbin!)\nDylan Meconis (Family Man, Outfoxed)\nEmily Carroll (The Prince And The Sea, so many others)\nEmily Partridge (Mount Pleasant Comics)\nEthan Nicolle (Axe Cop)\nFaith Erin Hicks (Nothing Can Possibly Go Wrong, Friends With Boys)\nJeff Rowland (Overcompensating, Wigu)\nJeph Jacques (Questionable Content)\nJess Fink (Chester 5000 XYV)\nJim Zubkavich (Skullkickers)\nJohn Allison (Bad Machinery, Scary Go Round)\nJohn Campbell (Pictures For Sad Children)\nJohn Keogh (Lucid TV)\nJohn Martz (Heaven All Day, Drawn.com)\nJon Rosenberg (Scenes From A Multiverse)\nKate Beaton (Hark! A Vagrant) (she did all spot illustrations you can see in the video and on this page!)\nKate Leth (Kate or Die)\nKazu Kibuishi (Amulet, Copper, Daisy Kutter),\nKC Green (Gunshow)\nKean Soo (Jellaby)\nKris Straub (Broodhollow, Chainsawsuit, Blamimation, Starslip)\nLar deSouza (Least I Could Do, Looking for Group)\nMarlo Meekins (all the beautiful pictures)\nMatthew Inman (The Oatmeal)\nMeredith Gran (Octopus Pie, Adventure Time: Marceline and the Scream Queens)\nMike Holmes (True Story, Bravest Warriors)\nMike Krahulik (Penny Arcade, co-founder of Child's Play)\nMike Maihack (Cleopatra In Space)\nNoelle Stevenson (Nimona, Gingerhaze) (she did the cover too!  It's going to be AMAZING, you will totally see it if you keep reading)\nRandall Munroe (XKCD)\nRay Fawkes (One Soul)\nRaynato Castro and Alex Culang (Buttersafe, Katamari Comic)\nRebecca Clements (Kinokofry, Ruffle Hall)\nRosemary Mosco (Bird And Moon)\nRyan Pequin (Three Word Phrase)\nSam Bosma (Turtle Soup)\nSam Logan (Sam And Fuzzy)\nScott Campbell (The Great Showdowns, Double Fine Action Comics)\nSteve Wolfhard (Cat Rackham, Adventure Time)\nTony Cliff (Delilah Dirk)\nTyson Hesse (Boxer Hockey)\nVera Brosgol (Verabee, plus storyboards for ParaNorman and Coraline!)\nWes and Tony (Amazing Super Powers)\nZac Gorman (Magical Game Time, all the pretty pictures)\nZach Weiner (Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal, plus Trial Of The Clone!)\n... AND MORE (surprise artists?  YES)\nWHAT'S THE MONEY GOING TOWARDS?\nIf we reach our goal for the book, I'll be able to release the book as a professionally-edited, professionally typeset, professionally-designed beautiful volume with a single illustration commissioned from each of these artists, each rendering a different way your story can end.  And the more money we raise, the more deaths get illustrated, until we have all 110 deaths done!  You can die a lot in a book like this, and I want to make each time something to look forward to.  I want it to be a treat.\nIn the video, I've included images showing each artist's style, and in some cases, an actual detail from an illustration I've already commissioned from them.  It is a SNEAK PEEK (assuming this project reaches its funding goals and is a success, otherwise it is just TANTALIZING GLIMPSES INTO A WORLD THAT WAS NOT MEANT TO BE)\nThis book will be published with help from Breadpig, who have a proven track record in bringing awesome into the real world.  They're the publishers behind super rad, super quality books like XKCD: volume 0, SMBC: Save Yourself, Mammal! and The Most Dangerous Game, and most recently, Zach Weiner's own chooseable-path gamebook also launched here on Kickstarter, The Trial Of The Clone. \nHOW DO I KNOW THIS BOOK IS AWESOME THOUGH??\nWell, I can tell you I think it's my best work so far.  And while you can't read this book just yet, pretty much everything else I've ever written is online for free!  I mentioned a bunch of it at the top of the page, but there's still more, like B^F, where I reviewed the insane novelization of Back to the Future, page by page, and my Twitter account, where I tell jokes that are short because it's Twitter, that's what it's there for!\nBUT ALL THAT ASIDE, I've worked to include every amazing thing possible in a book like this.  There's loops, alternate endings, secret paths and things that I'm pretty sure haven't even been done before in the medium.  Also, instead of a play-within-a-play to trap the conscience of a king, there's an \"an-adventure-is-chosen\" book within this \"an-adventure-is-chosen\" book, which you read while playing as King Claudius reading this nested book!  It's a whole separate book contained within this book, with cover and illustrations done by Andrew Hussie.  It's kinda the best?\nFor every 5K we raise, I'll post another section from the book!  We'll all choose what path we take... TOGETHER.  So you can read some of it that way too!\nTELL ME A BIT ABOUT THESE REWARDS\nEvery reward level gets you a DRM-free digital download of the book.  $15 is all it takes!  And this is highly appreciated.  But if you want to contribute more, there are some fun things I can offer in exchange!  Because things have been going so well, every tier threshold now includes TWO brand-new, never-released-anywhere Dinosaur Comics ebooks, so it's three books for the price of one.  PLUS if you donate a little extra, we'll throw in things like a plush Yorick skull (cutest ever!), an amazing multiple-path bookmark designed for this multiple-path book, awesome stickers and TATTOOS, a choose-your-own cover reversible dust jacket, a poster showing a map of the entire choice-structure of the book (beautiful, lose yourself in it), an audiobook version, all the way up to custom comics and custom little adventures starring YOU that I will write and that will be super rad extreme.  Keep reading to find out more about the rewards and what's left to unlock!  These are priced to raise money for this publishing project, but they're still pretty good deals too! \nNot everything reward is listed in the tiers over there to the right (they can't be edited once they've started) but rest assured you'll be getting all the prizes you've earned here.  I made a page that shows an up-to-date listing for each tier!  And the more money we raise, the more new rewards get unlocked that'll be automatically applied to people who have already contributed :o\nWHAT IF WE RAISE MORE MONEY THAN WHAT'S NEEDED?  DO AMAZING THINGS HAPPEN?\nYep!  If the book reaches its goal, yep, there's plenty of motivation to keep going!  I've got lots of plans for awesome things we could do to make this book the BEST EVER.  They include:\n$20,000 = UNLOCKED!!! Base goal, book printed w. 30 illustrations.

We've taken a simple black-and-white book with 30 illustrations and turned it into a full-colour, fully-illustrated, gorgeous volume.

Also because it's going to be great.  I've put a list of other things I've done above, offering them up as my Comedy Credentials, and hope that all these mostly-free content will encourage you to take a wee tiny risk on something that's not free.  I've been insanely lucky to be able to make a living by being an online cartoonist and writer - one of the very few to live this awesome dream - and I'd like to keep producing cool things for awesome strangers.  Hopefully this experiment is a success!\nPrototype cover with art by Noelle Stevenson, she is the best\nDUDE.

The main challenge will be in corralling the artists to get the illustrations on time, and then producing the best possible book (and rewards!) we can. This shouldn't be too hard, because as an artist, I know that all artists are incredibly reliable people who love meeting deadlines! Also if this is somehow not the case I will crack the whip on all slackers. Also, we've chosen fulfillment deadlines based on reasonable expectations of how things will go, but if it takes longer, we'll let everyone know and double-down on getting it done.\n\nThe difficulties in producing a physical book are well-known to me (I've self-published several volumes of Dinosaur Comics) and we're prepared for them.

Strike out to make your fortune amongst the Stars or sign-up for a tour of duty in the UEE Fleet.\nConstantly expanding and evolving universe\nWe\u2019re committed to making Star Citizen a living, breathing universe that is its own entity. It will be a constantly shifting and evolving place for players to explore and affect.\nMicro updates rule!\nWe\u2019re not interested in having yearly updates. Once live, we will have a team of people adding content on a weekly or bi-weekly basis. So we\u2019ll always be adding data, stories and campaigns as well as reacting to the needs and actions of the players.\nSquadron 42 - A Wing Commander style single player mode, playable OFFLINE if you want\nPlayable offline or online, co-op with friends, you sign up for a tour of duty with the UEE fleet, manning the front lines, protecting settlements from Vanduul warbands.\nLife during wartime\nIf you distinguish yourself in combat, you might be invited to join the legendary 42nd Squadron. Much like the French Foreign Legion of old, they can always be found in the toughest areas of operation and always snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, regardless of the odds.\nThe conflict never ends\nUpon completion of your tour you\u2019ll re-enter the persistent Star Citizen universe with some credits in your pocket and Citizenship to help you make your way.  But in the universe of Star Citizen when one conflict ends, another is just around the corner.  You\u2019ll have opportunity to spend more time with your squadron mates as additional Campaigns are released as part of the content update plan.\nActions of the players impact the universe and become part of its history and lore\nThe universe will change based on the players' actions and adventures allowing them to become part of the history of the universe. As an example, players can scan for gravitational anomalies while out in space. If one is discovered and the player manages to successfully navigate this uncharted jump point, they\u2019ll be able to sell their Nav- Computers recording of their jump flight path for a great profit to a space company for other users to download. But the real prize is getting the system or jump-point named after them!\nAllowing user generated content is a key design goal\nOur modding tools will allow players to design new ships for both submission to the persistent RSI ship dealer network or to build custom ships and items for the self-hosted multiplayer mode.\nIt\u2019s about the gameplay and your interactions with others\nWe plan to put a lot of social ideas in the universe. Since the universe is dynamic, it will create some divisions and factions. For example, it\u2019s a perfectly valid choice not to be a Citizen and operate outside the protection of Earth. We think there will be people that gravitate to crime or helping enforce the law or defending the galaxy from the alien raiders or just accumulating as much money as possible. We want to include all these social divisions so players will gravitate to one or the other much like the real world operates. \nFully dynamic economy driven by player actions\nIf too many people fly iron ore to the smelting plants of New Pittsburgh, steel prices will drop. Buy low\u2026 sell high\u2026 you hope.\nThe cost of society\nIn game trade landing and trade tariffs pay for law and order in the civilized systems. Want to make a bigger profit? Try the outer world - outside earth\u2019s infrastructure and protection. The downside? No military or local police to protect you from an opportunistic pirate!\nMoney isn\u2019t everything\nYou could be a trader, a miner or an industrial magnate. Amass great wealth or just run enough missions to earn a comfortable living and upgrades for your ship.\nSpace is empty but you\u2019re never really alone\nIf caught alone in an online ambush, send a distress broadcast to your friends and if they\u2019re nearby they can jump in-system to save your bacon. In each combat instance player slots are reserved for your friends so you can rally forces to join you in combat!\nBigger ships offer bigger multi-player action\nOn larger ships, friends can join you to man turrets, repair systems, or switch with you on the pilot\u2019s chair. Think the Millennium Falcon with Han-Solo piloting and Luke on the turret.\nFull rigid body simulation of all spaceships\nYou wanted proper Newtonian mechanics. You got it! Spaceships adjust their trajectory and orientation just like the real thing.\nIntelligent Flight Control System (IFCS)\nLike a modern day F-35, the ships have fly by wire systems which take the player\u2019s inputs and then translate them into the commands for the ship\u2019s engine and thrusters to articulate and deliver the required thrust to achieve the pilot\u2019s request.\nDynamic Ship Maneuverability\nShip\u2019s performance is calculated dynamically based on various physical variables and the ability of your jet maneuvering to deliver thrust towards a requested vector. What does this mean? Infinite customization with component damage, mass or energy changes affecting maneuverability on the fly \u2013 allowing for endless combat strategies and results.\nShip Components matter!\nBecause we are fully simulating the physics and flight dynamics, the actual components matter. If a port thruster is damaged, it will affect your maneuverability organically.  If you upgrade your thruster package with enhanced thrusters that gimbal faster and deliver more thrust it will affect your performance. Dump cargo, you may be able to get the edge in turning in a dogfight.\n10X the detail of current AAA games\nMost current gen \u201cAAA\u201d games have around 10,000 polygons for a character and 30,000 or so for a vehicle. In Star Citizen, the characters are detailed at 100,000 polygons, the fighter at 300,000 and the Space Carrier 7 million! This allows unparalleled detail, making the visuals more immersive than has ever been achieved before.\nEverything you would imagine would move or articulate on a spaceship or a device \u2013 does!\nEvery spaceship is built from 100s of sub-components, many of them moving and articulating just like they would in the \u201creal\u201d world. If a component gets damaged during combat be prepared to feel the effects on your ship.\nRange of scale never seen before in a game\nFrom a vast 1km long carrier to a 27m fighter, to your 1.8m tall pilot, Everything is rendered and to the same level of detail. Zoom in to the paneling of the carrier and its texel density is the same as the 27m fighter. All without a load screen or loss of visual fidelity.\nReally feel the scale of ships and space battles\nBecause of the ability of the game to scale seamlessly you could be looking out the windows on the bridge of a carrier watching the battle unfold or jump into a cockpit and take the fight to the enemy.\nJoystick, gamepad, mouse, keyboard are all supported.\nWe\u2019ve all got our preferences, so why be forced to choose?\nAdvanced peripheral support\nAs part of commitment to high end gaming we are dedicated to supporting the more exotic enthusiast peripherals; HOTAS, flight chair, rudder pedals. It\u2019s all about the immersion and if you've got the equipment we want to support it!\nVirtual Reality is here!\nWe have backed Oculus Rift and will support it in Star Citizen / Squadron 42. Who doesn't want to sit in their cockpit, hands on your joystick and throttle, swiveling your head, to track that enemy fighter that just blew by?\nNext generation, TODAY\nBuilt on top of Crytek\u2019s award winning CryEngine3 technology, Star Citizen\u2019s engine is built to scale for the PC\u2019s of today and tomorrow.\nA PC gaming enthusiast\u2019s friend!\nAs you upgrade your PC, Star Citizen will take advantage of your extra processor cores, memory or GPUs. This is why you\u2019re a PC gamer \u2013 you love being on the cutting edge, not stuck in the past!\nToday\u2019s game publishers, like their Hollywood counterparts, want predictable returns from sequels to last year\u2019s hits. A game in an out- of-favor genre, set in an original universe is viewed as a bad investment. And the concept of developing a new product exclusively for the PC sends publishing executives and most Venture Capitalists running for the exits.\nAnd that hero is you, the unappreciated PC gamer. The ignored Space Sim fan.\nThis is your chance to have your voice heard. To tell the world that high end PC gaming lives. That you want to sit in the cockpit of your space fighter defending the galaxy or making your fortune as a wily entrepreneur.\nStar Citizen is meant to be everything you ever dreamed you could have in a Space-Sim, all in one glorious ever-evolving package.\nWe know it may not look like this, but we do!\nWhat you've seen was put together by a very small team over the past year. We felt that this vision needed to be shown rather than talked about so we invested our own money to build the technical and visual prototype that shows just how Star Citizen is going to push the limits of PC games.\nInstead of taking this prototype to a publisher for a green light, we are cutting out the middleman and taking it to you.\nYou as the customer get the ultimate vote in whether we make this game. Your dollars are your votes and the better we do the more resources we\u2019ll have to bring you a great game.\nWe have investors that have agreed to contribute the balance we need to complete this game as long as we can validate that there is a demand for a high end PC space game. By meeting or surpassing our target on Kickstarter you tell the world that you want a PC based Space Sim and allow us to make this game.\nBut we're offering more than just the chance to support the platform and genre.\nAs an early backer, you\u2019ll also be getting a lot more than just the finished game.\nFor the people who pledge for their spaceship in the Star Citizen universe, you\u2019ll be part of a select club that has exclusive access to early gameplay and behind the scenes development updates.\nThe people who pledge for their spaceships will get to test-fly them long before the general public. 12 months in, we will allow the early backers to play the multiplayer space combat Alpha, and then 20-22 months in they will get to play the Star Citizen Beta, adventuring around the huge open galaxy, well before the general public. We are going to limit our alpha slots to 200,000 as we want to stress test the game with real users, but will not be ready for the full load until we have finished Beta.\nIn addition, part of the money we are asking for is budgeted to maintain the Roberts Space Industries site with constant updates. Our goal is for the game\u2019s website to be live from day one, constantly giving information about what\u2019s happening in the galaxy even before the game is live, sharing interesting insights into the development process and canvassing the early backers for their opinions. Roberts Space Industries should be the first stop into the Star Citizen universe. When we say we want to involve the community, we really mean it!\nFinally we are offering the pledge slots a discount to what the final digital price will be. Like Guild Wars 2, the basic game will be $60, but for the very early backers we are offering the entry tier at $30. But hurry! Slots are limited!\nOur hope is that these benefits are compelling enough for you to pledge for your spaceship today.\nPlease support us, tell your friends and participate in the discussion.

The Tactical Whistle was an idea to re-invent the ordinary safety whistle, make it louder, stronger, resistant to corrosion (for marine use), portable, securable, beautifully designed and cosmetically appealing to the eye. \n The Tactical Whistle was designed here in our own facility by Cybernetic Research design engineers. Using technology and advanced machinery we were able to produce the design into a tangible, functional, very useful object, and we want to share it with you! \ncheck out the video above!\nThe \u2018three flute\u2019 design provides three specific frequencies designed to increase sound levels over distance, cut through background noise caused by weather, rushing water, air and ground traffic, and other distracting noises. The primary central frequency of 3150 Hz is per government regulations as providing the most piercing sound over the widest range of detrimental conditions. The higher and lower frequencies are designed to fill the overall acoustical profile at frequencies between the primary 3150 Hz output and its various harmonics both above and below the primary.\n\nThe whistle is two piece construction with no moving parts. Nothing to lose and no \u201crattle\u201d.\n\nThe small, low volume profile incorporates a graduated air passage designed to reduce the amount of exhalation effort required to generate an audible whistle signal. A person can blow this whistle for longer periods without exhaustion as opposed to some competitors offerings.\n\nThe rugged outer shell is provided with a stepped knurled surface to improve grip in the whistle body in cold, wet or icy conditions.\n\nThe whistle body is durable against heat, cold and crushing force and will provide life-long serviceability.\n Our company engineers, designs, and produces, with standards that comply with both the aerospace requirements for AS9100 and to many military specifications (MIL) that are listed below: \nAS9100 (C) - Quality Management Systems \u2013 Requirements for Aviation, Space, and Defense\nMIL C 5541 F (E) - Chemical Conversion Coatings on Aluminum and Aluminum Alloys\nMIL P 53022 B - Primer, Epoxy Coating, Corrosion Inhibiting, Lead and Chromate Free\nMIL STD 130 (T) - Identification and Marking Parts and Assemblies\nMIL STD 889 Galvanic Table \u2013 Corrosion Control\nISO 9001 (E) - Quality Management Systems \u2013 Requirements\nASTM A 484 / A 484M \u2013 10 (2010) Stainless Steel Bars\nASTM A 564 / A 564M \u2013 10 (2010) Hot-rolled and Cold Finished Age-Hardening Stainless Steel Bars and Shapes\n {and more}\nThe Tactical Whistle will be 2-3/4\u201d long, 9/16\u201d diameter, and the weights are as followed:\nAluminum : 14.6 gm\nStainless Steel : 43.1 gm\nTitanium : 25.5 gm\nBrass: 40.1 gm\nThe Tactical Whistle will be available in three different material types, Aluminum, Stainless steel, and Titanium. the Aluminum will be available in four different colors: Clear (silver), Black, Olive Drab Green (OD green), and red.\nADD ON's\nThank you in advance!

Throughout my career, I've worked for many studios including Don Bluth, Electronic Arts, Cartoon Network, Pixar, Nickelodeon, Disney, and many more. In 2001, I left my position as Head of Special Effetcs at Warner Brothers Feature Animation, so that I could pursue being a full time independent artist. I had always done personal work after hours and on weekends, but with my departure from Hollywood, I was hoping that from then on, I could make my art the primary focus of my career. In 2002, I moved to the Pacific Northwest, and began working seriously toward that dream.\nSince leaving the studios and becoming a full time independent artist, I have done books, graphic novels, short films, a video game, live performances, etc, while at the same time, continuing my affiliation with the movie, television and game industries as a freelancer.\nAnd now, I feel ready to tackle my dream of making an independent animated feature film.\nTHE SAGA OF REX: THE MOVIE IN MY HEAD\nTHE SAGA OF REX is labor of love that reflects my deep love for science fiction, strange creatures, otherwordly concepts, and classical animation. When I created THE SAGA OF REX graphic novel, I literally saw it as a movie in my head and treated the whole thing as a fully art directed storyboard. I saw the characters, the effects and the landscapes move in my mind's eye, and tried to convey as much of that feeling as I could on the pages.\nA COSMIC LOVE STORY\nTHE SAGA OF REX is the story of a little fox who gets abducted by a flying saucer and is transported to the planet Edernia, where he encounters the Blossoms, a race of shape shifters.\nOne of the Blossoms, chooses Rex as a potential mate and so the adventure begins. Rex must prove his worth and Aven, the shapeshifting Blossom, must conquer Rex\u2019s heart.\nIt\u2019s a love story. It\u2019s an adventure. It\u2019s an epic journey into an alien world. I am convinced that it will make a fascinating and beautiful film.\nA 1\u00bd TO 4 MINUTE SHORT FILM AT FIRST\nSo, how do I go about making a film of THE SAGA OF REX? Here's my concept: My first goal, before diving into a feature length film is to make a short film. The short will be a self-contained section of the feature film and will be used for the second round of financing (which may or may not necessarily be on Kickstarter). Preferably, the short film will be 4 minutes in length, but shorter will work too (you will help determine the length, but more on that later). So why 4 minutes you ask? Here are my reasons:\nI believe THE SAGA OF REX will be beautiful, visionary, surreal, and fascinating, but I also realize that it will be quite artsy in terms of storytelling. If it is too long, it could be taxing on the audience. This is why I want to make the movie as short as possible, yet I still want it to qualify as a feature film. According to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences:\n\"An animated feature film is defined as a motion picture with a running time of more than 40 minutes, in which movement and characters\u2019 performances are created using a frame-by-frame technique.\"\n40 minutes for a film like THE SAGA OF REX sounds just like what I have in mind\u2014so this is perfect! But in order to be eligible for Academy Award submission...\n\"No more then ten percent of the running time of a film, is allowed to be shown in a nontheatrical medium prior to the film\u2019s theatrical release.\"\nSince I want to have the option of submitting the film, and at the same time, I want to be able to share the footage created through Kickstarter with the world\u2014as soon as it is completed\u2014I need to make sure I play by the rules. Hence, the four minutes limit (40 minutes \u00f7 10 = 4 minutes).\nThe credits will be different in the short film and feature film so I'm not worried about going over 4 minutes with that part of it.\nYOU DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF THE FILM\nI evaluated that by working full time, at my regular pace of 50 hours a week, I can produce around one minute of completed film every 8 to 10 weeks. I also need to budget for sound and music since this is not my area of expertise. I already produced approximately 30 seconds of animation so the new footage will be added to that.\nFIRST GOAL - $15,000: I will create ONE minute of new full color animation bringing the total length to 1\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nSECOND GOAL - $30,000: I will create TWO minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 2\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nTHIRD GOAL - $45,000: I will create THREE minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 3\u00bd minutes. LOCKED!\nFOURTH GOAL - $52,500:  I will create THREE AND A HALF minutes of new full color animation bringing the total length to 4 minutes. LOCKED!\nFIFTH GOAL - $60,000: In addition to the FOUR-MINUTE SHORT FILM, I will create a TWO-MINUTE THEATRICAL TRAILER featuring 30 seconds of new animation.\nIf we reach the $60,000 mark, I will create a 2-minute theatrical trailer featuring scenes from the short film as well as 30 seconds of new animation. For the new animation, I will cherry pick events from the graphic novel that will display the full breath of what the feature film will look like: spectacular, emotional, poetic, action-packed, mysterious and thrilling.\nAdding 30 more seconds of animation that will be publicly shown before the completed feature film's theatrical release means that I will have to increase the length of the feature film to 45 minutes, so that I still respect the Academy's 10% rule. This is okay\u2014a 45-minute film still falls within the range of what I envision.\nAnything raised above the fifth goal will go back into the production to pay for sound and music, more lavish animation and effects, etc. EVERYTHING WILL GO INTO THE FILM. The bigger the budget, the more impressive this film will be. If you make the calculation (subtract rewards and 10% Kickstarter and Amazon fee), you will see how low the budget actually is for what I'm trying to attempt. That's why any surplus in money would allow me to expand the project further (equipment, software, assistant animator, etc). I'm not here to get rich, I only want an opportunity to do a beautiful film.\nOnce the short film is completed, I will start designing the next phase of financing, as well as planning the potential addition of a small crew. But first, let's do this first part!\nEVOLVING TECHNOLOGY\nWhen I started in the animation industry back in the 80s, I dreamt of a day when the technology would evolve to a point where a small group of artists, or even a single one, would be able to create complex and fully animated films\u2014something that could only be achieved with huge crews and big budgets at the time. Throughout my career, I kept learning everything I could about animation filmmaking while exploring new technologies. I always kept my dream alive of one day making that \"classically animated\" movie that would look like a big budget feature film, only done with a fraction of the cost. The big appeal for me was simple\u2014if the cost was massively reduced, a truly singular artistic vision could be kept untampered.\nWhen digital ink & paint and compositing started making their way into the animation biz in the early 90s, I hooked up with Cambridge Animation from the UK, to help them develop Animo, a 2D software for traditional animators. From that relationship, I made a short film called, PRELUDE TO EDEN, and became one of the spokepersons for Animo (watch the film here).\nDuring that period, Animo became the prime tool for non-Disney animated feature films, being used on movies such as, THE IRON GIANT, OSMOSIS JONES, PRINCE OF EGYPT, THE QUEST FOR CAMELOT, ELDORADO, SPACE JAM and many more. However, 2D animation software from other sources continued to evolve while Animo stagnated. I had to come to the realization that Animo, a product of a now defunct company which hadn't been updated since 2006, was no longer cutting edge. After over 15 years of using Animo for my animation projects, it was time for me to move on. I did some research and found a series of software called Toon Boom. Quickly thereafter, I proceeded to use Toon Boom Harmony 10, their latest offering, to create an animation test based on my graphic novel, THE SAGA OF REX (you can read all about it here).\nToon Boom allowed me to remain 100% paperless and bypass time-consuming steps such as scanning and processing drawings. By working directly within the software with a Cintiq tablet, my process was massively sped up. To test this, I gave myelf a 3-week deadline in an effort to see how much I could accomplish within that time frame. Chosing a simple section of the graphic novel, I was able to singlehandedly create approximately 30 seconds of animation, fully colored and composited. This would have been unthinkable if I would have been hand drawing the animation on paper. Granted, I worked like a mad man for the duration of the test, and this was one of the simplest section of the graphic novel with only one character and very little special effects\u2014most of the book is a good deal more involved and would require more time\u2014but nevertheless, I saw what was possible.\nTHE ORIGIN OF REX\nIn 1997, I was working at Warner Brothers Feature Animation as Special Effects Supervisor. My production assistant at the time, Scott Grieder, really enjoyed my art and suggested that I do a children's book. The thought of illustrating a storybook sounded pretty cool, so I told Scott, \"I'll draw it and you write it.\" I quickly scribbled a drawing of a cute little fox facing a strange creature and gave it to Scott. \"This is your starting point, write something about that,\" I said to him.\nTwo weeks later, before Scott had a chance to begin writing, I had completed twenty more illustrations.\"Here's more inspiration for your story,\" I said while handing him a stack of photocopies.\nAnother fifteen to twenty days later, I called Scott to tell him that the book was finished and that I'd written the whole thing. I couldn't stop myself\u2014it just poured out of me. I was glad to hear that Scott was relieved to have the burden off his shoulders.\nA SEARCH FOR MEANING: THE STORY OF REX was finished in December 1997 and published in July 1998 as an oversized hardcover book, signed and numbered edition of 1000\nI sold the book at trade shows, conventions and to friends, and after a couple of years, sold out all the copies. I didn't want to let the story disappear into oblivion, so in 2002, I colored the illustrations, refined the layouts, and self-published the second hard cover edition. I actually managed to get a distribution deal for the new edition and was able to get the book in several comic shops and bookstores.\nThe color edition eventually sold out and in my desire to keep the story available for readers, I included the original black and white version of the book in PARABLES: AN ANTHOLOGY, a compilation of the first four storybooks I self-published in 2004.\nREX TAKES FLIGHT\nBack in 2004, I was doing a signing at the Golden Apple Comics Booth at the Long Beach Wizard Con. Kazu Kibuishi (Amulet, Daisy Kutter) came to my table and showed me a binder containing the artwork for a comic anthology he was putting together called, FLIGHT. I was very impressed with it. Kazu was familiar with my work and hoped I'd be a part of future volumes, so when I suggested using my REX character, he was very receptive. One of Kazu's goals with Flight was to help artists build their own graphic novels in manageable chunks. Not sure if anyone else took advantage of that, but I, for one, saw a golden opportunity.\nWhen I did the first 17 pages for FLIGHT vol. 2, I had no idea where the overall story would take me. By the time FLIGHT vol. 3 rolled in, I had figured out the overall outline with its main themes and concepts. Within that framework, I kept improvising and coming up with new ideas as I went along.  From 2005 to 2010, I did a new chapter every year and progressively built the story over six volumes of FLIGHT.\nTHE SAGA OF REX was very loosely thumbnailed, and in some cases I didn't even thumbnail at all. I'd go straight ahead with cleaned up and colored pages without knowing exactly what the next page would be like. This method of working would be impossible in mainstream comics, but for a project like REX, being serialized in FLIGHT, it worked well. I found that it kept me constantly on my toes creatively and allowed new ideas to sneak in and surprise me. It made the whole process fun, unexpected and never boring.\nOnce the story was completed, I repackaged the whole thing, added a few pages and sent a mock-up to Image Comics, to see if they would be interested in publishing the graphic novel. I was delighted to get a very enthusiastic response from Image Comics' publisher, Eric Stephenson, and the book was quickly added to their pipeline. The complete SAGA OF REX was published by Image Comics in the fall of 2010.\nREWARDS\nThe rewards will allow you to dig deeper into my universe of strange beings, otherwordly concepts and offbeat storytelling. All my personal art is linked in some manner, and THE SAGA OF REX is very much part of this universe I've been developing over the years.\nEven though, the approximate shipping date for the rewards is listed as October 2013, most items will actually start shipping early in 2013. October 2013 is when I anticipate delivering the downloadable file of the film. The production blog will also become accessible as soon I start working on the film.\nTHE SECRET PRODUCTION BLOG: To share the experience of making the film with the people who back this project, I will create a secret, password protected blog that will document the whole process\u2014elation and frustration, happiness and trauma\u2014I\u2019ll share everything, the art, the tests, the animation\u2014every step of the way.

Keeping your own list of to-dos up to date makes you more productive and accountable, but the real power of task management comes from teams collaborating on tasks.  Our current iOS app helps you better handle your email and tasks but our web app will take this to the next level.  Our web application will allow users to collaborate on tasks updating status, priority, and due dates as a team.\nWhat about Android?\nWe love all our mobile devices equally, but building an Android app means doubling our engineering costs.  We will build a native Android version, but our current plan has that coming after the iOS version.  If we are able to reach our stretch goal of $60,000 we can hire more engineers and move up our Android delivery to January.

If you answered yes to this question, then Cthulhu Claus Greeting Cards are just for you.\nEach box of Cthulhu Claus Greeting Cards will contain 25 cards and feature 5 different illustrations by cartoonist Jody Lindke.  They will also feature a Lovecraftian greeting written by Cthulhu scribe Kenneth Hite.  These items will be shipped as soon as possible after the project is funded and should be ready to ship this Holiday season.\nWho is Working on the Project?\nAbout Jody Lindke --  When her kindergarten bookmark design beat out first and second graders--earning her a hardbound Complete Winnie The Pooh--Jody was hooked on drawing. She began freelancing in junior high school and supported herself while attending University of Nevada with single and multi panel comics and illustrations for many local publications. Jody became the first female artist ever to receive the Charles M. Schulz Award from Scripps Howard--presented to her delight by Snoopy himself. After her first novel earned her a Masters degree, Jody left teaching at the university to enter the production program at USC\u2019s School of Cinema.\nAbout Kenneth Hite -- Kenneth Hite is a writer and role-playing game designer. He holds an M.A. in International Relations from the University of Chicago and a Bachelor's degree in Cartography from East Central University. He has been writing games since 1981 and full-time since 1995. In addition to his writing for role playing games, Kenneth Hite has been the author of a number of Lovecraft related fiction and non-fiction titles.  These include Tour De Lovecraft: The Tales, Cthulhu 101, Where the Deep Ones Are, The Antarctic Express, and Cliffourd the Big Red God.\nWhy $4,800?\nThis will allow Twin Suns Entertainment to meet the break even costs for a 200 box print run of the card set and allow us to begin to announce stretch goals for the project.  We want to be able to make stickers and post cards available to supporters, but that will require a certain level of support.  The most expensive part of publishing these cards is the set up cost with the printer and this level of funding will allow us to clear that hurdle.\n\nLimited Rewards:\nThe Real Cthulhu Claus -- The person who backs at this level will receive the original black and white line art base version of the the illustration below. This illustration will be signed by the artist and personalized if you desire. In addition, you will receive one box of Cthulhu Claus Holiday Cards and a set of five postcards.  As the project continues, more illustrations will be made available.\n\"and eight tiny dark young...it sang, 'dash away, dash away, dash away all!'\"\nTenticular Cookie Devourer from Beyond Time -- The person who backs at this level will receive the original black and white line art base version of the the illustration below. This illustration will be signed by the artist and personalized if you desire. In addition, you will receive one box of Cthulhu Claus Holiday Cards and a set of five postcards.  As the project continues, more illustrations will be made available.\nTurnabout is Fair Play -- At this level, you get the original black and white line art base illustration used in making the Cthulhu Claus Cookie with a Bite Taken card design. This illustration will be signed by the artist and personalized if you desire. In addition, you will receive one box of Cthulhu Claus Holiday Cards and a set of five postcards.\nYith-mas Tree Decorator -- At this level, you get the original black and white line art base illustration used in making the Yith-mas Tree card design. This illustration will be signed by the artist and personalized if you desire. In addition, you will receive one box of Cthulhu Claus Holiday Cards and a set of five postcards.\n\n\"Slay\" Ride -- At this level, you get the original black and white line art base illustration used in making the \"Slay\" Ride card design. This illustration will be signed by the artist and personalized if you desire. In addition, you will receive one box of Cthulhu Claus Holiday Cards and a set of five postcards.\nWill There be Stretch Goals?\nYes.  As we approach our initial goal, we will be announcing a number of stretch goals to this project.  One that I am particularly excited about involves a certain trilogy by Matt Forbeck which involves monsters and education.  Some of the stretch goals will be added to existing awards, and others will be available as add-ons.  All of them will be available as separate rewards when they are announced.\n$5,200 -- Stretch Goal\nIf we reach $5,200 with this project.  We will be emailing all supporters at the $30 level and higher 10 \"Coloring Pages\" that can be printed out and handed to your favorite little monster to draw on.  The first five of those illustrations will be based on the illustrations used in the Cthulhu Claus Holiday Card set.  The second five illustrations will be based on characters from Matt Forbeck's upcoming Monster Academy trilogy.  The artwork will also be given to Matt to be used in his project as illustrations in his books.  If all goes well, we might even be able to get more illustrations for Matt to use!\n\nWhat are Other Saying About Cthulhu Holiday Cards?\nChristian Lindke's a font of energy and ideas.

We're unable to edit pledge levels, so here's an update of goals to professionally illustrate each game:\n$20+: Wolf Man's Curse unlocked at $4000\n$25+: Monster Con! unlocked at $5500\n$30+: Blood Type unlocked at $7000\n$35+: Demon Bound unlocked at $8500\n$40+: The Return of Monster Con! unlocked at $10000\nAll other rewards at these levels apply as well, of course. \nThat's the news. Now the basic info for those who have just joined us...\nWhat Is It?\nInvasion of the Saucer People is a card game for 2-4 players working together to fend off a 1950's-style alien invasion. Each turn, a wave of saucers attacks, and the players must band together to defend against them. To fail is to lose one of the inner planets--Mercury, Venus, Earth, or Mars--to the invaders. Lose them all, and humankind faces extinction. \nFortunately, your crew cards provide special abilities that can be used in a pinch to help hold off overwhelming attacks. Also, the game is self-leveling, so that 2 players face a lesser threat than 3 players or 4 do. \nClip-Art Crew Cards from the Playtest Set\nEverything you need to play is in this one deck: 4 suits of cards, each with a Captain, a Navigator, an Engineer, and 10 combination alien-attack/human-defense cards; plus 2 non-suited malfunction cards to add a bit of uncertainty. Also included is a carefully tested and edited rules sheet. Age level is 10+. \nWho's Doing It?\nThe concept and rules are by me, Lester Smith, designer of such things as the Origins-award-winning Dragon Dice game and the popular Dark Conspiracy role-playing game. \nAll new illustration is being done by Bradley K. McDevitt. (What you saw in the video is clip art, used on the playtest set.) Brad is the author and illustrator of the cult classic It Came from the Late, Late, Late Show role-playing game and has done illustrations for most of the major game companies, including a stint as staff illustrator for Game Designers' Workshop. His most recent illustration credits include the Age of Cthulhu and Dungeon Crawl Classics lines from Goodman Games.\nThe publisher is Popcorn Press, a family-owned hobby project with a history of producing poetry and short fiction, including an ongoing line of Halloween titles (Vampyr Verse, The Hungry Dead, Halloween Haiku, and the upcoming Cthulhu Haiku).\nThe Professional Card Back\nHere's a glimpse at Brad's process, from his initial pitch (far left), to pencil, to inks, to computer colorization. The card faces will be penciled, inked, and colored using this same process.\nClick for a closer look.\nWhy Are We Doing It?\nMy grandson loves the game. It would be great to see him playing it with professionally illustrated and published cards. \nIt's also a natural step for Popcorn Press. If this project reaches its funding goal, you can expect to see many more games from the company. I have several finished designs just waiting in the wings. \nWhy So Cheap?\nWe've set our target funding goal as low as possible, to give this first game project from Popcorn Press its best chance at success. At this basic level, the card backs will be in full color, the faces will be black-and-white illustrations, and publication will be print-on-demand. \nIf there's enough interest, we'll set a stretch goal to colorize the faces, and we'll be able to print a full press run with a larger card-game printer. At that point, we can also afford to add a retailer discount package. Other  stretch goals are in the works.\nWhat You Can Do...\nPledges are appreciated, of course. But so is buzz. Spread the word; spread the link; spread the love. Send me an \"Atta boy,\" if you can spare one. \nSincerely,\nLes\nSTRETCH GOALS!\nThank you again for the support in reaching\u2014and surpassing\u2014our initial goal! That funding will pay for a full-color card back, black-and-white card faces, and printing and shipping of decks for backers. What it doesn't pay for is time and effort put in by Popcorn Press staff to get the product into backers\u2019 hands. Which brings me to the topic of stretch goals. The following have been created to help fund Popcorn Press\u2019s expansion, while offering you some exciting new product. Without further ado\u2026 \n$2500\u2014Full-Color Cards & Rules, Limited-Edition Captain Cards, Charity Decks [GOAL MET!]\nAt $2500, (1) the Invasion of the Saucer People card faces will all be colorized. This includes both the PDF and the physical product. (2) We will add two limited-edition Captain cards (Ceres and Luna, each with a unique power), available only to backers of this Kickstarter project. These Captains will be included both in the PDF and physical editions. (3) We\u2019ll also print the game rules in full color front and back, with illustrated examples of play. (4) In addition, we will donate 25 decks to charities chosen from backer suggestions. (5) And we will join the \u201cKicking it Forward\u201d promise, pledging five percent of our proceeds after costs to future Kickstarter projects. \n$4000\u2014Wolf Man's Curse [GOAL MET!]\nAt $4000, we will release a PDF version of the Wolf Man's Curse card game, in full color, for pledges at a new level of $20 and above. (This $20 level will also receive the $15 awards.) \nIn the Wolf Man\u2019s Curse game, each player is a victim of lycanthropy and must avoid slaughtering innocents during the full of the moon. As if that weren\u2019t difficult enough, they must also dodge the \u201cSilver Bullet\u201d at the hands of their \u201cTrue Love,\u201d escape being lynched by angry villagers, and not be convicted and hanged by Scotland Yard. If anyone survives to the end, the guiltless soul wins\u2014or the richest, if all hands are bloody. \nIn addition, we'll add a limited-edition Renegade Alien Queen card to the Invasion of the Saucer People deck for all pledges of $25 or more. The Renegade Alien Queen card joins the human defenders and can captain a ship. In combat against the invaders, she can mesmerize one attacking card, forcing it to fight its fellows.\nMini Stretch Goal: $4500\u2014Robot Sidekick\nAt $4500, this limited-edition card will be added to the rewards for pledges of $30 and up. The Robot Sidekick is a special Navigator card with unique powers.\nMini Stretch Goal: $5000\u2014Space Monkey\nAt $5000, this limited-edition card will be added to the rewards for pledges of $35 and up. The Space Monkey is a special Engineer card with unique powers.\n$5500\u2014Monster Con!\nAt $5500, (1) we will increase our deck donation to 50 copies, and (2) we will release a PDF version of the Monster Con! card game, in full color, for pledges of $25 and above. \nIn Monster Con!, players take the roles of Dracula, Werewolf, Mummy, and Frankenstein\u2019s Monster, all attending a SciFi convention. Each is convinced that the starlet guest of honor, Desire Delamort, is his own true love. Can one monster draw close enough to snag her before the attendees realize these are not costumes? Will there be a monster showdown? Will Flash Armstrong, Ms. Delamort\u2019s sports-star boyfriend, save her? \n$7000\u2014Blood Type!\nAt $7000, we will release a PDF version of the Blood Type card game, in full color, for pledges at a new level of $30 and above. (This $30 pledge level will also receive the $25 awards.) \nIn the world of Blood Type, a weaponized virus has been accidentally released, attacking each blood type differently. Each player takes the role of a different faction, trying to emerge victorious in a post-apocalyptic world. The blood type A faction must eat raw flesh to stave off the ravages of the disease. The AB faction is a maniacal killing machine. The O+ faction is an antidote, and just wants to survive; they\u2019re hunted by the S.M.a.R.T. faction that accidentally released the virus in the first place. \n$8500\u2014Demon Bound\nAt $8500, (1) we will increase our deck donation to 100 copies, and (2) we will release a PDF version of the Demon Bound card game, in full color, for pledges at a new level of $35 and above. (This $35 pledge level will also receive the $30 awards.) \nIn Demon Bound, it\u2019s anno domini 666, and you have just learned the secret of Solomon\u2019s Seal, which binds demons to your service. This knowledge can make you unbelievably wealthy. Unfortunately, you\u2019re not the only one possessing it. To achieve your dreams of ungodly riches, you\u2019ll have to destroy your competitors\u2014if your summoned demons don't kill you first.\n$10,000\u2014The Return of Monster Con!\nAt $10,000, we will release a PDF version of The Return of Monster Con! card game, in full color, for pledges at a new level of $40 and above. The Return of Monster Con! game adds four new monsters to the mix. Current plans are for the Invisible Man, the Alien Changeling, the Amorphous Blog, and Swampy. \nNOTE: Each of these card games is a stand-alone product, with very different rules. (The one exception is Monster Con! and The Return of Monster Con!, which are stand-alone but share rules\u2014and which can be played by mixing monsters from each.)\nThis is an audacious set of stretch goals. But I\u2019m hoping with your help to see all six products published. If we do reach that point, we\u2019ll consider new stretch goals to physically print one or more of these PDF games. And maybe even a board game or two.\n\nThanks again, and keep spreading the word!\nMonster Con! prototype logo", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #62", "update_userinfo": "Jonesing to Keep Up", "update_content": "Dear Invasion of the Saucer People backer,\nLast weekend, at GameHoleCon, a Kickstarter backer chided me (in friendly fashion) for not having messaged him about a later project. \nThe Problem: Messaging Kickstarter backers means there's a good chance some people get the same message several times--once for each project they backed.

The signal from this coil is conditioned and connected to a high-speed timing processor. The timing processor is clocked at 125 MHz; thus, providing ultra-high precision frequency measurement of the Accutron watch with up to 6 significant digits. The frequency of the Accutron is then sent to a notebook computer via a USB connection for display and analysis. A diagram detailing this operation is shown below:\nThe mathematics below shows how up to six digits of precision are derived. The system is driven by a 125 MHz crystal oscillator. The clock source being measured is the frequency of an Accutron Watch, which oscillates around 360 Hz. For each cycle of the Accutron Watch frequency, approximately 347,222 counts are counted by a high-speed 24-bit counter driven by the 125 MHz oscillator. Two high-speed 24-bit counters are used to capture each cycle of the Accutron Watch. Every cycle of 24-bit counter data is then captured and sent serially over the USB Port to a notebook computer where the raw counter data is analyzed and displayed.\nThe waveforms diagram below shows various testpoints indicted in the System Diagram above. It shows how each cycle of the Accutron Watch is captured and digitized with ultra-high precision.\nShown below is an electronic schematic prototype design I plan to implement. To detect the vibration of the tuning fork Accutron Watch, a magnetic induction coil is used. The detected oscillation is signal conditioned as the first stage of the Timing Processor. Two modes are provided. The Standard Mode (STD_MODE) features a filtered input designed to properly condition the frequency coming from the Watch and remove extraneous noise that may interfere with the timing. The Mumford Mode (MUM_MODE) is a special request that provides an input emulation of a previous generation device. Switch SW1 allows selection between these two modes of input conditioning. Both modes provide a positive square wave signal to the LC4256ZE Complex Programmable Logic Device or CPLD made by Lattice Semiconductor. The CPLD contains the necessary hardware and switching speed to measure the frequency of the Watch and package this frequency for transmission over a USB Port to a Notebook Computer.\nDetailed below shows how the CPLD is connected to an off-the-shelf USB Interface called FT2232H Mini Module. This Module contains the necessary circuitry to properly interface to the high-speed USB 2.0 Port. Also provided is another USB port, which is used program the CPLD. This Port is built into the CPLD Breakout Board.\nThe software tools for developing the CPLD configuration pattern is available free of charge from Lattice Semiconductor. Verilog is the hardware programming language.\nShown below is software running on a Notebook Computer will receive captured raw packets of 24-bit counter information. The information is being received at a rate of around 360 packets / second over the USB 2.0 Port. The software can apply special filtering algorithms that will smooth out the waveform allowing a temporal shift to be easily observed.

We will also add another model from the same storyline, albeit one half world away - Oz Judge Bruce, mounted on his trike! Bruce and Trike will be added to Sector Chief and Chief Judge levels.\nAnd that is not all either! Now that we have passed the $80,000 stretch, we will send an electronic copy of the Judge Dredd RPG core book (which is a lovely read, even if you are not a roleplayer) to everyone who has pledged more than $100, regardless of actual pledge level - just our way of saying thank you very, very much for all your support. Judge Dredd started off as a 'community' game, and your help in boosting both its range and profile is appreciated beyond words here at Mongoose HQ. Thank you.\nHere at Mongoose, we are really excited about the new movie, the Block War supplement and what the future holds for Judge Dredd overall. 2000AD was the first comic I started reading when I was a kid, and it has been with me for, well, decades now! Back then I would never have guessed I would actually be working with Judge Dredd and exploring Mega-City One, and it is great to share this with fans of the comic who love the high octane action and black humour of Judge Dredd.\nMay your Lawgiver always fire true!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #142", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Concluded", "update_content": "Good afternoon everyone,\nA little before Christmas, we dispatched what should be the last of the models from this Kickstarter to the handful of you still waiting for them, mainly replacements for broken or missing items.

This is a flawless execution of design, advanced options, and portability. I can't wait to own 4-5 of these!\" - Cameron Michael, The Manhattan Project\nFeatured on Engadget, PopPhoto, Gizmag, TUAW, BiteMyApple and Timelapse.org!\n- - - -\nWhat is a time-lapse?\nA time-lapse is a series of photos taken over a period of time that are stitched together to create a beautiful video clip of whatever scene you are capturing. Imagine taking video of a scene, and then speeding it up to capture the passage of time in ways our eyes never could. Our personal favorite is Yosemite HD, made by our close friends Colin Delehanty and Sheldon Neill. \nNever done one before? No worries! We will also be providing clear-as-day tutorials to go along with your Radian, to show you how to use every one of our features. \nWhat is Radian?\nRadian is a remarkably powerful, yet wonderfully simple solution that lets you take incredible moving time-lapses with just a few swipes of your iOS or Android device. It's small, rugged, and can handle anything you throw at it. It can rotate side-to-side. It can tilt up and down. It can dynamically speed up and slow down. And if you have a Canon dSLR, you can change exposure to capture sunrise to sunset. You name it. With our app, the sky is the limit. \nWho is it for?\nYou. Whether you've never done a time-lapse in your life, or you're a pro photographer coming back from your 20th trip to Yosemite. Whether you just want to capture your daughter's birthday party in a fun and unique way, or document your group working on a project, we designed this for you. We worked closely with professional time-lapsers to design a product that met exacting needs, and then radically innovated to make it ultra-affordable, extremely versatile, and unbelievably easy to use. If you know how to use your camera and your phone, then you know how to use Radian. In fact, you don't even have to own a camera - any iPhone or Android will do. \nWe'll be transparent. \nThis is about bringing time-lapse to you. This is about enabling you to share and showcase the amazing things you see and do. That means that in addition to being well designed, it must be affordable. Which is why Radian starts at just $150. This is unprecedented - remote timers alone cost $130. And the only way we can sell it at this price is if we get 1,250 pre-orders. We\u2019re pushing the limits of Kickstarter because we strongly believe that by putting this product in your hands, beautiful things will happen. Your money goes directly into tooling & mold costs, pcb printing, as well as component parts to make Radian. \nFeatures\nUltra-affordable  For the first 150 backers, Radian is only $125, and $150 for all kickstarter backers. It is the most affordable motion time-lapse device ever. Period.\nUltra-portable design Radian is a completely self-contained product that is easy to transport, solidly built, and can start timelapsing in seconds. It even works on tabletops! \nYou don't even need a tripod to use Radian!\nEasy-to-use & fully-functional A major design goal involved making the entire process of time-lapsing frustration and hassle free, so you can actually enjoy what you're capturing. We designed (and are continuing to improve) a beautiful and easy-to-use app that lets you do everything you'd want with time-lapses, without overwhelming you with a confusing and ugly interface.\nTo make things even simpler, our app makes valuable real time calculations - giving you a good feel for what the resulting time-lapse would be based on your settings. This allows you to quickly and easily adjust your settings to get your desired output while simultaneously saving you multiple trips to the calculator app.\nWe have integrated bramping (bulb-ramping for smooth night-day-night transitions, currently only for Canon cameras), speed ramping, and a range of time-delay settings. Our app combined with Radian allows you to take on previously difficult feats, such as day-to-night and sunrise-to-sunset timelapses.\nNo phone tethering required We recognize that you and your phone are most likely attached at the hip, which is why unlike other iPhone-based camera triggers and devices, you don't need to keep your iPhone connected. Once you press \"Start,\" you are free to disconnect your phone without any worry of interfering with your timelapse. The last thing you want is your game of Angry Birds to interrupt a time-lapse that you had started hours prior. And when you're far out in the wilds of Alaska, you can turn your phone off to save valuable battery life for when you really need it. And trust us, both of those situations may happen more than you think.\nInfinitely expandable battery life - As photographers, we unfortunately know all too well the dreaded scenario in which we didn't bring enough batteries to the shoot. Which is why we designed Radian to be easily run off of any external USB power pack, easily providing enough power to let you to run Radian continuously for multiple days on end. \nEco-friendly We decided to support the movement of environmentally conscious consumer electronics by integrating an energy dense, rechargeable lithium ion power source. We believe the days of using alkaline batteries once and then throwing them away to damage our home is over.\nPlays nice with others Radian is fully-compatible with digital SLRs and any camera with a trigger-release input. However, Radian can also easily be paired with any smartphone time-lapse app to create some on-the-go 'lapses with your iPhone or Android.\nRadian also works remarkably well in combination with other timelapse equipment, like motorized dollies and other timelapse triggers. When paired with a motorized slider, some amazing timelapses happen.\nSpecs\nDimensions: 4.57 x 1.77\" (116mm x 45mm)\nWeight: 8oz. (225g)\nPanning Load: 15lbs (7kg)\nTilt load: 4+ lbs., so far tested with the following setup: Canon 5D Mark III with Canon EF 16-35mm f/2.8 LII with heavy duty L-bracket\nAngular Resolution: 0.0124\u00b0 (over 29,000 discrete positions per 360\u00b0).

In his dingy garage, he was lamenting to the others about the lack of any truly portable, affordable and easy-to-use photography equipment, especially when it came to timelapse gear. A full year earlier he had been captivated by the potential of rotating time lapses (see 1:20 of https://vimeo.com/16914640), but couldn't find any affordable or simple product to do just that. He just wanted a simple rotary device that he could use to (hopefully) create some beautiful time lapses.\nWe all thought about it for awhile, and realized that it shouldn't, and doesn't, have to be that way. We immediately recognized the amazing potential for putting time-lapse tools into the hands of not just professionals, but casual shooters and amateurs as well. In our heads, we saw the amazing timelapses that were just waiting to be captured all around us, but weren't for lack of an accessible and simple product.\nSo we got together, and set out to make a motion time-lapse product the way we thought it should be made.\nIf we raise this money, it proves to everyone in the industry that there is a large group of people out there who love the nuances of photography, but can't spend a fortune on the equipment they need to create those perfect moments.\nOur timeline\nOur timeline has been thoroughly planned and reviewed, and we are ready to hit the ground running.

And everyone receiving a physical copy of the book gets a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS bookmark.\n$120k - Either a second 6-8 page supplemental story, or the first supplement will be expanded to 12-16 pages. PDF/digital delivery only; every backer $9-PDF level and above will receive this exclusively. And everyone receiving a physical copy of the book will get a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS postcard and a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS bookmark.\n$150k - Jim will shave his head. (Pretty sure we're not making this one, --I hope-- but if we do, it will be filmed and put up for viewing.) (PS: There's no allowance here for back-outs and denied credit cards; if my hair is going, it's at 150k for real)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nONE LAST REWARD\nIt's the final days of the campaign, and we've come up with a high-end unique pledge reward to -hopefully- give us a significant boost towards our final stretch goal. We're offering a one of a kind edition of Jim Calafiore's script notes and layouts. \n\"When I begin a new book, I print out the script one script-page to an 8 1/2 x 11 page. On these I make my notes to myself, and questions to ask the writer. I also do a pen thumbnail of how I'll lay out the page. The next step is a rough pencil sketch on layout paper about half the size of the final art board, which -for the final penciling- is blown up and transferred to the full size art board using a light box.\" \nThis is an opportunity to own all of Jim's script pages with notes and thumbnails, and all the original layout roughs for the whole main story of LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS. The volume will be over 160 pages (more if we exceed the 105k stretch goal), more than 80 pages of Jim's original pencil layouts, showing his creative process. Also included will be Jim's original layouts for both the regular and alternate covers for the graphic novel, as well as a selection of the original character pencil roughs. \nThis will be bound in a single hardcover volume, a little larger than 8 1/2 x 11. The cover will feature the same art as the regular graphic novel. There will be a foreword by Jim, and an afterword by Gail, and the book will be signed by both Gail and Jim. Being all original art, this will of course be a single edition. The pledge level will be $4,000. \nWe are limiting this to CONTINENTAL US ONLY because, to be honest, it scares the willies out of us to think about shipping a one-of-a-kind out of the country. If you are outside the continental US, but plan to attend a convention in the US that Jim or Gail will be attending, you can pledge for the book and pick it up there. (Jim's website jimcalafiore.com lists his con schedule, and he usually does at least the same shows each year. And both Gail and Jim definitely do San Diego Comic Con.) \nAs an additional bonus, for any backer who pledges for this volume, if you are attending a convention that either Gail or Jim or both are attending, you can choose to receive the book personally at a lunch with the creator(s).\n------------------------------------------------------\n112 PAGE STRETCH GOAL\nWe exceeded $92k!\nOnward and upward. Our next goal is more pages. The stretch goal to increase the page count to 112 pages is $105k. These would be story pages, not filler. We'd love the opportunity to put even more into the story. And we think we have a serious chance of reaching the next goal.\nThe support has been amazing; and just looking at the number we've reached already is extremely gratifying. Shows not only what the fans can do, but what Kickstarter can be for so many creators. Direct connection with no middlemen.\nThanks\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$86k unlocks the Comixology digital comic. We're contracting with Comixology to help fulfill our digital rewards commitment. They will take our book and convert it to a digital comic that works with their app, and feature all the functionality like double-tap zoom. (All backers at the PDF level and above will get a code to use at Comixology to download the digital comic for free. We will still be sending the PDF to all those backers.) Comixology will also host a small preview of the book for free download when it's ready.\n$92k As mentioned below, we've been hoping to reunite the Secret Six team, and bring the excellent colorist Jason Wright on board. We definitely had a great working rapport with him, and he brought so much to the series. Jason won't have any personal stake in the book, so he'd be hired basically as an independent contractor. And in this same goal, we'll be looking to bring on a separate letterer who will also be handling our pre-press file handling, getting it ready for the printer, freeing us up creatively.\n(Folded into both of those is also an accommodation for the fact that we've happily exceeded our 3,000 book print run estimate, and are into the next level of printing costs.)\nWe're looking into the goal after that, and hoping to expand to 112 pages which will let us open and deepen the story even more. We're looking into budget and pricing for that (besides printing, there's the added freight and shipping costs because of increased weight). We figure that will be somewhere over 100k; we'd be beyond thrilled if we can get that far, but don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're grateful for how far you've gotten us already.\n                                  ---------------------------------------\nAs of the $81k goal, the book is now hardcover; all copies shipped will be hardcover.\n                                    -----------------------------------\nWe are also offering a signed bookplate to be included with the book. If you'd like that, you have to add $10 to your pledge (to cover our printing, shipping and inserting of the book plates). A few of the rewards have it listed, but it applies to all rewards. Any reward pledge that includes the actual book increased by that $10 will get the bookplate included. (The $10 does not apply to the two 10-book bulk rewards; those backers add $25) There's more explanation in the FAQ and UPDATES.\nLEAVING MEGALOPOLIS is a thrilling, original 80 page graphic novel of suspense and terror in a superhero universe gone horribly wrong, where a small band of survivors face the horror of both their formerly beloved protectors, and the dark secrets within themselves. Featuring the creative talents of writer Gail Simone and artist Jim Calafiore this is a story of violence, fear, hope and --if they're lucky-- survival. \nLEAVING MEGALOPOLIS will be brought to you by the team behind DC Comics' critical smash, SECRET SIX. IGN.COM called the final issue of Secret Six, \"the best single comic issue of 2011,\" and in this dark ride of a story, we go even wilder! LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS is a journey, by two professional creators, with no holds barred and no limits imposed. Our groundbreaking work on SECRET SIX was only the beginning. If you thought that was dark...\nLEAVING MEGALOPOLIS will be a new and complete story in a single 80 page volume. Bonus materials will include development sketches, single page illustrations by some of the biggest names in comics, a forward by industry legend MARK WAID, and a short prose story in the LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS universe by Gail Simone. \nInitial plans are for the graphic novel to be available only through this Kickstarter drive. We're handling everything, including shipping of the individual books to pledges of $15 or above. There's additional goodies to be had with higher pledge incentives, listed down the right side of the page. The rewards will ship at different times. Some incentives, like the print or commission art, will ship within months; the graphic novel will ship in early 2013. \nThis an example of the 9x12 commission\nThis is an example of the 11x17 commission\nPlans are to keep the printing in the US, (the same printer and specs as the last Secret Six trade, THE DARKEST HOUSE), and if possible to reunite with another of the SIX team, colorist Jason Wright. And if we're lucky, and the funding goal is exceeded enough to afford it, we hope to expand the page count. \n We're working on the book now, so please check back for more preview art as it's done. Thanks so much for considering our project.\nABOUT THE CREATORS\nGAIL SIMONE is the multiple award winning writer of WONDER WOMAN, BIRDS OF PREY, DEADPOOL, THE SIMPSONS, and many other classic runs of some of the world's most popular comics.

All you need to do is choose how many MiniDrives you want, and we will collect your choice of model (i.e. the Nifty MiniDrive Pro, the Nifty MiniDrive [Air], or the Nifty MiniDrive Retina), as well as your choice of color and shipping address in our email survey at the end of the campaign.\nUPDATE - MiniDrive for the Retina MacBook Pro now available: See Update #2 for details.\nIMPORTANT: The MiniDrive does not come with a MicroSD card - that must be bought separately and can be easily acquired at almost any online or high street consumer electronics retailer :-)\nNOTE: A couple of people have pointed out to us that we have mixed our terms a little. To clarify; when we refer to the MiniDrive increasing the \"memory\" of your computer, we mean the storage space, not RAM. Sorry for any confusion that this might have caused!\nTHE PROTOTYPE\nThe main difference between the prototype and the production model is that we change the casing material of the body from mostly aluminium to an engineering plastic.\nThe front of the MiniDrive (the bit can be seen when the drive is inserted into the computer and is used for removal) will still be machined from high grade aluminium to ensure the fit and finish matches the MacBook.\nNote 1: The MiniDrive is really easy to remove from your computer - you just stick a paper-clip through the specially designed eyelet at the front of the device to pull it out!\nThe first time you use a paper-clip you can use the front of the drive to bend the paper-clip into a little hook - then you have your very own MiniDrive removal tool! Macgyver would be proud.\nOr, if you are not the paper-clip kind; if you can help us get over $500,000 pledges before the end of the Kickstarter campaign, we will be sending one of these out free with every MiniDrive we ship:\nThe Nifty Tool - Specially designed for removing your MiniDrive\nSee our updates for more details on the Nifty Tool!\nNote 2: The devices shown on all videos are the prototypes we made to test the concept - the appearance of the production drives will be as close to the following pictures as possible:\nNifty MiniDrive - for the Macbook Air\nNifty MiniDrive Pro - for the Macbook Pro\nNote 3: Pink and blue are special editions for our Kickstarter supporters, and will not be initially offered after the Kickstarter campaign.\nWHAT IS THE NIFTY MINIDRIVE?\nThe Nifty MiniDrive is an easy to use device that allows anyone to quickly and simply increase the available memory in their MacBook computer, as well as providing a set and forget back-up solution. \nThe Nifty MiniDrive + MicroSD Card\nTHE STORY\nIt all started with the MacBook Air. We wanted to create an easy way to add memory to the MacBook Air, without having to rip it open with a torx screwdriver.\nThe easiest way to do that of course is to use an external hard disk drive, but as that is not really integrated with the computer we thought we could do better.\nThe MiniDrive is designed to be an integrated solution to that problem by using the SD card slot in the 13\" MacBook Air.\nWhile a normal SD card, which sticks out by about 1cm from the body of the computer when fully inserted, the MiniDrive is designed to sit completely flush with the body of the MacBook, becoming a semi permanent part of your computer.\nWe made our first protoype by 3D printing our design out of plastic before building a smalll batch of working prototypes that we had indiviually precision machined out of aircraft grade aluminium\nPrototyping the MiniDrive\nWe also developed a simple way of removing the MiniDrive from the computer by hooking a paperclip through our specially designed eyelet at the front of the device.\nTHE PRODUCTS\nWe are proud to announce the launch of not one but two products; the MiniDrive and the MiniDrive Pro.\nThe MiniDrive and the MiniDrive Pro have been designed to fit securely into the SD slot of the MacBook computers.\nThe MiniDrive in the Macbook Air\nThe MiniDrive Pro in the Macbook Pro\nBy utilising standard micro SD cards the MiniDrive can add plug in and forget memory to your computer.\nThe MiniDrive & MicroSD Card\nThis gives you the extra space for the things that are most important to you - holiday snaps, music, movies and any documents you may need with you, wherever you go.\nTHE MINIDRIVE AS A BACK-UP SOLUTION\nOne of the cool things about Micro SD cards is that they are practically indestructible - in fact a major manufactuer of them claims their cards can survive under the sea for over 24 hours, withstand 1.6 tons of force, and are impervious to magnets and X-rays.\nTherefore, when combined with the Nifty MiniDrive, this makes them perfectly suited as a primary back-up disk.\nAs the Minidrives are designed to stay in your computer without getting in the way, a daily back-up  of your critical files may be set up and then happen automatically without having to remember to plug anything in.\nThen if you happen to spill coffee on your computer or drop it down the stairs, or some other disaster strikes you will not be forced to re-do days, weeks or even months worth of work, or even worse lose memories in the form of photos, or videos that may be irreplaceable.\nTECH SPECS - Micro SD cards\nAll MacBook Air and Pro computers from the mid 2010 refresh onwards have a Secure Digital Extended Copacity, or SD XC card reader in their SD card slot.\nThis format can support a Micro SD card of up to 2TB - roughly 2000GB in size. The largest capacity Micro SD card available to put in a MiniDrive today is 64GB which would already increase by 50% the capacity of an entry level 13\" MacBook air.\nOf course we are excited to see what the memory manufacturers will be doing in this highly active market in the near future.\nTECH SPECS - Nifty Minidrive\nFor us it is critical that the finish and quality of the drives match the computer for which they have been designed for.\nThis is particularly true for the aluminium front of the MiniDrive, as this must become as much like the computer it sits within in order to truly become part of it.\nTo achieve this we will be putting the aluminium of the MiniDrives through the same kind of rigorous anodising process that the Macbook Air and MacBook Pro go through themselves.\nBut of course, it is not just how good it looks that counts, but also how well it works, and to ensure reliability and longevity we have selected components that have been tested to be reliable for over 10,000 insertions and removals of a Micro SD card as well as coating our main connectors with immersion gold to enure the connection to your MacBook does not degrade over time.\nTHE MANUFACTURING PLAN\nThe money we raise on Kickstarter will help us pay for the tooling needed to commercially produce the MiniDrive, as well as the cost of materials themselves.\nAlmost all of our manufacture and assembly is done in the UK, using high quality local expertise in machining and manufacture. The exception to this is the circuit-boards which are printed and assembled in China by a UK based company, as the UK, sadly, does not seem to have facilities to print 0.4mm circuit board.\nManufacturing schedule:\n- End of Kickstarter campaign\n- Up to 20 days for funds to clear (yes 20!!)\n- Week 1: Order placed for the MiniDrive injection mould to be made\n- Week 1: Order placed for machined fronts for MiniDrive & MiniDrive Pro\n- Week 1: Order placed for PCB manufacture & assembly\n- Week 3-4: Machined fronts sent for finishing and anodising\n- Week 5-6: Finished machined fronts received and checked. \n- Week 5-6: Finished and assembled PCBs received and tested.\n- Week 4-6: Tooling for injection mould finished + first 50 sent to check for mould finalisation.\n- Week 6-8: Final injection moulded components delivered\n- Week 7-8: MiniDrives assembly and testing.\n- Week 9: MiniDrives dispatched.\n- Week 10: MiniDrives arrive\nBased on above - expect shipping at the end of October/start of November.\nWHERE WE ARE\nSo that's the MiniDrive, we have finished the design and made the prototypes, and we're just about to start production. But we need your help to get the MiniDrive into your computer.\nWe hope you'll join us, thank you!\nFollow The Nifty MiniDrive on Twitter! @NiftyMiniDrive\nFor high resolution images: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ncgtu5tyv2dmc44/h_VXQS3piU", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #42", "update_userinfo": "Lessons learnt, a big thank you and some information if you are thinking about starting out!", "update_content": "Dear Backers,\nSo, it has been a long journey to here.
