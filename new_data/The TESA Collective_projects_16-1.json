We have every confidence that Ares Expedition will be on schedule and of the highest possible quality.\n\nThat said, there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Stronghold Games will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs, and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office, and FEDEX to ship the games to you \u2013 we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunities for delay. We have a track record of making everything work out for backers in the end \u2013 so please be confident and supportive of our efforts to get this great game into your hands.\n\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus 20% for Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds 14 days after the close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nDAMAGED OR INCOMPLETE PRODUCTS\nWe understand that all backers want to receive their items in pristine condition; however, the realities of worldwide shipping can sometimes make this difficult. We guarantee that the product you receive will be complete and all internal components in perfect condition. We will do our best to ensure that your package arrives in good condition, but all decisions on box replacements will be made on a case by case basis. Due to the difficulty and expense in replacing boxes, depending on your region, we will not be able to replace some boxes with minor cosmetic damage only.\n\nRETURNED PRODUCTS\nIf you refuse to accept your package on arrival we will not issue you a refund for the cost of the pledge.\n\nFAILURE TO RESPOND TO SURVEY\nSurveys will be completed through Crowd Ox. If you fill out the survey after the designated time frame, your package may be delayed in sending to you by up to a few months. If you do not fill out the survey until after the declared end of the project, we may not be able to send it to you.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials, and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and submit your project survey results (ie, provide us with your shipping address) for your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge (at additional cost for international backers) if you complete your project survey after the 8-week window has elapsed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Just Here for the Gear", "descp": "This pledge level is for backers that only want to get Add-ons.

The most controversial element of the Declaration of Sentiments is \u201cthe right of equal franchise\u201d. Attendees can\u2019t possibly predict the 70 year road ahead: the masterful organizers or the eloquent speakers who will emerge, the continent-enveloping wars nor the inter-movement fights that might sink the whole effort, not even the pandemics and parades that lay ahead in the great battle for Votes for Women. Now, put yourself in their bloomers to decide the strategies and tactics needed to ratify the 19th Amendment and ensure Votes for Women is enshrined in the Constitution.\nFor more history and background on the game and the designer, check out this interview with Tory Brown at The Players' Aid: https://theplayersaid.com/2020/09/07/interview-with-tory-brown-designer-of-votes-for-women-from-fort-circle-games-currently-on-kickstarter/\nIn Votes for Women, you are invited to join the movement for women's suffrage, starting in 1848 at the Seneca Falls Convention and navigating the ups and downs of the next seventy years. Will you succeed in this card-driven game by winning support in three-fourths of the states needed for ratification? Or will the opposition stymie progress and prevent enough states from ratifying the Nineteenth Amendment, dashing our hopes for equality? Play this 60 minute game to determine who will out-campaign and out-organize their competition to win. \nVotes for Women, designed by Tory Brown, can be played competitively, cooperatively, or in solitaire mode. Players may play cards for their events, to campaign, to organize or to call for a vote in state legislatures to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment. Game play occurs over three eras that correspond to important historical periods of the movement up to the exciting culmination of ratification in 1919 and 1920. The Support player needs 36 states to pass ratification to win while the Opposition player needs only 13 states to bury the 19th amendment.\nThe gorgeous cards feature some of the famous leaders we already know, plus many suffragists who have been left out of the narrative but whose contributions were critical to the passage of the 19th amendment, as well as the events, publications and clubs that were instrumental to winning not just suffrage but to advancing the women\u2019s rights movement overall. The opposition cards highlight the events, forces, industries and individuals, many of them women, who nearly thwarted the greatest expansion of citizenship in American history.\n Votes for Women comes with the following:\nA beautiful mounted game board featuring a map of the continental United States\nOver 100 high quality cards that feature portraits, historical documents and stunning artwork from the period\n18 organizing buttons\nAn illustrated, easy-to-understand rule book\nAn original historical essay and numerous historical documents and postcards from the struggle\nOver 300 wooden pieces and sixteen dice\nShipping will be charged just prior to game delivery.  One game shipped to the United States will be $10.  One game shipped to Canada or the EU will be $15.  One game shipped to Australia will be $25.  For larger quantities or other countries, please message.  A print-and-play PDF will be delivered to every backer at the conclusion of the campaign.\nOur pre-pandemic plans were to have this game ship to customers in November and have the game available at retail in December for the winter holidays.

For the past ten years, we have been instrumental in helping grassroots activists and social justice movements with printed ephemera. We expanded into literary publishing in 2017, and have since sought to support writers and voices from the margins.   \nIn 2021-2022, we will be releasing three distinctively unique graphic narrative projects. Each of these projects explores the prescient themes that concern our lives: urban isolation, the failures of capitalism, and restorative and transformative justice. We need your support to help bring them to life!\nThe three projects are:\nTHE SOLAR GRID BY GANZEER \nThe first five issues of THE SOLAR GRID\nFrom the mind of the eclectic, internationally celebrated artist Ganzeer comes a dystopian graphic series set in a future where humanity is left to deal with the fallout of irreversible climate change and the intense privatization of every industry. Covering centuries after a great flood has subsumed much of the world, The Solar Grid explores how the never-ending greed of capitalism continues to sink the world further. Will there be a way out? \nInterior page from THE SOLAR GRID\nInterior page of THE SOLAR GRID\nSpanning an estimated ten saddle-stitched booklets in rich, monochromatic hues, The Solar Grid is a warning for what lies ahead should greed, capitalism, attack on dissent, obsession with celebrity culture, and ecologically harmful practices continue unchecked. Through provocative writing, surrealist artwork, pop-culture references, ample easter eggs, and an exhilarating pace, Ganzeer delivers a terrorizing tale of our times.\nFollowing a successful Kickstarter campaign to release the full story as a hardcover book, this brand new edition is a special one consisting of individual chapters, printed with new exclusive cover art (the covers above are from the web edition). Beginning in April 2021, the story will be serialized the same way our science fiction collection Futures was\u2014one chapbook per month. A limited edition box set will follow for the most ardent readers to pick up.\nDimensions: 6.625\" x 10.25\"\nFormat: Saddle-Stitched \nPages: Varies per issue\nPublication Date: Begins April 2021\nAbout the Writer-Artist:\nWriter-artist Ganzeer\nGanzeer operates seamlessly between art, design, and storytelling, creating what he has coined Concept Pop. With over forty exhibitions to his name, Ganzeer\u2019s work has been seen in a wide variety of art galleries, impromptu spaces, alleyways, and major museums around the world, such as The Brooklyn Museum in New York, The Palace of the Arts in Cairo, Greek State Museum in Thessaloniki, and more. He also illustrated We Are All Things, a graphic prose poem by Elliott Colla, published by Radix Media in 2020.\nMORTALS BY JOHN DERMOT WOODS AND MATT L. \nWorking cover for MORTALS\n\u201cIs it better to burn out than to fade away?\u201d\nThis iconic line from Nick Hornby\u2019s High Fidelity, a not-so-subtle nod to Hey, Hey, My, My (Into the Black) by Neil Young, is perhaps what Francis in Mortals, written by writer-illustrator John Dermot Woods and illustrated by Matt L., thinks about.\nFrancis, the protagonist of MORTALS, with his son, Courtney\nSticking out in the hip private school culture and boutique cafe laziness of New York City is Francis, a theatre actor well past his prime but self-important about his craft. He struggles to show up for the son his ex-wife raises by herself, and is perturbed by his kid\u2019s stuffy private school that has eight-year-olds enact a rendition of Oedipus The King. When an offer to star in an indie film as the dying father to a teen-pop sensation comes along, Francis is both slighted and tired. What happens when the mortality of real and reel life stares Francis down?\nMortals is a deeply internal, meditative graphic novella. The artwork eschews action for pause, pace for quiet, and the writing allows for Francis to come into his deeply flawed, yet vulnerable state. Taking place over three sections, where the first section bears the naivet\u00e9 of childhood, the second the insouciance of early adulthood, and the third the exhaustion of old age, the novella culminates in a stirring exodus that makes one consider the breadth of their own life.\nThe cast of characters of MORTALS\nDimensions: 7.5\" x 7.5\"\nFormat: Paperback \nPages: 120 pages\nPublication Date: September 2021\nAbout the Writer:  \nJohn Dermot Woods, author of MORTALS\nJohn Dermot Woods writes stories and draws comics. He lives in Brooklyn, NY. His books include the novel, The Baltimore Atrocities, published by Coffee House Press, and a collection of comics, Activities (Publishing Genius Press).

Her body of work includes artwork ranging from live illustrations of the underground burlesque scene to the agitations of the Occupy Wall Street Movement. Her sketches are often marked with sudden rushes of color and striking images jostling for the viewer\u2019s attention. The artwork, much like the artist who once famously challenged Donald Trump long before he was president, is nothing but defiant.\nSample art from FANNING THE FLAMES, by Molly Crabapple\nFor the first time, fellow artists, students, and followers of Crabapple can access her early illustrations stripped down to their outlines; all color removed so readers can color within, or outside, her sketches. In this book are bodies that subvert sexuality, demand justice, and confront the violence of institutions head-on. A political coloring book for a political generation. \nPlease note that this is an adult coloring book featuring nudity and sexual themes.  \nSample art from FANNING THE FLAMES, by Molly Crabapple\nThis book features thirty select pieces from Molly Crabapple\u2019s career, printed in black and white on Neenah Environment 80# text weight stock. 100% recycled, and thick enough that colors won't bleed through to the other side.\nDimensions: 8\" x 10\"\nFormat: Saddle-Stitched \nPages: 36 pages\nPublication Date: March 2022\nAbout the Artist:     \nArtist and author Molly Crabapple\nMolly Crabapple is an artist and writer based in New York. She is the author of two books, Drawing Blood and Brothers of the Gun (with Marwan Hisham), which was long-listed for a National Book Award in 2018. Her reportage has been published in The New York Times, New York Review of Books, The Paris Review, Vanity Fair, The Guardian, Rolling Stone, The New Yorker, and elsewhere. Her art is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art. She is currently a 2020 New America Fellow and a 2020 Bard Fellow at the Brooklyn Public Library. Her animated short A Message from the Future with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been nominated for an Emmy award in the category of Outstanding News Analysis: Editorial and Opinion. \nMetallic silver letterpress for the cover of THE WITCHES' GRIMOIRE by Sabrina Cintron\nAs an emerging press, our print shop is the main benefactor of our publishing endeavors. However, the COVID-19 pandemic hit us hard, like it did many small enterprises. As a non-essential business, our print shop remained closed for three months, and that break affected our ability to redirect resources to our publishing program.\nMoreover, the Graphic Narrative Collection is an extensive project involving twelve books and one box set. It would be ambitious for us even under normal circumstances, but in these uncertain times, your support will help us bring three relevant, interesting projects into the world. We will be able to maintain print quality for each of these projects, print a respectable run, and dedicate time and effort to marketing these books. As a worker co-op, it is incredibly essential to us to compensate our artists fairly and make our work accessible to the reading community. Your support will help us greatly in that regard.\nEach of these books speak to the world as it looks today: tentative, vulnerable, but also hopeful. We are grateful that these incredible writers and artists have trusted us to bring their work into a world that needs it. \n *** WE HIT OUR GOAL OF $25,000!!! ***\nSo, what's next?

We were founded in Portland, Oregon in 2010, and in 2014 emerged in the heart of the Prospect Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York. For the last ten years, as a worker-owned, union print shop, we have been a crucial resource for radical communities and grassroots social justice movements. We actively extend our support to transformative movements with our work. \nSarah printing a poster on the Vandercook\nThree years ago, we entered the world of independent publishing in a bid to elevate marginalized voices, and prioritize fresh ideas and underrepresented themes. Our ethos has been to support writers and projects outside the purview of mainstream publication, using our printing expertise to publish books that have a distinctive aesthetic and can match the quality of prestige publications. We are an inherently political crew, and we seek and publish work that challenges existing narratives. For us, the personal is indubitably political, and publishing is a means to bring marginalized voices to the forefront.  \nLantz running the two-color offset press.\nWe seek to reimagine what publishing can be, the people it can include and the readers it can serve. By supporting us, you support our choices to be brave, swim against the tide, and back work that is unlike other work currently being published.

This kit is passed between coworkers as an act of solidarity and a signal that there is room to organize at your company. Tech needs an employee-driven onboarding that strengthens bonds, makes support visible, and inoculates against the tired propaganda playbook companies use to stamp out collective efforts.\nThe Kit\nSolidarity takes time and someone always takes the first step. This friendly collection of pro-labor mementos breaks the ice and gets folks talking about how we can work together to build a better workplace.\nSprout was the third project I ever backed on Kickstarter and I\u2019m thrilled to include them in this kit. When you get down to the last inch of pencil, the seed capsule on the end can be planted! Feel united and connected to your team as you grow a culture of care. \nThe Playbook\nAt the center of the kit is a welcome booklet filled with common anti-labor statements companies use to dissuade employees from organizing.\nTech activists, artists, and creators who helped organize Google, Facebook, WeWork, Kickstarter, and more have annotated this assemblage of statements, crafting a counter narrative directly over the words employed to keep us from uniting.\n Together we\u2019re creating an artifact shared between coworkers that helps call out the true aim of these classic anti-labor statements. Each page is a wealth of advice, guidance, wisdom, and inspiration.\nThe Propaganda & Refutation \nThe booklet contains thirteen common anti-labor talking points distilled from real tech company statements. Below is a handful. You might recognize them.\nNo one is too privileged to exercise their labor rights. From GitHub software developers to Facebook Trust and Safety analysts, Google contractors to Lyft drivers, Amazon engineers to Instacart shoppers- every employee deserves a legal framework to challenge authority and hold companies accountable. Refusing to share power with employees only serves to concentrate power in the hands of a few individuals deciding how the world's largest platforms will shape society.\nThe subtext here is, if you choose to create a second power structure that can successfully challenge management, you\u2019re not a team player. This is suggested in bad faith since the company knows management will always overpower the voice of an individual. Keeping employees from forming a collective is inherently adversarial.\nThis is a direct quote from Amazon.  Tech companies have stated that a union contract is too rigid for the business practices of today and that adopting a union framework will make the company less competitive. Employees negotiating a contract don't want to hurt the company they are fighting to secure and improve. Workers generally do not advocate for contracts that will interfere with the company's ability to compete. Companies must learn to be innovative without the crutch of workforce exploitation.\nDigital Version & Adding Your Voice\nIn addition to a free PDF of the printed version of the booklet, we're building a simple site to house the growing contributions.  This site is where we'll add doodles, comments, and other contributions you send our way. \nPLAY\n\nIf you want to contribute an annotation, here are the simple steps.  Feel free to DM me or leave a comment if you have any questions about the process. \n It's just that simple for now! ;) \nRadix Media\nThe shop making our booklets is a worker owned printer and publisher.  As one of several worker cooperatives born out of the blossoming Occupy Wall Street movement, Radix Media set up shop in Brooklyn and became a crucial resource for both the radical and surrounding communities of New York City. \nActs of Solidarity \nA year after organizers at Google led a massive walkout to protest the company\u2019s handling of sexual harassment, collective action across tech is on the rise.  We've demanded our companies take action for the climate, we've started sharing compensation rates with workers across the industry, we've challenged the gig economy, and there's so much more we can do together. \nMy Experience With Solidarity\nAfter years of backing projects, working on the Kickstarter team to build the Design and Tech community, and launching several small projects of my own - about a year ago I took on another role in the Kickstarter community as a member of the union. \nI\u2019m proud to have been one of the public organizers for Kickstarter United. I joined out of solidarity, learned so much from my fellow organizers, and experienced the grassroots development of a culture of care. \nTaking part in the unionizing effort opened my eyes to the power of solidarity in practice. I am so grateful to everyone who shared stories, challenged assumptions, verified facts, linked arms, and took action.\nWhy Kickstarter\nThis community continues to inspire. Kickstarter is a Public Benefit Corporation obligated to consider the impact of their decisions on society.  The platform and team have a stated commitment to supporting creative projects that bring people together and challenge the status quo. There is no better place for a project dedicated to collective action. \nRecognize Kickstarter United \nAlthough a few of the collaborators are current and former members of Kickstarter United, the funds raised from this campaign are not going to Kickstarter United.  We need to be very clear that there is no formal relationship between Kickstarter United and this campaign. All of the contributors to this project donated their time & talent.  Funds pledged are all going toward the materials and labor required to safely get these kits to you and to fund the free digital version of the booklet.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first campaign I'll be shipping rewards internationally.

Though you all have different roles with unique advantages, you will all either win the game together, or lose the game together. The game is not easy to win, but losing is a lesson! Come back stronger the next time with a different plan, better communication, and tighter teamwork!\nEndangered is also a modular game system. The base game includes the Tiger and Sea Otter modules; you\u2019ll play with the environment, cards, hazards, and special rules that apply to your chosen species. We also have a number of other modules planned for a variety of threatened species. Each module tells a different story, offers unique challenges, and helps players understand the difficulties facing these animals and the conservationists determined to help them. With your help we will be able to make many modules a reality!\n\n\nThe Kickstarter edition comes with these extra-gorgeous custom-screened dice, featuring the role symbols in place of the 6! Three of each, so fifteen custom dice total! The Kickstarter edition will also be notable for the shiny Spot UV finish on selected areas of the box top which will make it POP off your game shelf!\n\n\n\n\n We\u2019ve teamed up with the Center for Biological Diversity, a national environmental group with an amazing staff of lawyers, scientists and organizers who fight every day for endangered wildlife and their homes. Through our alliance, every game played will advance the Center\u2019s mission and help increase awareness about the vital need for action now to save the wild. \nPost-Kickstarter, the Center will consult with us on the game's content to ensure that we are accurately reflecting the conservation community. They will also help us reach a population of enthusiastic animal lovers who might otherwise have never heard of Endangered.\nWe will be supporting them during the campaign with a special pledge level. If you choose that level, we will gift the Center one copy of Endangered as part of your pledge. They will distribute those copies through their educational initiatives!\nAs well, in the post-campaign pledge manager we will donate all of the funds from the \"Tip Jar\" to the Center, and we will support them with a portion of proceeds from non-Kickstarter sales. (Kickstarter's terms expressly forbid the direct donation of campaign funds.) \nEndangered is played in turns. On your turn, you go through 5 phases:\nRoll your dice and then place them onto the Action spots, triggering a number of useful abilities. Stuff like moving animals around, managing the destruction of the environment, trying to influence ambassadors, preparing for Impacts, and playing cards from your hand. As the game goes on, you will be adding Actions to the play area which will develop your team's capabilities. Work together to form the best skill set!\nHopefully your species will breed! Each species has different rules for generating offspring, but in general you will want to encourage the forming of mating pairs so that your chances of increasing the population go up!\nUnavoidably, the environment will degrade. For Tigers it is deforestation; for Sea Otters it is Oil Spills. Here you'll carry out the relentless spread of destruction, which eliminates any animals it comes into contact with. Keep them out of harm's way!\nThe Impact deck for each species comes with an unpredictable set of Impacts. Some are positive, but most are a real threat. Clearcutting, Poachers, Sharks, Fragmentation, and Government Upheaval are just a few of the potential disasters you might encounter. Reveal the next one from the deck and carry it out!\nDraw a new card into your hand and pass play to the next player. If everyone has acted, the Year is over and the next Year begins. If it was a voting year, check the ambassadors to see if you have earned 4 or more yes votes!\nYou all win the game together only if you can get 4 or more Yes votes from your ambassadors in one of your two voting years. If your team fails to do that, or if your animal population vanishes, or if the environment becomes too devastated, you all lose the game!\n  Check out the previews, reviews, and quotes below!\nWe\u2019re happy to support Tantrum House Season 6 with a set of promotional Ambassador cards you can find on their campaign. These cards will be available after our campaign, and you are getting a complete game even without them. Both the Guild and Tantrum House thank you for your support!

It\u2019s all about different people working together to overcome challenges and build amazing successes \u2014 and then celebrating the camaraderie of their shared achievements.\nThe best cooperative games are like that too. If you love cooperative board, card, and dice games, and you want to know more about how they work, Meeples Together is for you.\nMeeples Together is a book about how and why cooperative games work. It's a 384-page, 6\" \u00d7 9\" trade paperback with more than 150 illustrated figures. It's also available in digital editions.\nMeeples Together is for gamers. Whether you play games as a lifestyle or a more casual pastime, and whether you\u2019re just interested or you want to get better, this book will help you understand how cooperative games work, how you can play them better, and which games might be your next new favorites.\nMeeples Together is also for aficionados. Champions and connoisseurs of tabletop gaming can never get enough of thinking and talking about games. If you\u2019re the kind of person who logs your plays on BoardGameGeek and always tries the new hotness at Gen Con or Essen Spiel, this book provides crucial fuel for thought and discussion.\nMeeples Together is for critics too. The gaming community has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to writers, reviewers, podcasters, and pundits. This book moves the state of the art forward in terms of understanding this key subset of tabletop gaming, making it required reading for anyone with a serious critical interest in tabletop games.\nMeeples Together is for game designers. Not only does it break down existing tabletop designs in exhaustive detail so you can understand what specific mechanics and concepts make them tick, it also highlights ideas for game development with icons in the text, and appendices cover both the basics of game design as well as game design dilemmas.\nIf you\u2019re a gamer, aficionado, critic, or game designer, Meeples Together is for you.\nMeeples Together contains 14 chapters about the nature, mechanics, theory, and frontiers of cooperative gaming.\nAlong the way, 14 in-depth case studies (or more, depending on stretch goals!) of cooperative gaming\u2019s greatest hits \u2014 from Pandemic and Battlestar Galactica to Contract Bridge \u2014 demonstrate the concepts and ideas.

His Life with Alacrity blog talks about the principles of cooperation, collaboration, and governance while his Rebooting the Web of Trust workshops imagine the future of collaboration on the internet.\nShannon Appelcline writes about games. He regularly contributed to the defunct board-gaming magazine Knucklebones, while his eurogame-focused Meeples & Mechanics blog contains over a decade worth of game analysis. He's also long been involved with the roleplaying field, working for Chaosium and supporting lines like Call of Cthulhu and Pendragon. He's best known for Designers & Dragons, a four-book history of the roleplaying industry.\nGameplaywright publishes books about games, stories, and the work of making them.

For the 20 years after that, we hope game stores will continue to sell Meeples Together to people who love cooperative games.  If you have a store, our \"Bricks & Mortar\" tier is for you.\nThis campaign is retail-friendly because:\n* The price is the price. What it costs to back the campaign is also the MSRP we\u2019ll put on the back.\n* Your customers get everything. We\u2019ll give you access to the digital edition so you can pass it along to your customers who buy physical copies of Meeples Together from you.\n* We won\u2019t tie up your capital.

Includes full-length analyses of Hamlet, Dr. No, and Casablanca. ($19.95 add-on)\nBeating the Story expands the story beat system by defining different types of beat-to-beat transitions, and providing practical guidance on topics like conceiving your story, creating its hero, mapping its beats, writing drafts, revising, and even editing the work of others. Includes extended analyses of Maupassant\u2019s \u201cThe Necklace,\u201d the Mad Men episode \u201cHave a Seat, Shut the Door,\u201d the X-Files episode \u201cHome,\u201d and a scene from The Color Purple.

It also keeps your money in your pocket longer.\nWe\u2019ve estimated the following shipping costs by region and tier.\nUnited States (including Puerto Rico) Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $3-4\nPrint Plus: $6-7\nPrint Designer: $12-15\nEverything in Print: $12-15\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nCanada Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $10-12\nPrint Plus: $12-15\nPrint Designer: $15-20\nEverything in Print: $15-20\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nEurope Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $15-20\nPrint Plus: $20-35\nPrint Designer: $20-40\nEverything in Print: $30-50\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nAustralia and New Zealand Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $15-20\nPrint Plus: $20-35\nPrint Designer: $20-40\nEverything in Print: $30-50\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nEverywhere Else Estimated Shipping Costs\nPrint Edition: $20-30\nPrint Plus: $30-40\nPrint Designer: $35-50\nEverything in Print: $40-60\nBricks & Mortar: Actual cost, inquire if needed\nAs you can see, shipping physical objects around the world is expensive. We don\u2019t like it any more than you do.\nWe won\u2019t profit from the shipping costs for the various tiers of this campaign. Rather, we\u2019ll wind up modestly subsidizing shipping to most destinations. After re-shipping lost and stolen packages, we\u2019ll spend a little bit more. This is what we expect, and it\u2019s fine with us.\nPlease expect that shipping charges will increase if you respond to the pledge manager after shipping has begun. Make sure your inbox is set to receive backer updates, and look for them after the campaign ends.\nTo avoid shipping charges, consider the digital tiers. You can also wait until Meeples Together\u2019s public release, anticipated for April, 2019. If you buy the book in a store, you won\u2019t pay shipping charges. Other online merchants\u2019 shipping prices vary; you\u2019ll know better than we will what you might expect to pay in the future.\nThere isn\u2019t another scheduled opportunity to get digital editions free with printed editions. This isn\u2019t an option we routinely offer at Gameplaywright via any of our distribution channels, including direct sales. So if you want digital and physical editions together for one price, now\u2019s your chance.\nFor customs purposes, assume the worst case scenario that your rewards will ship from the United States. We are not willing to fraudulently claim that campaign rewards are gifts in order to help avoid duties. If the campaign does well, the possibility exists for fulfillment from within Canada, the European Union, and Australia. That said: It\u2019s a possibility, not a guarantee. If backing at physical levels is contingent on fulfillment from within your local region, we recommend backing at a digital tier now to get access to the post-campaign pledge manager, when you\u2019ll be able to upgrade your pledge if you wish.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe manuscript is already done and through its first round of editing.

Who will create the tastiest beers and win the most loyal customers?  Only one way to find out - Ready! Set! Brew!\nMicrobrew is an innovative medium weight, worker placement / puzzle game hybrid that fits right in your pocket!\nMicrobrew is an award winning board game! Designed originally for the 2017 Mint Tin competition on BoardGameGeek - Microbrew won 1st place in two of the five categories (Best Overall and Most Innovative Mechanism) and 2nd place in a further one (Best Written Rules)! \nGuest Judge Justin Blaske (Designer and Publisher of Mint Works and Mint Delivery) also selected it as one of his three picks of the contest!\nAll of the above plus the rulebook fits inside a standard \"Altoids\" style mint tin! Don't believe us? Here's an little animation of how to pack the game into the tin:\nIt's definitely the second tightest packed game we've ever seen (curse you, Tim Fowers)! We've even done science to check! (Sort of...)\nUsing the Brew action, you can play the puzzle element of Microbrew! This allows you to move the malt tokens in your Copper - but 4 simple rules mean that you can't just move anything anywhere! \nDark malt tokens want to go down and light malt tokens want to go up, so the question is: Can you work out the most efficient way to to match a column in your Copper to your beer recipe and make the purest beer?\nWorker placement in Microbrew means that you can use an action your opponent is on, but they get their worker back to use again!\nSometimes rounds are short, sometimes rounds are long and if you can predict where you're opponent is going to go next - you can effectively get free actions by doing it first! \nConversely you'll need to decide is it worth changing your plans to avoid giving your opponent an extra action? You might even find that you need to deliberately bump their workers off because your beer needs longer to ferment!\nSometimes you can make the purest beer, sometimes you need to make a beer that's just good enough to earn you some cash. Sometimes you can see who's going to love your beer, sometimes they've not arrived yet. Microbrew's fermenting mechanics reward and encourage planning for yourself and trying to plan for what your opponent is going to do!\nIn Microbrew you win by earning the most Loyal Customers by the end of the game because we wanted it to feel like you were running a micro-business, where every new customer feels important to you and its as much about community and ethos as it is about profit.\nThere's lots more to love in Microbrew - if you want to find out more about the highlights, check out the Design Diaries we've added over on our homepage. There's lots more detail about how they work and why we think they're cool!\nIf you want more detail on how to actually play, scroll down to the How to Play section. But we've got so much else to show you too, read on!\nMicrobrew is a very full tin and we have always believed in using the best quality components from the start so it might seem like there's less stretch goals than other projects, but we've worked hard to come up with a list of rewards that show how much we appreciate you joining us on this quirky adventure.\nIf you want to learn the rest, you can:\nCheck out the current prototype rules.\nSee the game played in the Reviews and Previews section below.\nCreate your own Print and Play version from the files on BoardGameGeek.\nPlay the prototype version online for free (if you have a copy of Tabletop Simulator) by subscribing to this workshop page:\nCheck out an (almost) full playthrough by Tom \"Slickerdrips\" Heath in the following video:\nCheck out an in-depth explaination of all the rules in motion by Chubby Meeple:\n                              Disclosure: All reviewers and previewers have received a prototype version for review purposes marked \"Not for Sale\". No fees or payments have been made.\nEverything you need to play Microbrew with 2 players and includes all stretch goals you unlock!\nTwo full sets of Microbrew with two full sets of all stretch goals. With the components from both sets, you can play Microbrew with 2, 3 or 4 players by merging the components using the reverse side of the Brewery cards!\nThe Special Edition tins will only be produced as part of this kickstarter. \nSome playtesters have said they prefer the older, more abstract, art style used in the BGG Mint Tin competition! Here's some samples, but you can see them also on the Tabletop Simulator version, any of the reviews, and in the Print and Play version available on BoardGameGeek.com\nIf you agree, this pledge level will get you one manufactured copy with the production art and one Special Edition copy featuring the competition art, hand-packed by us when the campaign closes. This is also the best option if you don't want to wait to start playing Microbrew!\nPlease note that the special edition will be fully updated with the final version of the rules but will not include any of the stretch goals - they only apply to the manufactured copies.\nThe retailer pledge: Get Microbrew in your store!  \nWe have worked closely with retailers for all our campaigns. Select this pledge level and we will get in touch with details on how to buy bulk orders of Microbrew. This pledge does not include any reward without additional purchases and a minimum order quantity will apply!\n-\n\"I want more copies!\"\nHooray! We've decided to keep the pledges as simple as possible, but after the campaign we will use a pledge manager so that you can add on extra copies of Microbrew at that stage.\nAs with our previous projects, we will be shipping from within the EU so that our European and UK backers, like our US and Australian backers, will not have to pay any customs charges. We will not be using GamesQuest for fulfilment of this project. The planned manufacturing schedule is as follows:\nStandard shipping will be untracked with a certificate of posting. This will be available to most locations to keep your costs low. In some locations tracked will be included as standard. All shipping information is summarised here:\nIf you live in a remote area, one that experiences issues with shipping, or are just willing to pay the extra for security, please select the \"Rest of the World\" shipping option and your package will be delivered tracked and requiring a signature on delivery.\n If you can help us make Microbrew as awesome as possible, that's great!

Their power and reach is spreading, but so is word of their misdeeds. A band of resistance fighters known as the Liberation has begun striking at the Dynasty from a hidden base.\nUsing a tiny deck of only 18 cards, Liberation plays out a miniature rebellion of galactic scale on your tabletop. An asymmetrical game of cat and mouse, the Dynasty player expands their web of power, occupying and exploiting city cards, while the Liberation player strikes from the shadows, sabotaging the Dynasty\u2019s hand and performing daring missions. The odds are long and the stakes are high.\nCan you stall long enough to cycle through the deck 3 times, earning enough support to topple the Dynasty, or will you scour the galactic map, tightening the noose around the secret base of the Liberation to attack and destroy them? The future of the galaxy is at stake!\nFirst you will shuffle and build the map. Map cards map be face up or down, or oriented in any horizontal position (some cards may be upside-down). No matter what you do, the map routes will still connect cities and planets. There are thousands of potential combinations, so your map may never be the same twice.\nChoose 1 player to play the Dynasty. The Dynasty places one of their cards face up in front of them, as the first city they occupy.\nThe other player is the Liberation. The Liberation places one of their cards face down in front of them. This is their secret base.\nEach side will play differently, with a different set of actions, and using their specific missions on the cards.\nTo help understand the gameplay, designer Jon Simantov shot an excellent How To Play video.\nFor a deeper look, check out the unedited rules here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/y34elmmk5tfqpup/LiberationRules080718.docx?dl=0\n\nOr if you would like to try it for yourself, you can try it today on Tabletop Simulator: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1475636286\n.\nhttps://cardboardclash.wordpress.com/2018/08/14/review-for-two-liberation/\nhttps://openseatgaming.com/2018/08/13/kickstarter-preview-liberation/\nhttps://boardsandbees.wordpress.com/2018/08/13/0785/\n.\n.\n.\nIn previous campaigns we created expansion material and used it as stretch goals. Going forward, we're just going to give it away from the start. So no worries on whether we'll hit it or not, you are getting this expansion if you pledge here.\nWith your Liberation pledge you will be receiving the Warped World expansion. Warped World is a 5 card expansion that introduces a new planet and two new missions. Missions that are a bit different than we've seen before...\n .\nIf you want to add more games to your order, you can do one of three things.\nUse the INSTANT COLLECTION reward to get 3 extra games. If you do this, please let us know which games you want using the following google form. (LINK: https://goo.gl/forms/pWsPAC40Cn4lsJKy1) We will make sure the games are in stock and let you know if there are any issues.

We've highlighted some prominent games, but there is a lot more than we could even note here.\nJon Simantov is the designer of Liberation. This will be Jon's first published tabletop game, soon to be followed by Vamp on the Batwalk by Gold Nugget Games. Outside of tabletop games, Jon has been developing video games for 17 years. Follow Jon on twitter @JonSimantov.\nSara Beauvais is the artist for Liberation. Sara has illustrated Universal Rule, Smoke & Mirrors and some smaller projects for us as well. Through her illustrations and direction, Sara has been key in shaping our Pocket Universe. More of Sara's artwork can be found at http://thefairycircle.com.\nIf you haven't heard of Button Shy, we are a family-run small press game company that specializes in pocket-sized wallet games.\nAll games are hand-assembled and primarily sold directly to our customers, allowing us to form a relationship and line of contact with those that are responsible for our success.\nOur reach is growing, but to expand to the masses we've formed relationships with companies such as AEG, IDW Games & Loot Crate and we're forming international partnerships as well.\nLiberation is the 41st game in the long lasting Button Shy Wallet Game Series. The game is just 18 cards and comes packed in a vinyl wallet for maximum portability.\nWe have an awesome following of repeat customers. As a result, we've built the Board Game of the Month Club.\nIt's a subscription service where you receive unreleased microgames, promo cards, expansion content, and Kickstarter discounts.... every month. Supporters will receive from $1, $2, $5 to $10 off of EVERY WALLET GAME THAT WE MAKE.\nAnd here's a peek at what's coming next month.\nOur $5 packages include an episode of Timestamp, a time-travel game that takes place on a single postcard. Each episode is fully playable on its own, and supporters receive PNP links to previous episodes. It also includes a character in our expanding series Banned Books. All supporters receive the Banned Books base game in their first package. It's a solo game of literary characters trying to get their books un-banned. And finally it includes a copy (and a link to print more) of the next Legends of Dsyx Roll and Write Game. Legends of Dsyx is an ongoing roll & write series where each game is set in the same kingdom, but the games play very differently.\nOur $10 packages include all of those and something extra. Generally it's a micro-game (up to 9 cards), or some expansion / promo cards for our existing games. The September package includes Six Suns of the Sultan by Todd Sanders. A great 2 player action selection / area control game with a solo variant.\nAnd our $20 September package includes all of the above and a copy of the featured wallet game (or the wallet game of your choice). The next package will feature Liberation with the Warped World expansion.\nYou can subscribe here using one of the subscription pledges, or visit  https://www.patreon.com/buttonshy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nReleasing games each month has established a groove with the manufacturer.

The main products that Isuken food truck will offer are Sambusas, fried pastries filled with local meats and veggies. We will offer beef, chicken, fish, goat, and veggie (vegan) options. We will also offer a gluten-free and vegan rice, corn, bean, and veggie dishes and grilled meats. For beverages, we will offer our Somali chai tea, a sweet, spicy, milky tea.\nA Sambusa!\nIsuken is a worker-owned cooperative with the five members sharing equally in the responsibilities and rewards of the business.  We make decisions together and support each other in the co-op. This co-op structure is based on our traditional form of cooperation \"Iskashito,\" where we farmed and worked together.  Now we have formed the co-op so we can support one another in our new home in Maine.  \nThe Isuken Food Truck is the first step towards a permanent farm to table restaurant and market in downtown Lewiston. The Food Truck will bring the food directly to the people, build the brand and following and raise money for the long-term goal of a permanent location. \nThrough this Kickstarter campaign, we'll be able to invest money in a put down a deposit on a truck, base station for our truck, and have working capital to get the truck started and purchase supplies.  We already have offers of financing for the truck purchase and if we raise more money than $10,000 we will have less debt and start the truck up in a  better financial position.  \nThrough supporting Isuken, you are helping get local food to people and supporting New American farmers and chefs.  \nFarming Together", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFood businesses have risks and challenges and are not easy for anyone to start. There are slim margins and potential for wasted food. Additionally, a food truck faces challenges because it is dependent on the weather, a working vehicle, and good crowds wherever we set-up.

The book will be FREE and distributed to the campaigners and activists who are working towards social change.\nSimon Critchley (Philosopher) With the publication of his new book The Faith of the Faithless, I talked to him about why a counterfactual faith is so important to modern politics, why it offers an \"archive of possibilities\" to those involved in political campaigning, and how the Occupy movement has changed the conversation and our expectations of ourselves.\nDavid Boyle (New Economics Foundation) talks about the disconnect between money and wealth, how we\u2019re stuck with the oldest fantasy about how money works, and shows that local currencies can capture the real wealth of communities that cannot be expressed by the single currencies we use.\nRaj Patel (author of Stuffed and Starved) discusses why we should be worried about the new extremes the food industry has gone to and the global food riots connected to the financial speculation of food as commodities, but shows that international social movements are already responding with increasing resilience and creativity to these assaults.\nMarianne Maeckelbergh (author of The Will of Many) looks back at the first year of Occupy, excited by the widespread use of consensus process, whilst also analysing the practical problems associated with the rise in popularity of democratic decision-making.\nNina Power (activist, Defend the Right to Protest) examines the success and failures of a decade of protest in Britain\u2019s capital city, looking at demonstrations against the Iraq War, the Occupy camp at St Paul\u2019s, the day of rage during the G20 summit and the recent student uprisings against tuition fee rises.\nDavid Bollier (author of This Land is our Land)  questions why privatisation is aggressively promoted as the only feasible way to manage our resources, to generate medical research, and to achieve human progress. As an alternative he presents the commons as a viable economic paradigm that focuses on stewardship, community benefit and sustainability.\nThe book will also feature pieces by Simon Critchley (author of Infinitely Demanding), George McKay (author of Radical Gardening), Glyn Moody (author of Rebel Code), Brian Van Slyke (Founder of Toolbox for education and social action), Bethan Graham & Guppi Bola (food justice activists), Derek Wall (No-Nonsense Guide to Green Politics), Megan Saunders (The Real Food Store).\nWhat will the money (funds) do?\nIt will pay for a print run of the book through Calverts \u2014 a print co-operative based in London. It will enable us to commission artists to illustrate the articles and interviews in the book, and also reward future contributors. \nYou contributing at the $25 level or more will allow us to make the book freely available, and get it into the hands of the campaigners, transitioners, occupiers, and general movers and shakers who want to change their communities for the better.\nWhat if we hit the $15,000 target?\nKeep giving! The more funds we raise the more books we publish and distribute, and the bigger impact we can make in spreading these practical ideas.

Meanwhile the majority of people in prison come from New York City\u2019s communities of color and their families are forced to make long trips to visit them. The guards union and their elected officials oppose major reforms to the prison system because they fear it will destroy jobs in their community.  As a result, New York\u2019s prison system is racist, ineffective, and too expensive. This is not going to change unless we can develop a new economic relationship between urban and rural areas.  MILK NOT JAILS looks to the state\u2019s dairy industry \u2013 which comprises 80% of New York\u2019s agricultural sales \u2013 for a delicious solution to this conundrum.  Join us in saying, \u201cIf rural New York\u2019s economic survival depends on us, we\u2019d rather drink their milk than go to their prison.\u201d\nWhat we are doing:\nOver the past year, MILK NOT JAILS has been touring New York State educating people about prison industry economics and asking farmers to join our cooperative.  We host ice cream socials in urban areas to reach out to communities impacted by incarceration, to conduct market research,, and to dialogue about our project.  We have elicited feedback from over 250 dairy farmers and identified a niche market that we can develop.  Over 35 criminal justice organizations endorse MILK NOT JAILS.\nOur dairy cooperative has quickly grown from a conversation to a pilot business.  We recently started a milk share program in Brooklyn, where people purchase a milk subscription from one of our partner farms.   We are undertaking a massive outreach campaign to coffee shops, daycares and CSAs to sell milk contracts to these local establishments. We are analyzing over a year\u2019s worth of market research to identify neighborhoods and retailers to sell to. Our farmers have cheese, butter, yogurt and ice cream ready to sell once we have our distribution system established!\nWhat we need:\nWe need two things to turn our business plan into a reality.  First, we need a truck to deliver products throughout New York City (and eventually other cities).  Our farmers will drop off their products at one location within New York City, but we need a way to get this milk to all of the cafes, CSAs, and stores we have established contracts with.  We need a refrigerated delivery truck that can safely transport dairy products.  This truck will also be used as a county fair float and a mobile popular education tool.\nSecond, we need to print marketing materials \u2013 stickers, labels and tags \u2013 so that consumers can identify our products on the store shelf.  We have created a buzz in urban centers across the state, and people are anxious to start building an economic relationship with our politically allied dairy farmers.  Help us make this happen.\nAll contributions are tax deductible.\nYour tax deductible pledge also comes with fantastic rewards.

It seemed like no matter where we went, something was off -- poor or inconsistent quality, low worker morale, snobbishness, or just an uninspired and uncreative feel. We knew that with the right planning, drive, and people, we could create something unlike any other coffee house around. \nAfter seeing the renown and success of local cooperatives such as Arizmendi Bakery, Zachary\u2019s Pizza, AK Press, and BioFuel Oasis, and some research into what it means to be a cooperative, we decided that this model was the one for us. So, we began working on a business plan and started looking for a group of dedicated people to create a strong and diverse workforce capable of putting it all together. Since coming up with the idea about a year ago, we\u2019ve been planning, building, recruiting, and researching everything from entrepreneurship in general to the scientific intricacies of preparing the best coffee possible.  \nIn April, we started serving single-cup drip coffee at a local farmer\u2019s market and have gotten overwhelmingly positive response to both our coffee and our mission. With your help, we can progress to the next stage of our plan - a hand-built espresso cart open 5 days a week in the parking lot of BioFuel Oasis (map) in Berkeley, CA. We are excited and proud to have gotten ourselves this far, but it\u2019s just the beginning.\nSpecial thanks to:\nTia Katrina Taruc Canlas (Early Supporter, Camerawoman)\nPatricia Moran (Early Supporter)\nJohn Semerjian (Early Supporter)\nElysha Rom-Povolo (The Alchemy song: \u201cHelp Them Make Coffee For You\u201d)\nBen Davila and Vanessa Black & Andy Martriez (Runners-up in the Alchemy song contest)\nBioFuel Oasis (Launchpad for this here revolution)\nThe Alchemists are:\nRob Wertheimer (Adult Beverage Officer/Webmaster)\nCaleb Wolfson-Seeley (Bakemeister/Finance Officer)\nPayam Imani (Design Officer/Multimedia)\nEric Thoreson (Lead Barista Trainer)\nChristopher Myers (Fabricator/Food Officer)\nJames Parrish (Music Officer/Impromptu Vocalist)\nWhat exactly is a cooperative and how does yours work?\nCooperatives come in all shapes and sizes and can be structured according to how the founders want things to run.  For us, each member owns exactly one share, has equal voting rights, and gets a share of profits according to hours worked.\nWhy not just run it like a regular business?  Are you guys, like, socialists or something?  Or worse - anarchists??!!!\nOur business doesn\u2019t push any particular political agenda; we just think that a focused group of competent people can create a stronger, healthier, and more ethical business.\nHere are some of the advantages we gain by working cooperatively:\nBroad pool of skills, experience and connections\nMore control of quality and consistency of service (we don\u2019t just hire baristas who\u2019ll quit once the school year starts, we\u2019re recruiting entrepreneurial business partners who are passionate about coffee)\nFull incentive for every worker to go above and beyond at all times (profit sharing!)\nSharing of cumbersome tasks and stress\nDemocratic decision-making (\u201cDemocracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried...\u201d -Winston Churchill).\n\nWhat do you mean by \u201cspecialty cafe\u201d?  What makes it so special?\nSpecialty, or \u201cThird Wave\u201d coffee, is tricky to define, but we think the most accurate description is this: a specialty cafe\u2019s primary objective is to serve coffee at the highest standards possible. In no particular order, here\u2019s what specialty coffee means to us:\nFreshly roasted, freshly ground, freshly brewed coffee (we get our beans from Verve Coffee Roasters, a great small-batch, direct-trade roaster out of Santa Cruz, CA)\nQuality organic milk\nExpert-level barista training\nUse of equipment that can produce consistent results (La Marzocco, Mazzer, Ditting)\nEmphasis on home-made, not mass produced (we make our own vanilla syrup from raw vanilla, bake our own pastries, and mix our own chocolate sauce)\nGenerally, a commitment to taste, test, research, and push our coffee closer and closer to perfection\nYour Kickstarter goal is to get equipment for the espresso cart right? What\u2019s this cafe stuff about?\nThe cafe is our ultimate goal. However, we developed the cart business as an intermediate stepping stone in that direction. Opening a cafe is expensive (this is why we\u2019re starting with the cart!), so anything above what we need for the cart will go towards the balance we\u2019ll need to show lenders to get the startup money for the cafe.\nWill the cafe be...awesome?\nYes. Yes it will be. Our vision for the cafe is more than a specialty coffee shop - we want to open a space that serves a delicious and local food menu, offers craft beer and wine, and is a high-quality venue for live music and local art.\nWow! You guys sure are ambitious.  Anything else you want to accomplish?\nOne more thing: We really want to be a shining example of how the cooperative model can be an amazing vehicle for small businesses. These are rough times financially, and with how tight-fisted banks already are, it seems like you have to already be wealthy to start a business. This model makes it less daunting to get started, since we can draw on a larger pool of talents and resources and also have the ability to minimize labor costs while our business is building its customer base.  The best part is that we\u2019ll continue to remain in control of the product of our hard work, even as the business grows.\nSo, by helping us, not only will you be helping to create an amazing place for people to come together and enjoy coffee and entertainment, you\u2019ll also be helping to promote the cooperative movement and encourage others to create rewarding and sustainable jobs, and lives, for themselves.\nThe Gifts:\n:: full-size image here ::\n[exhibit a]: Alchemy shirts are American Apparel, sweatshop-free, and hand-printed by us!
