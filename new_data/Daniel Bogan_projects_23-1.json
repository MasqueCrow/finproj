[{"backer": "Daniel Bogan", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Karlee Esmailli here, the founder of Immigrant Father Studios. I'm an Iranian-American person, and I wrote a video game to express all my complex feelings towards America, the middle east, and my clitoris. I'm proud to present The Super Patriotic Dating Simulator. \nThe Super Patriotic Dating Simulator is a satirical visual novel. Play as Elodie, a 19-year-old CIA super spy. As one of America's most ruthless agents, you\u2019ve been assigned a deadly solo mission: infiltrate and destroy I***.\nBesides the whole \u201csuper spy\u201d thing, you\u2019re just a normal American girl\u2026 who\u2019s really horny. Give these fuckers an American ass-kicking, and maybe learn a bit about your body on the way. Just remember the #1 rule of the CIA: always ask for consent.\nKarlee Esmailli: Creator, Writer, & Programmer \nExitMothership: Background Artist \nLinda Chung: Background Artist \nAndrew Weiler: Video Production \nLauren Gallagher: Logo Design \nDavid Wehmeyer: UI Designer\n7 different \u201cdateable\u201d characters, each with multiple character endings. \nGeopolitical intrigue. \nBeautiful illustrations at high-tension moments. \nOne horse.\nHelpful reminders for white people that I*** is not representative of Islam or all middle eastern people\nThe Super Patriotic Dating Simulator is a visual novel. We have the \u201cnovel\u201d part written! The first draft is finished. We'll continue refining, expanding, and playtesting that draft until release. We're crowdfunding on Kickstarter to fund all of the other components to the game -- art, music, and development.\nPrimarily, our budget is going towards our beautiful art. Our team of artists made all the art on this page, and they're excited to make even more good art. We're raising money to pay these artists the money they deserve!\nOther than the character design and background art, we're budgeting for music, interface design, sensitivity readers, digital distribution, and a few odds and ends to turn this into a complete product.\nWe only have ONE official stretch goal, and it's the most badass thing ever. If we hit the funding goal of $54,000, we'll add an original soundtrack by Kitty.\nOther than that, we don\u2019t have any specific stretch goals we\u2019re trying to reach -- just hitting our goal will be enough for us to make an awesome game. However, if we\u2019re lucky enough to overfund, we\u2019ll reinvest that money into bells and whistles to make the game even better. Right now, we\u2019re thinking of an expanded art budget, more jokes, and maybe an initial investment on our next project.\nWarning: I'm about to get sincere, so if you're just here for the jokes, you can skip this next part.\nI love dating SIMs and visual novels. I love my family in Iran, my Persian nose, and middle eastern culture. I love being an American. I'm grateful to live in this country. Despite my love for these different components of my identity, I've felt a deep anxiety towards each of them. These mixed relationships of love and anxiety are the foundational components of The Super Patriotic Dating Simulator. \nDating SIMs, as a genre, have strong roots in the expression of sexuality. Female characters in many dating SIMs are built as sexual objects for heterosexual male players. I wanted to contribute a grounded, accurate, female perspective to this genre typically dominated by the male gaze. The protagonist's story arc in the game centers around the questions that I asked myself as a young woman. Elodie, the main character, wonders: Why am I not orgasming from just penetration? How do I orgasm? Am I gay or straight? Does my virginity matter? Why didn't anyone tell me about this?\nTo contrast against this grounded discussion of female sexuality, I wanted to subvert the sexual oppression that characterizes so much of I***'s politics. In reality, I***'s oppression of women exists within a patriarchal framework, which subjugates women's bodies, pleasure, and power to men. I found power and strength in an objectified caricature of members of I***. The same tools of objectification that have made me feel diminished, disrespected, and worthless as a woman can be used against the perpetrators of this gendered violence. The tactics of I*** are intended to terrorize. Subversion and comedy are particularly effective against this kind of politics. I want to rob I*** of the terror they work so hard to instill, through this reversal of the sexual narrative. \nWhile the game directly addresses I***'s gender politics, it is equally informed by my identity as a middle eastern person in modern-day America. The Super Patriotic Dating Simulator is specifically about I*** because of American perception of the middle east. To many white Americans, I*** is just a group of brown boogeymen in the desert. I*** is universally disavowed by Muslims - they are not a representative depiction of Islam. And yet, Americans tend to use I*** as the face of Islam and the middle east, and that terrifies me because they literally can't tell us apart and think we deserve to die. The Super Patriotic Dating Simulator is a satire about this American perception. It's a satire of the dehumanizing, inaccurate, atrocious politics of American perception of middle eastern people. It's a desperate plea that we recognize how harmful that perception is. \nUltimately, my growth and understanding of my sexuality have been informed by my connection to middle eastern culture, American culture, and the conflicts I've experienced living between these two perspectives. The Super Patriotic Dating Simulator is an expression of my personal experience -- my anger, my pleasure, my identity -- seen through the lens of comedy. \n- Karlee Parvin Esmailli", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAlthough our team has a lot of experience working on Kickstarter campaigns, this will be the first campaign we've launched ourselves.

The challenge was to figure out how to make great coffee work at just $1 a cup, and we found that by being clever and controlling for waste, we could bring exceptionally crafted hot and cold coffee drinks to people at scale, without skimping on the quality of beans in our blend.\nKind words and a bit of controversy in the NYTimes\nThat $1 cup was a big hit and caused a bigger stir than we could\u2019ve anticipated. It challenged assumptions about what contexts great coffee could thrive in. It sparked a debate about the limitations of our third wave coffee movement's strategies (which I\u2019ve long advocated) to move coffee drinkers toward paying higher prices to support higher quality, more sustainable coffee\u2014against the need to reach a broader audience beyond the exclusionary, validation-seeking culinary burlesque that characterizes a lot of today\u2019s high-end coffee bars.\nOne of our conceits with \u201cThe Mix\u201d is the simultaneously heretical-sounding yet obvious-seeming idea that there\u2019s almost no single origin coffee that couldn\u2019t be made even better with a judicious bit of blending. We recently shared a small prototype batch with a handful of friends and beta testers which included a mini manifesto: \nWe hand stamped this manifesto on one of our prototype batches. Sort of like those Dr. Bronner's soap bottles you read in the shower.\nGreat coffee, great price, your pace\nWe\u2019ll roast a new iteration of \u201cThe Mix\u201d each week, so you\u2019ll be able to choose to get a box shipped weekly, fortnightly, every third week, monthly, or just whenever you need it. Each shipment will be 12 ounces (340g), simply packaged with our awesome newsletter and delivered fresh to your door.\nOur target price is going to be just $15 a box, shipped within the US. Additional charges will apply to international shipping.\nWho We Are\nTony \"Tonx\" Konecny. Tony fell into coffee first as a barista and then head roaster at Seattle\u2019s seminal Victrola Coffee. In 2006 he went on to bend the coffeebar genre as part of Intelligentsia\u2019s Los Angeles project. One of the early weirdos in what has come to be known as coffee\u2019s Third Wave movement, he holds the dubious distinction of being among the first coffee bloggers, for which he sincerely apologizes. In 2011, frustrated with how the top roasting companies focused more on their baristas and selling beverages than in giving honest footholds for would-be coffee connoisseurs, he started Tonx Coffee. It pioneered a direct to consumer subscription service, sourcing great coffees from around the world and empowering coffee lovers to brew stuff at home that could rival the best cafes. In 2014 Tonx Coffee was acquired by Blue Bottle Coffee becoming the Blue Bottle at Home service. Tony\u2019s itch for finding new on ramps for getting people into coffee remained, leading him deeper into a still-unfinished book project and the $1 coffee project for LocoL.\nSumi Ali. After a few years working as a barista, Sumi opened his first coffee bar, Condesa, while still a teenager in Atlanta\u2019s nascent coffee scene. He moved to Los Angeles to work for Intelligentsia where his exceptional barista skills and strong sensibilities about hospitality led to him being poached as the first barista at the landmark SQIRL/G&B Coffee pop-up that spawned several local culinary empires. His excellent palate for coffee and his skills as an auto and motorcycle mechanic led to him get poached again, this time to join the roasting team at Tonx Coffee as it scaled up. He went on to learn the business of green coffee importing with Thrive Farmers (the company behind Chick-fil-A\u2019s brews) and consulted for a number of roasteries. Sumi was the brains and the boots on the ground behind LocoL\u2019s successful coffee program and he\u2019s one of the most talented roasters we\u2019ve ever met (but don\u2019t tell him that or it\u2019ll go to his head).\nAdditional Teammates\nRyan Brown. Tonx Coffee alumni Ryan will be joining us as our green coffee advisor. Ryan was instrumental in the success of Tonx Coffee and Blue Bottle at Home, bringing his experience working with coffee producers around the globe and as a coffee buyer for Ritual Roasters and Stumptown Coffee. He is the author of the recent book Dear Coffee Buyer.\nAmy Marie Slocum. Amy will be the Editor of our we-can\u2019t-wait-to-show-it-to-you awesome newsletter. She previously worked at Flaunt Magazine as Managing Editor and served as the Content and Social Media Editor for Need Supply Co. She spent over a decade in the food service industry before that, training as a barista under Western Barista Champ Jared Truby and managing the farm-to-glass cocktail bar Orbit Room in San Francisco.\nSean U\u2019Ren.

Through this campaign we can gauge and engage interest, and right-size our inventories from the jump. No overcommitting on green coffees and having them lying around in our warehouse before we can roast them, compromising \u201cThe Mix\u201d; and no under-committing and then scrambling for 2nd tier ingredients to fill an unexpected demand.\nWe want your help to make \"The Mix\" the best possible blend it can be!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe truth is we have a lot of unfair advantages. We\u2019ve been in the business for a long time, have built up a lot of good will with suppliers and allies, and have stepped on most of the rakes and sussed out the cheat codes.\n\nWe\u2019re taking some risks by offering \u201cThe Mix\u201d at a low price while not compromising on the quality of green coffees we source.

What happens next is based on your choices. The smallest details, biggest plot points, and how explicit the book is.... The story is in your hands...\nProbably not the final image, but it's pretty good!\nThe Process\nThis project involves many things I love. I love crowdfunding and I love Kickstarter (I've backed 168 projects so far!). I also really love finding creative people to collaborate with. The two amazing women who are my ghostwriters will be incorporating the feedback of the backers to build the story of my fantasy-self. I'm going to be as surprised as you are in what gets produced. EXCITING!\nBut the best aspect of this project is crowdsourcing the plot. At every pledge level you get a certain number of votes. As the writers share the story they will present options for you to vote on. Everything from the background of the characters, to major plot points, sexual escapades, and even the brand names of objects... Everyone casts a vote (multiplied by how many votes you have) and that is how we'll know what happens next.\nBy incorporating the readership into the development of the story the collaboration is integral to the whole project and the opportunity for things I would never have thought of is guaranteed. Together we can write the best book ever.\nBackground\nThere is no greater honor than being immortalized in erotic fan fiction. But let's be honest, that isn't likely to happen to most of us. I'm taking matters into my own hands and producing erotic fan fiction about me. \nI met Fabio when he was selling his protein powder at Whole Foods.\nBut I'll be honest with you, I don't know enough about erotic fiction to make the right calls, so that's why I'm letting you vote what happens. This will be like a collaborative \"Choose Your Own Adventure.\"\nTHE HONEST TRUTH: I just turned 40 and my last relationship is in shambles. There isn't much chance I'm going to become a dashing globe-trotting billionaire bad boy conquering the world in business and sexual encounters. But that doesn't mean I can't dream about it! (As my mentor Shia LaBeouf says \"Don't let your dreams be dreams!\")\nMy ghostwriting team is these two amazingly smart and culturally savvy writers. One is a prolific writer and college professor, the other has been writing erotic scenarios for years. Combining their talents with the input and direction of the \"wisdom-of-the-backers\" is a recipe for wild success in the world of erotic entertainment.\nTHE UPSIDE: Together (me, the ghostwriters, and you) we can make a book better than 50 Shades of Grey. I read that book, it's not that great! And if we get even 1/20th of the success of that book we can get a Hollywood movie deal (I just moved to Los Angeles, everyone here is making movies!).\nTHE DOWNSIDE: The highly sexual fictional version of myself might become more famous than the real me ever will and everyone will think I'm way more sexually experienced than I actually am. To be frank I was a bit of a late bloomer.\nTHE UPSIDE AGAIN: OH MY GOD, what if it *DID* become a movie and then someone wrote erotic fan fic about me and the fictional version of myself from the movie!? That would be the most beautiful thing to happen in my entire life.\nBudget\nThe goal is $5,000 because we want to a) offer a print edition when this is all done and b) we're making a special voting system for the backers.\nOf course we'd love to go over the minimum! The more interest we have the more likely we gain interest from publishers and movie producers! (Note to self: think of some stretch goals!)\nAbout Me\nI'm Mike Merrill. If you know me it's probably because I sell shares in myself. That project was written about in Wired, The Atlantic, CNBC, and I also got on the Today Show.\nAnd then Jason Bateman got interested in making a movie about it (which hasn't happened yet, but fingers crossed!).\nI'm also a Techstars alum (twice!) and co-founded a fintech company four years ago. Before that I was a game designer and before that I worked at the best software company in the world.

That is why there are two of them.

As a hotshot pilot, you are the difference between life and death for countless millions. Only your dog fighting skills and teamwork can master the hazardous terrain, using it against your foes to gain the upper hand in uncontrolled space.\nThe Underground\nThe people of Earth watch from afar as opposing forces race to gather the materials that will keep them alive. The struggle for resources is the newest sport \u2013 a source of hope and a shared effort championed by larger-than-life heroes. As one of those pilots, your life depends on your contribution, your reputation, and your value to your sponsors back home.\nDescent: Underground provides all of the different play experiences that players loved in the original titles while adding new elements that take the experience even further. Tunnel through walls to outflank the enemy, discover hidden pockets of rare and valuable resources, set traps to ensnare enemy ships, and work as a team to accomplish your goals. Keep an eagle eye out for power-ups throughout the map, and uncover more by mining the walls. Collect resources to save the earth, fund your team, and make your name in the Underground.\nSingle-player Campaign  \nEnjoy the puzzle-solving single-player experience of the original Descent games. Descent: Underground's initial release will include an engaging single-player campaign that serves as a prologue to the full game. \nDesign Underground discusses Single player\nCooperative  \nJoin your friends to conquer the single-player maps and to accomplish bonus goals that require teamwork.\nMultiplayer Mayhem\nPit your skills against other pilots as you battle for critical resources in the asteroids. Fly alongside allies of your corporation, and crush competing corporations into bankruptcy, or play as a free-lance pilot available to the highest bidder.\nMatch Types\nMatches can include multiple teams of up to sixteen players each. Each game mode will have team goals and configurable parameters, such as mission timers, stock ships only, or limited ship types.\nAnarchy \u2013 Classic Descent combat where your only goal is to crush your opponents. Choose 1 vs 1, team matches, or free-for-all.\nCapture the Asteroid \u2013 Secure and defend strategic beacons in the map.\nCorporate War \u2013 Mine resources and ferry them to your harvester. The first team to reach their mining quota wins.\nMining for Minerals \u2013 Find and mine a special resource and return it to your harvester. But watch out! If you drop the \u201cball,\u201d your enemy will swoop in and snatch it away.\nAnd many more!\nMap Types\nLevels come in a myriad of types.\n\nMature Mine - This asteroid is riddled with tunnels and has already been heavily mined. You\u2019ll find plenty of space for pitched battles.\nMolten Core - A newer mine, this map offers a lot of opportunities for miners and explorers. Watch for the lava at the center, though \u2013 digging in the wrong place could be disastrous!\nThe Ice Cave - This frozen ball of rock is rich in resources, but glittering ice makes for tricky navigation.\nAbandoned Base - This station was built to house a now-defunct corporation. This map is built for classic Descent battles and single-player exploration.\nAnd that\u2019s just a few. Not to mention you can create your own maps too!\n\nLadders and Leader Boards  \n\nCompete to be the best at each individual role, or become the highest-ranked combat pilot around. Sanctioned matches will use individual skill as part of the matchmaking process, and all of them contribute to your ranking as a pilot.  \n\nDescendent Studios will host regularly-scheduled tournaments, often with specific rule sets, to pit the best pilots against one another for prizes and bragging rights. Create your own corporation with friends. Rally together and fight as a team. A corporation can craft a logo, company name, and a team color scheme for their ships. \n\nShips, Customization, and Tech Trees\nThe majority of the Descent: Underground game packages start with the Wasp. Some pledge tiers begin with additional ships. All ships can be earned through game play.\nEach ship in Descent: Underground has a specialization so pilots can work together to accomplish their mission objectives.\nAUGER \u2013 the mining expert, able to bore through walls to find valuable resources, hidden tunnels and chambers, and rare power-ups.\nGOLIATH \u2013 a massive cargo ship with the most storage capacity, the Goliath is a beast that will maximize your haul.\nPANZER \u2013 a sturdy tank that can take punishment and dish it out, the Panzer is designed to get in and slug it out nose-to-nose.\nPREDATOR \u2013 a small, light craft that is fast and maneuverable. It acts as your team\u2019s advance scout, mapping the terrain ahead and spotting enemies.\nSHAMAN \u2013 a sturdy repair ship, able to stay at the front lines and keep all of your drones in the action.\nTORCH \u2013 the maneuverable light combat specialist. It doesn\u2019t pack quite the same punch as the Typhoon, but it is a good all-around combat craft with strong defensive and maneuvering capability.\nTYPHOON \u2013 a tri-winged heavy assault craft that trades defensive strength for firepower. The Typhoon is the point of the spear.\nWARLOCK \u2013 your technical specialist \u2013 able to thwart enemy plans, augment teammates, lay and defuse traps, and circumvent locked doors.\nWASP \u2013 a well-rounded craft balanced in all roles.\nShips can be customized for the look you want. Interchangeable noses, tails, wings, paint schemes, and decals make your craft one of a kind so your foes know who is taking them down. Or choose a scheme to fit your team.  \n\nUse the company scrip that you earn in matches to advance your ships along the tech trees. These trees augment the performance of your ship by enhancing existing abilities or adding new ones. Just remember that when you\u2019re deep in the mines, all of your enhancements can be dropped as power-ups for other players if you are destroyed. (Don't worry - you'll get them back in later matches.)\nWe love sharing with our backers and sharing what our backers share with us. \nMODDERS Welcome: We are designing and building this game to allow maximum community collaboration. Backers will be able to build their own maps, ships, logos, and weapons. Build something cool, submit it, and we may introduce it into the greater universe \u2013 become a developer yourself.\nWe're amping up the communication all the way to 11 (because 10 is not enough).\nYou've seen us do it before and we\u2019re doing it again. Michael Morlan and Eric Peterson set a new standard for reaching out to the community with \u201cWingman\u2019s Hangar\u201d and \u201cGalactic Inquiry.\u201d Look for a new show for Descent: Underground. Also expect behind-the-scenes videos, blogs, peeks into design meetings, and fun side-channel streams.\nThere has been a lot of interest in a Descent reboot and we\u2019ve been building a community ready to back such a project. Kickstarter is how we test the commitment of the fans and how we attract beyond that core community. \nThis genre of game has been neglected by traditional publishers. With the advent of online, digital distribution and crowd funding, we can surpass those publishers mired in repetitive releases and confined to only safe sequels.\nERIC \"WINGMAN\" PETERSON\nWing Commander 4, Starlancer, Conquest: Frontier Wars, Star Citizen \nEric has been making video games since 1984. He has been a founder of several successful game companies, and most recently was President of Production on Star Citizen. His passion for making AAA space games is known throughout the industry. He is very much involved in every aspect of game development from design, to production to team building, he can do it all. Eric believes strongly in community involvement, and is a pioneer in changing the way companies communicate with their communities. He is looking forward to making Descendent Studios, Inc, the leader in community involvement, and of course making a kick arse game called Descent: Underground!\nJASON \"STORMWIND\" SPANGLER\nStar Wars: The Old Republic, Star Citizen, Star Trek: Klingon Academy, Ultima Online and many expansions \nJason has served as chief technical officer (CTO), technical director, lead programmer, and programmer for a variety of studios and projects. He has also spoken at game development conferences in the United States and Japan, focusing on online game development, software quality, and software engineering practices. Before entering the games industry, Jason was a fan of space, RPG, sandbox, and simulation games. He even had a poem dedicated to Wing Commander and other Origin games published in Computer Gaming World as a winning entry in a game poetry contest.\nROB \"DESIGNOPOTAMUS\" IRVING\nWing Commander, Jane's AH-64D Longbow, Ultima Online: Renaissance, Star Citizen\nRob has been wandering around games since 1992, and they've pretty much all featured online play, combat, space, or all of the above. Over the years, he's served as a designer, writer, producer, programmer, and everything in between, but design has always been where his heart lies. Rob will be aiming for one word: FUN for Descent: Underground.\nSERGIO ROSAS - ART DIRECTOR\nConquest: Frontier Wars, Deus Ex: Invisible War, Thief: Deadly Shadows, Star Citizen\nSergio is an experienced video game industry art director with twenty years experience in graphic design including UI Design, 3D modeling, concept art, animation and video production, project management, outsource training and management, and international business development.

Todd is a game designer, dungeon master, tabletop RPG player and has self published two fantasy fiction novels. He'll be bringing his creative efforts to making Descent: Underworld an awesome gaming experience.\nPHIL \"BLUEDOG\" TITTLE\nGods and Heroes, Deadly Creatures, Multiple WWE titles, Star Citizen\nPhil has served as Project Manager, Producer, and Sr. Producer on a variety of game projects and with companies such as Origin-EA, THQ, Heatwave, and CIG. Prior to entering the game industry, Phil was a programmer, systems architect and project manager in the telecom industry. He has earned his PMP and CSM credentials. Phil's love of MMOs (EQ and Meridian 59) drove him to leave the somewhat stodgy world of telecom systems development to join Origin Studios and the UXO project. He'll be bringing his breadth of development and management experience to Descent: Underground.\nMICHAEL \"VIEWMASTER\" MORLAN\nCrusader: No Remorse, Ultima IX: Ascension, Ultima Online and several extensions, Star Citizen\nMichael started in the game industry as an artist, writer, and director of cinematics. Bridging the divide between left and right hemispheres, he also designed and coded the Ultima IX particle and magic effects system as well as wrote/directed/edited all the cinematics for that project. After art directing Ultima Online: Third Dawn, Michael joined Eric at Fever Pitch Studios then moved on to a full-time, freelance career as a cinematographer. He returned to game development with the successful funding of Star Citizen and produced \u201cWingman\u2019s Hangar\u201d as well as dozens of behind-the-scene programs. He\u2019ll be bringing that experience to the community outreach programming for Descent: Underground.\nDESCENT is a registered trademark or trademark of Interplay Entertainment Corp. in the U.S. and other countries, and is used under license.

There\u2019s a lot that can go wrong between funding and delivery of the game we\u2019re promising. We could run dry on funds, lose key people, mistake our original goals, and/or just not deliver the level of quality we imagined.\n\nFrom Scratch?\n\nWell, okay, not quite from scratch. We\u2019re starting with Unreal Engine 4 as our off-the-shelf platform, a team experienced with integrating multiple front-end and back-end subsystems, and a creative group with the vision to deliver top-flight game design and artwork.\n\nFunds\n\nOur challenge, here, is to assure we properly scope both the project and ongoing revenues, and manage it well throughout the development. Eric Peterson is a multi-successful producer with a penchant for negotiating great deals and motivating his team through inspiration and example. Our project manager, Phil Tittle, is focused on preventing runaway costs and assuring we hit milestones. Our CTO, Jason Spangler, will guide us in making good technological decisions, allowing us to stay focused on getting the game done in an efficient manner.\n\nPersonnel Churn\n\nDescendent Studios is a small team of very key people. Fortunately, we\u2019re incredibly dedicated to reviving the Descent 6DoF genre and are really excited to see this through. That, along with a tightly scheduled development cycle to deliver our alpha and gold master releases, should decrease our risk of losing a vital person.\n\nProper Scope\n\nOur biggest challenge is not overestimating what we can do with the funds, time, and team we\u2019ve planned for the game\u2019s development. Fortunately, our key people have all been responsible for delivering several successful game projects including Starlancer, Gods and Heros: Rome Rising, Ultima Online: Third Dawn, and Conquest: Frontier Wars. We\u2019ll be applying all our experience and craft to delivering Descent: Underground on time and within budget.\n\nQuality Experience\n\nWe really want to play this game. We really do. Anything less than what we promise is unacceptable.\n\nCommunity Participation\n\nIn the end, we depend on our backers and tight-knit community to watch and respond as we dive into one more game project.

Little girls are super excited about math and science and I completely disagree with anyone who says we need to put lots of effort into getting them more interested. They already are. It isn't until later in high school that society tells them math & science isn't for them & their participation drops. I don't think we need to get high school girls interested in math and science so much as make sure they feel welcome, included, and supported.\nThis isn't to say that I believe the lack of diversity in tech is solely because of a pipeline problem. I also believe strongly in making sure underrepresented demographics are treated well once they enter the industry. There's a lot that of work that needs to be done to ensure that any young people who are excited about science and technology now have an inclusive environment to work in when they get older. If you are funding this project, please consider also funding people and organizations that support diversity in the tech industry like AlterConf & Model View Culture.\nCredits\nmusic: leaves by airtone\nvideography: ellen kyle", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI am have taken the time to familiarize myself with printing, binding, and shipping zines on smaller projects leading up to this project. \n\nI want to make sure that the content of the zines speak to their intended audience, so it might take a few iterations and user studies to get everything right.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #36", "update_userinfo": "moar bubblesort zines and a hardware kit!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #35", "update_userinfo": "microcontroller zines printed!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #34", "update_userinfo": "hardware hacking zines sent to printer!", "update_content": "hi everyone! super exciting news! the hardware hacking & micro controller programming issue of bubblesort zines was sent to the printer a few weeks ago and i'll get them and start mailing them out monday!\nwe partnered with adafruit, and they'll sell a kit on their site that has all the parts you'll need to do the project in the zine. more on that soon!\nthis zine has been many months in the making! it's the longest zine yet at 134 pages. i can't wait to share it with you! on monday i'll update with photos of the zine, but in the mean time, here's a proof from the printer:"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "hardware hacking zine update!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "attention international backers (paper zines)!", "update_content": "hi international backers! \nfirstly, thank you so much for supporting bubblesort zines! it makes me so excited every time i pack up envelopes and see for myself how many places bubblesort is being sent to. i had last year's summer intern map out all of the places zines are being sent to and every time i see it it makes my heart so full!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "secret messages zine shipping party!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "printing update for zine #5!", "update_content": "Hi everyone!\nWanted to give you a quick update on the printing status of zine #5!

We\u2019re best known for our albums 3 Feet High and Rising, De La Soul Is Dead, Stakes Is High and many others. Some of our hit singles include \"Me Myself and I,\" \"Saturdays\" and \"Feel Good Inc.\" a collaboration with Gorillaz.\nWe\u2019ve collaborated with everyone from Chaka Khan to Common to even NASA: In 2004, our song \"Potholes in My Lawn,\" became one of the first rap records to be beamed from another planet by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity. Now we are here to collaborate with YOU, humanoid, on the most exciting project we\u2019ve ever done.\nFor the last decade, we've been independent artists, free of a record label interfering in our creative process. This will be our first De La Soul studio album in eleven years. We\u2019re excited and ready to create. It's been essential that we find ways to fund, record and release new music. Typically the fans have been the ones who support and appreciate our vision, so using Kickstarter and giving our fans the opportunity to be a part of the process just feels right. We see Kickstarter as a home for creative minds and a wonderful platform; where people who believe, respect and see the vision, can support an idea and make it a reality.\nTrue to our Hip-Hop roots, we make music without limits. This new album will incorporate elements of Jazz, Funk, Rock, Country Western and anything else we're feeling in the moment. To us, music is the influence of sounds, sounds in all vibrations and sizes, telling a story or pointing a direction. Some of these sounds we call samples, samples we use to make songs.\nS-950 & SP 1200 Samplers\nSampling is basically copying a piece of sound, from one recording, and reusing it to create a new recording. It is how De La has always made music. The sampler is our instrument, but people who copy, and in this case \"sample,\" have also been considered thieves and unoriginal. So, unfortunately a huge part of our career has also been spent fighting off the \u201csample police.\u201d\nEnough of those battles! For the new album, we needed a completely new approach, something Hip-Hop hasn\u2019t done before. So, here it is: For the first time, we're going to sample ourselves.\nVox Studios, Los Angeles, CA\nOver the last three years, we've collaborated with some of LA's finest studio musicians and recorded them in free-styled, unrehearsed, jam sessions. They played everything from banjo to upright bass, sometimes up to a dozen musicians at once; simply allowing sounds to integrate. We did 90% of these recordings in one of LA's most classic studios, Vox. We chose Vox because we wanted our recordings to have that creamy analog warm mixing board sound that the old records our parent\u2019s once played had. With over 200 hours of sounds, and vibes, equal to about 250 to 300 full-length vinyl LPs, it's time that we get to the work.\nHere\u2019s the interesting part. We are now in the process of going back to that 200+ hours of music, listening, enjoying and discovering those special moments where, musically, something magical happens, where interesting sounds and layers were forgotten, where new sounds can be sampled, looped, chopped, filtered and arranged, freely, without the intrusive presence of publishing politics and the infamous \u201csample police.\u201d What we've done is created our own crates of records; album upon albums to mine and sample from. In our world, what we\u2019ve created is freedom, freedom to make the art you believe in without having to compromise your vision. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve always wanted most, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always believed in, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve fought for, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this Kickstarter with you.\nWe have a fantastic cast of artist we're collaborating with. So far Damon Albarn (of Blur/Gorillaz), 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, and David Byrne (of Talking Heads) have blessed us with their talents; and we\u2019ll have more announcements of collabs to come, right here on Kickstarter.\nClockwise: Damon Albarn, 2 Chainz, Little Dragon, David Bryne\nWe\u2019re crowdfunding it to help pay for recording, mixing, marketing, and everything else. Your support will keep us in the studio, help us continue to sample and manipulate the music we\u2019ve recorded, will help us get additional production work done; and will help us design, package, market, and distribute the album. The whole thing. We literally cannot do it without you.\nSo now, for the goodies\u2026 For your support we\u2019d like to offer you some cool rewards. Let\u2019s start with our Kickstarter only, 1GB De La Soul thumb drives uploaded with the new album. We have a limited amount of our 2015, out of stock De La Dunks by NIKE, autographed by us, for you. How about a De La Dinner Date? The three of us and you at our good friend Marcus Samuelsson\u2019s new Harlem restaurant \u201cStreet Bird.\u201d We have an exclusive De La Soul T-shirt only available on Kickstarter. Who wants to spend the afternoon in NY, hitting up the sneaker shops with Pos? Would you like to go shopping with Dave for vintage toys and action figures; or diggin\u2019 for records with Maseo? Well you can when you \"Go Shopping Wit De La.\" We\u2019re also offering limited edition colored vinyl LPs and a 7\u201d singles, exclusive to Kickstarter only.

Wonder no more!\nTwenty-five years ago, Ron Gilbert and Gary Winnick created the game that introduced the world to 2D point & click adventure games. Maniac Mansion took the computer game world by storm with its compelling story, complex puzzles, cutting edge humor, engaging game play, and provided an entire generation with a new idea of what an adventure game could be. Blah blah blah...\nAnd now they are back together with an all new 2D point & click adventure game!  Ron is skinny again and Gary had that rash looked at \u2014 and they're here (finally!) to create the true spiritual successor to Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island.\nThimbleweed Park is a new game that cuts to the core of what made classic point & click adventure games so special, and done by the actual people who spawned the genre.\nIt's deep, it's challenging, it's funny, it's everything you loved about adventure games.\nHoly crap is this going to be fun! And you can be part of it - right here and right now for $20 bucks which is like $1.52 in 1987 dollars.\nWhy do we want to make Thimbleweed Park? Because we miss classic adventures and all their innocence and charm. \nThey were fun and would put a smile on your face. We want to make one of those again and we want to do it right. We don\u2019t want to make a game \u201cinspired by,\u201d or \u201cpaying homage to\u201d classic point & click adventures, we want to make a real classic point & click adventure. \nThimbleweed Park is a game for true lovers of adventure games. This is a Kickstarter for fans who loved Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island, and everything else that made that era great.  It strips away all the cruft built up over the years and is distilled down to what we loved about the genre.\n                                By popular demand and with thanks to the fine folks at Humble Bundle, we are now offering the ability to pay using PayPal. If you can back through Kickstarter directly, we kindly ask you to do that. It will make our lives a bit easier. But if you can't, then we're here for you. We got your back. \nAnyone who backs at $50 or higher will not only get their name in the Thimbleweed Park phone book (used for actual puzzle solving), but you\u2019ll also be able to record your own custom voicemail message when the number is called (subject to approval).\n               Please back our stretch goals and help us make Thimbleweed Park the best damn point & click adventure game you've played since that last point & click adventure game you played and liked.\nThimbleweed Park is the curious story of two washed up detectives called in to investigate a dead body found in the river just outside of town. It\u2019s a game where you switch between five playable characters while uncovering the dark, satirical and bizarre world of Thimbleweed Park.\nLost along a dusty stretch of highway, the town of Thimbleweed Park once boasted an opulent hotel, a vibrant business district and the state\u2019s largest pillow factory, but now teeters on the edge of oblivion and continues to exist for no real reason. It\u2019s a town that makes you itch and your skin crawl. It\u2019s a place no one ever looks for, but everyone seems to find. \nNot far from town, Delores and her siblings are gathered at the reading of her rich uncle\u2019s will where the backstabbing, intrigue and puzzle solving knows no end. How is this all connected to the dead body under the bridge? Good question.\nAt the long abandoned circus grounds, Ransome the Clown had been cursed and can never remove his make-up. How did he get into this situation? How can he get out? Does he really want to? What\u2019s up with that dead body slowly bloating in the water? Who knows!\nMeanwhile, on the 13th floor of the Edmund hotel, Franklin wakes up with no idea how he got there. But that\u2019s not the weird part. The weird part is that he\u2019s dead. Spoiler: He\u2019s not the body found just outside of Thimbleweed Park. Wow! That's confusing. Don\u2019t panic, we\u2019re just as confused as you are.\nWe like big pixels. Huge ones. Pixels that have their own Zip Codes. Pixels a family of six could live inside of and still have room for Uncle Pete when he drops in unexpectedly on his way to the coast.\nWe had a lot of fun building Maniac Mansion, there was a charm and simplicity to the art that let the game design shine and your imagination run wild.\nWe want Thimbleweed Park to be like an undiscovered classic LucasArts' adventure game you'd never played before. A game discovered in a dusty old desk that puts a smile on your face and sends a wave of nostalgia through you in the same way it does for us.\nRon Gilbert and Gary Winnick created and designed Maniac Mansion and have extensive experience making games over the past 25 years. Maniac Mansion was LucasArts\u2019 first adventure game and the point & click adventure game that spawned the genre we know and love today.\nRON GILBERT is a game designer, writer and programmer best known for creating and designing the cult classic adventure games Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island. Ron was the ninth employee at Lucasfilm Games, instrumental in their leap into adventure games, and creator of the SCUMM engine. He was the co-founder of Humongous Entertainment and made numerous adventure games for kids, such as Putt-Putt, Freddi Fish and Pajama Sam. His most recent work includes the adventure/RPG DeathSpank, The Cave and indie mobile games The Big Big Castle and Scurvy Scallywags.\nGARY WINNICK is an artist, writer, designer and art director. During his ten year stint at Lucasfilm Games he co-designed and created all the art for their first graphic adventure Maniac Mansion. Additionally, he created art for and art directed many other LucasArts games including Zak McKracken, Loom, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monkey Island and Habitat. Gary created the original property Defenders of Dynatron City, co-plotted a six issue mini-series for Marvel and served as a producer for the animated TV special. He was a co-founder of Lightsource Studios and Suddenly Social. His most recent graphic novel Bad Dreams is currently being published by comic company Red 5.\nJust like they were on Maniac Mansion, Ron and Gary will be the core of the team building this new point & click adventure, co-designing and writing with Ron doing the bulk of the programming and Gary doing the art.  Good times.\nAn additional programmer and artist will be added 6 months into production, along with a part-time musician. Dedicated testers will join as the game nears completion.\nWe're fully devoting ourselves to Thimbleweed Park in the same way we did Maniac Mansion, Monkey Island and everything else we do. This is a serious full-time project for us. We want to make the best classic point & click adventure we can.\nFollow and participate in the game's development on our website, where Ron, Gary and other members of the team will discuss behind-the-scenes art, designs, information, cooking, gossip, answer questions, get feedback and generally have a lot of fun*. \n* Fun not guaranteed and void where prohibited by law.\nTons of other fascinating rewards can be found by looking to your right\u2026 over there\u2026 no, a little higher\u2026 scroll up\u2026 there!\n** Rewards icons are for reference, entertainment and gambling purposes only and are not necessarily representative of the final rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBuilding games is always risky.

Check out this update.\nSome big names in games love our pitch!\nJerry Holkins of Penny-Arcade has some interesting stuff to say about Human Resources here.\n Want to destroy the world? Get in line.\nHuman Resources is a PC real-time strategy game that puts you in command of apocalyptic factions vying to conquer the drifting remains of a shattered Earth. Using humans as your resource, assemble giant armies to annihilate your foes, then feed the newly-cleansed Earthshards to your almighty leader. \nKey Features of Human Resources include: \nAsymmetrical factions! Play as ancient squid monsters from another dimension or as giant killer robots.\nInsanely huge battles! Command hundreds of units and conquer sprawling, fully destructible cities.\nBreathtaking visuals! A comic-inspired art style means the apocalypse has never looked so gorgeous.\nBlast from the past! The tone, character, and pacing of a Command & Conquer game mixed with the mammoth battles of an Annihilation game.\nThe Singularity is nigh. Newly-sentient automated factories churn out waves of giant robots, hell-bent on dismantling and recycling all of human civilization. The insect-like Machines can deploy into stationary modes, enhancing their shielding and firepower. They decimate their enemies with ranged energy weapons. \nThe humans invoke the tentacled Ancient Ones in a last-ditch effort to stem the Machine onslaught. This proves unwise. Now the Ancient Ones vie with the Machines to consume the last scraps of Earth. The Ancient Ones advance in fast-moving hordes, overwhelming their foes with fearsome melee attacks. An assortment of arcane spells and foul poisons rounds out their arsenal. \nWho knows what other factions may lurk in the void, waiting for the moment to strike? \nBattles unfold on floating fragments of Earth as they are ripped from the planet and pulled toward the waiting mouths of god-sized faction leaders. The cities that lie in your path are fully destructible, as is the terrain beneath them. Uproot buildings to use as clubs! Create mighty warriors that can cut the Earthshard in two! Bore giant holes through the ground! Summon your overlords to eat the whole thing!\nUp to eight players can duke it out on endlessly-varied procedural battlefields. Skirmish against up to seven AI adversaries on your own or fight multiple AI opponents alongside your friends. \nRandomly-generated terrain and cityscapes create new opportunities from battle to battle. A single game may encompass one or many Earthshards, crisscrossed by any number of human settlements. Unexpected bonus items lurk in randomly-generated structures throughout the battlefield, encouraging improvisation and risk-taking. \nHuman Resources\u2019 visual style is inspired by the clean color and precise linework of classic comic illustrators like Moebius, Herg\u00e9, and Geof Darrow. Clear silhouettes and easily-differentiated colors make it easy to navigate chaotic battlefields. We\u2019ve created a homebrew rendering system to make the apocalypse prettier than it\u2019s ever been before.\nUber Entertainment is an independent game studio founded in 2008 by a team of industry veterans who wanted to create high quality games in a small-team environment. In 2010, Uber released its first title, the critically-acclaimed Monday Night Combat. Since then, we have released Super Monday Night Combat, Toy Rush, and Planetary Annihilation. \nPlanetary Annihilation was developed with the support of a record-breaking Kickstarter campaign (the Planetary Annihilation team will continue to support that project while a new team builds Human Resources). Having experienced the unprecedented creative control, autonomy, and IP ownership enabled by crowdfunding, we can\u2019t imagine going back to the old way of making games. With Kickstarter, we get to make the game we want, the way we want to make it -- and we get to work with you guys from day one. \nWith Planetary Annihilation, we think the results speak for themselves. The game is a beloved and critically lauded entry in the RTS canon, and we\u2019re extremely proud of it. Now we\u2019re ready to try something even more ambitious. \nHuman Resources evolves the powerful Planetary Annihilation engine to enable new innovations in gameplay, graphics, and world-building. We need your help -- not just as financial backers, but as partners who will shape key aspects of the game\u2019s design.  \nFolks at Uber Entertainment have worked on titles like Total Annihilation, Command & Conquer, Supreme Commander, and Demigod. We are very passionate about RTS gaming and we can\u2019t wait to show you our vision for the future of the genre.\nJohn Comes - Lead Designer, Project Director\nJohn Comes has spent the better part of his 13 year professional career working on some of the biggest strategy titles out there. Titles like: Command & Conquer Generals: Zero Hour, The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle Earth, Supreme Commander, Planetary Annihilation, and more. He wants to take this opportunity to combine all the best parts of all these games and incorporate them into one awesome experience. After all, he knows awesome! \nNate Simpson - Art Director\nNate Simpson\u2019s highlight reel includes Demigod, Supreme Commander 2, GoPets, and Starfleet Command 2. He also writes and draws Nonplayer, an Eisner Award-winning series published by Image Comics. His favorite games are Katamari Damacy and Shadow of the Colossus.

We will prototype key features rapidly to ensure compelling and exciting gameplay.\n\nThe estimated launch date of February 2016 grows directly from this plan and resulting production timeline.\n\nThe Kickstarter video is a gameplay visualization, not actual in-game footage.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Planetary Annihilation Inc\n2 created \u00b7 2 backed\nPlanetary Annihilation Inc is the new home for Planetary Annihilation and this Kickstarter project originally created by Uber...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "The End is Nigh", "update_content": "Fellow meat sticks,\nI come here today to give a wholehearted THANK YOU to everyone who backed us, tweeted, Facebooked, and stood on an overpass with a sign.

However, when you waken you are weak and must lurk in the shadows to avoid a return to your demonic slumber.\nThis is where That Which Sleeps deviates from the typical turn based strategy formula. Rather than directly affecting the world by building or training troops, you use your power to indirectly influence the world utilizing uniquely designed Agents who can infiltrate the nations of the world, terrorize outlying farms, and perform esoteric rituals to create the perfect situation for your return.\nThe player must balance an aggressive approach utilizing his considerable power and eager hordes with the need to remain unknown to the Champions and Heroes of the world. This allows for multiple play styles and various meaningful decision paths - all made more unique and re-playable due to the large cast of available agents and awakened demons aka \"Ancient Evils\". In addition, the world is customized at the beginning of the game as you explicitly lay out how you were sealed away, and what methods you used to manipulate the world in your slumber.\nThe priority of our stretch goals were voted on by the community, and we couldn't be happier with the final ordering of results!\nMinion Art Pack - ACHIEVED - A responsibly rendered minion is a happy minion, and with this art pack we'll be able to create the thematically consistent look for the less celebrated tools of the Old One that they deserve.\nGods and Religion - ACHIEVED - The Gods have returned in all their fractious glory! Cultures can be polytheistic, monotheistic, or shamanistic - and of course none of the religions will be on friendly terms and even inside the Pantheons themselves you're bound to find friction, just the thing that a conniving Old One like yourself can capitalize on. In addition to the Gods themselves as AI entities, you will be able to start a religion yourself and present yourself as a savior to the gullible masses. Cults round out the feature set representing splinter groups that fixate on one particular aspect of their religion and pursuit it all costs.\nReligions will become an integral part of the game, but just like guilds you can set the number and relative importance. Take on a world dominated by a single monotheistic faith or find your agents embroiled in a religious war with several fronts. Rally your strength by recruiting The Apostate, and prepare to confront three new hero types based around the Priest archetype.\nRival Old Ones - ACHIEVED - You think you were the only Ancient Evil set to slumber? Whatever occurrence caused you to rouse from your sleep has brought others to consciousness as well, and you must contend with their motivations. Not to worry, they aren't all bent on world domination like you are - but their oft times ineffable logic may frustrate your ambitions. Work with them if you'd like, or even better position yourself as savior of the world and join the Alliance to stop a great evil. Then you... well... you know what comes afterwards.\nConfigure the amount of Old Ones on a game by game basis to fill the world with foes or have a solemnly terrifying time to yourself. Set up Kingdoms ruled by Mythical Creatures from your age that have remained in the world while you slept and teach them that they have merely been stewards of a world that yours alone. Finally, you can enable randomized events that spawn lesser creatures of ancient power that jealously wish to usurp your throne.\nEndless Simulation - ACHIEVED - Get ready for the long haul. A plethora of engine changes to enhance the simulation aspect of That Which Sleeps. By reducing dependencies on fundamental assumptions of the engine we can make the world and AI more independent, and the benefits of these changes flow down into the modding world.\nWhat does this mean for you? It means a game with less limitations - play an endless world where your rise to power is simply another event. Survive wave after wave of insurrection while you solidify your control and remake the world in your image, or ride the wings of fate on a new dynamic prophecy system that rewards you for obtaining obscure results in the game world.\nProcedural Generation - ACHIEVED - An infinite amount of replay! Genealogical generation of a sprite based map that will itself be used as a basis for a dynamically created scenario. Instead of making decisions \"after the fact\" with our current Scenario Generation, you will observe a world as the cultures start as tribes and push forward into a civilized state. Use your limited power to interfere at key moments and alter the shape of the world and its peoples. Choose to begin your game at any moment in the world's development and then do what you do best.\nThis will give you an infinitely re-playable world with vastly different dynamics in every game. You may find yourself a lost God amongst primitive tribes during an age of colonialism, or you awaken just after your defeat to a world fresh with desire for revenge. Environmental effects will become more powerful as you raise volcanoes to choke the world with ash or flood it from its rivers.\nLife Goes On - Achieved - At least that's what people tell themselves, and with this Asset Pack it becomes easier than ever to determine which pieces of the world are flourishing and need your corrupting presence. Trade routes will now be illustrated by caravans that ply the roads and sea, farmers will tend their fields, and workers will labor on new buildings in capitals - all modeled at the proper resolution to be able to be identified without obscuring other more salient pieces of data. This and a suite of other changes will make the world feel more alive than ever before.\nThe Horrors of War - ACHIEVED - Now that we've drawn the world at peace, let's give it a more appealing aesthetic. Refugees will cry in terror as they emerge from their burning homes, armies will drill beyond city limits, and your Terrorizing Challenges will emerge onto the map before you. In addition, all POIs will gain a graphical indicator of their defenses and you'll see your progress as the walls crumble.\nRitual Impact - ACHIEVED - After laboring for fifty turns to finally be able to raise a fortress into the sky, it can be a little disappointing to only see an icon on the map. We'll be taking some of the most potent Rituals and rendering them the way they deserve - lord over the world in your flying citadel, see the forbidden outlines of The Horror as it draws madness from the populace, or watch the Colossus laboriously pound the walls of your enemies' castles to ruin.\nFor information on our latest Stretch Goals please check out our update.\nFeatures\nCorrupt, conquer, charm, and manipulate - with a fully realized world driven by thematic AIs that follow their own interests you can pursue multiple paths to victory.\nCustomize the world with your choices at the beginning of each scenario, choosing an Ancient Evil and selecting his origins and what dire deeds he has wrought on the world.\nMake difficult choices with limited agents, choosing to send your Prophet to rouse the orc hordes or beset Kings with maddening dreams will greatly change the flow of the game.\nDisrupt the Balance of Power by creating famines in the farmland, stoking the flame of old vendettas, or recruiting pirates to the sea.\nWatch the fame of your Agents rise and heroes will begin to hunt them down. Let them fall as scapegoats and keep your name secret, or imbue them with dark power and take the fight back to the heroes.\nEach action you take leaves clues behind that cunning heroes can decipher, eventually leading them to the truth. Kill or corrupt them before they find a receptive ear at court\nA fully functioning in-game Editor that allows you to create your own scenarios, old ones, heroes, artifacts, and even agents\nLocalization supported for multiple languages and character sets\nThat Which Sleeps is based around configurable Scenarios, each of which is a hand-crafted experience designed to maximize the strategic and thematic potential of the game mechanics.  Populating this world are complex AI entities ranging from heroes who wander the world pursuing their goals (generally being meddlesome) to Kings who must weigh their personal desires against the best interest of the country. \nThe AI is designed in such a way that you will never feel like you are playing against the nations and heroes of the world, instead they often work at cross-purposes.  Leave them alone and they may fight wars, wound one another in duels, and pass discriminatory laws against other cultures.  Give them a little nudge in the right direction, and the fireworks really start to fly.\nPoints of Interest (PoIs)\nThe building blocks of the map are Points of Interest (PoIs), which are highly detailed nodes that serve as cities, villages, ruins, and other more diverse landscapes.  The PoI system allows us to make sure that every point on the map is richly detailed, consisting of cultural and social breakdowns and containing the potential for epic quests and clever stratagems.  You may find yourself burning the farmland of a village, infiltrating the local Mage's Guild, or excavating ancient tombs to find more powerful rituals for your reconquest.\nGuilds, Orders, and Cabals\nWhile Nations remain the primary methods of AI agency we have several institutions that exist outside of national borders and spread their own agendas regardless of nationality.  While many of them are detrimental to your cause as they promote order and development, most are just a short \"change of management\" away from being a useful tool for spreading corruption and chaos.\nThe player takes the role as an Old One - an extremely powerful demon that has been sealed away from the world for generations.  Some of these creatures are unknowable eldritch abominations of mysterious origin and intent, others are men fallen from grace as they ascended to the ranks of true power.  Each fundamentally changes the way the game is played, with ability trees that are devoid of \"fluff\" or redundancy.\nMeet Azlan - the Dreaming God, He Who Lurks, the Disembodied Titan, the Twilight Confessor, the Usurper of Dreams, the King in Gold, the Severed Tendril.  All of these names are associated with abilities and legends inside the world, that the Heroes will pursue and attempt to decipher.  If they learn them all, you will find your ability to battle them greatly reduced as they gear up and prepare to defeat you.  When we say \"The World Has Forgotten Your Name\" we mean it.\nDream Host - Azlan's body was torn asunder in the ancient past, but his spirit ascended to the world of dreams.  He wields the power of this surreal existence to alter reality itself, and as he grows stronger he will eventually bridge the gap between the two remaking the world in his twisted image.\nThe Night Whispers - In the night man drifts into the world that Azlan calls home, and as prisoners they listen to his ravings.  The most defining ability of Azlan comes from this tree, allowing him to tag a certain number of Heroes, Leaders, or other AI entities and over time adjust their personality.  Drive the Pious High Theocrat to abhorrent behavior, or make the brave King of the Cylarians a coward.\nBelial the Deceiver is a coward, a lurking evil that festers in jealousy, greed, and the desires that turn man against his fellows - but their is strength in small things and power to be found in whispered secrets.  With a wide range of Agents to recruit and abilities that augment any play-style you pursue, Belial is the natural choice for a versatile game.\nAbilities\nWill over Fate - Belial sees deep into the pools of time, at first you will be limited to simply perceiving events before they occur but as you waken you will be able to take control of fate and bend it to your will.  Force an earthquake to strike the walls of a besieged city, or turn a stray arrow to a King's throat.\nDwelling in Darkness -  Belial finds his ways into the darkness of all creatures, twisting them to his will. While you stir only carrion feeders and other beasts heed this call, but how far is man from beast in the end?  Ravens will be your eyes in the far corners of the world, and in time the cowardly will fall to your will.\nPower drew Sisyphus on a noble path, a hero destined to save the world - but like so many before him he found in his own uncompromising ideals a nightmare of benevolence, a world frozen in imperfection.  Sisyphus is tormented by his failings but will try, eternally, to create the perfect world of his dreams - he will look to The Chosen One to uncover the flaw in his character.\nAbilities\nOf Mortal Birth - Born of man but ascended to the ranks of the Ancients, Sisyphus strives to erase all trace of his mortal past. That past still defines him, in his life and even more so in his death.  He gains abilities based on choices made during Scenario Generation and by interacting with The Chosen One.\nThe Price of Victory - The quest for peace lead Sisyphus to Godhood and the world bled for his dream. Those who serve him will sacrifice as well and lend strength to his divine designs.  Your imbues are far stronger than the other Ancients but they come at a cost, useful for pursuing very particular strategies.\nKarth the Scarred saw the rest of the Primal Entities fall as the Old Ones claimed the world for their own, but war is an eternal truth beyond even the designs of the Ancients.  Struck down by the Old Ones, from his blood the children of his rage emerged and their fires would engulf the world.  Karth wakes quickly and is a powerful figure on the map - it can be hard to maintain a low profile with such an occurrence but Karth isn't one to pursue a subtle agenda.\nAbilities\nWar Without End - Karth is the last surviving Primal God. Time tempered and made anachronisms of his peers but in every Orc battlecry, in every scream of the slaughtered, therein lies praise to Karth.  War is hell, but with Karth around it becomes so much worse - expect more wounds in combat, more attrition in battle, and tempers to rise in the halls of power.\nCall of the Horde - The heirs to Karth's legacy lay scattered through the land, but their time has come.  As you stir you will only be able to bring orcs and goblins to rise, but as you waken all of the creatures that thirst for battle will come to your call, from the furthest corners of the world.\nLimos howls and screams at the abomination that is life.  Tortured, he has been kept at bay by the Ancients and before them the Primal Powers, but now his time has come and he can bring an end to the motion and sound that engulfs his every moment of awareness.  Choose Limos if you want to bring a true end to the world, but it may be difficult to draw the living to your crusade.\nAbilities\nThe Gift of Death - To Limos even the Undead are reprehensible, but still they are better than the living.  He is able to easily raise the dead to his legions and bestow the eternal gift on Agents and Heroes, bringing them to a more sympathetic view of his position. \nEnd of Days - Limos is the end of all things, and in his hands the apocalypse will come in every form that man has feared.  Choke the healthy with plagues, raise the seas and poison the rivers - you will put the world to the test and see if they can come together to put an end to your rise before it is too late.\nA mysterious Old One whose Crystal Towers slowly covered the earth emitting a sickly luminescence draining both color and spirit from the world around them.  Her minions scoured the world drawing out those of their choosing to the mysterious depths of the Towers.  Still, there were those who made the Sojurn to her lair and returned - a tale of wonder on their lips.\nReflections of Grace - Seraph descended as light, and created for herself a home to magnify her form and splendor.  From it the seeds of crystalline growth are spread, and within the bounds of her magnified light she can easily manifest - projecting her will into solid crystal.  As she wakens her light shall grow stronger, and her powers within her expanding domain as well.\nCelestial Artifice - Much of her light was lost in the shattering of her palace, and the pieces of its ruin scattered across the world.  Recovering these shards will return Seraph to her full strength, and utilizing the remnants she may grant her followers rituals and artifacts of celestial strength, or craft crystalline forges to create golems to bolster her forces.\nWeak and bound still to your terrestrial prison, you rely on those of dark inclination to serve you.  At first only the soft minded will rally to your cause, but as your power and influence grows you can call powerful demons to your side, exhume ancient allies, or bend to your will the Lords of the world. \nAgents move about the world beneath the gaze of armies, kings, and even heroes unless their fame rises too high or their activities are dangerous enough.  They infiltrate cities, terrorize farmlands, muster military units, cast ritual spells, and even excavate ancient ruins.  The possible actions an Agent can make are bound to their skills and traits, which they supplement by recruiting minions from the areas they've corrupted around the map.\nYou may only have a certain number of Agents active at a time, so choosing the proper Agent to supplement your strategy is critical to victory.  All Agents are valuable, even though some of the later Agents are more ostensibly powerful each has their role to play.  In addition to their skills and abilities each Agent has a unique Scheme that only they can use, proper usage of which can change your fortunes.\nThe Peddler\nThe Peddler is one of your early agents, a weak-willed failure whose dependence on the bottle makes breaking his spirit easy even in your weakened state.  He is uniquely suited for low level espionage and fails to raise warning flags at villages due to their acceptance of the traveling merchant.  He is able to sell cursed items and poisoned potions to unwitting Heroes.\nScheme - Prey Upon Fear - It isn't just wares that the Peddler deals in, but also rumors and information.  Knowing just what to say at the right moment can turn a tranquil marketplace into a ready and able lynch mob.  Turn the crowd against magic, and see that pesky sorcerer Hero strung up before nightfall.\nSpeaker of the Dead\nEarn the respect of one of the necromantic cabals and you may be able to recruit their leader to your cause.  The Speaker is a rough hand at infiltration but is second to none at terrorizing the countryside and turning a few isolated undead groups into a horde that can upend a kingdom.  Failing that, you will find no other Agent who can so easily extract information from Heroes, dead or alive... preferably dead.\nScheme - Scorn the Grave - The Speaker can bind a deceased Hero, gaining access to his skills, abilities, and knowledge.  This ritual is considered a horrible affront and you can expect other Heroes to come try and free their tortured comrade.\nHordemaster Drall\nFrom the moment an Orc Tribe joins your forces you can recruit this beast of an Orc.  A skilled commander and an even better recruiter, Drall is the cornerstone of any good Orc Horde.  Expect to see his star rise quickly, he often makes a useful scapegoat to avoid arousing suspicion of your return.  Prop him up as the Great Conqueror, let him fall, and move along to your next plot.\nScheme - Lessons in Bone - The ultimate tool in Drall's arsenal, by sacrificing an Elite unit Drall can give that Elite's special ability to another Elite.  The humans think they counter your Goblin Fanatics with their Heavy Cavalry, just wait till they see them ride into combat on Ogres.  Seeing that look of surprise is what makes Drall get out of the bed every morning.\nHeroes\nWhile your agents and minions are out pursuing your agenda doing nefarious deeds, there are a host of heroes in the realm going about their activities as well - questing for their liege, searching for treasure or artifacts, and hunting monsters.\nWe first previewed heroes in our development blog HERE.\nHeroes have their own set of traits and goals that guide their activities during the game.  A sage may seek out tomes or lore to create a magical spell or artifact, while a warden may seek to root evil out of the nearby wilderness.  In addition to following their archetypical interests, they have desires they seek to fulfill.  Some heroes may seek gold, others to join an exclusive Order, or maybe just to be the greatest warrior in the world.  The personality traits derive from culture, so when you see an Errus Warrior you can guess that he's not going to run away from a fight.\nThings change as you interact with the land - heroes may begin to pick up clues to your existence and begin to either seek out your agents or find prophecies or artifacts that will help defeat you.  Decreasing the potency and frequency of  the release of dangerous clues by not calling on your Ancient Powers will mitigate the danger, but also lowers your efficiency at pursuing your goals.  Striking a balance between the two is an uncertain task.\nEvents\nAnother major way the player interacts with the world is through a series of branching and interconnected events.  We draw our inspiration from great games such as King of Dragon Pass and Expeditions: Conquistador.  \nWe understand that striking narrative paired with varied decision paths that directly influence both short reaching and long reaching game states can really create memorable situations and really immerse the player into the game.\nWe have already created hundreds of unique events and the supported mod tools allow players to create countless more.\n Combat\nCombat is the crisis point of the challenges Agents face, and the decision of whether or not to stand and fight will always be a difficult one.  Our mechanics for combat are primarily to reinforce the idea of meaningful sacrifice and long term strategy vs short term gains.  The battles are, even in their smallest skirmish, consequential and evoke the type of boss battles often encountered in RPGs, except this time you're the boss.\n Music\nThat Which Sleeps boasts over 45 minutes of unique, custom made music produced by the extremely talented Paul Giangregorio, or Gluglug as he is known to his League of Legend Parody fans.  We couldn't have asked for a more evocative soundtrack.\n Everything you see in the scenarios were developed completely inside That Which Sleep's in-game editor.  We are firm believers in modding as a requirement for a game to call itself a real strategy game, and we are confident that the tools we have in place will not disappoint.  I expect to see some pretty amazing community contributions once the game is released.\nYou can make new Old Ones, Agents, Heroes, Events, Campaigns, Guilds - the list goes on and on.  All of it from inside the game engine, and if you really want to do some modification of the files they are all in standardized XML.  Each class has an XML Serializer helper class to facilitate our mod support that checks for localization information, override folders, and image substitutions. \nWant more than 1 copy of the game?  Just add an additional $10 per copy to your reward tier!\nThat Which Sleeps has been in development for over a year and has been entirely self funded up to this point.  We have a stable working game engine and what we feel is a fun and engaging concept, we just lack the art resources to bring the visuals to the next level.  \nWe have a full time coder and all the major game systems and are in place and successfully implemented.  We do not, however, have an in house artist - so we'd be using your funds primarily to cover graphic updates, and animation.  We think with responsible use of your funds we can overhaul several of the major art assets - including portraits, heros, and agent sprites & animation.\nAny additional funding will go directly into stretch goals.\nKing Dinosaur Games was founded by two friends who have known each-other for over 15 years.\nCombined we have not just the critically important design and development experience to create a game of this scope, we also have the discipline to properly budget and execute in an efficient and timely manner.  Mix that with the overwhelming passion we both have for creating innovative, fun games and we like to think you have a recipe for success.\nWe have been chronicling the design process on IndieDB since June.  We have several blogs posts and over an hour of video logs for you to check out HERE.\nWe've also been actively discussing design decisions, and taking feedback directly from fans on Bay 12 Forums, RPGCODEX, and on our Reddit Forums.  Check them out and participate in the discussion!\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBy waiting until we have a fully functional and working game engine we feel like we successfully mitigated the most common risks that many games on Kickstarter face.

We spent hours pretending to be wizards and casting epic imaginary spells.\nNow, we want to bring that kind of creative freedom to video games.  Instead of giving the player pre-packaged spells, CodeSpells allows you to craft your own magical spells.  It's the ultimate spellcrafting sandbox.\nWhat makes it all possible is code.  The game provides a coding interface where you can specify exactly what your spells will do. This interface is intuitive enough for individuals (young and old) who have never coded before.  But skilled coders will also enjoy using their coding skills in new and creative ways!  Even children can use this interface to make mountains out of the terrain, make an impenetrable force field around yourself, or even make a golem creature out of the surrounding rocks. The sky is the limit!\nSpell-crafting sandbox: Craft and test your spells on the surrounding landscape - lift rocks, whip a river up into a tornado, anything!  The spells are cooler spells than in any video game to date -- because you and the rest of the CodeSpells community have complete control over them.  If you'd rather use \"boxed\" spells (maybe for inspiration before designing your own spells) these will be available too!\nUnlimited creative expression: With 4 different elements (earth, fire, water, air) and the ability to combine those elements in complex ways, the number of spells you can create is literally infinite.\nLearn some coding: If you already know coding, great! If not, CodeSpells uses an intuitive drag-and-drop language that even children can use.  As they become more proficient, they can code in typed Javascript!  It's the coolest way to learn one of the world's most valuable skills. \nShare spells with friends: As soon as you create a new spell, send it over to your friends for them to try out! CodeSpells will have community forums where users can show off their favorite spells with other wizards or work collaboratively on spell projects.\nPlay Online: Create new game modes to play with and against your friends. We'll give you the tools to make anything from a survival game to a new magic-based sport!\nFor the CodeSpells world we will be creating procedurally generated levels that change over time as you affect the elements and their distributions throughout the map. We've come up with a system for simulating the effects of elements in the world that will dynamically change as the environment changes. An area in shadow will be less hot than an area in direct sunlight. Altitude will change the weather. Land close to a water source will be humid, so more vegetation will grow there. Hot and dry areas will be more prone to catching fire. We'll be able to simulate fire spreading, water flowing through new areas, and constantly changing biomes. The world will feel truly dynamic and alive.\nFor the sandbox version of CodeSpells you'll be able to freely use any spells you create to affect these environments and understand the way the systems work together. You'll be able to redirect rivers and play with the environment as a living system.\nYou will be able to level up from experience gained through gameplay. Each element will be bound to a different mana bar that can be increased so that your character can be customized.  Specialize in one element, or learn them all.\nWe are developing several game modes that make full use of the generated areas of CodeSpells, but we'll also be opening up the ability to make new game modes to you. If you want to make a game about surviving in the wilderness, you'll have all the tools to do that. If you want to create a game mode that's purely about balancing an eco-system, you'll also be able to do that. You can even create a new multiplayer magic-based sport to play with your friends. You'll be able to share these and discover game modes that other people have create around the world. At the core, CodeSpells is about creative expression. We want you to be able to customize the experience and give you the power to use your magic in the worlds you create.\nThe statistics about coding education are alarming: \nPart of the reason kids choose not to pursue coding is because it doesn't sound \"fun\": working in a basement, dealing with syntax errors... We hope to make an impact in the world by showing kids (and adults) that coding can be a tool for creative expression.\nStudents can learn to code, syntax-error free using a Blockly spell-crafting interface that has all the tools available in Javascript. When they've learned all the programming concepts from Blockly, students can move on to typing Javascript code.\nThe wizards of CodeSpells will be able to master each of the 5 elements. As you grow more powerful, elemental magic can be combined into even stronger spells.\nEarth\nEarth is aligned with geological forces and a deep understanding of the physical world. Earth magic users understand the geological timescale. These wizards are both powerful builders, building castles and deforming terrain, but also powerful foes, with the ability to hurl boulders and create secret pitfalls.\nEarth orbs use the physical forces of the world to attract and repel objects away from each. They can apply directional forces or torques to objects they touch. With Earth magic you could create a rock fortress that only you know the secret way into or you could create a Rock Golem to defend you as you explore the world.\nFire \nFire is the spark that started the universe. While fire users appreciate a fire's simple light and warmth, they can also unlock its more destructive potential -- burning forests and melting glaciers.\nA fire orb has the ability to burn things in its path, but it also has the ability to reconstruct things from ashes at a high mana cost. A player could teleport themselves by turning themselves into ash, having the orb fly through an un-walkable area, and reconstructing themselves on the other side.\nWater \nWater is an ever-changing substance, and water wizards are aware of water in all its forms: water, ice, and vapor.\nWater orbs are primarily about interacting with the flow of the environment. You can redirect rivers or put out fires. You can affect the world in a sustained way to flood an area or to create new forests.\nAir \nAir ties everything together and is combined with the other elements to amplify their precision. Because of its broad area, air is often used as a defensive art.\nAir orbs are about sensing the world. They have a wide radius and have a more defined understanding of what they touch. As a wizard you can capture sounds from one area and alter the way they manifest themselves. If you wanted to be stealthy, you could use an air orb to suppress your footstep sounds or emit them elsewhere to confuse creatures or other players.\nLife (The 5th Element) \nLife is the most powerful element, and therefore the most difficult to master (See stretch goals). Life magic can be used to grow forests and affect creatures.\nLife orbs represent a deeper understanding of programming and being able to deconstruct prebuilt code. Creatures will have code that through observation and Life orbs you'll be able to open up and explore. With that, you can alter their behavior and tame them. If you see a creature defending its home, you can cast a Life orb to study the creature and expose the concept of 'defending a target'. You then have access to the defend function for a creature and can redirect it to defend you.\nAdrian Lopez-Mobilia, Lead Video Game Developer - Adrian has been developing video games for several years.

She recently completed her PhD from UC San Diego in Computer Science with a focus on Computer Science Education and HCI.\nWe chose Kickstarter because we want to involve you in the development process! We need your feedback, comments, and criticism to help us create the best possible spell-crafting world.\nWe want to create a world that is not only fun to play in, but also fun to build new content in. With Kickstarter, we feel like we can connect with you and get feedback immediately from people truly interested in seeing CodeSpells succeed.\nCurrent Status\nWe have a system for crafting spells in a drag-and-drop language. We have an early version of gameplay for earth magic completed, and we've started prototyping the other elements, but we still have plenty more to develop.\nPost-Kickstarter Timeline\nThis Kickstarter will fund the development of three more elements (Fire, Air, and Water) and the polishing of the final game over the course of 1 year. We want CodeSpells to be an experience with AAA game quality.\nDecember 2014: The Alpha of CodeSpells will be released to our \"$80 & up\" backers on Christmas Day of 2014.\nJune 2015: The Beta of CodeSpells will be released to our \"$30 & up\" backers. We look forward to using the feedback from our Alpha & Beta Kickstarter backers while we improve the gameplay. \nSeptember 2015: All Kickstarter backers will receive a copy of the Creative Mode of CodeSpells.\nIf we get funded beyond:\nEarly 2016: We'll polish and release the multiplayer game creation tools so you can create your own new multiplayer games within CodeSpells.\nSummer 2016: First release of Life as an element in the game. There will be creatures, plants, and NPCs to interact with in the world.\nHolidays 2016: We'll give you the tools for a new Artificial Intelligence system for the NPCs that populate the world along with a dialog system so you can create new story based adventures within CodeSpells.\nEarly 2017: Create your own new species and custom characters with new tools and an in-game character creator.\nWe want CodeSpells to be a game with AAA quality but that requires time and money. We need to purchase licenses and be able to pay developers. Each new feature in CodeSpells needs to work not only as a clearly defined system, but also one that's fun to play with. Making a world where you have infinite freedom to bend the rules requires attention to details that you could usually cheat or mask in the development of other games.\nWe also need to be able to pay people for new sounds, music, animations, and all of the things you'd expect from a fully realized game!\nAfter we release CodeSpells to Kickstarter backers in September 2015, we plan to sell copies of this version of CodeSpells. This revenue will be used to make further enhancements to the game. (See our stretch goals below.) We want to keep adding these new features to the game to enable you even more creativity. We would like for CodeSpells to continue to evolve and grow as we get more feedback and people playing it.\nAdditional Backer Rewards:\nStephen & Sarah, researchers at UC San Diego, knew they wanted to create a video game that taught young students how to code. They knew that coding should be completely immersed in the gameplay, but how? They decided to use a metaphor for coding in the game: magic. They decided students will play the role of a wizard, and they will craft magical spells in Java code.\nWhile developing this first iteration of CodeSpells for their research at UC San Diego, Sarah & Stephen published several academic papers about the educational aspects of CodeSpells:\n\"From competition to metacognition: designing diverse, sustainable educational games.\"\n\"On the nature of fires and how to spark them when you're not there.\" \n\"CodeSpells: embodying the metaphor of wizardry for programming.\"\n\"Codespells: how to design quests to teach java concepts.\"\nWord soon got out about this game that attempted to teach young students how to program. CodeSpells was featured in Wired, RockPaperShotgun, and UC San Diego news, after which it was picked up by bloggers across the internet. KPBS even filmed some local San Diego students trying out the game. \nAmidst all this, Sarah & Stephen teamed up with Lindsey to co-found a company (ThoughtSTEM) to educate local San Diego kids in coding through after-school programs, summer camps, and more. ThoughtSTEM soon expanded across San Diego into other cities in California and is now branching out into other states.\nThe ThoughtSTEM team always had bigger dreams for CodeSpells though. For this game to educate the most people possible, they knew CodeSpells needed a makeover. Everything from the look & feel, gameplay, and even the coding interface left something to be desired. They had a great concept, but they needed expert Game Designers & Coders to make the dream a reality.\nThat's where Adrian & Jason came in. Having worked in the game development industry for several years, they brought new vision & inspiration to the CodeSpells project. We're excited to turn this vision into a reality with your help!\n                                                                                                                      ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks inherent in a video game development project are self evident, but ThoughtSTEM has a history of following through on successful projects (including LearnToMod, a software that teaches kids to code in Minecraft), and we plan to do the same with CodeSpells. With Backer funding, we have an excellent team with the skills necessary to create a fun & exciting video game. In addition, ThoughtSTEM has been previously funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and we plan to apply for NSF grant funding again to further improve CodeSpells as a coding educational product. Therefore, CodeSpells development will not suddenly stop when development for the Kickstarter is completed. We'll be actively seeking NSF funding for our stretch goals which will extend CodeSpells gameplay for our Backers further.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "CodeSpells is Making a Comeback!", "update_content": "CodeSpells has been calling to us for a couple years now\u2026 The voice has only grown louder since COVID-19 hit American shores, locking us all away in our homes and giving us more time on our hands than we know what to do with.

Entirely curated by the community, Upcoming surfaced weird and wonderful events that usually fell under the radar of traditional event listings from newspapers and local weeklies.\nMost importantly, it surfaced what your friends were interested in attending. Upcoming was among the first generation of web apps to use the social network for anything beyond Friendster-like connections, helping to define Web 2.0.  \nUpcoming in 2007\nAfter the first year, my friends Gordon Luk and Leonard Lin joined me as co-founders to help expand it. As Upcoming took off, we decided to sell it to Yahoo in 2005, hoping they could provide the resources to help it thrive.\nUnfortunately, things didn't go according to plan and it quickly fell into disrepair after we left in 2007. Last year, Yahoo shut it down with little notice and no way to back up events. Fortunately, through a herculean volunteer effort organized by Archive Team, the complete site was saved to the Internet Archive.\nFor the last year, the domain didn't even resolve. I thought that was the end of the story.\nThe Return\nLast month, I got an unexpected email from Yahoo out of the blue, offering to sell me back the original domain. I jumped at the chance, and am thrilled to announce I own Upcoming.org once again.\nSo, what now? \nLike many of the people that used it, I miss Upcoming. Nothing's come to replace it in the years since, and I have the same problems that motivated me to build it a decade ago\u2014I'm missing interesting events in my city and struggling to discover interesting events when I travel. I don't know what my friends are going to, and I lose track of the events I hear about on a regular basis.\nI want to bring back Upcoming, rebuilding it for the modern era using tools and platforms that weren't available at the time I started it. I started Upcoming long before Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, or OAuth.\nAnd I'd love to restore the original Upcoming events collected by Archive Team to a permanent archive, hosted at their original URLs. There's over 3.5TB of raw HTML, Javascript, and images in their data dump, which I plan to parse and release as structured data.\nThe Rewards\nLike my other Kickstarter projects, most of the rewards are exclusive access to what I'm making\u2014in this case, early access to the Upcoming.org beta as I develop it, giving you first dibs at registering your username and helping guide the direction of the site. \nI'll keep a development blog exclusively for backers, keeping you up-to-date on my progress, and every backer gets a special badge on their profile, showing the world that you helped get Upcoming off the ground. \nYahoo graciously gave me permission to use the original logo for an exclusive print run of t-shirts, printed only for this Kickstarter project. Some samples are below, and I'll announce the final design before the Kickstarter project ends.\nMinimalist or retro reproduction? I can't decide.\nFor higher levels of patronage, adopt a city on Upcoming for you or your project, or a mega-classy site-wide dedication for the first full year after launch.\nIf we hit the goal, awesome. I'll use those funds to bring Upcoming back from the dead, covering the costs of the domain, infrastructure, and development time to build it independently again. \nAnd if not, that's okay too! I'd rather know now there wasn't enough interest than devote a big chunk of my life to working on it. \nWhy Kickstarter?\nTwo reasons:\nIndependence. With any other form of funding, I'd sacrifice creative or financial control over Upcoming. Taking investment would set it on a path towards an exit, which I don't have any intention of doing.\nAll-or-nothing. I don't want to begin building Upcoming unless there's interest in it, and this is a perfect way to gauge whether this is something you want to exist. If not, we all walk away.\nUndoubtedly, there will be cynics asking why they should invest in something without taking any equity. My answer to that is simple\u2014this isn't an investment. You're paying me to build something you want to exist; that's your return. If you don't want it to exist, don't back it! Yay!\nThe Promise\nMy goal is to build Upcoming into a self-sustaining, independent project that keeps to the ethics that made it great. An open API, an embrace of open standards, and a belief that your data belongs to you. And I won't sell it again.\nTen years ago, the community made Upcoming great. With your help, we can make it great again.\nThanks\nHuge thank you to Paul Searle for shooting the pitch video. It was filmed in Panic's lovely offices in downtown Portland, Oregon. The background music is Chris J. Hampton's \"So What\" from Kind of Bloop. (If you made it this far, backers can message me on Kickstarter for a free copy.)\nThanks to Chris Messina for capturing huge chunks of Upcoming's UI in his remarkable Flickr gallery of Design Patterns, where both homepage screenshots were borrowed from.\nThe photos in the video were, in order, from Scott Beale (Laughing Squid), Daniel Bogan, Ben Ward, Scott Beale (Laughing Squid), and Richard Eriksson. Photo of TBL by Rory Cellan. Thanks, everybody.\nThank you to Yahoo for taking the unprecedented founder-friendly move of offering Upcoming back to me. \nAnd a massive debt of gratitude to Leonard and Gordon. I love you guys.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have a long history building and releasing web apps on my own, including Upcoming.org, Playfic, and Supercut.org. But inevitably, things can go wrong and timelines can go awry. I try to minimize this risk by reducing dependencies and costs\u2014I have projects that I've run for over a decade with little support and zero budget. \n\nOne dependency I plan to use to make the site better are the APIs provided by Twitter and Foursquare for authentication, network graph, and placename database. Any of those services may choose to change their Terms of Service or disappear entirely, which could impact development time.\n\nThe biggest risk, to me, is that the success of a site like Upcoming hinges on network effects which may never materialize. Even if the project succeeds and the site launches according to plan, it's entirely plausible that enough people won't use it in your city to make it useful. I've thought deeply about that problem and how to solve it, but it's definitely a fundamental challenge and risk.\n\nAnd, of course, software always takes longer than you'd expect. My hope is to have a public beta by March 2015, but the scope may expand or change, dependent on countless variables, and timelines may shift.

Suddenly, his trusty DeHavilland Beaver loses power and crashes into the dense mountain forest below.\nStranded far from the closest human habitation -- lost, wounded, alone, and with wolves circling -- Mackenzie will have to quickly master basic wilderness survival skills if he's to last long enough to understand what he just witnessed, and how his world has just changed.\nAnd that's only the beginning. \nWelcome to The Long Dark, the inaugural title from Hinterland, a new independent game studio comprised of veteran developers from the triple-A game industry.\nThe Long Dark is a thoughtful, first-person survival simulation that emphasizes quiet exploration in a stark, yet hauntingly beautiful, post-disaster setting. The breathtakingly picturesque Pacific Northwest frames the backdrop for the drama of The Long Dark.\nAs Mackenzie, you will:\nRisk the daily hazards of wilderness survival in this deep simulation that tracks weather, time of day, temperature, food/water, energy use/consumption, and gear condition. Fight the elements to stay alive!\nExplore a beautiful but savage Northern Wilderness, searching for gear and supplies as you struggle to survive a dangerous wilderness setting where the weather can suddenly turn on you, and wildlife stalk you. The hunter becomes the hunted!\nFace morally challenging scenarios that push you to your limit. Will you risk your life for the common good, or live by the adage, \"every man for himself\"? How far will you go to survive?\nExperience a mature storyline, rich world, cast of memorable characters, and hours of narrative gameplay in the Survival Story mode with a riveting storyline that advances at your pace.\nEnjoy dozens of hours of Survival Sandbox gameplay where you fight to last as long as possible across a range of survival scenarios.\nWinter closes in. Only the strong are able to brave the elements to find life-saving supplies.\nEarly praise for The Long Dark... \n\u201cThe Long Dark caught my eye with intriguing visuals and a great premise, and as a fan of survival open-world games, I\u2019m eager to see what perspective Hinterland brings to the quiet apocalypse.\u201d \n- Chris Avellone, Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of Obsidian Entertainment, developers of Project Eternity, Fallout: New Vegas, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II \n\"No zombies, no robots, no mutant laser antelopes... I can't wait to experience The Long Dark's realistic, frozen, post-apocalyptic brutality!\" \n- Jason Kapalka, Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer of PopCap Games, Creator of Bejeweled\nBrilliant aurora undulate across the sky, at once a symbol of the power of nature, and a melancholy reminder of what we have lost.\nIn the \"post-digital\" world of The Long Dark, mysterious aurorae flash across the sky, destroying humanity's technological might in an instant. All the technology we take for granted, but depend on for our daily existence, suddenly gone.\nWhat happens in a world without technology? How do we communicate? Stay warm? Travel long distances? Make things? Feed ourselves? Protect ourselves? How do we continue to survive when everything we've built begins to fall apart?\nEvery location has the potential to hold life-saving supplies. Or grave danger.\nThis is the experience at the heart of The Long Dark. In a split second, we find ourselves face to face with the might of Mother Nature. We have been knocked several links down the food chain. It's difficult to find food and other resources. People become desperate. The roads are no longer safe.\nThis isn't the end of the world. But it's the end of the world as we know it.\nKnowledge is Power\nIn a world where communication is difficult and information about the world is not at your fingertips, Knowledge becomes a key resource. Learning about the world -- where the hazards are, the safe routes, supply caches, friendly camps -- is critical to your survival.\nKnowledge has a life-span. Track down resource caches and locate life-saving supplies before they are gone!\nThe world of The Long Dark can be a harsh and unforgiving place. There is no manual. Your success depends on getting out into the world and using the information you find there to survive.\nYou Won't Survive Alone\nEncountering other survivors can be a risky proposition, but this is not a game about shooting or thoughtless killing. Combat is rare, and highly lethal.\nWith Knowledge as a life-saving resource, you need to balance the potential value of what the survivor might know, vs. the threat they may represent. This is a game of careful exploration, where those who live by the gun, die by the gun -- or worse. \nThis is the world of ambiguity we are building with The Long Dark -- not a world of black and white heroes and villains, but rather, of saviours and survivors. The selfless and the selfish. People who will survive because they are strong, cunning, lucky, and most of all, pay close attention to what the world is telling them.\nGame Structure\nThe Long Dark's episodic story structure borrows from TV to deliver a well-paced narrative experience that is advanced by player action in the world. Similar to open-world games like Red Dead Redemption and Fallout 3, The Long Dark offers both a large open-world simulation space that encourages freeform gameplay, as well as a story-driven mission structure that draws players deeper into the fiction of the game and world. \nThis structure means that whether you have 15 minutes or 1.5 hours to play, you can jump in and make meaningful progress towards an in-game goal. \nPlease note that you are backing a FULL GAME with The Long Dark. We hope to continue expanding on this game with sequels. The episodic nature of the game's narrative refers to story structure, and not necessarily to the amount of content you're getting in the game, which we estimate to be 5-6 hours for single-player \"story mode\" and dozens of hours for sandbox \"survival mode\".\nThe Hinterland logo combines the fox, a symbol of cleverness and agility, with the Ouroboros, a symbol of eternal renewal.\nHinterland Studio Inc. is a new independent game studio headquartered on Vancouver Island, Canada, and helmed by a core team of veteran developers from the triple-A industry.\n Collectively, the Hinterland core team have shipped many beloved and award-winning games, including:\nNow, the team is embracing the spirit of independence to embark on this new creative challenge from the fringes of the established game industry. \nThe Hinterland core team is:\nIn addition to this impressive core team, Hinterland has partnered up with renowned composers Cris Velasco (www.monarchaudio.com) and Sascha Dikiciyan (www.sonicmayhem.com). Together, Cris and Sascha have scored dozens of games from huge triple-A franchises including Mass Effect, Borderlands, Starcraft, and God of War.\nFor more information about the Hinterland team, please visit the studio website.\nAdditional collaborators will be revealed over the course of our Kickstarter campaign!\nAlthough we're in the fortunate position to have been accepted for support by the Canada Media Fund's Experimental Stream, we still need your support. This program supports innovation in the Canadian video game, film, and television industries, and has allowed us to begin work on a prototype for The Long Dark. This funding has been enough to get us started, but no way is it enough to achieve our full ambition for The Long Dark.\nThe fact is, as an independent studio, we need to raise more money to make the game we want to make for you, and we want to do it in such a way that we can stay true to our creative values, retain our independence, and not \"sell out\" to the corporate world. \nYour financial support will not only help ensure we can help The Long Dark reach its full potential as a piece of ground-breaking entertainment, but that Hinterland can continue to be a viable studio in the future, so we can continue to push the envelope.\nIf you believe in us and would like to see The Long Dark achieve its full potential as an innovative experience, back us and become part of the Hinterland community.\nLet's make something great, together!\nNote: Early Access for Alpha and Beta is only guaranteed for the PC version.\nAll-Digital Tiers\nPhysical Goods Tiers\n  Reward Pics\n19\" x 13\" Poster\n19\" x 13\" Poster (Alternate)\nGame DVD in Hardcase\nT-shirt (choose from three available designs)\nParacord Survival Bracelet\n24\" x 36\" Movie Style Poster\n24 x 26\" Movie Style Poster (Alternate Version)\nLimited Edition Framed Print\nLimited Edition Framed Print (Alternate)\nHard Cover Coffee-Table Art Book\nTo add items onto your reward tier, please add up the total for all the Add-Ons you want and increase your pledge by that amount.

We hope to see you in the community forums! \nMore Love for The Long Dark!\n\"The Long Dark looks stupendous even in its conceptual stages.\"\n- Adam Paris, Indie Statik\n\"...(the Hinterland team) is absolutely riddled with triple-A veterans.\"\n- Philippa Warr, WiredUK\n\"I like the cool understatement of the title and premise, with the quiet authority of a classy novelist or filmmaker. That's what's wanted for an open-world narrative...not hyped neon signs pointing to the content, but an intriguing, mysterious, but immediately understandable world that I can explore, looking for meaning, choices, and self-expression. The art style has the same virtues... classy, thoughtful, expressive. This is the sort of experience I want to sit down at a table with, late on a winter's night, with a cup of coffee, hoping only to have scratched the surface before dawn comes peeking through the frosted window.\"\n- Ken Rolston, Director of Game Design at Turbine, Lead Designer of The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and over 30-year game design veteran.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking games is, by nature, a high-risk process, especially when you are trying to innovate \"outside the box\", with a small team and with limited resources. \n\nWe believe we're taking the right steps to mitigate the inherent risks, and also to ensure the money you pledge us is managed responsibly:\n\n1 - We're building on established technology, vs. \"rolling our own\". It's always tempting to develop your own shiny new technology, but we're a content-focused developer and the only technology we want to build is stuff we can't get off-the-shelf. As a result, we're building our entire technology pipeline around the Unity engine. \n\nUnity is an affordable technology platform for games, is being used by hundreds of independent developers like us, and is supported by a large community of developers who often make their content and technology enhancements available through the Asset Store. So far, we find Unity to be a powerful, flexible engine, and believe it will allow us to develop the game we need while minimizing the technology risk.\n\n2 - Core, distributed team. Rather than carry the risks of recruiting locally and having to face the disappointing hiring/firing cycle that feels like it's become endemic in the games industry, we're built around a \"core team\" model -- meaning, the game will be built by a dedicated, persistent core team of developers representing the key disciplines, and this core team will be supplemented, in a responsible way, by key freelancers as they are needed. This means we can be extremely flexible, have positive and fair collaborations with our freelance partners, and scale up and down in a sustainable, low-impact way. \n\nBeing distributed means we're building the game using modern technology and \"best practices\" dedicated to collaboration that doesn't require we relocate core team or freelancers to a physical location. We use a host of tools to recreate as much of the feeling of working in the same physical space as possible, but people can live where they want and don't have to relocate their families. They can do meaningful work with people they like, while also living where they want. Imagine that!\n\n3 - Responsible stretch goals. Despite the temptation to load up the list of stretch goals and use them as a carrot to drive fundraising, we've elected to take the approach that more money shouldn't add risk to the project. We've all seen examples of crowdfunded projects raise many multiples of their original target, only to be delayed indefinitely with not guaranteed increase in project quality. \n\nAs a result, our stretch goals are based on two things: 1) adding quality to areas of the game we are already developing (for example, more minutes of music in the soundtrack, or more lines of voiced dialogue, more polish time for things like User Interface and controls), vs. adding more features or significantly more game content. 2) adding to the overall experience of The Long Dark with supporting materials that enrich the game experience but do not directly affect scope or features (for example, creating a series of motion graphic novels that provide background fiction for key characters). \n\nWith this philosophy around stretch goals, we believe we can add a lot of value and quality to the experience of The Long Dark, and still get the game you're backing here to you on time and in the form you expect. We believe that when you choose to back a game, you're backing the game as it's being pitched, and not the game it might become if it achieved many times its original target. We hope you agree with this approach and appreciate what we're trying to do.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #77", "update_userinfo": "March 2021 Developer Diary", "update_content": "Dear community,\nIt\u2019s time for an update on Episode Four progress, which I\u2019m sure is the topic at the top of all your minds right now.\nEpisode Four Progress"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #76", "update_userinfo": "HESITANT PROSPECT Update Now Live", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #75", "update_userinfo": "ESCAPE THE DARKWALKER Now Live", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #74", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary \u2013 October 2020", "update_content": "Hello everyone,\nWith the Switch launch behind us, I wanted to update you on our activities around THE LONG DARK for the remainder of this year.\nNEW EVENT: ESCAPE THE DARKWALKER (October 29th - November 12th)"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #73", "update_userinfo": "TRUE SURVIVAL COMES TO NINTENDO SWITCH", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #72", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary \u2013 August 2020", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #71", "update_userinfo": "Will You Survive WINTER\u2019S EMBRACE?", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #70", "update_userinfo": "The Long Dark Dev Diary \u2013 May 2020", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #69", "update_userinfo": "Social Distancing Fundraiser!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #68", "update_userinfo": "The Long Dark Updated - ERRANT PILGRIM [1.64]", "update_content": ""}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 1663, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hinterlandgames/the-long-dark-a-first-person-post-disaster-surviva", "project_name": "THE LONG DARK, a first-person post-disaster survival sim"}}, {"backer": "Daniel Bogan", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Missed the Kickstarter?\nVisit www.slimfoldwallet.com to order.\nBack in high school, I got a credit card sleeve from the bank. I would always take the credit card sleeve out of my wallet, remove my credit card to use it, then return the card to the sleeve and the sleeve to the wallet. The sleeve itself was made of a material that was so thin and so strong that it outlasted several wallets. So I wondered\u2026why not just make a wallet out of the stuff the sleeve is made of?\nTyvek\u00ae is a product of USA and is technically a sheet plastic (HDPE):\nUsed in mailing envelopes and house wrap for its strength to weight ratio\n100% Waterproof\n25% Post-consumer recycled content\n100% Recyclable\nYears later when trying to create my own thin wallet, I returned to Tyvek.

Although I'm an interaction designer now, my original training is in Industrial Design and I've gone through the phases of making a similar product with the creation of the Original and V2 versions of the SlimFold. I've still done tons of prototyping to arrive at the finalized design and be confident enough in it to be eager to get it into your hands.\n\nProduction\nWhile I'll be using the same vendors to produce the MICRO as I've used for the Original SlimFold, there are always risks with relying on any outside suppliers. In the past they have all proven extremely reliable. Having worked with them, I have a good idea of quantities and schedules and will promptly communicate any issues should they arise.\n\nShipping\nI have a fulfillment house in place that I've been using for over a year to ship both domestically and internationally. I know first-hand how overwhelming it can be getting a huge backlog of orders and having to prepare and send all the packages myself.

Go here to see the first of the tumblr art updates! \nSymbiosis is a Creative Commons licensed, world-building art book by comic and concept artist Steven Sanders. It explores a world where there are no mechanical sources of power. Instead, humanity has learned to utilize biological engines that harness a \"bio-ether\" present on the planet. They can control and feel what these bio-engines feel via a \"Resonance Tooth.\" Consider it 1940s era bio-punk.\nThe Creative Commons licensing turns this book into a world-building toolkit that you can use to make your own RPGs, comics, cosplay, novels, or anything you can imagine that is inspired by the world in this book. \nIt's the first book of its kind.\n\nUPDATE 3/15: WE JUST FUNDED!\nHere's a couple stand-in stretch goals until I hear back from the printer:\nThe major one: \n75K If we can bring in pledges hand over fist, I'll bump the page count back up to my original planned count of 200 pages for the book!\nClosest one:\n60K  Free Symbiosis \"PRO SPAGYRICO, YLIASTER\" stickers with every physical order. 300DPi digital file with every digital order.  I'll leave the fun of learning up to the reader to translate the latin.\nI've had the pleasure of a number of people I am proud to call my friends and peers lending their support for this book.\nJason Aaron (THOR, WOLVERINE & THE X-MEN, SCALPED ): \"This is a whole book of pure, unadulterated Steven Sanders imagination -- for me, that's the part I'm excited about. I will for sure be buying my copy of Symbiosis.\"\nBlair Butler (Host, ATTACK OF THE SHOW, MSN, Writer, Heart ):  \"The guy is ridiculously talented, the project is ridiculously ambitious -- go ahead and donate!

My long-dead eyes are filled with anticipation and excitement.\"\nTHE BOOK\nOne thing that I have heard repeatedly from writers I've worked with is that my artwork is evocative. It makes them want to tell stories. I've spent a lot of time in the fan-bases of various genres, and feel that inside of every consumer is a creator. The fans are just as much a part of the process of story-building as the creators are. At its core, that is what this book is about: you becoming my co-creator. Symbiosis is a world-building art book that tells the story of a woman's travels through a world where the symbiotic relationship that we have with technology is made much more visceral. All sources of power are generated by bio-etheric engines, with which the operators share a direct mental link. The story-telling is loose and mostly visual. It will be told with art that uses a variety of media and formats: fully painted, colored line art, black-and-white line art, and comic art.\nWhat you do with this story is up to you. Enjoy it on its own merits, or take it and spin it off into any of a million different directions.\nThe world-building in Symbiosis will encompass ethnic and political groups, ecology, biology, physics, mechanics/power transmission, trade, agriculture, war, religion, medicine...anything and everything I can fit in these 100+ pages. Katherine Aeneas will be your guide through this world. Something like a Virgil to your Dante, albeit on a journey through a much more pleasant world.\nThe book will be 100+ pages and is being sold in two formats. One is an e-book that is in both PDF and CBR format, in web and HD tablet resolution. The other is an 11x17 high-end hardcover, with a clamshell box, gold foil logo on the box front and spine, a debossed logo on the book cover, and tipped-in vellum sheets for informational overlays in various parts of the book. The binding is Smyth sewn. If you want to know why Smyth sewn binding is so critical to a quality book, click here. The hardcover is an ode to old books that I love and grew up with, and now collect. I researched how they were made, how and why they last, and I am duplicating these books as much as I can while still making it affordable.\nFor collectors: The limitation page (where the number out of the total print run the book is, and where my signature goes) is sewn into the book along with the rest of the pages. There are no pasted elements to this book, just the tipped-in/edge glued vellum sheets, which is standard procedure for pages of different materials, which due to placement, cannot be sewn into the book.  If you are a collector with any other questions, feel free to contact me with questions.\nMock-up of foil-stamped Symbiosis clamshell box.\nMock-up of Symbiosis book with debossed logo, in clamshell box.\nSymbiosis frontispiece - Click for more detail.\nSample pages:\n(See more artwork on the Facebook page!)\nThe only hardcovers printed will be the ones made through this Kickstarter. The signed and numbered edition produced here will be it. For those who care about such things, books of this sort tend to increase in value rapidly, frequently doubling or tripling in value in a matter of months.\nThe e-book is based around how I think digital media should be handled. (Cheaply, without copy-protection, and in as many formats as possible.) In a sense, it will be an experiment to see if these ideas hold any weight in the market.\nCREATIVE COMMONS\nSymbiosis is about encouraging creativity. The Creative Commons licensing* will allow people to take this world, where I have done the artistic and conceptual heavy lifting, and use it however they'd like. It's about taking this book, being inspired, and HAVING FUN. Play tabletop RPGs? Use your RPG engine of choice (like Fate Core) to make a Symbiosis RPG. Are you a 3D modeler? Use the designs. Make comics? Write? Cosplay? This is your toolkit. Take what I'm making, build on it, play with it, impress us all with what you can do. There's so much talent out there, and I cannot wait to see this world through your eyes.\nREWARDS\n\nPROP-ARTIFACTS\nHandmade prop-artifacts make up another aspect of Symbiosis. While these are rewards/incentives, they are also there to help seed the creation by you of more artifacts from the world of Symbiosis.\nBEZRODNYM FIRST AID/SURVIVAL KIT from decommissioned Bezrodnym hardened carrier-frigate.

I'm Steven Sanders. I share a name with a \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" character, but we don't seem to have anything else in common. Unless being really cool counts. I'm really cool.\nI have over a decade of professional experience in the illustration field. My work has appeared in the distinguished SPECTRUM anthology, and I've drawn a number of comics for Marvel and Image (WOLVERINE AND THE X-MEN, WOLVERINE, DEADPOOL TEAM-UP, S.W.O.R.D., FIVE FISTS OF SCIENCE, OUR LOVE IS REAL). I've produced advertising and video game illustration for a number of large companies. In 2007 I made the first comic book in the western hemisphere made for cellphones.\nI'm an engineer who realized he wasn't good at math and decided to fall back on art. I read copious amounts of literature on medicine, engineering, biology, neurochemistry, foundry and machine shop work, radio theory, aeronautics and rocketry, philosophy, esoteric magical traditions, world history... anything I can get my hands on. Symbiosis sprang from thinking about our relationship with technology; the way that technology can be seen as a living organism unto itself, and how that shapes the world we live in.\nI use all of this to inform my work and make it as real (or real-seeming) as possible. Concept art and world-building lets me be the engineer I never was; it lets me build the impossible (or improbable) without all the \"math\" and \"physical laws of nature\" that are so pesky and crucial to actual engineers. It's playing in the pool of the aesthetics of technology, science and other trappings of human civilization.\nFIN\nIf you've made it this far, congrats!

There may be production problems with the book or props, but if there are delays, you will be told of them, and I will get these products to you. \n\nProp-artifacts: \nSince I have never made props on a large scale before, my estimates may be off regarding delivery time. I don't anticipate any problems, as I've done several dry runs, and have padded the delivery date out a bit, but if there are any delays, they will be promptly communicated. \n\nThere is also a possibility for international orders of the First Aid kit that your local customs may think I'm sending you drugs or a bomb or something, (There are no hazardous materials in the kit, but someone overzealous might think I'm sending some kind of crystalline drug) so I'm afraid I cannot be held responsible if the prop shows up rummaged through by your local customs officials. I think, though, that this risk is fairly small. \n\nI may be hit by a car or something and die. If possible I'll see what I can do from beyond the grave. \n\nKeeping promises: \nThere will definitely not be any hardcovers beyond what is made for this Kickstarter.

The islands are made of voxels, cubes made of various elements, which means you can dig, carve and build anything you can imagine in the landscape. Digging underground to gather resources, stacking bricks on top of each other to build a wall or even tunnelling through a mountain is all possible and even necessary to keep your Bricktrons safe.\nCarefully designing your castle not only requires creativity and imagination, but thanks to pathfinding AI and physics simulations, Castle Story has layers of strategy and depth on top of an otherwise free-form sandbox experience.\nCastle Story will be released for Windows & Mac (with possible Linux support once Unity4 is released).\nBuild any structure you can imagine! Using 2x1 blocks, create structures that are not only good-looking, but also functional. Your Bricktrons need to be able to navigate your castle to build it and to keep the monsters out! \nPhysics! Watch a tower crumble to the ground realistically when its foundations can no longer support it. The entire world obeys to the laws of physics which means that you need to build cleverly so your castle can withstand attacks from projectiles and explosives.\nSandbox! Build a huge sprawling fortress, a single impenetrable bunker or a network of underground tunnels. The choice is yours. Castle Story rewards imagination and ingenuity.\nStrategy! Command your Bricktrons as they build your castle brick by brick. Manage the way they work, what resources they gather, and the places they explore. Use your resources to build weapons and armor for your Bricktrons and all kinds of upgrades for your castle.\nCombat! Using shields, swords, bows and lots more, your Bricktrons can defend themselves against the hostile creatures inhabiting the world of Castle Story. Lead your Bricktrons through tough fights, and use your wits to gain an advantage. You can even build catapults to rain destruction on your foes!\nMagic! The world of Castle Story is permeated with all kinds of magic. Discover resources with magical auras and learn to mix them to create effects. Explore strange places and find mysterious artifacts left behind by unknown civilizations.\n\nWe've been working on Castle Story in our free time ever since we graduated from game design studies two years ago. We posted a video demo of our game on Youtube last January and received a flood of good comments and an amazing reception on the Internet. So we decided to quit our jobs and work on the game full-time. \nUntil recently we\u2019ve been working heavily on creating the engine for the game. While most of what is in the trailer and demo video currently exists, it needs to be refined and organized into a cohesive whole. In other words, we have a prototype, but we want to turn this in a complete game. \nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter to be able to fund the next stage of development for Castle Story, so we can build the single player and multiplayer modes. We\u2019ll use the money for:\nSoftware Licenses : As a startup studio, we are missing several tools to help us get the job done. Software is expensive and the costs add up quickly.\nHosting : Our website currently isn't capable of hosting large amounts of traffic. Bandwidth and maintenance for our website and forums as well as a server to handle traffic will be essential.\nMultiplayer : We've never done a multiplayer game of this scope before, so it's going to take a lot of time and effort to learn the ropes and get it right. \nMusic & Audio : We hired two musicians to compose the music for the trailer and the results were pretty amazing. We would like to hire them back again to compose a full fledged soundtrack for the game. We would also hire a professional SFX artist to make the soundscape just as good as the visuals.\nSurviving : Paying rent for food and basically sustain the basic needs of three full time developers for a full year.\nPolish : If we reach our goal, anything past that will be put back directly into making the game more polished.\nThe game has already come pretty far in the last months. Here's what it looked like only 6 months ago, before we quit our jobs:\nKickstarter is great because it allows us to have a direct relationship with you. Instead of having publishers interfere with the game development, you can contribute to the decision process so we can take the game into interesting directions. That's one of the great advantages of \"independent\" game development.\nGetting your name in the game:\nHere is a video attempting to explain what we plan on doing with the names of our backers:\nThe Beta:\nEveryone who contributes to the Kickstarter (enough to qualify for the first reward) gets an early version of the game and has access to any updates that come further down the road. The Beta will become the final game eventually so anybody who backed the Kickstarter with the minimum amount of 15$ gets the final game.\nThe Prototype:\nGet access to an alpha build of the game soon after the Kickstarter is over. The prototype represents what we've shown so far that works. The amount of content and the replay value will be limited, and the build will probably be slightly broken. But we want people to test this version and give us feedback so we can make the Beta better.\nTShirts:\nWe've designed a few t-shirts for you to choose from. Once the Kickstarter is over, we will contact you to see what t-shirt you would like and what size.\nPosters:\nDuring the 30 days that the Kickstarter is going to run. We are going to post several timelapses of the painting process behind our two posters. Afterwards, we are going to print limited-edition high quality prints for the backers who signed up for the posters.\nHere's a preview of the posters. Keep in mind that those are only sketches. The real posters will be painted during the Kickstarter.\nThe Bricktron Plushie:\nThis hand-crafted plushie is made by one of our friend, a professional seamstress and fashion designer. Each plushie will be made one at a time, so every one will be unique. If you want, you can choose a name for it, or we can choose for you, and we'll sew the name on the plushie.\nWe call this one Randy:\nMore coming soon...\nWe're pretty busy working on the prototype. But once we see what kind of response we get, we have a few extra rewards that we would like to offer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #118", "update_userinfo": "Castle Story Merch Store!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #117", "update_userinfo": "The Frosty Resort - Building Challenge RESULTS!", "update_content": "Hello Kickstarter friends!\nThe results for the Building Challenge are in!

I\u2019m John Kricfalusi (creator of Ren and Stimpy). I have a new cartoon I need your help in producing. It stars one of the original Ren and Stimpy characters, Mr. George Liquor, AMERICAN! You loved him in Dog Show and Man's Best Friend. Now bring him to life in CANS WITHOUT LABELS!\nGeorge is an old school, manly, Republican sort of guy. He thinks today\u2019s Republicans are wimps. He\u2019s leathery on the outside but all mush in the center, at least with his dear ones. He believes in \u201ctough love\u201d and lives his life according to the rules. \u201cIt\u2019s Discipline that begets love!\u201d\nHOW DID I COME UP WITH THIS PREPOSTEROUS STORY?\nIT REALLY HAPPENED - THAT'S HOW! George is largely inspired by my own manly Dad.\nDad believes in the old values: hard work, rules and most important of all \u2013 SAVING A BUCK! Wasting money is a sin against Almighty Bejeezus. Hang on to every last penny and put it away for a rainy day, or face the consequences!\nLike my Dad, George craves a bargain. He'll not pay sticker price for anything. He ONLY buys stuff on sale and refuses to buy any brand name products.\nBrand Names are a Commie Scam!\nDad didn't allow us to drink Coca Cola on principle - maybe because it tasted too good for the price. \"Tasting good is an advertising gimmick!\" Instead he would buy generic supermarket brands like \u201cLoblaws - cola\u2013like drinkable substance\u201d which tasted like motor oil and had no fizz: \u201cYou know what fizz goes for these days?!\u201d  \nWe had \u201cCatsup\u201d instead of Heinz\u2019 Ketchup. He\u2019d buy a 6 year\u2019s supply of red paste in huge crusty bottles for a 10th of what the regular sized brand name cost.\nOf course we couldn\u2019t have KLEENEX so we blew our noses in our poodle\u2019s clipped torso fur. NOTHING was wasted at the Kricfalusi home \u2013 at least not while Dad was watching. \nNo Labels at all\nAs much as Dad loves his generic brand labels, there are products he loves even better \u2013 products with no label at all!\nOur local supermarket \u2013 LOBLAWS again, used to sell damaged can goods on the bottom shelf at the back of the store. They would tear the labels off the cans and discount them. Then they\u2019d take a marker and write 5 or 10 cents on them. These super cheap mystery cans brought Dad to the heights of ecstasy.\nHe'd grab a cart and mow down all the old ladies who were trying to get at the cans and he\u2019d snatch up every can on the shelf. He loved these cans without labels so much he built his own wooden shelves in the basement to honor his collection of tin treasures.\nHe nailed two-by-fours right into the concrete with his fists. \u201cDo you know how much HAMMERS go for these days?!\u201d  My whole family was terrified by the shelf of naked cans. Mom refused to eat any of them. She was the only one in the family who was allowed to have brand name products.\nWe always knew when Dad was going to feed us one of these mystery cans cause we\u2019d hear him downstairs sliding the cans around the rough wood and concrete and chuckling to himself.\nAs he stomped upstairs with an armload of cans, we\u2019d try to escape, but he\u2019d locked all the doors and windows. Trapped!\nHe'd dump the cans onto the kitchen table, call everyone in for lunch and we\u2019d drag ourselves to our fate.\nHe always swore there would be something really tasty in a can and thought he could deduce what was it was using the scientific method. He\u2019d count the rings and look at whether the lid was silver or gold and then conclude...\n\u201cI think there are some nice peaches in this can!\u201d .\nLet me tell you something\u2026  There were NEVER any Goddamn peaches in these things. It was always something gruesome \u2013 like a whole plucked chicken carcass with staples in its ear holes; its limp stubbly skin hanging off mummified crumbling bones.\nOne time he opened up a can of pickled kittens.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if he guessed wrong about the contents of a can because he believed in not wasting anything the Lord has blessed us with.\n\u201cHERE\u2019S THE RULE \u2013 ONCE WE OPEN THE CAN \u2013 WE HAVE TO EAT WHATEVER\u2019S IN IT!\u201d\nWe\u2019d scream and try to crawl out the windows but he\u2019d wrestle us to the ground and force us to eat the pickled pets. We couldn\u2019t waste food at our house, because otherwise\u2026 \u201cDO YOU KNOW HOW MANY STARVING BIAFRAN KIDS WOULD KILL FOR A NICE PIECE OF KITTEN LIKE THIS?\u201d\nAnd thus...\nIn this cartoon, George introduces his innocent little nephews Slab N Ernie to his collection of Cans Without Labels.\nThere will be a special appearance of Spumco favorite CIGARETTES THE CAT and also a cameo from another beloved cartoon character.\nTHE CREATIVE TEAM\nGeorge Liquor is voiced by the great Mike Pataki, who, sadly, passed away last year. This is one of his last recordings for me.\nThe storyboard and layouts were drawn by hand by me and fellow Spumco Bigshot Jim Smith. \nEddie Fitzgerald of \u201cUncle Eddie\u201d fame is the voice of Cigarettes the Cat.\nEric Bauza is Slab. Gabe Swarr is Ernie.\nI am also employing my latest young talents who helped me with the Bobby Bigloaf cartoon, The Simpsons Couch Gag and Cartoon Network IDs: John Kedzie and Sarah Harkey\nIf you help me make the cartoon I will train some new cartoonists and animators as well and the world of animation will be that much richer.\n    EDIT: For international shipping refer to the following:\nFor the $30 and $50 pledges please add $5\nFor the $300 and $500 pledges please add $10\nFor the $1,000 pledge please add $15\nFor the $100 and $3,000 pledges please add $20\n\nEDIT: There is now a $1 reward so ALL of you fine folks will get a digital copy of the cartoon!\n    Be the first in your neighborhood to own one of my new digital toys.

I will personally do a caricature of you and animate you into the credits of the cartoon and thank you for being the philanthropic high-roller that you are! Maybe George will even pull your pants down.\nWhere Is Your Money Going?\nWe still need to animate, clean up, inbetween and color the cartoon. We will paint the backgrounds and build a cg set and some props. Then we need to pay for music, sound effects and final editing.  The whole process will take about 7 months.  It will be 8-10 minutes long, which is about the same length as a Ren and Stimpy episode, but for HALF the price!\nWe will also make DVDs and produce the prizes to ship out to all you swell folks who backed the project! \nThis is your chance to be your own Hollywood Cartoon executive and produce a Spumco-type cartoon the way you like it!\nThanks in advance for bringing the future of cartoon-making into the world of now!\nYour best friend,\nJohn Kricfalusi\nP.S.\nDon't for get to check this out!\nmusic courtesy of www.apmmusic.com\nHere's me showing how we ink our cartoons using Toonboom's \"Animate\" program.

All the details are on the official XOXO site.\nHey Kickstarter! We're organizing XOXO, an arts and technology festival in Portland, Oregon this September 13-16th.\nXOXO is a celebration of disruptive creativity. We want to take all the independent artists using the Internet to make a living doing what they love \u2014 the makers, craftspeople, musicians, filmmakers, comic book artists, game designers, hardware hackers \u2014 and bring them together with the technologists building the platforms that make it possible.

A series of unique events around the city, including live music, film screenings, indie videogames, and craft beer and coffee tastings.\nPortland's the perfect place for XOXO \u2014 it's the most independent and DIY-friendly cities in the world, which runs through every part of its culture. It's no wonder that Portland's one of the biggest cities on creative platforms like Kickstarter and Etsy. This is a great way to experience the best of Portland under one roof.\nConference\nOn the top floor of XOXO, we're building a stage to host a single-track of talks from people we love who are changing the world. \nConfirmed speakers include the leaders of amazingly creative communities like Etsy, Kickstarter, Canvas and Metafilter, the fiercely independent creators behind World of Goo, MakerBot, Indie Game: The Movie, Star Wars Uncut, Diesel Sweeties and Black Apple, and industry-changing startups like The Atavist, Simple, CASH Music, and VHX.tv.\nThe full lineup's still evolving, and we'll announce additions and changes as they happen.

We're still reaching out to creators and making the schedule, and we'll announce the festival's project lineup and food carts as we have them.\nFringe\nWe\u2019re taking the ideas behind the conference and building a fringe program around it, teaming up with local partners to take over venues around the city for a series of unique events, including lectures, workshops, hackspace, live music, film screenings, indie videogames, a craft beer festival, meetups and parties.\nThis is a perfect opportunity to experience the best that Portland has to offer, to explore the city and interact with its rich maker culture with other like-minded attendees. We\u2019re deep into fringe event planning, and will announce updates as the schedule comes together.\nVenue\nWe're holding the event at the YU Contemporary in the historic Yale Union Laundry Building in SE Portland, a cavernous two-story brick building within easy walking distance to some of the best restaurants, microbreweries, coffeehouses, and bars in town.\nRewards\nFor rewards, we're offering a few options:\nConference passes. These are limited to the seating upstairs, and may not last long. Backers at this level also get an XOXO shirt and early access to the talk videos.\nThe DIY Kit. Can't make it to Portland? We'll send a little bit of XOXO to you.

Backers receive early exclusive access to each of our talk videos as they go online. \nWe're working with Portland\u2019s own Factory North on the XOXO identity, including an exclusive t-shirt design for everyone who attends the conference or backs the DIY Kit.

The long-awaited XOXO talk videos are done, all the footage from the two-day conference portion of XOXO, totaling seven straight hours from 24 awesome people telling their stories. We just emailed the passwords out to everyone who backed this project at the $25 level and up, and the info should be sitting in your inbox right now. (If you haven't received it, get in touch and we'll sort you out ASAP.) To get a sense of the video quality, here's my from the first day.

Like whales, Portland food carts gather in \u201cpods,\u201d averaging 5-8 but with the largest hosting more than 60 carts. If you\u2019re coming from a city like NYC, LA or SF, you might think food trucks are the same thing, but there are some big differences \u2014 while food trucks need to stay on the move, Portland\u2019s food carts are effectively permanent.\nThe benefit is that they can build word-of-mouth at a fixed location, and each cart pods develops its own unique community and vibe. For example, the 10th and Alder carts are a shantytown of international food sprawling across two city blocks, while the D-Street Noshery has intimate live performances and the city\u2019s first cart serving craft beer on draft."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Important: Last Chance to Register or Transfer Your XOXO Pass", "update_content": "We're one week from the start of XOXO, and we're getting ready to send out all your badges to the printers.

Let's keep the number increasing and really knock it out of the ballpark. I have been having a blast reading the messages of excitement from the RPG players who feel neglected over the years.\nWe wanted to have a little fun and make another comical video so I hope you enjoy it. The next video I put up will also be more informative as I will answer some of the more common questions from the forums.

Give me Wasteland 2 already.\" - Chris Avellone - RPG designer extraordinaire\n\"Brian was one of the pioneers for the computer RPG with games like Bard's Tale and Wasteland.  I would be very excited to see what Brian could achieve with a sequel to such a classic like the first Wasteland.\"         - Rob Pardo - ExecutiveVice President of Game Design, Blizzard Entertainment\n\"WASTELAND is the game that made me a gamer.  It's still my favourite game of all time, simply because of how influential and mind-blowing it was at the time.\" - Rock Paper Shotgun reader Zerosociety\n\"Shut up and take my money!\" - Eurogamer reader Arcam (amongst many others)\nWasteland 2 is the direct sequel to the first ever post-apocalyptic computer RPG. The original Wasteland was the inspiration for the FALLOUT series of games, and the first RPG to allow players to split parties for tactical considerations, to face players with moral choices, and to make them deal with the consequences of their actions. It was the first to provide far more than the one-key-for-one-lock style of puzzle solving. It was groundbreaking, which is why IGN named it one of the top 25 PC games of all time, Computer Gaming World named it the Adventure Game of the year in 1988, and it was short-listed for inclusion in the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s current \u201cArt of the Computer Game\u201d exhibition.\nWasteland was set in a dangerous, post-apocalyptic world in the American Southwest. Over the course of adventures rangers would receive promotions, acquire new skills and equipment, then face new challenges with outcomes that changed depending on the strategy used to defeat them. The game featured a strong storyline which required painful decisions by players; and a storyline that allowed for maximum re-playability. Wasteland 2, with your participation and insights, will recapture all that and provide more.  It'll finally be the game worthy to be a Wasteland sequel, as challenging and rewarding as the original, with all added capacity and dazzle of games today.\nFor Wasteland 2, we\u2019re getting the band back together again!. Brian Fargo who Executive Produced both Wasteland and Fallout will be heading the team. Alan Pavlish and Mike Stackpole\u2014the original game\u2019s primary designers\u2014are coming back to put the project together, and we\u2019re rounding up as many of the other designers, like Ken St. Andre, as we can. On top of that, we\u2019ll have music by Mark Morgan of Fallout 1 and 2 fame. The storyline for Wasteland 2 was written by Jason Anderson who was the co-creator of Fallout. We have also enlisted the help of the amazing concept artist, Andree Wallin to help craft the Wasteland 2 world.\nA sample of Andree's other work can be seen below.\nBrian Fargo founded Interplay Productions (By Gamers, For Gamers) in 1983 where he went on to produce and finance some of the biggest RPG's made like Bard's Tale, Fallout 1 and 2, Stonekeep, Dragon Wars, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and more. Creating a new Wasteland will be a point of pride in the long history of games.\nNot a month goes by when an email doesn\u2019t come in asking if we\u2019ve ever considered doing a sequel. Emails from gamers who remember Wasteland fondly and want, just as badly as we do, to return to that gritty world where burning through clips might be the only thing that keeps you alive; and where running out of ammo will certainly get you killed. The fact that you, the folks who know and love and play games, keep asking for Wasteland 2 told us that there is a demand for it.\n\nSo, we\u2019re coming to you for support.\n\nFinancial.\n\nAnd creative.\n\nAfter all, since you\u2019re the driving force behind this game, we want to make sure that we\u2019ll be delivering the game you want. Wasteland is ready for a sequel, and with your help, it\u2019s going to happen. As for why you should want to participate, we\u2019ll let Kotaku point out why making Wasteland 2 happen is very important:  FanFundWasteland!\nWith your collective vision, the game that was the godfather to the popular Fallout series will become a reality.  Not only will you fund the development, but you\u2019ll have a voice in how the game goes together. We will have forums up for design discussion and soliciting your ideas for what will make Wasteland 2 rock.\nThis is your chance to influence the kind of game you want to see. With fan funding, you drive the direction of game design and development. If it is important to you, it is important to us. \nThis is probably the last chance for a Wasteland sequel.  We have tried to pitch this game multiple times to game publishers, but they\u2019ve balked. They don\u2019t think there\u2019s any interest in a solid, old school type of game.  This is our shot at proving them wrong. And more importantly this could help bring back an entire genre of RPGs. The power of the Indie scene continues and we see this as all part of a bigger trend of bringing control back to the developers.\nSupporting Wasteland 2 is nothing more radical than pre-ordering a game from your favorite brick-and-mortar store. We believe strongly enough in this project and in your desire to see it become a reality, that we decided to go ahead with this Kickstarter drive to fund it.\nNuts and bolts time.\nWe\u2019re going back to the original and building from there. No first person shooter, we\u2019re going top down so you get a tactical feel for the situation. And we\u2019re not ditching the party play to turn it into some hack-and-slash bloodfest. It\u2019s turn based, tactical, with a storyline that will be deeper and broader.\nWe\u2019re determined to keep the gritty, grim and satirical writing. We\u2019re going to pitch those moral dilemmas at you. You\u2019re going to be faced with the consequences of your actions.\nWe\u2019re planning on an initial 6 months of pre-production. We\u2019ll nail down every important element that you, our creative partners, want.  Once we have all that figured out, we buckle down for 12 month development cycle. During that time, players can get a sneak peek on a private closed beta through Steam.  In addition, we will be giving you constant updates and showing you our progress along the way.\nTo do this game right, we need to raise $1 million, but you'll notice our funding request is $900,000 and that is because Brian Fargo has offered to fund the last $100,000 if need be. That\u2019s a lot of money needed, but not when compared with the budgets of most full scale RPGs made today. The original game sold over 100,000 copies\u2014on the Apple ][ and Commodore 64 platforms back in the day. If everyone who played it then backs the project at the most basic level, the game is on.\n\nBut we\u2019re looking ahead to what we can do if you all back this project in force. At $1.25 million, the money will go primarily into making the world bigger, adding more maps, more divergent stories and even more music. \n\nAt $1.5 million, the world gets even bigger. You\u2019ll have more adventures to play, more challenges to deal with, and a greater level of complexity to the entire storyline.  We\u2019ll add more environments, story elements, and characters to make the rich world come alive even more.  We will even be able to bring Wasteland 2 to OS X and Linux! And after $1.5 million the sky is the limit.\nEveryone on the team is incredibly excited about the possibilities this Kickstarter will unlock. Like you, we\u2019ve long dreamed of being able to bring Wasteland back.  If you share that dream, if you\u2019ve always wanted to watch and influence the game design process from start to finish, this is your chance. If you\u2019ve wanted to change the world and get the games you really deserve, then do it by funding this Kickstarter.  The road to Wasteland 2 is there. \nJoin us on what\u2019s going to be a wild ride.\n***A big thank you to our (already) loyal forum users for their help in crafting the Kickstarter rewards.

Additional money means it can appear on more platforms, be translated into more languages, have more music and voice, and an original soundtrack for the documentary, and more!  We're still working to figure out exactly what we can offer, but we'll post more information as soon as possible.\nYour backing and comments have been truly inspiring to me and the team, so on behalf of Double Fine and 2 Player Productions I want to say THANK YOU!!!\nI can't wait to see where this thing can go!\nWelcome to the Adventure\nThe world of video game design is a mysterious one.  What really happens behind the closed doors of a development studio is often unknown, unappreciated, or misunderstood.  And the bigger the studio, the more tightly shut its door tends to be.  With this project, we're taking that door off its hinges and inviting you into the world of Double Fine Productions, the first major studio to fully finance their next game with a Kickstarter campaign and develop it in the public eye.\nDouble Fine Productions\nFounded in 2000 by industry veteran Tim Schafer (Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango), the San Francisco-based company has established itself as a unique creative force with critically-acclaimed titles such as Psychonauts, Brutal Legend, Costume Quest, Stacking, Iron Brigade, Once Upon a Monster, and Double Fine Happy Action Theater.  This year, you'll be given a front-row seat as they revisit Tim's design roots and create a brand-new, downloadable \"Point-and-Click\" graphic adventure game for the modern age.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\n\nDouble Fine\u2019s XBLA/PSN/PC title \u201cStacking\u201d\nBig games cost big money.  Even something as \"simple\" as an Xbox LIVE Arcade title can cost upwards of two or three million dollars.  For disc-based games, it can be over ten times that amount.  To finance the production, promotion, and distribution of these massive undertakings, companies like Double Fine have to rely on external sources like publishers, investment firms, or loans.  And while they fulfill an important role in the process, their involvement also comes with significant strings attached that can pull the game in the wrong directions or even cancel its production altogether.  Thankfully, viable alternatives have emerged and gained momentum in recent years.\nCrowd-sourced fundraising sites like Kickstarter have been an incredible boon to the independent development community.  They democratize the process by allowing consumers to support the games they want to see developed and give the developers the freedom to experiment, take risks, and design without anyone else compromising their vision.  It's the kind of creative luxury that most major, established studios simply can't afford.  At least, not until now.\n\n\nTim negotiates publishing rights\n\nKeeping the scale of the project this small accomplishes two things.  First and foremost, Double Fine gets to make the game they want to make, promote it in whatever manner they deem appropriate, and release the finished product on their own terms.  Secondly, since they\u2019re only accountable to themselves, there\u2019s an unprecedented opportunity to show the public what game development of this caliber looks like from the inside.  Not the sanitized commercials-posing-as-interviews that marketing teams only value for their ability to boost sales, but an honest, in-depth insight into a modern art form that will both entertain and educate gamers and non-gamers alike.\n\nAbout the Project\nOver a six-to-eight month period, a small team under Tim Schafer's supervision will develop Double Fine's next game, a classic point-and-click adventure.  Where it goes from there will unfold in real time for all the backers to see.\nTim\u2019s Project Lead debut, point-and-click classic \u201cDay of the Tentacle\u201d (1993)\n2 Player Productions will be documenting the creative process and releasing monthly video updates exclusively to the Kickstarter backers. This documentary series will strive to make the viewer as much a part of the process as possible by showing a game grow from start to finish, with all the passion, humor, and heartbreak that happens along the way.  Double Fine is committed to total transparency with this project, ensuring it is one of the most honest depictions of game development ever conceived.\n\nThere will be a private online community set up for the backers to discuss the project with the devs and submit their thoughts and feelings about the game's content and direction, sometimes even voting on decisions when the dev team can't decide.  Backers will also have access to help test the game once a beta is available.  Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice.\nFor fans of adventure games, this is a chance to prove that there is still a large  demand out there for a unique medium that inspired so many of us.\nRewards\nThis whole experience is being offered for the flat backer contribution of $15.
