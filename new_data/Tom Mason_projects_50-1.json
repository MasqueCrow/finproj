Bond with them, keep them happy, and they'll love you in return.\n Meet Villagers and build lasting relationships. Some may even become party members that fight by your side.\n Explore the magical world of Emora. Throughout your journey you'll encounter giant mushroom caverns, enchanted woods, the nightmarish realm of a sleeping god and more.\n Cast powerful spells. Summon your own skelly minion to fight with you or protect yourself with an ethereal magic armor.\n Decorate and upgrade your home. Place items like chests for storing your loot, a kettle for cooking, or just a nice rug to spruce the place up a bit.\n A tyrannical god once ruled over It\u2019s creation in a reign of fear and oppression. One day the people rebelled and a group of mages banded together to seal It away. Although the scars from this era are still fresh, the people have started to move on and are finally beginning to prosper in a new age.\nBut It has begun to stir in Its sleep, and the veil between this world and an all too familiar nightmare is shredding into pieces as the Demon God's dream blends into reality.\nZoe and the Cursed Dreamer already has a reputation for lovable quirky characters. Here are just a few of the more important ones so far.\n Teddy: The lovable butcher with a secret. He was relentlessly bullied as a child for his love of baking, and became the town\u2019s butcher so that he would be seen as manly. He hates his job and aspires to be the town\u2019s baker, but he does his cooking in secret. You can help make his dream come true.\n Claire: Your childhood best friend. You haven\u2019t seen her since you left the village many years ago, but she still has fond memories of the time spent together with you. She was an orphaned child, never knowing who her parents were. She has adopted a young girl that recently lost her parents, ensuring she is well loved and safe.\n Sue: The village blacksmith and Teddy\u2019s older sister. She\u2019s a strong woman that carries her massive hammer everywhere she goes. Despite her size though, she\u2019s a soft-spoken introvert with a heart of gold.\n Mad Catter: A mysterious and whimsical cat. Not much is known about this curious creature other than he\u2019s very old and extremely powerful. He loves taking naps, subtle humor, and 6th wall breaks.\nZoe and the Cursed Dreamer is about experiencing a world and being immersed in it. Throughout your journey, you\u2019ll be able to enjoy relaxing optional tasks that enhance your gameplay. Some of these are already implemented, while others are planned for the future.\n Collect bugs like common butterflies in the forest or rare beetles deep underground.\nSeek out fishing spots and cast your rod to see what you can catch. But beware, skellies will sometimes go boney dipping.\nPlanned Features:\nMine rare ores and minerals to craft into unique weapons and armor.\n Food keeps you happy and healthy. Cook your food into meals to increase their benefits and unlock extra buffs.\n Gather food from the wild or plant the seeds and start a farm. Higher quality foods will provide greater benefits when cooked.\n  Howdy! I\u2019m a solo developer who is finally creating my childhood dream game! I\u2019ve been developing the story of this game for over 18 years, and I\u2019m thrilled to see it come to life. It started out as a novel that I wanted to write, and when I took an interest in game development it became a game that I wanted to create.\n\nThis project has a lot of sentimental value for me, so I will be creating everything myself, including the art, music, code, and anything in between. It\u2019s a lot of hats to wear, but I love learning new skills, so I\u2019ve been having the time of my life working on this project.\nI host the YouTube channel Game Endeavor where I post devlogs and livestream the design process. So if you want to see how the game has developed as far back as day one, then go watch the devlog series on YouTube. This is my most popular devlog with over 400,000 views!\n\n 50,000+ YouTube subscribers\n 1.3+ million video views\n 5,000+ Discord community members\n 10+ years of programming experience\n Target Platforms\nThese major PC platforms will be supported:\nWindows, Linux, Mac", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've been developing this project for nine months, and I believe most of the hard work is behind me. The hardest part was getting the combat system, ai that fights with you, and complex cutscenes working. I did those early because I knew they would be a bit difficult.\n\nThere is still the multiplayer system that I would like to implement, which is primarily why I've given myself such an extended time period to release this project, just to have some breathing room. \n\nShould I need to adjust my time schedule or make significant changes to the game, I am open about it not only with my backers but also my community.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Game Endeavor\nFirst created \u00b7 2 backed\nHowdy!

Instead, crossing continental distances, only to reach the wall of a \u2018room\u2019. Passing beyond will only bring yet another room on the other side of it, with new lands stretching off just as far again.\nAlthough all manner of threats exist out in the wilds, such as strange animals and beasts, and other barbaric or dangerous people, the greatest dangers of all, are the Rooks. Huge, hulking stone automatons that patrol, somewhat mindlessly, out in the wilds of the Colostle\u2019s rooms.\nThat is until they are disturbed. Every Rook is different, there are no two the same, and they are the only source of magic in the world. As such, they are something of a target to hunters looking for tech they can scavenge, artefacts they can sell or magic crystals to grant them strange and unpredictable powers.\nThat is if they can bring one down...\nA 'room' stretching out before an Armed adventurer...\nWhat is a solo RPG?\nThink of it like a personal, mindful writing exercise, where the game provides you with prompts to write your own fascinating adventure in this strange world. You will be keeping a journal of your adventures, and the game system is a way to determine what you will encounter along the way, and to dictate the outcome of combat. All the book provides is prompts and inspirations, but it is up to you and your character to flesh out the details and to write about what you discover.\nFirst you need to create a character, someone of this world. This book will guide you through this process, but it is completely up to you. Then the game provides you with an outline of your first adventure. You can decide how to interpret these prompts and what to write, there are no limits to what you can do, this is YOUR adventure.\n\nWhat is in the book?\nThe Colostle book will be a 24 page A5 tome with all the rules required to create and play your own Colostle adventure. The book will have a thick 300gsm cover with foiled lettering, and the internal pages will be on off-white recycled paper for an otherworldly look and feel. The book will also feature black and white illustrations throughout suggesting glimpses of the world and the kind of characters you could create.\nDesign of the interior black and white pages (mockup)\nHow does the game work?\nThe basic principle is that of drawing cards from a shuffled deck of playing cards, and checking their colour, suit or number against tables to see what they represent for your adventure.\nIn the exploration phase of the game cards might stand for meeting another traveller on your journey, finding some abandoned ruins or discovering a mysterious doorway. its up to you to write in your journal what these things are and what they mean for your character. The game simply suggests things, like writing prompts, set against a fantastical world... its up to you what they all mean for your greater story. In the Combat phase, cards stand for attacks with the numbers on the cards showing their strength. Playing the right card at the right time could mean victory for your character!\nAs you play and write you will find ideas for what the mysteries of the Colostle might mean, just falling into your head. I don't provide the answers in the book, every player will discover their own truth and meaning of the world.\nAll you will need is a deck of playing cards, a pen, some rough paper for making gameplay notes and a journal to record your character's adventures in.\nHow to Play Colostle - Example of a typical Exploration and Combat phase in the game\n3 Unique Character classes\nTo play Colostle you will need to create a character, and to that end there are 3 unique classes introduced in the book that will help you do that. They are; The Armed, The Followed and The Helmed. All of them use parts and pieces harvested from Rooks that give them special abilities. I don't want to give everything away, as it is only a small book (!) but you can see an Illustration of The Armed class below.\nThe Armed - wielders of harvested Rook arms\n Rewards + Stretch Goals Breakdown\n Cheaper Shipping Options\nIf you look in the rewards you will notice that some rewards have an identical twin with the added 'Cheaper Shipping' to their title. This is because I found a cheaper shipping cost later in the life of the campaign after these tiers had been already added. If you are a new backer, and you live outside the UK, please make sure you select the 'Cheaper Shipping' version of the tier you would like, to make sure you get the best deal on your shipping.\n(These 'Cheaper Shipping' options only exist for the top 3 tiers, \u00a320 or over. The lower tiers have accurate international shipping as they are, so you don't need to worry about those)\nNew artwork for the 'Oceans' module!\nNew artwork for the 'Battlements' module\nWho am I?\nMy name is Nich Angell and I am a comic book artist, illustrator, writer and game designer. I am one quarter of the stories-and-games company Big Punch Studios, creators of comics such as 7STRING, Afterlife Inc., and Cat and Meringue and the super fun card game Sandwich Masters!\nI have worked on a lot of comics and games, both from an illustrator perspective and a concept/creation one. More than anything I love creating worlds, whether thats a place to hear a story from, or a place to play a game in, making worlds is my thing! So when I found out about solo RPGs and played a few I realised what an awesome thing they were, a small tight rulebook for a brand new world.\nAs someone with a wild imagination I am always coming up with new ideas and Colostle is the latest setting that popped into my head. This time though, I was excited to create a more open ended world so that others can experience the joy I have creating stories, adventures and mysteries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have worked on many graphic novels and as such am extremely familiar with creating books and making artwork printready. I have run a great many Kickstarters both on my own and as part of Big Punch so I am highly confident in the process and know the extent of what is involved.\n\nAs with all of my Kickstarters and those I have been a part of, I believe communication is key. I know to update regularly and keep the backers informed even if unforeseen delays or problems occur.\n\nWith a small book and a small print run like this I don't foresee any issues. The kinds of things might be print delays, quality issues, and delivery but I have plans for all of these issues if and when they appear.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe book will not be packaged in any plastic shrinkwrap or film, and will be delivered in a fully recyclable cardboard book envelope.

Read more about it in the update #5\n\nHave you ever had the problem of needing to describe a dungeon and none of the players could really imagine how the structure is actually built? You don't always have to draw a battle map. Sometimes a small picture is enough to quickly show what the situation around the players looks like. Or did you ever try to come up with a dungeon room on the fly and just could not come up with an interesting layout? This deck of dungeon cards is perfect for those situations. 36 (now 54) unique cards full of stairs, dark corners, slim corridors, claustrophobic rooms, crates, barrels and much more to place monsters and treasure in.\nCards can be either used separately or combined to form larger dungeons. You can reveal one card after another as your players make their way through the dungeon and make them curious about each corner.\nThe cards are made out of professional 310gsm card stock with a blue core and smooth linen finish for the professional look & feel. The deck comes in a custom printed tuck box with a protective matte coating to give your cards the home they deserve. \nSpeaking of... Each map (as well as the back of the card and the box) is completely hand-drawn. All 36 cards are already done and just need to be sent off to the printer.\nSo why Kickstarter? This is a test for me to see if such a deck is even wanted by enough people. If this project gets funded I can let the cards print for a reasonable price per deck without making a loss or charging an impossible high price.\nSupport Tiers\n5\u20ac - Get the PDF\nYou will get the full Deck of Dungeons (including the back side) as a PDF. This is perfect for those that would like to support this project but can't (or don't want to) afford the price of the physical deck + shipping costs.\n15\u20ac - Get the printed deck\nYou will get the physical Deck of Dungeons. Perfect for Dungeon Masters, as a present or just as a collectors item.\n18\u20ac - Physical & digital deck\nGet both - The PDF and the printed deck. This is for people who play classically as well as digitally or want to collect the printed deck and use the digital one.\nIf you want more than one deck please contact me with the shipping country. I would need to calculate the additional costs depending on where to ship. Thank you for your understanding :)\nStretch Goals\nI am very hesitant when it comes to stretch goals for this project. This is my first kickstarter and I just want everyone to get what they expect and as smoothly as possible. But if the project gets a lot more supporters than expected, I probably have no choice. So here is the goal:\n[Unlocked] 300 Supporters - 54 Cards\nIf we hit 300 or more supporters I will increase the number of cards in this deck to 54. It doesn't matter if for the physical deck or the PDF version. If we reach 300 backers the deal is sealed. I will invest some extra time to come up with 18 additional cards.\nSo if you would like to have a thicker deck make sure to share this project and encourage your friends to grab a copy as well ;)\n Shipping\nThe Deck of Dungeon gets shipped worldwide. The shipping costs will be added after you selected your pledge level. \nGermany: 6 \u20ac\nRest of the EU, USA, Canada, Japan: 11 \u20ac\nRest of the world: 13 \u20ac", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEven though this is my first kickstarter I am fairly confident that everything will go smoothly. The designs for the deck and tuck box are done and I already got several prototype prints of the deck from the printer to check the quality and made some adjustments.\n\nOf course it is always possible that something goes wrong during each step of the process and the shipping could get delayed.

Stop Starving. Start Thriving. \nDiscover how you can turn your art skills into your own thriving career in Illustration. \nFACT: Being an Illustrator is tough!\nYou have hopes and dreams to make it big as an artist; but you don't know how to make it happen.

Yet, as you move forward you can't help but feel stress & anxiety about the future. \"Will I actually succeed with my art?\" \"Is it even possible to find an art career that will pay my bills and  fulfill me creatively?\" To make things worse, you sometimes cave into your fears because of social distancing and/or your past.\nWell, listen up!

Your successful career in illustration is possible. I've written a guide to help you make it happen. \nThese may be BOLD words from a stranger - Why can I make you this promise?\n\n\nMy name is Will Terry and I am a successful  illustrator. - I\u2019ve illustrated over 30 children\u2019s books for publishers like Scholastic, Penguin Random House, and Simon Schuster. I co-founded the wildly popular illustration podcast - 3 point perspective. I co-founded SVSLEARN.com with Jake Parker and Lee White where we teach illustrators all over the world. I\u2019ve created a thriving comic convention brand. I taught illustration and business practices for 9 years at UVU. I\u2019ve been giving entrepreneurial advice on my popular YouTube channel  for over 10 years!\nThe point is, I've made my own successful illustration career. I, along with 12 other award winning illustrators, will show you how to make yours.\n\n What They Don't Teach You In Art School is a guide to help you create new opportunities using your art skills to pay the bills, even if you have no prospects right now. \nIn this BEAUTIFUL 300-page fully illustrated hard cover book; you're going to learn:\nIndustry Insights\nYou will learn the most relevant professional practices I use in my career to this date. To name a few: How to find clients, how to price effectively and close deals, how to figure out which industry your art is best suited for, how to correctly invoice, industry mistakes you should avoid, and more...\nThis means you will be fully prepared to find and secure the right opportunities that will fulfill you creatively and pay you fairly.\n\nHow To Land Your Dream Art Job\nFor some of you, landing that nice prestigious illustration job at a famous company like Disney, Riot games, or DreamWorks is your dream. In this guide you will learn how to network effectively, how to get yourself & your art noticed, how to nail an interview, and much more.\nThis means that you will have a competitive edge over all the other illustrators out there trying to get the top jobs in your industry.\n\nHow To Get Freelance Work\nFor those of you looking for the thrill of freelancer life, I've got you covered. You will learn how to get the best freelance work, how to get your work discovered to attract more clients, how to correctly structure your portfolio, best practices to follow as a freelancer, and more\u2026\nThis means that you will be able to create the freelance work-hard/play-hard lifestyle you want, earn a living, and still have time for conventions and games.\n\nHow To Create Your Own Brand\nAs artists, what we want most is to be known for our accomplishments and abilities.

You could spend an entire academic career at an art university and still not even come close to learning the gems that are in this guide. \nLuckily, this isn't art school so you won't have to take out student loans to get access to this valuable information. For this Kickstarter only, I am going to give you access to a massive discount. \nI'll give you one copy of \"What They don't Teach in Art School\" for the price of $29 for a soft cover or $39 for a hard cover. \nThe invaluable knowledge of how to monetize your art skills and craft your own successful career all for a fraction of the cost of student loans, housing, text books, and Tuition. This deal lasts only for the duration of the Kickstarter. It will go back to full price afterwards. Claim your guide at a massive discount today!\nSoft Cover\nHard Cover\n\n\nSo What? Why should I care? \nThe vast majority of artists out there have the art skills to earn a living, but they have no clue how to monetize their skills; so they starve. Artists just assume that if they don't have any opportunities to make money with their art now; they will never have any opportunities in the future. This is false. They just lack the understanding of how to apply their art.\nWhat They don't Teach in Art School gives artists the edge they need to go out there and make a successful career for themselves. \nIf you personally apply the principles in this book:\n* You'll learn how to establish a career where you are both earning a living and creatively fulfilled.\n* You'll learn where to spend your time to get your career off the ground and save a lot of money in the long run.\n* You'll skip past mistakes and obstacles that inexperienced illustrators make in the industry today.\n* You won't have to listen to that naysayer in your life, you know the one, and instead you'll take life into your own hands.\n* You'll be recognized for your own content and your own brand.\n* You won't have to be afraid of the future and instead look at it as your oyster.\nFear is a tough thing to shrug off. It paralyzes you from head to toe; preventing you from taking the necessary steps towards success. The greatest source of fear is the anxiety of not knowing how your future will play out. But let me clue you in on a secret, the future is yours to decide. You have what it takes! Decide to make your future a bright one. I wrote this guide to help illustrators, like you, to succeed in the most challenging time of your life. It's going to take work, there are no shortcuts, but there are open highways.\n- Will Terry\n\nShipping & Fulfillment\nBoth soft & hard cover books are ready to be printed!\nBooks will ship to the United States & Internationally. You will not pay for shipping until after the completion of the Kickstarter during fulfillment  (estimated to be in October). I will be using Backerkit to help me with fulfillment. Backerkit makes fulfillment quick and easy! I will not mark up shipping whatsoever, you will only pay what is fair.  \nWhen we are ready to ship the books (probably in October) you will receive an alert to complete a survey (to be sent to the email address that you provided with your pledge). That survey will ask for your current/updated mailing address to ensure that your order will arrive to you directly. You will pay for shipping at that time -AND- GREAT NEWS: YOU WILL ALSO HAVE THE OPTION TO ADD MORE COPIES TO YOUR ORDER AT THAT TIME! You'll also have the chance to purchase add-ons, such as other books and prints by Will Terry.\nIf you have any further questions, feel free to ask me personally.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFulfillment is estimated to be October of 2020 for both hard cover and soft cover books.

They are what got my brother Brady and me into the hobby back when we were teenagers. Whether we\u2019re using them in roleplaying games, board games, or tabletop miniatures games, we love collecting, assembling, painting, and playing with them. While Blacklist Games has published several of our games that feature miniatures, they saw our passion could be used for the creation of a new division that would focus solely on miniatures and allow for company growth in parallel with creating great board games. With everyone at the company excited about the possibility of this new division, here we are to share it with you!\nBlacklist Miniatures will focus entirely on producing high quality, highly detailed, pre-assembled plastic miniatures to be used in any type of game. Blacklist Miniatures: Fantasy Series 1, our first miniatures line, is not only a celebration of our love for miniatures, but also of all things fantasy.\nWith your support, this campaign will not only bring this project to life, but also open the door to other lines of miniatures in various genres and even new games to utilize them! \nBlacklist Games has published several board games that include detailed plastic miniatures. With each game we publish, we learn more about how to improve the quality of the miniatures we produce. When you compare the miniatures in our first game, Street Masters, with those in our most recent game, Altar Quest, you can see these improvements.\nBlacklist Miniatures will take this experience and apply it to produce our best miniatures yet. These miniatures are 28mm scale and will be produced in PVC plastic.\nDragon (Kickstarter Exclusive!)\nMale Elf Paladin\nOrc\nOoze\nQUARTERMASTER LOGISTICS\nBlacklist Games, LLC is proud to announce that Quartermaster Logistics (QML) will be handling our fulfillment for Blacklist Miniatures: Fantasy Series 1.\nQML has an outstanding reputation for their transparent and stellar customer service, allowing for backers to get freight/shipping updates and personable QA solutions directly from them. From what we\u2019ve seen, they have high standards when it comes to ensuring packages are delivered with enough protection and care to give backers and publishers a peace of mind.\nFinding the perfect fit for logistics has been an immense test of trial and error, but after better understanding the needs of backers and our own expectations, we are now confident and excited for this new direction and our partnership with QML for this campaign.\nShipping\nLike our previous campaigns, shipping will be collected after this Kickstarter campaign concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship, via our pledge manager (see the \u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d section below for more details). This is because shipping varies from region to region.\nDepending on which region you are in, we will ship from the following hubs: UK (for EU/UK backers), China (for Asia Pacific backers), Canada (for Canadian backers), Australia (for Australia and New Zealand backers) or Indiana (for USA and the rest of the world).\nPlease note: Altar Quest add-ons (Altar Quest Quest Tier Pledge, Ruins of Arkenspire, First Four) will ship in a separate, earlier wave. See below for details.\nSHIPPING FOR FANTASY SERIES 1 ITEMS\nThe current estimated delivery for Fantasy Series 1 items (Adventurer Tier, Guildmaster Tier, Altar Quest Lurker Pack add-on) is December 2020.\nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg or 8.8lbs volumetric weight).Keep in mind costs may increase based on weight from unlocked stretch goals and/or any optional add-ons purchased.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $65 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $12-$18 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries (see below).\nASIA: $10-$15 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $20-$25 to Australia and New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$20 to most countries.\n$25-$30 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia.\n$50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland.\n$65-$70 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\n  Unfortunately, because of certain import laws and customs, we currently are NOT ABLE TO SHIP TO Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia.\nIf your territory is listed above we hope to be able to offer our product to you later at retail, but are unable to commit to shipping to these territories during the Kickstarter.\nSHIPPING FOR ALTAR QUEST ADD-ONS\nIf you pledge for any of the Altar Quest add-ons (Altar Quest Quest Tier Pledge, First Four Hero Pack, Ruins of Arkenspire) during this campaign, they will be shipped to you separately from your Fantasy Series 1 items. They will be shipped in the same time period as rewards are shipped to backers of the Altar Quest campaign (current estimate is July 2020).\nYou will pay for this shipment based on the shipping rates from the Altar Quest Kickstarter campaign. In other words, you will pay the same shipping costs that Altar Quest backers paid for these items to be shipped.\nTerms and Conditions\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that you have read and accepted the following terms and conditions.\nFINAL PRODUCT\nThe products/rewards shown on this Kickstarter page are subject to change. The final products/rewards you receive could differ from what is presented here.\nPROJECT UPDATES\nIt is your responsibility as a backer of this project to read project updates in order to stay up to date with important details and requests from the Blacklist Games team.\nCOMMUNICATING WITH BLACKLIST GAMES POST-CAMPAIGN\nPlease note that we do not monitor the Kickstarter messaging inbox outside of a live Kickstarter campaign. Therefore, after this project has ended, please ensure to send all communications to customerservice@blacklistgamesllc.com\nREFUND POLICY\nFull refunds are available within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end date. All refunds taking place within 14 days of the close of the campaign are reversed in full via Stripe to your credit card.\nAfterwards, refunds minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot recuperate) will be available before and during the first 30 days the pledge manager is open. Once these initial 30 days have passed, no refunds will be possible. A reminder of the refund cutoff date will be announced in project updates.\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed as previously stated.\nCOMPLETING THE PLEDGE MANAGER\nIn the weeks following the conclusion of the campaign, an email invitation to our pledge manager will be sent to all backers to allow them entry to the pledge manager; further details on this process will be provided in a project update published around the same time the email invites are sent out.\nBackers must confirm their \u201corder\u201d (pledge rewards + purchased add-ons) in our pledge manager before its closing date in order to receive their order. \u201cConfirming your order\u201d means entering your valid shipping information and paying any balances due for shipping costs and selected add-ons in the pledge manager.\nIf you confirm your order by the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your confirmed order as entered into the pledge manager. That title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.\nIf you do not confirm your order before the closing date of the pledge manager, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payments/donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, agree to place you on a waiting list for backers with unconfirmed orders if you contact us after the closing date of the pledge manager but before fulfillment of rewards begins. Backers on this list will be contacted once initial fulfillment to backers has concluded in order to offer them a final chance to complete their orders; note that this process would not involve the pledge manager and that any shipments sent as a result of this process would not benefit from any \u201cfriendly shipping\u201d rates offered during the Kickstarter campaign and would undoubtedly be shipped at a higher cost due to not benefitting from overall Kickstarter shipping rates. \nRemember that unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and could lead to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, therefore if you do not complete your order by the pledge manager\u2019s closing date, we cannot guarantee the availability of add-ons/exclusive items in sufficient quantity for your pledge.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing five successful Kickstarter campaigns, we are continuing to learn how to further improve our marketing, design, manufacturing, fulfillment, and distribution, as well as how best to nurture our growing community. \n\nThe following are the statuses of our crowdfunding projects:\n\nStreet Masters: Fulfilled\nBrook City: Fulfilled\nAftershock: Delivering now\nAltar Quest: In production at the manufacturer\nHour of Need: Development wrapping up \n\nThere are a lot of moving parts with Kickstarter campaigns, and timing is often one of the biggest obstacles, especially for smaller publishers such as ourselves.

Later on I learned that this method is similar to what cognitive research has called \"The Testing Effect\". \nStudies have shown that The Testing Effect is one of the most efficient ways your brain retains new longterm information and this book was developed using these same scientific principles.\nCognitive Drawing has had over 1300 Beta Testers which have included Homeshoolers, Charter Schools, High Schools, hobbyists and those who just wanted to expand on their college educations. \nOf those testers 90% saw an immediate improvement in their drawing AND retained what they learned.\n LINK: Four Page Cognitive Drawing Sample PDF (Download)\nBetter yet, here is a demo video if me doing the sample PDF!\nOver the course of 90 days I'll be teaching you the techniques that have made me a successful artist. \nWith Cognitive Drawing learning to draw is as easy as... \nWhat are Students Saying?\nWhether it's for personal use, homeschooling or the education system.

It will be a softcover, perfect-bound book that will fit nicely with the other books in the DRAWINGS series. It will hold a comprehensive collection of both finished and exploratory artworks from the last three years, including an exclusive SKULL CHASER comic made especially for it. There will be a step-by-step tutorial on my drawing process as well.\nThis is the FIFTH book in my series of DRAWINGS art books and I felt it was time to mix things up a bit and change the nature and design of these books for the next several publications starting with DRAWINGS 5.\nYou can order these books right now from my shop. If they're out of print, I have a digital download option available.\nAlong with the book there's a bunch of other stuff that is only available from this Kickstarter. I'm excited to make these things and get them out to you!\nNote: this is a living, breathing project.

We will be doing our best to make sure everything gets to you on time!\nSometimes orders get lost or damaged in the mail. In that case, we will work with you to make sure you get your book. For instance, if your book is damaged, please contact us and we will have you return the damaged book for a replacement.

This book is for all ages showcasing character designs, concept art, and visual development. With full color illustrations, rough sketches, traditional ink and ink washed artwork.

Building good drawing habits and making sketching fun is the goal of our latest creation.  \n The wallet is 3.25 x 4.25\" and is made of high quality printed vinyl. The inside has an ID window pocket, a card pocket, and a money pocket for your cash. Each wallet comes with a small pencil and a 2.5 x 3.75\" replaceable sketchbook filled with drawing activities to prime the creative pump.  \nMany parents have asked me how to keep their young artist going. I believe they should provide them with a few things: \n\"Encouragement\" will need to come from you, but we can help with the \"fresh art supplies\" and \"inspiration\" to make drawing fun and accessible. Each wallet comes with a replaceable sketchbook filled with tips, prompts, activities and more to get the creative juices flowing. Your artist will definitely come away with new skills and fun stuff to draw. There are also plenty of blank pages that will allow unguided creativity. Our small blank, toned, dot-grid and lined books also fit this wallet. \nMany artists don't begin to carry a sketchbook until they hit college age or older. Help the young artist in your life to develop this habit early, it will only help them get better. Drawing at a young age should only have one goal...it should be fun. You'll have plenty of opportunity to dash their hopes and dreams later. Don't get hung up on, \"you drew the head too big,\" or \"the perspective is all wrong.\" Criticism before they're ready will squeeze the love right out of it. If they can keep drawing through middle school and into high school then they are probably ready for honest critiques. You'll know because they'll ask for it.\nWe've had this on the idea board for a couple years and thought it was time to make this thing. We have been trying several designs, interviewing young people, measuring pockets, checking out materials and so on. We love the final designs and know you will too. \n The first wallet was designed by the ever-doodling Parker Jacobs. Parker has been posting his daily doodles for the past decade. You may recognize his work from Paul Frank Industries, Yo Gabba, Gabba, The Aquabats and Goon Holler. Parker has a bad habit of letting his domain names run out.\n The second wallet was designed by Sketch Wallet creator Ralph Thomas. He's proven that even a mediocre artist can make a living in illustration and has spent the last 10 years as a game artist. When he's not drawing he's found riding his trusty green bike, \"the Bass-O-Matic\u2122\" or stealing Parkers websites (Exhibit A, Exibit B).\nSpecial Thanks to Miles, Raegan, and Aaliyah :-)\nPLAY", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs much as I want to pretend there are no risks - there are.

So we reached out to our manufacturer and worked with them to create this set.\nSo, who are these guys?\nWe are a group of toy developers, game designers, and brick enthusiasts that want to bridge the gap between bricks and tabletop RPGs. We have a lot of experience in toys and manufacturing and want to use those connections and knowledge to create awesome sets to enhance your game. Our first set will be this dice tower, then we move onto sets that support the most popular campaign settings and modules.\nWhat will happen now that the Kickstarter is funded?\nAfter we receive funds, production will begin. The smallest order we can place for a product like this is 1000 sets. This will take 1 month for the factory to complete. Then they will be shipped in a container to our warehouse in the US, this will also take 1 month. Then the warehouse will ship all of the orders out to your addresses.\nAfter we fulfill the Kickstarter, we will launch our eCommerce site where people will be able to place orders for this dice tower and future sets.\n Future sets? \nYep, we already have a few sets lined up for release after this one. The next set will be around 1500 pieces and feature a campaign with 3 sessions worth of play.

It's a unique gaming experience without a lot of baggage. Simple set-up, intuitive rules and minimal components. No DM, no bookkeeping or character sheet. Just you, an oversized deck of cards, dice and cube markers.\nMy influences for this game are rooted in the nostagia of my childhood. D&D, Planet of the Apes, Land of the Lost, Heavy Metal Magazine, Zork, and Monkey Island, to name a few.\n\nIt's the grisly tale of a strange tower that emerges in the heart of a bustling Viking city. The townsfolk have vanished. It\u2019s up to you to mount a rescue and unravel the mystery. \nYou move through the game like a book. But in this case, it's a stack of ominous cards. Flip them over, make difficult choices and let the story unfold. \n\nYou have an Ally Deck with 6 adventurers (6 chances) to face the countless dangers of the spire. From this deck you will randomly pick 2 starting Allies. But be warned, your path is paved in blood. If they die, and they will you will randomly select another Ally to take their place.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a six-chapter adventure, each of which includes a major encounter, loot, choices, dice chucking and more! It will require both skill and luck. \nThe hook is simple. In combat you perform actions at a cost. That cost is your character's hit points. Every action is a risk. To execute stronger attacks you will need to spend more hit points, which in turn leaves you weak and vulnerable. This makes for tense, close, ruthless battles.\nPlease note: This is a simplistic look at some basics in combat. There are many exciting variables to actions and their outcomes detailed in the instructions deck. Check out Kickbacks, Status Effects, Rest meters and more!\nEnemies will fight in a similar fashion, with a few exceptions. They don't spend Hit Points and their actions are determined by the Action Deck.\nEach enemy you will face has different hooks and mechanics to make them interesting. Some have story branches that trigger in the midst of battle.\n\n\nWhat would an adventure be without pesky trash mobs getting in your way? You can't head out on your first quest without clearing rats out of a cellar, right?\n\nMy goal was to make this game with as few components as possible without taking away from the gaming experience. It's a clean minimalistic approach to an in-depth and engrossing adventure.\nThe focus has always been the story deck. The heart of the game. It represents the spire, and each card is a layer you uncover during your descent. \nFrom the very start I wanted ENORMOUS PLAYING CARDS. These are custom 6.5 x 3.5 inch cards. They are about the same size as an iPhone X and they're glorious. Here's what's in the box. \n\n\n\nThis is not a randomly generated gaming experience. The concept here is to experience a specific storyline with multiple chapter branches and endings. Your choices, enemy encounters and items you discover will influence the overall narrative. There are multiple endings to uncover, some more unpleasant than others.\n\n\n\nHere is a look at the current Card Progression Tree for Chapters 1 and 2 to help illustrate the branching paths. Each square is a card. Black = Story Card, Red = Item Card, Dark Red = Encounter. Your story can splinter out in many different directions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsidering the complexities of the project I want to be transparent with the progress made and what's left to do.\n\nGreg is an Art Director and Graphic Designer currently residing in Los Angeles, CA. In his free time he's pumping whatever pop culture he can into his veins..or dreaming up new encounters for Spire's End!\n\nBenjamin is a Digital Artist from Berlin, Germany currently working as a freelance concept artist and illustrator. These days he uses every available minute for art and game design.\nErica is co-owner of Oaktown Spice Shop in Oakland, CA. Before starting a retail business with her husband, she was a journalist. She loves to cook and drink wine.\nChristian is co-owner of Hop Merchants Bottle Shop & Taproom, a craft beer bar in North Hollywood, CA.  He's a writer, a gamer and horror film fanatic.\n\n\nShipping will be charged after the campaign has ended. \nThe shipping rates listed below are conservative estimates NOT the official costs. Please note that these estimates are based on the core game. Any Stretch Goals unlocked during the campaign may change the weight and the size of the game, which could influence the final shipping cost. I will work to secure the best prices possible and attempt to lower these costs in proportion to the success of the campaign.\nBackers outside the countries listed above may be responsible for their own customs fees and any additional charges if and when they occur. Please message me regarding countries not listed for more information.\nPlease not that Spire's End is a work in progress, product is still in development.\nWarning: This is a fantasy/horror game that contains violence and disturbing imagery. Ages 16 and up.\nThe incredible art by Benjamin Wieseman sets the mood. The game will contain over 40 original illustrations.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first venture into the madness of crowdfunding and it\u2019s incredibly daunting. But with more than 15 years of graphic design and packaging experience, I am merely in a state of heightened panic.\n\nThis project, like many, started with very ambitious goals before it was wrangled into something reasonable for my first attempt. It began as a 12 chapter, 200 card epic. Due to the sheer scope of the game, production costs and the fact that I am just one person, the game is now 6 Chapters, with the hopes to continue later if successful.\n\nThe style guides and templates are set, and the writing for Chapters 1-6 are more than halfway there.\n\nMy aim is to keep things simple without compromising the game as much as possible. That being said, even with \u201csimple\u201d in mind I know that problems lurk around every corner. Game balancing and rewrites take time so I am giving myself a considerable amount of lead time to get this labor-intensive job done properly.\n\nNobody wants this game in their hands more than me. I dream about this thing. I spend my time in the shower planning the next encounter. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to get this out before the spire drags me down into the bowels of the underworld.

Each stop along the way unlocks more fun!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\n!! VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ !! \n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion.\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates.\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change/subtract or add a piece to a specific model.\n4) The bulk of our Kickstarter will be made in China. A tariff in excess of 50% or a ban on Chinese imports would seriously delay delivery and/or, in a worse case, shutdown this project entirely. If such an event occurs early on in this project, refunds (less charges and expense payments made) might be possible. If it occurs later in this project (after almost all expenses have been paid) there would be little and possibly no refunds. \n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment against loss or damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that helps us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays that are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and dock yard labor strikes are examples of delays out of our control. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to back it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nAlso we reserve the right to modify any model or piece of a model shown to meet cost and production requirements. Modifications may include the removal or addition of new parts to a model. \n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored.\n\nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by August 31, 2020 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after August 31, 2020.\n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after April 30, 2021) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit.\n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery. These include, but are not limited to: import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant and taxing authorities, VAT and GST due and delivery acceptance, brokerage and collection charges.\n\nYou are required to provide correct address information and ensure this address is deliverable by normal methods before your rewards are shipped.\n\nYou must have your address correct and up to date in the Reaper Pledge Manager when we announce shipping is beginning. You may change it at any time until then. There may be a shipping surcharge associated with changing countries.\n\nRewards returned to us as undeliverable will be shipped again postage prepaid by the Backer.\n\nALL OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIS KICKSTARTER WILL BE VIA KICKSTARTER UPDATES ONLY.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wave 2 - United Kingdom (NOT Europe)", "descp": "2019 Bones 5 PLEDGE LEVEL This reward level pledges enough to get you into this Bones 5 Kickstarter.

With an engaging one-off experience and narrative campaign play, Altar Quest offers players endless adventure in a unique fantasy setting with years of support planned for the game.\nWhether playing an individual quest or part of a campaign, each quest is made up of a combination of several different decks and other game elements. Heroes must complete the goal set out by the chosen quest deck in order to win the game. They must overcome several obstacles during the quest determined by the chosen threat deck and villain deck, as well as the deck of lurker cards. If any hero is defeated, the heroes lose the game.\nAll Original Fantasy Setting\nAltar Quest takes place mainly in a realm called Aridika\u2014a land of high fantasy and Gothic horror. As players dive deeper into the game, they\u2019ll learn about the deep lore and many mysteries that hide within the shadows of Aridika and the world of Rhuna. Designers Adam & Brady Sadler have been developing the world of Rhuna since their early days of playing Dungeons & Dragons, and are excited to share it and expand it with Altar Quest.\nAltars\nThe world of Rhuna was created by powers called \u201crhunes\u201d\u2014godlike essences that came together to create all existence. Mortals were never intended to wield the untempered powers of rhunes, so they were crystallized deep within the earth to keep the lands above in balance. Unfortunately, evil finds a way, and deep below Aridika where the lich queen Szera slumbers, the rhunestones have been corrupted and forced to the surface. These altars are worshipped by power-hungry opportunists that use the rhunic energies surrounding them to further their own nefarious plans\u2026 \nDuring each quest, the chosen altar card will constantly affect the state of the altar pool. The altar pool is made up of 5 altar dice that are rolled at the start of the quest. Each altar die has 6 unique sides, each one containing a rhune symbol. These rhunes are used by the heroes, as well as the enemies, to trigger special effects. After an effect is triggered by a rhune symbol, the altar die showing that symbol is rolled and the new symbol is added to the altar pool. Players will have to balance using their rhune effects with making sure they aren\u2019t empowering the enemy too much.\nIncredibly Modular\nFeaturing the versatile Modular Deck System (MDS) that the Sadlers first introduced with Street Masters, the variability of Altar Quest is one of its key features. Players will have a world to explore by mixing hero decks, villain decks, threat decks, and quest decks with fluctuating feature decks to keep the environments fresh. Players can create their ideal game scenarios by matching up decks of their choice, or leave it to fate and embark on a randomized quest!\nTruly Solo, Truly Cooperative\nAltar Quest features an elegant player scaling solution built into the core design of the game, which means one player can play the game as easily as up to four, with no exceptions or special rules. \nThree Great Ways to Play\nWhile Altar Quest is designed to be a satisfying one-off adventure, players can also embark on an epic campaign by linking their quests together, earning upgraded cards for their decks, finding new equipment, and facing new challenges with enemy upgrades. Additionally, stories allow players to explore the vibrant setting of Aridika by playing through a story deck using the campaign rules.\nFor more information on the add-ons, click here.\nShow your support for Altar Quest by donning one of many avatars available here: https://www.blacklistgamesllc.com/altarquest\nShipping Info \nLike our previous campaigns, shipping will be collected after the Kickstarter based on the actual costs incurred to ship, via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping varies from region to region and doing so will allow us to provide more stretch goals for you during the campaign!\nDepending on what region you are in, we will ship from the following hubs: UK (for EU/UK backers), China (for Asia Pacific backers),  Canada (for Canadian backers), Australia (for Australia and New Zealand backers) or Indiana (for USA and the rest of the world). \nThe following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg or 8.8lbs volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates and costs may increase based on weight from unlocked stretch goals and/or any optional buys you get.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states. $50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $15-$30 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries (see below). \nASIA: $10-$15 to China, Hong Kong, and Singapore. $35 to most other countries.\nOCEANIA: $25-$35 to Australia and New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $20-$30 to most countries (see below).  \n \u2022 $35 to Norway, Switzerland, Finland, Estonia, and Latvia. \n \u2022 $50 to Bosnia/Herzegowina, Croatia, and Iceland. \n \u2022 $70-$80 to Israel, Liechtenstein, and Serbia.\nUnfortunately, because of certain import laws and customs, we currently are NOT ABLE TO SHIP TO Afghanistan, Argentina, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Russia.\nIf your territory is listed above we hope to be able to offer our product to you later at retail, but are unable to commit to shipping to these territories during the Kickstarter. \nTHE LOOMING TARIFFS: We have spoken to our factory and shipping logistic reps and until anything officially changes, nothing will change or affect us cost-wise. If things do start having a financial impact, Blacklist Games, LLC will be absorbing what we can, so we can keep overall costs and shipping as familiar to what you're normally used to with our campaigns. If there are any increases at all, it will be minimal and only be set by any fulfillment costs outside of our control, since we do not intend to randomly up-charge our products for the sake of doing so.\nPOST PLEDGE MANAGER NOTICE: Any pledges confirmed after our pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date and will likely incur increased shipping costs since it would be out of our normal fulfillment cycle. For non-US backers that will likely incur import taxes as well. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally due to the size of each package and the risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nRefund Policy\nWe can refund you within 2 weeks (14 days) of the campaign\u2019s end date, fees included. All refunds taking place within 14 days of the close of the campaign are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. After that, we will accept returns minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot get back from them) up until our pledge manager is closed. At that point, refunds will no longer be possible. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing our successful campaigns for Street Masters, Brook City, and Street Masters: Aftershock we continue to learn about how better to improve our marketing, design, manufacturing, fulfillment, and distribution, as well as how best to nurture our growing community. Street Masters and Brook City have been fulfilled and have received high acclaim by reviewers and gamers alike.\nCurrently, Aftershock is in production at the manufacturer. Per our recent updates, we've approved all samples and they are in mass production, about 5 months early! Though we aren't physically involved until mass production is finished, it's equally important that we continue to communicate with them and our backers in order to provide the latest updates and news. Altar Quest is extremely exciting, but we are also just as excited and committed to bringing Street Masters: Aftershock to our backers' tabletops as soon as possible.\nThere are a lot of moving parts with Kickstarter campaigns, and timing is often one of the biggest obstacles, especially for smaller publishers such as ourselves. Fortunately, we've got experienced game designers working hard to ensure the gameplay offers the best experience it can, we have strong relationships with the factory/manufacturer, we have a shipment/fulfillment company already signed on, we are completely passionate about our games, and, most importantly, we care about our backers and their satisfaction.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "Quest Tier", "descp": "Get one copy of Altar Quest and all unlocked stretch goals, PLUS the KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE \"Call of the Lunarin\" guest designer expansion by Isaac Childres, creator of Gloomhaven!

If you are a fan of 80's/90's road trip movies and retro video games, this movie is for you. It will capture those warm memories you have for gaming and remind you of those good times while making you laugh along the way. This will be a movie you can watch with the whole family. For fans of the Game Chaser's web series, this is not a 2-hour game chasers episode, it is a feature-length scripted comedy film. However, it will have everything you come to love from the show at its roots, just presented in a new and exciting way!   This will be a different format, of course, from the show (which is reality documentary style) But that's the point, to do something fresh and different!  \nWe've had an idea to do a movie for a long time, but it wasn't until someone approached us with the concept of a scripted comedy that the light-bulb went off. Our original idea a few years back was a country-wide road trip going to flea markets. Basically exactly what we do on the YouTube show, still keeping it a \"reality format\", and making it a feature-length movie. And while many might find that idea awesome, I found it boring. It's the same thing we already do just.....longer. And we have to depend on the chance of actually finding games. You wouldn't see Mevor, or Dodongo in it because or work obligations as well. For me, that idea just wasn't exciting. We never pursued it. We never tried to Kickstart it. Maybe we will down the road, but this idea that we have is so much more stimulating creatively for all of us, and a nice breath of fresh air. And the great thing about it for fans is that even though it's a fictional narrative, it still has the essence of the show. It's a refreshing take on Game Chasers. And we are super excited to bring it to life and show the world. \nNow, some people might be concerned over the fact that we have a Producer and that that means someone else other than us is calling the shots. Nothing could be further from the truth. This is OUR project, OUR vision, and the idea and direction is 100 percent OUR creations. We make the decisions. No one controls us, ever. They work for US, not the other way around. I just wanted to ease anyone's concerns that someone else was in charge of this project. This is GAME CHASERS only bigger and badder! What you love about the channel, you will love about this. \nThe plan is to shoot over the Spring/Summer and have it ready for release in 2020. There will be a limited theater run, at the minimum here in DFW. But there will also be digital downloads and Blu-rays as well! In the meantime the regular YouTube show isn't going anywhere, so don't worry.  \n\nWhat's it about????\nWell....I can only say so much. A lot of what will make it awesome to see for the first time is the big surprise we have in store. That's good enough, right??? RIGHT? NO? Fine......I can give a quick synopsis, I suppose...... Billy and Jay go on a road trip to track down a childhood gaming relic. And of course...a ridiculous adventure ensues.....a ridiculous adventure but not TOO outside the bounds of reality. Its main purpose is to be FUN to watch but also make you feel good!\nThink of this as a fictionalized Game Chasers Prequel. A fun re-telling of how 2 friends became game collectors. \nIt will be what you have come to love about the show mixed with stuff you would have never expected, but still fitting in with the spirit of what we do. And also mixed with bigfoots and aliens. Maybe. ;)\nPLAY\n\n\nOk, how about this? How about I list some words that are out of context but have actual meaning in the movie.

For now....\nFor another tease...scroll to the bottom and see a page from the actual script. \nThis is just a teaser paying homage to Gremlins, not any official art\nIn this video we go into the story a little more to hopefully help you understand the theme of what its all about.  \nMany of the Game Chasers show fan's favorite episodes were ones that made them both laugh and cry, and this movie will capture that same feeling. You will laugh, cry, cheer, and reflect. Fans of the web-show will get enjoyment out it, as well as those who are not familiar. Its a movie for fans and newcomers alike.  \n I (Billy)  have a passion for storytelling. I have enjoyed making the Game Chasers web series and will continue to do so, but my favorite projects have always been the ones where I can tell a story and or just be creative. The Under The Bridge Game Chasers Episode and our cartoons display that the most, I believe. This movie has been in the planning stages for a while now, but we feel it's finally time to move forward with it.  \nYour support right now of this Kickstarter is critical for it's success.\n Making a movie of this magnitude is expensive. As I said, this isn't a 2-hour Game Chaser episode. This is not us just taking a camera and going out a few days a week shooting video. We have a producer. We are hiring a professional film crew for this. We want this to be like any other movie you would see in a theater. THIS IS NOT a normal \"web series makes a movie\" scenario. Our goal is to shoot this movie on a RED Camera. A RED camera was used in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, to give you an idea of the quality. I DEMAND that this EXCEEDS your expectations.  We have always reached for the best quality in everything we do, and this is no exception. But besides the film crew, there are so many costs that go into this such as, location costs, insurance, paying the cast, props, transportation, post-production, CGI, licensing, lawyers, to name a few. We will need to hire people to do jobs such as accounting so we don't get sued or have the IRS come after us, a production manager so they can organize the dozens of people need to work on this and keep things on schedule, and also the cost of simple things like food for the crew that will add up quick. Luckily I (Billy) will edit so we can save money on that. As you can see, things add up quickly. 95k may seem like a lot, but in movie making terms 95k is still low budget. Remember, this isn't us filming on the fly at the flea market, this is a REAL production.   \nThis is a Pre-Sell. \nWe hope to Pre-Sell enough copies of the movie to cover the costs of making. If we don't, and our goal is not met, then Kickstarter will not charge your card. \nWHY CROWDFUNDING?\nCrowdfunding, or \"Eat Bacon\" as some would call it, is the best way to for us to bring this movie to you. Lucky for us, it's the year 2019 and the film industry has changed so much. There isn't a need to get a studio's backing or get deep pocket investors. We cut out the middle man and allow our product to be funded by the PEOPLE who want it DIRECTLY. The thing is, investors, dropping large sums of money will want a say in the movie, and rightfully so. We want to keep 100 percent control. We have TURNED down an offer for a TON of money from a potential investor because they wanted to make changes.  Our vision is important to us. With that said, we HAVE been able to secure smaller funding from a few sponsors who won't be taking any control. It's not a ton of money, but it helps, and we are always looking for more small sponsors who don't want say in the movie making aspect. \nObviously, we have always been great at taking low budget and making it look high budget. It's been our MO since we started. \nReminder: You wont be charged unless we hit our goal\nOf course, there are going to be people waving their finger saying we should get investors instead of going directly to our audience who would want to see this movie to fund it. They say we E bacon? With that said, we actually DO have some! As it stands we have around 7k committed from sponsors. However, you can play a huge part in making that higher. IF you guys help fund this now and early on in this campaign, more sponsors will be willing to jump on board since they will see there is a ton of interest and will be way more willing to get involved. However, they still wouldn't be sponsors who would get a say in how we make this movie. If so, we will turn them down. So if you want this to happen, let's do it as soon as you can! Let's show the people what the Chode Nation is all about!\nWe more than likely not make any profit off this. And we have no plans to pay OURSELVES for the work. Kyle Newman recently said he made nothing off the movie Fanboys in the end. I can see that happening with us. This is a passion project, but even passion projects require funding. If you want to see this movie made let's pull together an make one hell of a movie! \nHere is a pie chart that will show (generally) where the money will be spent. This as of now is a best guess, some areas could end up being cheaper, others more expensive.\nHere are a few further breakdowns of what you saw on the graph, and why exactly we need them. These are the jobs/things we will actually have to pay for and not get the \"friend\" hook-up.\nProduction Manager - This person handles the business side of things. Like managing the budget, making sure people get paid, employment issues, paperwork and etc. \nCinematographer - Behind the director (Billy and Melvor) this is the most important crew member. He or she is responsible for the look and cinematography of the movie. We can't do everything, so this person is vital for us. We want to hire someone who knows what they are doing, a professional. This will obviously cost but will be worth it. We want the movie to look good! But beyond that, if we hire someone who is cheap and inexperienced we run the risk of them making a mistake, and a mistake on a movie set can cost thousands of dollars and days of shooting. \nAudio Tech - This person is responsible for recording the audio on the set. Again, if someone messes up this job it can cost money and time, so a professional is needed. \nAssistant Director - While the director and co directors focus on the actual movie making, the Assistant director does the important \"dirty\" work to free up the directors time. Such as breaking down the script and planning the shooting days, and making sure all the people who need to be on set a certain day are there. They find the best and most efficient way to organize the shooting days to save time and money. \nSet Building - This is a must, and an expensive must. Some of our settings will need to be created because finding a real-life location that we need will be near impossible. I wish I could go into more detail but I would be giving away to much of the plot. Let's just say we will need to create a set that looks like it's from 1988. Also, a few of our settings would be impossible to film in a real life location because there would be no space to fit a camera and crew, so one would need to be built with only 3 walls, so a camera crew could be behind the \"fourth wall\". All this would need to be built on a sound stage which we would have to rent out from someone. Plus add the cost for materials and people to build said sets.  \nFilm Equipment - The DP will have a lot of gear but we will more than likely need to rent more and that cost can add up quick. Things such as camera mounts for a car, jibs, lenses, and lighting. Maybe even another camera if needed.  \nLocation fees - When we CAN shoot in real outside locations rather it be a building, a town, or someone's house, it is rarely ever free. Someone, whoever owns it, will want to be paid. Believe me, we will try to find a place for free or cheap, but it might not be possible.  \nSpecial Effects Tech - Sometimes its cheaper and easier to use miniatures instead of full size real life objects for a particular scene. Tons of movies use models and you never realized it. Apollo 13 and Avatar are two to come to mind, and we have one of the model makers who worked on those movies on board to work with us! He knows the art of the craft and how to make them look real on camera. We are talking professional half-scale and quarter-scale models, not little toys. Big difference. This will make our life SO much easier for a few things we have planned, but we still have to pay him. But it's totally worth it.\nActors - Some of the main actors will be friends, others will not. Regardless, we will still need to pay them. We can't ask someone to step away from work for a week, or a month, or even a few days for shooting and expect them to do it for free. We will also have a lot of actors who are not our friends...we will definitely need to pay them.... \nFlight/hotel -  This is another costly but necessary expense. We will need to fly actors and crew in and out all through the shooting phase. \nCatering - This is not in the pie graph but still important. You can't starve your actors or crew while shooting all day. Food will add up quickly. I hope they like Taco Bell...or bread and water...\nInsurance/legal - I hate this one, but it's a must. We are treading new ground here. We have to do things on the up and up to protect ourselves. We can't afford to get sued if someone gets hurt on set. And an entertainment lawyer is a MUST on a movie. One product or logo shown might open ourselves up to get sued, so we need council to tell us what's off limits. \nCGI artist - I already mentioned this but we have an artist who has worked on the Walking Dead on board. Now when I say CGI I don't necessarily mean crazy CGI sets or creatures (for the most part), a lot of CGI you see you don't even know you...see it.. Like wire removal, or fixing a mistake in the scene. CGI is an amazing tool to have, especially when a lot of times its cheaper than just re-shooting a scene. Cheaper...but not free\nMiscellaneous - This is everything else. Anything from fixing a broken piece of equipment, to gas for driving to a location.  On a movie set, something can always go wrong. An example would be as follows: We have scheduled a two-day shoot that's outside at a certain location. We have 12 cast and crew members that need to be there, and we have flights booked for everyone. The shoot day comes and then...it RAINS! We have to pay for two extra days of hotels for everyone and reschedule return flights. And some of those people might not be able to stick around after the rain to shoot, so we could have to re-shoot it a week or two later.Yeah, that would be a nightmare. An expensive nightmare. If we get more than expected out of this campaign, then this slice of the pie will get filled up even more due to the old saying, \"what can go wrong will go wrong\". \nCAMPAIGN FEES - Kickstarter's fees, together with the credit card processing fees, come to about 8.5% - 10%. At our goal of $95k that's up to $9,500. \nCheck out the production team so far. It isn't just a bunch of chodes (for the most part), we have real industry people working on this with us! \n\n\nMore on CGI With Yoshi\nHere, Yoshi talks about a somewhat unknown use for CGI that can have a huge impact on storytelling. CGI isn't just for space battles and crazy aliens....for the most part.\n here is Yoshi's IMDB and demo reel\nhttps://m.imdb.com/name/nm4668929/\n\nAgain, this is a Pre-SELL. If we don't hit the goal, you will get your money back, but if we do, then you will get a copy of the movie. \nWe are NOT asking for FREE money. You will get stuff in return. We are offering some cool rewards for you! You are the VIP of this project. We could easily ask you guys for money now, make the movie, then charge you again to buy it. We don't want to do that, so despite having a significant part of our budget go towards Blu-ray production, we want your money to go towards owning the movie as well as making it. You only have to contribute once to see it! If you ever wanted to be a part of a movie, see how it works up close, and know you helped make it happen, then we have a ton of cool rewards just for you! \nAnd remember, you can pledge as many times as you like. If you only want a digital download now, you can always come back before the campaign ends and get a Blu-Ray as well, or one of the higher rewards. Take a look on the right-hand side of all the reward details, but some of the stuff included are:\nUltimate Combo Pack!\nThis is the ultimate pack! Get the Blu-Ray, Shirt, name in the credits, and filming vlogs! This IS the combo you are looking for...\nConcept Art!\nGet art made just for the movie! This concept art is what is used to bring forth a visualization of what the scene should look like for filming. \nActual concept art drawn for the movie\nCome To the Premiere! \nCome hang out and see the premiere of the movie with us! This will be a special private first screening! Get VIP tickets and dinner with the cast and crew! It will be a blast, don't miss out!\npic is for example only. Official venue to be determined.\nHang out on set, and or be in the movie!\nWant a once in a life time chance to be behind the scenes when a movie is made? Or even update your IMDB profile with a role IN the movie? Either way, you are sure to have a hell of a time. \nnot the official sound-stage, pic only used as example\nPages from the First Working Draft! \nThis is a page from Jay's first draft of the script. There are notes as we made changes. You can get a page like this from one of 3 first draft working scripts from Billy, Jay, or Melvor.(Obviously the black lines are only so we don't give away the plot here on the kickstarter page and your page wont have them)\nThis is censored pic of an actual page of the actual script. Your page will have no black bars\nA VERY LIMITED VHS print\nThis VHS will be limited to 150 copies and each one numbered \"1 of 150\", \"2 of 150\", etc. It will have the movie itself but no extras. A great novelty item for VHS collectors! \n*artwork and title not yet finalized\n\nThere are even more awesome rewards to choose from! Just check out the list on the right side of the page and pick the one that is right for you! Or heck, maybe even 2 or 3...no nuts!\nOh, one more thing..... \nBlu-Ray, and poster art not yet finalized\nBlu-Rays - These are not cheap to produce. There is a reason most of the film kickstarter projects don't have this perk and the ones that do have them priced higher than a Blu-ray would normally be, it takes money away from your movie budget to make them. However, I know you most of you love physical media, so despite taking a piece of the budget away we are going to produce them for you! They will have exclusive stuff only found on the Kickstater Pre-order, so don't miss out! When we run out of these Blu-rays and print more to sell at cons and online well after the movie is out, they will be cheaper but have less content. So these are DEFINITELY the versions to get! These Kickstarter versions will have TWO discs with so much extra content. Plus...if you guys don't buy these now....we wont have the money to make the movie...\nArtwork - The artwork on the BLu-Ray and shirts are just to have visuals for the Kickstarter and are not the final product. I plan on hiring an awesome artist to make the poster/blur-Ray cover and make it look super epic. \nSo our goal of 95k is bare MINIMUM what we need to make this thing. We can make it awesome on that budget, however, we can make it even MORE awesome with these stretch goals!  WE will make the best movie we possibly can on 95k, but these goals are the key to taking things to an all new level. With this extra money we will do things like bring in a REAL famous actor or 2 for a cameo, add more complex scenes, bring in more people to help, and just overall add much more cool chodiness. Not only for the movie, but for the Youtube channel as well. Let's UNLOCK these stretch goals! \nRemember, if you want to throw in an extra dollar or $2 or $1000.....(i'm looking at you Bill Gates)....over what the perk costs, it will help! The more that do that, the more likely this goal will be met and exceeded. \nWhat About Game Chasers on Youtube???\nDoes this mean the end of the Game Chasers series? No way! In fact, check out the video below to learn how there could be MORE Game Chasers/Toy Chasers/ AND Chasing the Unknown.\nLastly, let me list a few films that we were inspired by while writing this script: \nFanboys\nPee Wee's Big Adventure\nDumb and Dumber\nBilly Madison\nGremlins\nGhostbusters \nTommy Boy\n\nOther Ways You Can Help\nSome people can't help fund this, but that doesn't mean they can't help:\nIf you want to help by offering your services (construction, make-up, costumes, etc) please let us know.  \nAnd it would be radical if you want to share this with everyone! \nI will share any video made by you that promotes this Kickstarter and encourages support! \nMake everyone aware!\nThank you so much for stopping in and checking this out. Together we can make this happen!\nEverything that is on this page is here for a reason. Even things you can barely see.....\n\nUpdate:\nHere at the bottom I will be posting various auditions as we receive them. Some for VERY small roles, and some for bigger ones. Keep in mind they are Auditions, it doesnt mean they have the part. I just wanted to post a few of these as teasers.

Choose your path and gather the greatest warriors of the age to your cause! Enter a world of magical treasures, wonders, and horrors. Compete against rivals in the bitter struggle for supremacy! The rules are deceptively simple and easy to learn, but you'll immediately face deep tactical choices in this dynamic battle game.\nThis ambitious Kickstarter campaign includes two new faction sets and a campaign book packed with adventures, lore, and much more! New Faction Sets not only expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players as they enter the dreaded Volgelands!\nGet the Volgelands campaign book, both of the new factions, and the Kickstarter Exclusive \"Vandas Greycloak\" miniature with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level! \n  Relicblade miniatures are cast in white metal for crisp detail.\nThe Volgelands Adventure Campaign Setting\nThe Volgelands is the first campaign setting for Relicblade, and the first in-depth exploration of the Relicblade world. The book centers on the region known as the Volgelands. The port city of Riverhold is the beating heart of these cursed lands where feral magic still hold sway. Founded on the divine principles of Justice, but controlled by a powerful merchant class. Riverhold stands at a crossroad, both as a center of trade and a symbol of hope. Adventurers seek out the city to find their path. From this indomitable city, brave souls set out into the Volgelands, seeking a new destiny in a dying world. \nThis campaign book is packed with tons of great content. Inside you'll find:\nRegional lore concerning the history of the Relicblade world, Riverhold, and the Volgelands.\nFaction lore focussing on the Temple of Justice, the Lone Guard, the Battle Pigs, and the sinister Bone and Darkness.\nMap based narrative quest lines.\nTwo dangerous new environments: the Scoured Plains and the Brackish Badlands\nSix scenarios in addition to the narrative quest lines.\nNew wild monsters that inhabit the Volgelands\nAnd optional campaign extras including Side Quests and more!\nJust look at this awesome map. Now imagine leading your warriors on this dangerous quest!\nThere is so much great content in this book! It's a little crazy to focus on one particular aspect, but I can't just upload everything and say \"SEE HOW COOL IT IS!!!\" with crazy eyes. But look at this dope map! These map based quest lines are great narrative adventures with cool details that bring it all to life. I can't wait for you to play through them.  \nScoured Plains illustration two-page spread.\nAlso, now that the cards are all in color I may as well make the books full color, right? Here is a preview of the Scoured Plains environment two page spread. Kinda neat, eh?\nIncluded in Adventurer Pledge and Above. Available as an Add-On during this campaign only.\nTo celebrate the launch of The Volgelands, I sculpted an exclusive miniature of Vandas Greycloak: the Torment of Dusk. Vandas is one of the cruel Dark Wanderers featured in the new book. This miniature will not be available for general release after this Kickstarter Campaign, so be sure that you don't miss out!\nThe Moldorfs come from a strange dwarven society deep underground. Utterly detached from the surface, these intrepid explorers set out to discover the truth about a mythical world... An \"outer land\" connected to an infinite \"outer space\". Though it is surely folly, a powerful hearthguard warrior and a razor sharp rogue join the Bibliothecary on this absurd quest. \nThe Moldorf Hearthguard\nA titanic underground world exists below our very feet. Immeasurable caverns spread into unknowable depths. Sprawling underground ruins extend into the shadowy abyss. It is from these depths that the Moldorfs emerge.\nMoldorf society is ruled by warlords from opposing houses. These households retain an elite core of Hearthguard warriors. In the tight corridors in which the hearthguard fight, they favor the use of massive shields and heavy war spears. From behind their brightly colored and richly decorated pavises, these fighters force their foes into unfavorable positions. \nTactically keen and lavishly equipped, the few Moldorf Hearthguard to reach the surface have quickly gained renown as formidable warriors.\nThe Shadowfoot\nShadowfoot belong to secretive clans. They are maniac rogues who stalk the shadowy depths with razor sharp daggers and dubious ambitions. In the complex political alliances between Moldorf houses, there is ample space for these shadowy agents. And though no household would ever admit to employing the Shadowfoot clans, a knife in the dark always has its place.\nThe quest to discover unknown realms promises both horrors and treasures. The opportunity to test their razor sharp skill is simply irresistible to these rogues. The Shadowfoot are ready to face anything the great unknown can throw at them, but is the greater world ready for them!?\nThe Moldorf Bibliothecaries\nThe Moldorf libraries contain countless manuscripts of the forgotten age. Arcane secrets were swallowed by the abyss and utterly lost. But so too, were the Moldorfs. Isolated from the powers that ravage the surface world, the Moldorfs learned magic from ancient texts. A strange wizard caste of librarians, or bibliothecaries, formed around the arcane arts. \nWithout the otherworldly patrons or raw creative energy present on the surface, the moldorf studies have naturally emphasized illusion magic. Though illusory magic is far less destructive than other forms, it is no less potent as they manipulate the battlefield. Bibliothecaries sew panic and chaos with massive illusory horrors and dazzling visions.\nAs the bibliothecaries collected and studied arcane writings, a strange sect began to believe in the existence of a surface world. They insisted the writings were not simply myths, but that they contain a metaphysical truth about the cosmic order. Now, these highly influential illusionists have gathered other bold explorers to their cause. They set out into the unknown. Traveling ever upward holding the ardent belief that a greater world exists in the unknown beyond. \nNeutral Alignment Faction!?\nThe Moldorfs are a neutral faction. That means any player, good or evil, may add Moldorfs to their party! Isolated underground, the Moldorfs have somehow avoided the cosmic struggle between good an evil. While players must still choose their alignment, neutral characters may be hired by any warband.\nWill you influence these strange subterranean explorers for good? Or will you manipulate them to serve your own selfish ambition? I guess we'll see... \nThe strange Lostwood stands to the west of Riverhold. It is the source of countless mysteries and haunting legends. The forests shifting boarders mark the boundaries of a most savage wilderness. Lone Guard watches stand vigilantly at its edge. Deep within the Lostwood stands an ancient empire ruled by the exile of the city of the dead, the immortal king Al'Adindred. \nThe Lostwood Enclave are a distinct faction who abide by the savage laws of nature. They are wanderers, protectors, and sages of the changed world. Though they are extremely dangerous, their souls are intimately tied to the advocate.\nThe Arboleth Sentinel\nThe arboleth are a powerful race of treefolk from deep within the mysterious Lostwood realm. They are slow to anger and deeply wise. Many proud generations have served the immortal king as peacekeepers. They are indomitable warriors naturally attuned with the will of the advocate. These singular beings are lawful, just, and frightfully strong. \nThe Wild Elf Pathfinder\nPathfinders are profoundly talented scouts able to navigate the most bewildering lands. They are keen hunters with the senses that reach beyond the physical realms. The wild elves are secretive nomads as a rule, however the pathfinders routinely interact with the greater world. \nOn certain foggy nights the Lone Guard are visited by these wanderers. They trade rare goods and exchange rumors before fading away as mysteriously as they came. There are even stories of pathfinders joining noble warriors on dangerous quests. The mist-like visitors lend their unearthly speed and stinging arrows to the righteous endeavor.\nWild Elf Druid and Cave Bear Form\nThe way of the Druid is a solitary existence. Druids are in communion with nature and abide within its savage laws. They take the shape of a wild beast and may spend years in this form without ever encountering civilization.\nThe shape of the mighty cave bear is among the most fearsome shapes a druid may choose. These powerful beasts can contend with the horrors and monstrosities that plague the land on equal terms. With tooth and claw these creatures are horrors in their own right.\nDRUID CREDIT OPTION:\nThe druid and bear are original sculpts from the first Relicblade release in 2015. The druid cards have been out of production for the past year, but with the Lostwood set she finds her place in a faction set with updated colored cards. \n2015 to 2018\nIf you already own the Druid and Bear figures you can opt for $10 credit toward add-ons instead of getting duplicate copies of these figures. You will get the Lostwood set without the druid and bear figures, but still receive the updated druid cards and the new elf and treeman figures. You will have the option to select a credit in the survey after the campaign ends.\nIn Relicblade, players recruit the ultimate squad of fantasy heroes or cruel villains as they battle for the fate of the world. Choose your path and gather the greatest warriors of the age to your cause! Enter a world of magical treasures, wonders, and horrors. Compete against rivals in the bitter struggle for supremacy! The rules are simple and easy to learn, but players are quickly engaged by deep tactical decisions.\nBehold! A disparate band of heroes set upon the path of the Advocate. A Moldorf Shadowfoot, Hellhound Berserker, Arboleth Sentinel, Cleric of Justice, and their Billman Companion.\nRelicblade \"factions\" represent groups that exist within the world. However, when you enter the game as a Seeker you choose between the good or evil alignments and gather heroes or villains to YOUR cause! Players use their influence to recruit characters.\nWill you be the fate that brings together a noble fellowship? Or will you bind wicked servants to your dark will!? \nA soldier pig, iguan poacher, ogre retiarius, dark watcher, and shild pig join forces on a dark quest.\nSpecialize your characters utilizing a vast arsenal of upgrade cards. Tactics, items, weapons, potions, and spells create the framework to customize your characters. Faction sets include a booster pack of cards with new characters and upgrades, so as each new set is released the options continue to grow with dynamic new list-building options. \nIn the example below this Iguan Slaver has a combination of defensive and ranged attack upgrades, which shifts his battlefield role and greatly increases his survivability. This particular build includes cards from The Wretched Hive, The Lone Guard, and Adventure Gear card pack.\n(some older cards were produced in black and white)\nWith the Seeker's Handbook campaign rules players construct a base and lead their characters on dangerous adventures to claim magical treasures. There are six scenarios, four environments, dangerous wild monsters, and rare treasures that pack each game with new dangers and unique challenges. The Seeker's Handbook is a wonderful source for limitless adventure. The Volgelands campaign book builds on the core rules in the Seeker's Handbook with tons of exciting new content. \nYou can learn a lot more about the game and how it's played on YouTube! There are gameplay overviews, unboxings, and battle reports ready to consume! Ash and Owen of Guerrilla Miniature Games and Gaming With The Cooler played multiple full Relicblade campaigns on their channels. So check it out!\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. I try to offer pledge's suitable for a variety of hobbyists. From the ubiquitous PDF hoarder, to the much beloved completionist. To make things super easy I put the new stuff in one \"kickstarter recommended level\". \nThe \"Bold Adventurer\" pledge level is the core level for this campaign. It's the perfect level for new and veteran players. With these two faction sets you will be well equipped to enter the dangerous Volgelands. However, players will still need the core rules found in the Seeker's Handbook. You may purchase the book as an Add-on or purchase the book or a pdf right away from Relicblade.com/shop\nThe Champion of Adventure pledge level will equip you with everything you need for a FOUR PLAYER RELICBLADE CAMPAIGN!!! Is $180 kinda expensive? Sure, it is for me... but it's EVERYTHING you need for up to FOUR players to enter a world of adventure. Good luck getting your gaming group started on a new tabletop miniature game for less :)\nNow that you mention it, I spent that much on a single warband earlier this year... So I feel confident that this is an awesome value.\nWhat's a Custom Character Card?\nYou tell me about a D&D character you used to play or any character you can imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character on a special character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them! The custom card will be your ideas collaboratively realized in Relicblade. You're welcome to create heroes, villains, relics, or monsters, whatever your heart desires.\nYou get the digital artwork and copies of your character card along with the other Legends from this campaign. All ten custom character commissions will be collected in the \"Legends 4\" booster pack. This booster pack will be an official expansion for Relicblade for players to collect and enjoy. The first three Legends sets were extremely popular, so don't miss out on being part of a new generation of legends! \nMy sincerest hope is to raise enough money to produce the book and the two faction sets above. But as is Kickstarter tradition, I am happy to add a little wish-list in the form of stretch goals. There will be fewer than last year, but that's just because the core campaign has a heavy workload with an amazing book.\nStretch goals are a great way to boost the project outcomes as the budget increases. If we raise enough money to produce the new sets, then the money we continue to raise will push toward even more new content! Newly unlocked content will be available as Add-Ons once the goal is reached.\nGuest Artist: M\u00e1rk L\u00e1szl\u00f3\nThe Relicblade: Guest Artist Series RETURNS!! I'm honored to offer another excellent collaboration. As the creator of Relicblade I enjoy unbridled creative freedom. This privilege is granted by my generous Kickstarter Backers, so in this campaign I hope to extend the mantle of creative power to a guest artist! \nI love M\u00e1rk's style. He and I share a lot of the same influences. His work has tons of character with a mystical edge. He seemed like the perfect person to take my old idea for the Flame Bearer (crazed-fire-wizard) and transform it into something surprising and unique. I'm really delighted with the sketches he's sent so far, and I'm confident we're going to make an AMAZING miniature together!\nCard art by Mark Laszlo!\nHere is the proposed artwork and specs on the type of shirt we'll be using. \nVolgelands monsters have great art.\nThe add-on marketplace is a way to add a few extra items to your pledge. That way you can rest assured you are getting all the Relicblade goodness you can handle. To \"add-on\" simply increase your pledge total to include your selections. Then make a note of your choice so you can let me know what you wanted when the surveys go out! (Pro Tip: email yourself with the note so you can search for it later.)\nI highly recommend that new players pick up a copy of The Seeker's Handbook. You and a friend will be equipped to play a full campaign with this book and the Bold Adventurer pledge level.\nThe greatest testament to Relicblade is the amazing community on Facebook! \nDarkness force by Matt Lechtenberg\nThe group that has formed around RB is the best. They are kind, welcoming, and super talented! There are awesome battle reports, stunning paint jobs, and new friends waiting in the Relicblade Adventure Battle Friends. We have a forum available Here, too. But the facebook platform makes sharing photos and stuff super easy. So we tend to just use that the most.\nStonekin Battleborn by Mads", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have run three successful Kickstarter campaigns to create Relicblade and several expansions.

However, the pharmaceutical giant Parasol Incorporated has taken matters into its own hands and begun to lead cleanup efforts, a decision met with universal praise from the outside world.\nUnfortunately, for those within the nightmare, the corporation's arrival has made things worse. Their interests seem skewed, their actions are questionable, and since their \"efforts\" have begun, people have disappeared, strange mutated creatures have crawled out of the shadows, and what can only be described as monsters straight out of horror movies have begun to run rampant.\nNow, it is time for the survivors to fight. Fight for the truth ... and their futures.\nAftershock is a deluxe expansion for the Street Masters board game, adding four new fighter decks, four new stage decks, two new enemy decks, new loot cards, and much more! Expanding on the modular nature of Street Masters, Aftershock includes two new ways to customize your play experience: missions and showdowns.\nThe mission deck is included to speed up multiplayer games by adding additional ways to support your fellow fighters. Mission cards allow fighters to gain powerful mission tokens, that can in turn be used to assist your fellow fighters during their turn.\nShowdowns are a new type of story deck that can be used in any story mode game, adding a villainous character working in the shadows against the fighters. Each showdown deck introduces a unique story for the associated enemy deck, as well as upgrade cards that will truly test the fighters!\nPlayers can also choose to include these enemy upgrade cards in their arcade games to increase difficulty and customize their games even further.\nAdditionally, Aftershock comes packed in a massive storage box that is designed to hold all existing Street Masters decks and tokens, as well as room for future content.\n Find out more about the products in the Aftershock Tier: Aftershock (Details Part 1), Aftershock (Details Part 2), Essence of Evil\nFind out more about the products in the Street Masters Tier: Street Masters, Legend of Oni, KS1 Stretch Goals\nClick here to see us unbox the original Kickstarter lineup!\nStreet Masters is a 1-4 player cooperative miniatures board game inspired by classic beat \u2018em up & fighting video games.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to you all since final shipping sizes are unpredictable with a growing campaign. This also gives us more room for stretch goals and as much cool gameplay stuff as possible.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. The following is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose.\nUSA: $10-$20 to most states ($50 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico).\nCANADA: $12-$23 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $70-$80 to most countries ($90 to Brazil).\nASIA: $15-20 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries; note that we cannot provide an estimated cost to Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia though they will be sent from China).\nOCEANIA: $20-$35 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $95 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $20-$35 to most countries. $30-$40 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. $50 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. $60 to Iceland. $45 to Greece and Turkey. $70-$80 to Israel, and Liechtenstein. $90 to Belarus.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to there, such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Due to this, we will not ship to these areas.\nREFUND POLICY\nWe can refund you within 2 weeks (14 days) of the campaign\u2019s end date, fees included. After that, we will accept returns minus the Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we cannot get back from them after 14 days).

All refunds taking place within 14 days of the close of the campaign are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. Refunds taking place 14 days after the close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card, at our discretion.

Street Masters was fulfilled in June/July 2018 and has since received critical acclaim, resulting in it selling out. Thus this Kickstarter's theme is not only to offer new content and a great (and highly demanded) storage solution, but also to print more inventory from our first campaign\u2019s product lineup, giving backers a chance to get all of the things they missed the first time around, as well as allow us to get non-exclusive items to mass retail.\n\nCurrently, Brook City is in production at the manufacturer. Per our recent updates, we've approved all samples and they are in mass production, about 5 months early! Though we aren't physically involved until mass production is finished, it's equally important that we continue to communicate with them and our backers in order to provide the latest updates and news. Aftershock is extremely exciting, but we are also just as excited and committed to bringing Brook City to our backers' tabletops as soon as possible.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts with Kickstarter campaigns, and timing is often one of the biggest obstacles, especially for smaller publishers such as ourselves.

The medium wallet is roughly 4x4.5 inches and the small is 3.5x4 inches. We know what you're thinking, are they too small to draw or write in? No. The medium wallet sketchbooks are roughly 3.5 inches square and are great to draw or write in. Everybody loves to draw or take notes on Post-It Notes and these books are larger than those, plus the square format is great for posting to Instagram :-) The small Sketch Wallet books are 2.5x3.75 which are slightly bigger than a standard sketch card. It's a fun size to draw or write in while making it a great size for even a front pocket. Each version comes in black or brown leather or black or gray canvas. Plus we threw in a tweed version just for fun. Keeping our vegan friends in mind, we picked a herringbone pattern tweed that is made from cotton, not wool. The space for the pencil or pen is actually larger than our original size wallet opening up many possibilities for new tools to carry.\nMedium leather wallets come in black or brown\nMedium fabric wallets come in brown tweed, black and gray canvas\nSmall leather wallets coming in brown or black leather\nSmall fabric wallets come in brown tweed or black and gray canvas\n If you're new to Sketch Wallet...\nSketch Wallet is a great way to always have your sketchbook with you.

Zealot is back with our third Kickstarter, bringing to life this new range, with our usual reputation for quality and jaw-droppingly detailed miniatures.\nBack in 2014 we created a new level of Dungeon scenery, using digital production methods and detailed vacuum casting. Then last year, we breathed new life into a too-long forgotten fantasy race, the Minotaurs, which we are finishing the delivery of now - with delighted backers praising the detail and quality.\nThis time, we wanted to go back to our roots and tackle real heroes and villains, characters which capture our imaginations and make us remember why we started gaming or collecting.\nWe are heavily inspired by classic RPG games; playing old fantasy games from the 80s is what started all this madness in the first place!\nSo welcome to a fusion of past and present, new and old. We are updating, modernizing and offering to you, this range of high quality miniatures traditionally sculpted by the awesome miniature artist, Boris Woloszyn.\nIf you like what you see; Read on, brave adventurer.\n We don't produce board game counters, these are not PVC pencil toppers, injection moulded in china  - we make Miniatures. Resin and Metal, these are produced the same as they were 30 years ago, cutting no corners and not skimping on quality or detail. It's not the fastest or cheapest process, but it certainly is the best. If you want Miniatures which you will cherish and still want to use in another 30 years time, then these are for you.\n We have teamed up with Boris Woloszyn, a traditional putty sculptor from Brazil, these models are made by hand, no 3D printing involved (unusually for us!). Boris has a real talent as an artist, able to bring true character to each sculpt, I'm sure you will agree.\nThese models are heavily inspired by the classic games we grew up loving and playing with our families and friends. Just take a look at the greens, all made from putty.\nProduction of Boris's sculpts is done in three materials, Standard Resin, White Metal and Premium Resin. As we unlock each material in the stretch goals, you will have a choice to add which material you want.\nStandard Resin is one for the gamer, it is on par with a lot of other companies' resin materials, the details are good but the resin is not as tough and flexible as the Premium offering. There will be more splits and parts for each model when they are produced in this material.\nWhite Metal, that fabled shiny material which is fondly remembered by older gamers. When your army weighed more than a cinder block and dropping a Dragon model on your toes resulted in a trip to the hospital.\nIt's for the gamer or painter who wants a shot of nostalgia, feeling the weight in their hands. The details are good, the models are tough and it paints well. White metal does have more gates and vents to clean up from the model than resin models.\nPremium Resin is really a superior resin. It requires very few gates and vents, has a nice matte surface to paint, has 0.2% shrinkage and captures every detail of the original sculpt perfectly. It is tougher than Standard Resin with some flex to avoid damage. It cuts and files well when cleaning the model up or converting.\nPremium resin is the material for the serious painter or collector.\n All of the pledges you can supplement with \"Add Ons\" from the section below.\nMiniatures come in three tiers 'Hero Sized', 'Mighty Sized' and 'Monstrous Sized'. Green, Blue and Yellow Dots respectively.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, Forgotten Halls\nYou can add to your pledge with any of the following packs. Just increase your pledge by the amount needed.\nTo see each scenery piece in better detail, you can view them in our store by clicking here.\nHere is a gallery for each of the core Miniatures, stretch goal models can bee seen in the section below. The coloured dot on each image, indicates if they are \"Hero Sized\", \"Mighty Sized\" or \"Monstrous Sized\".\nEach model will come with a standard Plastic Round Base or Classic Rectangle base, as shown in the pictures. You can make your selection on the Pledge Manager after the campaign closes.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, 3DBases\n As funding progresses we will unlock stretch goals and extra miniatures. Below you can see what has been unlocked and what is the next goal coming up. The coloured dot on each image refers to the size. Green \"Hero Size\", Blue \"Mighty Size\" and Orange \"Monstrous Size\".\nWe are splitting the production into three tiers with the three types of material on offer. This should allow us to deliver to our deadlines as the load on each manufacturing method is reduced. Currently we have marked July 2019 as the delivery for this project. \nSince this is a traditionally sculpted project, Boris requires around 1 week to complete each additional sculpt, depending on how many stretch goals are unlocked, this could take a fair few months for him to complete the sculpting. You cant rush this kind of art!\nIf this is the case and we hit a lot of the planned stretch goals, we are happy to offer a split dispatch option, where the core models are dispatched early - since they are already in moulds and not far off mass production. There will be no problem delivering core models before the dispatch date.\nThen the stretch goal sculpts will follow some months later in wave 2.\nDue to the manufacture method of vacuum cast resin and spincast metals, dispatch date will depend a lot on amount that we fund. We will update this section once funding is underway and we have a better idea for how popular this will be. We do dispatch on a rolling backer ID system.\nIt may be possible to dispatch Standard Resin core miniatures ahead of the predicted delivery date.\nScenery by our friends at Manor House Workshop, 3DBases\nMAXIMUM Postage Costs\nThese are the MAXIMUM postage costs for a large pledge. For example a pledge of 50 models in White metal would be these values. 50 models in resin, the postage is around half these values.\nPostage costs start at the values which are stated on each pledge (\u00a33 UK, \u00a34 EU and \u00a35 Rest of World) If you add more models and Add ons, postage costs will increase with weight. The end postage will be calculated by the pledge manager after the campaign end.\nPlease note, metal models are around 4 times as heavy as resin.\nThe end postage costs will be calculated on the Pledge Manager, but they will not exceed the postage values in the table below. These include tracked and signed for shipping.\nBy Adam Skinner", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will produce a new range of quality resin and metal Heroes and Monsters. The risks to this project are very minimal. We do this kind of production, every day for 8 years, producing miniatures for many high profile companies. All the core set of models are already ready to start mass manufacture. \n\nWe are not new to Kickstarter; our first Kickstarter was a colossal project ~200k resin cast pieces.\nWe delivered it and it was highly praised that \"the quality was beyond amazing\" and the detail was \"phenomenal\". Certainly achieving what we set out; to bring a new level of cutting edge dungeon scenery to gamers.\nOur second project, the Minotaur Horde, we are on track to deliver the last few hundred backers inside the next 2 months, and again the feedback was overwhelmingly positive by everyone receiving their pledge. \n\nRisk#1: Speed of manufacture.\nResin and Spincast Metal are labor intensive materials to cast with. If there are many stretch goals which we hit, then Boris will need more time to sculpt them. This will push back the start of manufacture. \n\nWhile there will be no problem delivering the core models by the estimated date. If the project funds well and many goals are hit - then we will offer a split shipping option, so core models are delivered on time, then stretch goal models get delivered in a wave 2 a few months later. \n\nAside from the risk of delayed dispatch of stretch goals, the risks are very minimal.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "+ MANNA SHARER +", "descp": "A big thank you from the Twisting Catacombs backers, Zealot Miniatures and the RPG gamer community for helping us to create some awesome miniatures.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2018"}], "stat": ["39 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "+ SOLO HERO +", "descp": "One Hero-Sized Miniature of your choice, in Standard Resin.\nUpgrading material to White Metal or Premium Resin is an addition.\nHero-Sized Models are marked with a Green Dot.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["131 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a318 or more", "title": "+ ADVENTURE PARTY +", "descp": "Four Hero-Sized Miniature of your choice, in Standard Resin.\nUpgrading material to White Metal or Premium Resin is an addition.\nHero-Sized Models are marked with a Green Dot.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["334 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a362 or more", "title": "+ COLLECTOR +", "descp": "One of all the 13 models in the Core Kickstarter, in Standard Resin.

Or in the warband of any ambitious Warlord seeking fame and fortune gold and glory!\nLike walking piles of muscle held together by leather and chains and random plates of battered metal, the barbarian flings himself into the fray frothing at the mouth and shouting unintelligible obscenities. God knows they tend to die a lot so you'll need a lot of them.....so here we are!\nRed Box Games makers of awesomely designed, exquisitely sculpted and expertly cast fine fantasy 28mm scale miniatures is very proud to present!!\nWARBANDS OF WRATH AND RUIN\nWith your generous support we hope to fund the production of a series of new, finely detailed and beautifully sculpted, expertly produced,\" 28 mm \" scale barbarian miniatures which are the initial warband starter set for an all new small scale skirmish game set in a brutal, fallen fantasy world ruled by capricious Living Gods and beset by the ravages of their eternal war for survival and supremacy. The rules for the game are not quite ready for print yet but it is the goal of this campaign to fund this initial set of figures which will help us to also afford to finish the rules and get the production process for the rules and game components started.\nIn the game, Players take on the role of a powerful characters of super human or preternatural nature called \" Chosen \" in command of a small band of followers of various role and ability. These warbands , referred to in game as the \" Following \" expand in number and diversity as the Warlord grows in Power, Repute, Fortune and Favor of the Gods beginning in number between 6 and 9 followers, but growing to include as many as 24 followers at the Apex of the Chosen's Stature.\nFOLLOWERS\nThese followers may be lowly slaves, cultists, warriors, champions, and even monsters. But the core of any Chosen's following are the foot warriors.\nFOOT WARRIORS\nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any Chosen whose coin can fill their bowl or whose stature warrants following. \nPictured here still somewhat WIP these figures are semi modular for VERY expansive customization options and are cast in a very high quality lead free white metal. All modular fittings will be made in such a way as to insure easy secure assembly.\nThe items included in the pack are;\n10 barbarian foot warrior head / helm options\n6 right hand weapon options\n3 heavy weapon options\n3 heavy weapon foot warrior bodies\n5 weapon and shield foot warrior bodies\nAll this in one set for $40.00!! High quality, finely detailed metal minis for $5.00 Each!\n SOLOS\nSolos include both the companions and the Chosen themselves. These are the characters of the stories with the companions acting as a supporting role to the Chosen. Please note that any one of the foot warriors can be selected as a Solo option. \nPRIESTESS\nThe Priestess is a companion follower who serves as an intermediary between the Chosen and one of the Patron Gods of the world. Each Priestess is different and their uses can vary wildly based on the particular choices made during the creation of the character for use in the game but rest assured in this game a Chosen without some sort of spiritual aid is a Chosen set upon an arduous path.\nPictured here as a WIP the Priestess will be available in 2 different forms. One unclad and one half clad. The image above represents her unclad form. Her clad form will be slightly more modest.\nBackers can add additional copies of the Priestess to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\nBackers can also pledge for the Priestess figure ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nLESSER CHOSEN\nCurrently still WIP the Chosen will be finished very soon!\nThe Chosen are the scions of the Gods. Born from any strata of denizen in the realms these few are half mortal and half God, able to draw upon the ethereal energies of the cosmos to fuel superhuman feats of strength, speed, skill or to perform miraculous manipulations of the world around them. They can be man or woman marked by the touch of divinity with strange colored skin, hair, eyes, super human, or inhuman build or feature.\n Backers can add additional copies of Chosen to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\n Backers can also pledge for the Chosen figure(s) ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nPLEDGES\n As the funding allows I WILL add more options to the campaign. These will include Chosen of different nature to lead the Foot Warriors and companions of different role and nature to aid these Chosen in their quest for power, survival, glory, favor and fortune. I do not anticipate being able to add other foot warrior types to this campaign BUT I DO have plans for other various types of foot warrior to expand the range of theme of the game through future campaigns if this campaign does not reach a level of funding to allow them to be added during this campaign.\nBackers are free to add as many sets of foot warrior as they desire. This is accomplished by simply managing the amount of their pledge upward by enough value to cover multiple sets.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIt is our hope to be able to expand the total offering of this campaign to include Chosen and Companions of different character such as an Amazon, a Mutant, a Beast Man, and a Hoplite, as well as a Sorceror, Sorceress, Priestess and Mystic as well as different head options for the Human foot warriors, and possibly other foot warrior themes as well! We can only do this as funding allows however and we will need to cover the costs of each new addition BEFORE it is a selectable add-on or substitution.\nPRODUCTION\nWe have been producing miniatures in metal and resin for a long time..... 10 years actually. And in that time we have established strong stable partnerships with some of the best contractors in the industry. This project will be handled by one of those awesome professionals as well insuring promptly delivered awesomeness so that you can get started playing your games while the excitement is still fresh! This contractor is VERY well established in the industry having delivered in a timely fashion to high levels of quality on several very large products including many of my own Kickstarter projects. Their system of manufacture is very well tested and efficient to make sure that delivery is handled swiftly. And being based in the US this means no lengthy delays in delivery, and no unexpected complications in that process.\nSHIPPING\nWe will not accept any payment for postage through the kickstarter. So please be aware that all of the money you add to your pledge WILL be applied to a reward selection and NOT to the postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. I have learned the hard way several times that trying to predict the postage costs of rewards packages can very easily become a serious problem. \nYou will be billed for postage during the pledge manager phase of fulfillment which will be very shortly before delivery commences. We work to keep the postage costs as low as possible and we will be certain that your rewards are securely packaged so as to avoid any damage in transit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been working in the miniatures industry since 2006 and have been operating my own business producing miniatures since 2008. In that time I have produced several hundred different unique figures and shipped thousands of packages around the world. I have also established very close working relationships with several of the best contractors in the business.\nThere are always certain risks in any production but I feel that with my experience and relationships I can confidently say there is very minimal risk involved in this kickstarter due to the sheer amount of experience I have in making minis and the reliability and experience of my casting contractor. There may be certain fixes needed for optimal casting of the figures and there may be production delays as these fixes are made. If the project's scope grows beyond the initial offering it could also result in further delays as all fo the product is readied for delivery. The most reasonable risk I could assume worth being worries about would be a delay in postage or a sudden drastic increase in postage costs.

God knows they tend to die a lot so you'll need a lot of them.....so here we are!\nRed Box Games makers of awesomely designed, exquisitely sculpted and expertly cast fine fantasy 28mm scale miniatures is very proud to present!!\nWARBANDS OF WRATH AND RUIN\nWith your generous support we hope to fund the production of a series of new high quality, finely detailed and beautifully sculpted, expertly produced DURABLE and SUPPLE RESIN cast \" 28 mm \" scale barbarian miniatures which are the initial warband starter set for an all new small scale skirmish game set in a brutal, fallen fantasy world ruled by capricious Living Gods and beset by the ravages of their eternal war for survival and supremacy. The rules for the game are not quite ready for print yet but it is the goal of this campaign to fund this initial set of figures which will help us to also afford to finish the rules and get the production process for the rules and game components started.\nIn the game Players take on the role of a powerful characters of super human or preternatural nature called \" Chosen \" in command of a small band of followers of various role and ability. These warbands , referred to in game as the \" Following \" expand in number and diversity as the Warlord grows in Power, Repute, Fortune and Favor of the Gods beginning in number between 6 and 9 followers, but growing to include as many as 24 followers at the Apex of the Chosen's Stature.\nThese followers may be lowly slaves, cultists, warriors, champions, and even monsters. But the core of any Chosen's following are the foot warriors.\nFOOT WARRIORS\nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any \nThe foot warriors are the most basic type of warrior follower. They are sparely equipped and basically trained and able. They are non specific to the character of their Chosen and can be of many different races or creature types but the first set of Foot Warriors we want to fund are the Human foot warriors. Rippling muscle and ready to slay in the name of any\nThese figures are semi modular for VERY expansive customization options and are cast in a very high quality DURABLE RESIN that is VERY similar in feel and nature to HIPS but with the detail fidelity of Resin. We are VERY excited about this.\nThe items included in the pack are;\n10 Human Warrior head / helm options\n8 right hand weapon options ( 2 clubs, 2 swords, 1 spear, 2 axes, 1 javelin )\n4 heavy / long weapon options ( 1 spear, 1 club, 1 sword, 1 axe )\n5 weapon and shield warrior bodies\n1 weapon and javelin warrior body\n2 heavy weapon warrior bodies\n2 long weapon warrior bodies\nAll this in one set for $55.00!! High quality, finely detailed resin minis for $5.50 Each!\nPRIESTESS\nThe Priestess a companion follower who serves as an intermediary between the Chosen and one of the Patron Gods of the world. Each Priestess is different and their uses can vary wildly based on the particular choices made during the creation of the character for use in the game but rest assured in this game a Chosen without some sort of spiritual aid is a Chosen set upon an arduous path.\nThe Priestess is an automatic addition to any \" Foot Warriors \" pledge and is available in two different forms; Unclad ( pictured above ) and half clad ( not yet pictured ). Her Unclad form is kickstarter exclusive and will not be available outside of the kickstarter. Backers will be able to select which form of figure they want to receive as part of their rewards in the pledge manager phase of the fulfillment.\nBackers can add additional copies of the Priestess to their existing pledge for an additional $8 per copy desired.\nBackers can also pledge for the Priestess figure ONLY if they so choose for $8 per copy desired.\nPLEDGES\nTo keep the campaign simple there is only one pledge level available from the outset of the campaign. As the funding allows I WILL add more options to the campaign. These will include Chosen of different nature to lead the Foot Warriors and companions of different role and nature to aid these Chosen in their quest for power, survival, glory, favor and fortune. I do not anticipate being able to add other foot warrior types to this campaign BUT I DO have plans for other various types of foot warrior to expand the range of theme of the game.\nBackers are free to add as many sets of foot warrior as they desire. This is accomplished by simply managing the amount of their pledge upward by enough value to cover multiple sets.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIt is our hope to be able to expand the total offering of this campaign to include Chosen and Companions of different character such as an Amazon, A Mutant, a Beast Man, and a Hoplite, as well as a Sorceror, Sorceress, Priestess and Mystic as well as different head options for the Human foot warriors, and possibly other foot warrior themes as well! We can only do this as funding allows however and we will need to cover the costs of each new addition BEFORE it is a selectable add-on or substitution.\nPRODUCTION\nWe have been producing miniatures in metal and resin for a long time..... 10 years actually. And in that time we have established strong stable partnerships with some of the best contractors in the industry. This project will be handled by one of those awesome professionals as well insuring promptly delivered awesomeness so that you can get started playing your games while the excitement is still fresh! This contractor is VERY well established in the industry having delivered in a timely fashion to high levels of quality on several very large products. Their system of manufacture is very well tested and efficient to make sure that delivery is handled swiftly. And being based in the US this means no lengthy delays in delivery, and no unexpected complications in that process.\nSHIPPING\nWe will not accept any payment for postage through the kickstarter. So please be aware that all of the money you add to your pledge WILL be applied to a reward selection and NOT to the postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. I have learned the hard way several times that trying to predict the postage costs of rewards packages can very easily become a serious problem. \nYou will be billed for postage during the pledge manager phase of fulfillment which will be very shortly before delivery commences. We work to keep the postage costs as low as possible and we will be certain that your rewards are securely packaged so as to avoid any damage in transit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have been working in the miniatures industry since 2006 and have been operating my own business producing miniatures since 2008. In that time I have produced several hundred different unique figures and shipped thousands of packages around the world. I have also established very close working relationships with several of the best contractors in the business.\n\n There are always certain risks in any production but I feel that with my experience and relationships I can confidently say there is very minimal risk involved in this kickstarter due to the sheer amount of experience I have in making minis and the reliability and experience of my casting contractor. There may be certain fixes needed for optimal casting of the figures and there may be production delays as these fixes are made. If the project's scope grows beyond the initial offering it could also result in further delays as all fo the product is readied for delivery. The most reasonable risk I could assume worth being worries about would be a delay in postage or a sudden drastic increase in postage costs. An Increase in postage costs is VERY unlikely though as the time frame between funding and delivery on this project will be very short.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "tre manor\n17 created \u00b7 57 backed\nI am a sculptor of table top miniature figures for fantasy gaming.

Also for JUST $40.00 USD.\n     See? Not much math stuff, lots of Orcs and Goblins. Who needs them book learnin talkie times anyways? Not Gobbers and Orcsies don't.\n     It is our hope that as the campaign progresses we can add items to the offering and perhaps to the initial box contents as well HOWEVER as this is our first effort in plastic manufacturing we want to be sure we are responsible and take this slowly keeping everything nice and predictable and efficiently produced and delivered. So there will only be a few additions to this campaigns. We don't want to get too ahead of ourselves with promises but we also want to make sure we make the most of this campaign that we can. You CAN NOT go wrong with more and more monstrous beasties eh?\n\n    Please be aware you can buy as many of these boxes as you want! Personally I don't think any orc or goblin warband is complete unless it nearly breaks the shelves under it's ponderous weight when stowed away between sessions of rampaging blood thirst. \n   If you want to add to your rewards you can do so by managing the amount of your pledge upward by enough to cover the addition of as many green hellions your heart desires. \n  And remember a forest without goblins under every hedge is just not a forest worth trodding through for any self respecting adventurer!

THE HORDES OF THE AULD WORLD ORCS AND GOBLINS BOXED SET!!\n   The whole idea of this kickstarter is to fund the production of these fantastic monstrosities in high detail hard grade PVC plastic similar to many of the newly beloved board games recently hitting the market like a spiked ball of steel in the gnarly green fist of a feral Orc berserker rampaging through the ranks of silly tights wearing doods who spend all their time preening their poofy feathered hats and shining their armor and dancing with their little swishy poke \" swords \" and singing songs about damsels and wine and stupid stuff. Do we really want those kinds of doods in charge of stuff and ruining our good time? No. No we do not. We want Orcs and goblins. Lots of them. That is why plastic is good; cause we can make a LOT of them and sell them cheap.\n\n  So to help us do this well we need your help to allow us to pay the high cost of plastic production with tried and true manufacturers who have produced many of these exact same great boxed game projects.\n   Ok this is serious. Shipping is important and can be costly depending upon where in the world you need your stuff to be delivered to. Because we do not know exactly when the project will complete production we cannot bill for postage until the product is actually in hand and ready to deliver. We are working to build a base frame of reference for the shipping costs and we are also working to establish relationships that may allow us to ship from hubs in various parts of the world to mitigate those costs. \n   We will work to keep the postage costs as low as possible cause we don't really want to make money from shipping we just want to get your stuff to you as soon as possible cause once you know you have orcs and goblins on the way.... well they just need to get there fast and cheap right? \n   For now though the only region in which we can reasonably project postage costs is the US. We will be shipping orders via priority mail so as long as your stuff fits into a priority box ( and we will be working to make sure that they do ) you can expect to pay the priority mail shipping rates.\nAnd Say!

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our Kickstarters, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital.

The game features highly detailed miniatures and the Modular Deck System (MDS) introduced in Street Masters. In the game, players take on the role of heroic cops inspired by classic action movies and are tasked with protecting the city from the recent rise in criminal activity. Each game is dictated by the chosen criminal deck and case deck. These decks are modular and the different combinations of decks create unique experiences each game.\nThe game is played on a beautifully illustrated board of the city, where the cops must run or drive to various locations and bust up crimes. While cops start the game with a standard issue B.C.P.D. Cruiser, they can also commandeer many other types of vehicles on the streets of Brook City.\nEach cop in Brook City plays differently thanks to each having their own unique cop deck. Cop decks include encounter cards, ability cards, and tactic cards to represent each cop\u2019s unique strengths and strategy to take on the criminals underworld.\nWhile the cops try to crack the case, their prime suspect is represented by the criminal deck. Each criminal deck contains at least 1 suspect card, as well as a slew of crime cards that spawn crew members around the city to interfere with your detective work. If cops ignore these criminal masterminds while trying to pin the crime on them, things may just get seriously out of hand\u2026\nCase decks represent the cops\u2019 overall goal of the game. While keeping the criminal under control, they must also concentrate on working their way through the case. Each case has special rules governing how cops can interact with clue cards and get their hands on enough evidence to bring the criminal to justice. In addition to clue cards, case decks include a variety of events that are designed to hinder the cops or punish them for not making enough progress solving the case.\nYou don\u2019t have to take our word on how the game plays. Please click HERE to read a draft of the rulebook.\nBrook City features a variety of highly detailed miniatures, which are used to mark the location of the cops, criminals, and crew throughout the city. With our experience producing miniatures in our previous game, Street Masters, we are confident in the level of detail and overall quality of the miniatures that will be in this game. While we were extremely happy with the miniatures in Street Masters, we learned some tricks to improve them even more for Brook City.\n         Blacklist Games is committed to publishing only high quality games. Please watch this video of Adam and Brady unboxing a production copy of Street Masters:\nAs you can see from the video, great care was taken to ensure every component was of the best quality possible. Backers of this campaign can feel confident that the same amount of care and attention to detail will be taken with Brook City as well.\nLike many other publishers, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to to you all since final shipping sizes are unpredictable with a growing campaign. Plus this gives more room to pool into stretch goals and as much cool gameplay stuff as we possibly can.\nAfter manufacturing, we'll ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Following, is a rough estimate for shipping a standard game package (approx. 4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any add-ons you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. ($30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.)\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $15-20 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia, Singapore, or Indonesia).\nOCEANIA: $15-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. AFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries. $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. $60 to Iceland and Israel. $45 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for our shipping/fulfillment partner to ship to such as Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan. Due to that we will not ship to these areas.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFollowing our successful campaign for Street Masters: Rise of the Kingdom, we've taken what we've learned from production, shipping and fulfillment to strive for an even smoother experience from start to finish, continuing to focus on overall quality.\n\nThere are a lot of moving parts from the Kickstarter, production, manufacture, to fulfillment, then distribution. Timing seems to be one of the biggest obstacles in many campaigns, especially from small, indie publishers such as ourselves. Fortunately, we've got experienced game designers working hard to ensure the gameplay offers the best experience it can be; we have strong relations with the factory/manufacture; we have a shipment/fulfillment company already signed on; we are completely passionate about our games; and most important, we care about our backers.\n\nWe also understand there may still be confusion about our first campaign, as it was a card game that we cancelled. It didn't receive the momentum it needed due to us purchasing the rights from a publisher that has not had much luck in the industry. Currently we're developing an app for the game and tightening up some of the original rules and cards in order to release it under our brand at a future date. Doing this will give us the time we need to ensure that the game will make a great edition to our library as well as yours.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 89 or more", "title": "Rookie Tier", "descp": "Included is the Core Game designed by Adam and Brady Sadler with 51 miniatures, 341 cards, a beautiful game board of Brook City, custom dice, and all Unlocked Stretch Goals!\nINCLUDES:\nAll Unlocked Stretch Goals\nBrook City \"Core\" Game", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["125 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 109 or more", "title": "Officer Tier", "descp": "Included is the Core Game designed by Adam and Brady Sadler plus the Exclusive \"Keys to the Kingdom\" expansion that stars Ying Hua and Ah Long (from Street Masters) in a unique storyline that brings you even more content and even 3 crossover cards that make their Brook City version playable in Street Masters!

They had been curious of course, and there was much speculation as to what was on the other side, but as the hill had been inhabited by Gnomes who didn't take kindly to such impudent questions, the matter was largely left alone.\nNow, seemingly in the middle of the night, the gnomes have disappeared, and the big question (apart from where have all the gnomes gone) of what lies on the other side of the hill is now very much the talk of the town.  Some think it might be an orchard, full of apples.  Others, that a very big dragon has eaten all the gnomes and may well be coming for them next.\nThe Halfling Town Council declared an emergency meeting, and decided there's only one way to be sure - an adventure.  Under such dire circumstances, they are seeking brave (or at least moderately confident) adventurers, from different backgrounds to form a Party (the very worst kind, without cake or even paper hats) to investigate the other side of the hill...\nNinjas in the Pantry - Stretch Goal Unlocked!\nWe are very pleased to announce that we have made our stretch goal to unlock the Halfling Ninja class!

It had been decided however, that eager though the bakers were, they were far too vital to the town to risk, and that something else was needed. At that moment, from out of the shadows of the room, two totally silent black-clad figures triple back-flipped into the interview chairs.\n\"And you are...\"\nAs suggested by one of our loyal customers, we present a male and female halfling ninja from one of the more obscure character classes. \nShould we reach \u00a37000, then we will include one of each miniature free with every Halfling Lady and Gentlemen Adventurers pledge, and the appropriate one free with each Ladies or Gentlemen Adventurers pledge.  Backers who pledge for a single or double miniature set will be able to choose one of these miniatures as one of their options.\nMidlam Miniatures are pleased to present a collection of sixteen 28mm scale halfling miniatures for use in all of your fantasy games.\nChoosing Your Class\nWe have chosen a range of different character classes for the 'A Class of Their Own' Kickstarter, which we hope will help flesh out your fantasy adventures. However, while we couldn't include all the possible choices in the campaign, we will consider any suggestions for a follow up Kickstarter in the future, should this Kickstarter is successful.  Please leave any suggestions (from the obvious to the obscure) in the comments page!\nAbout Midlam Miniatures and Our Kickstarters \nThis is our ninth Kickstarter, and we are using it to help develop and extend our range of miniatures, in this case, halflings! \nWe have been very grateful to all the support we have received in the past and hope you will join us on our latest project. Our eight previous Kickstarters - Wizard Apprentices, Wizard Halflings, Cultists of the Kraken Lord, Servants of the Undead Pharaoh, Halfling Adventures, Winter Adventurers, Common or Garden Gnomes and the Ghosts of Midlam Manor have all successfully funded.\nA Note on Metal\nThe miniatures are cast in a high quality pewter, with a high Tin content, but may contain a small quantity of lead. We unfortunately cannot guarantee lead free models. Most 'lead free' metal usually contains a small amount of lead to help the metal flow into the mould. \nAnticipated Delivery Date\nThe delivery date of July 2018, is our shipping date, rather than an arrival date. As we ship all over the world, delivery times will vary considerably, even within the same countries. From our experience, the majority of deliveries take as little as a couple of days (UK), to a couple of weeks (international) although we have found a minority of deliveries can take up to (and in rare cases more than) a month to arrive. We ask you to please be patient as it is our experience that almost all deliveries do arrive safely at their destination. \n All images and miniatures are \u00a92018 Midlam Miniatures.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks are low, though there is always a small chance that, for one reason or another, a figure does not cast properly.\n\nIn these unlikely circumstances we would either get a replacement mould or commission a sculpt by the original sculptor, matching the original as closely as possible, with whatever modifications are necessary for the miniatures to cast correctly.\n\nShould this happen, the estimated release date of July 2018 for all miniatures could be pushed back by a month or two until any problem was fixed. Although, across all eight of our Kickstarters, we have only had one serious issue with a miniature, which in the end, only added a couple of weeks to shipping.\n\nWe strive to keep people updated at all stages of production to let them know how the manufacturing is going.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a33 or more", "title": "The Lone Adventurer", "descp": "Sponsor the Halfling Town Council to send one Adventurer on the Great Expedition.\nBy choosing this reward you will receive 1 Halfling Miniature of your choice as a reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["7 backers", "Limited (93 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a36 or more", "title": "An Adventuring Duo", "descp": "Sponsor the Halfling Town Council to send two Adventurers on the Great Expedition.\nBy choosing this reward you will receive 2 Halfling Miniatures of your choice as a reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["50 backers", "Limited (50 left of 100)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Halfling Gentlemen Adventurers", "descp": "Sponsor the Halfling Town Council to send 8 Halfling Gentlemen Adventurers on the Great Expedition.\nBy choosing this reward you will receive all 8 Halfling Gentlemen Miniatures as your reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["10 backers", "Limited (490 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a320 or more", "title": "Halfling Lady Adventurers", "descp": "Sponsor the Halfling Town Council to send 8 Halfling Lady Adventurers on the Great Expedition.\nBy choosing this reward you will receive all 8 Halfling Lady Miniatures as your reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (494 left of 500)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a335 or more", "title": "Halfling Lady and Gentlemen Adventurers", "descp": "Sponsor the Halfling Town Council to send all 16 Halfling Adventurers on the Great Expedition.\nBy choosing this reward you will receive all 8 Halfling Lady Miniatures and all 8 Halfling Gentlemen Adventurers as your reward.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["248 backers", "Limited (252 left of 500)"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "High Priests, Explorers and Bandaged Wrapped Undead in 'To the Mummy's Tomb' Expedition", "update_content": "To the Mummy's Tomb!\nIntroducing a series of  Eight Fantasy Miniatures in 28mm scale from a halfling expedition to the burial grounds of their cousins, in the desert southlands."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "How, a Class of Their Own, gave rise to latest project Classic Cloaked Halflings", "update_content": "We had a great reception to this oddball bunch of halflings, so thank you all again for your support.

Thrall and Brute\nSpetznaz Greens are Done\n The US mech armed with pile driver and grenade launcher will have this frame.  \nPLAY\n\nUS and Russian Mechs\nRussian Mechs\nUS Mechs\nHello Kickstarter Patrons,\nWe at Impulse Miniatures are looking to kick start our first miniature game \"The Evolved\".  This 28mm mech focused game gives you control over mechs, infantry vehicles and The Evolved.  The game play is fast paced, full of tactics, and strategy.  The setting is based in the modern day with some futuristic advancements.  Players can look to see modern day weapons and vehicle designs.  The story is something new that we believe players will find fresh and intense, and we can\u2019t wait to share it with you.\nAfter the Kickstarter we will continue to produce models for the 3 armies and have another army in the works. There are several additional units currently planned for each army.  The US army has an infantry team with large caliber sniper rifle, anti tank gun team, and anti infantry gun team. For US mechs, an anti infantry mech, a leader only mech, and a close quarters mech with pile driver.  For the Russians, a heavy cannon team, RPG team, and mortar team.  For the Russian mechs, a riot shield and shotgun armed mech, leader mech, and one armed with high explosive rockets.  The evolved will gain a heavy armored infantry unit, an infantry unit with ranged weapon, a faster moving large creature, and one with ranged.  These will be added as additional stretch goals if the kickstarter reaches all of the current stretch goals.  All of the current stretch goals and the ones mentioned above are in the rule book, and will be included in the pdf rules sent to all backers.  A printed rule book will be available shortly after the kickstarter as well.  \nThe evolved are humans that have the ability to control nanite swarms.  After being experimented on by scientists from the US, they broke free.  In their wake they left cities in ruins.  They lead armies of humans that  have been taken over by the nanites.  The nanites change the humans from the inside out.  The evolved brutes are formed from the melding of nanites with larger beasts and in other cases several human hosts.  They are the wrecking balls of the evolved armies.  The evolved have also learned how to use nanites to take control of mechs whose pilots have been killed but are otherwise still operable.  They are less accurate and agile, but provide  needed ranged attacks to the evolved armies.  The evolved army is a swarm army with powerful technomancers able to deal damage and heal thanks to their nanite abilities.  \nSo far we have the US, and Russian Mechs completed and ready for production. This Kickstarter will be funding the infantry and expansions. This is just the beginning of The Evolved universe with many more units and models planned for the future!  Our manufacturer is US based and used by many other companies with a proven track record.  \nThank you for being apart of our Kickstarter and helping us to bring The Evolved to life.\nSTRETCH GOALS!!!!\n$8500 \nRussian Mech with Howitzer\nRussian Howitzer\nUS Mech with High Caliber Rifle\nUS Heavy Rifle\n $10,000- \n-US Stingray variant armed with pile driver and grenade launcher\n-Russian Black Bear Variant armed with riot shield and automatic shotgun\n$12,000\n- US Infantry Heavy Armor Squad.

Evolved Leaders are strong technomancers able to control swarms of nanites, transforming fallen enemies into servants of their wil, interfering with the systems of enemy mechs, and even creating brutes from fallen enemies and nanite swarms.  \nThis is the first miniature for the evolved, and to celebrate every backer will receive this model for free.\n$18000\n-The Evolved infantry.  Assimilation of human and nanites, these creatures serve the will of the Technomancers.  They are quick, able to heal damage and deadly up close.  \n$20000\n-The Evolved Brute.  Massive creatures created by the technomancers.  They tower at over 10 feet tall.  Metallic protrusions, incredible strength, ability to heal wounds.  They are horrendous creatures to encounter in the field.  Able to tear a mech apart with brute strength.  \n$25000\n-To celebrate the initial models for The Evolved miniatures game being funded, Every backer will receive a Kickstarter only SGT Jack Savage Model.\n$30,000\n-The Evolved Corrupted mech.  The strongest technomancers are able to overcome mechs and their pilots taking control of the mech and corrupting it to their will.  These are less accurate and responsive than normal mechs, but provide much needed ranged support to the evolved armies.  \n$35,000\n-Japanese Mech.  Japanese mechs are the most nimble and agile of the mechs.  The have the most overdrive points of all the mechs, and the highest evasion roll.  \n$37,500\n-Japanese Infantry.

Civilization for Sauracens has risen to celestial heights and fallen to their archaic origins many times as their knowledge ebbs and flows as with the cycles of the great celestial mechanism. Those retaining knowledge of archaic technologies still travel the stars searching for the mythical home of their origin to which they are instinctively as a species driven to return. As the navigator/priests identify each newly discovered planet, they pray to the celestial consciences that the long lost home of their origin will finally be rediscovered and bring some peace to the wander lust they have not yet managed to suppress.\nMETALS\n This project is for unpainted, white metal figurines. Models are provided NOT painted. Models are scaled to 28mm toe to eye or 1:60. Models are provided with a plastic tab/slot base. White metal figurines are not toys and are intended only for adults.

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our Kickstarters, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital. What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures with capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day. All molding and casting is done in house by our dedicated staff of three well experienced individuals. Only the sculpting is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. We have, so far, completed 5 Kickstarter projects and a 6th project on track for completion before the end of this campaign. A quick look at our previous Kickstarters will show that we shipped rewards to backers well ahead of schedule. We believe we have a 100% backer satisfaction record after five successful kickstarters and a 6th one in process.

We have returned again to kickstarter in the hopes to fund our newest selection of fantasy norse figures that we call the Njorn. \n  Our intention is to fund the production of a new set of heroes and their faithful follower rank and file troops. We also intend to fund the set up of our in house production capacity! This means buying a spin caster, a smelter, all the various periphery of safe casting, metal shelves to hold molds ( LOTS of molds ) having our molds shipped to us from the various contractors we currently partner with, and raw metal to do the casting with. Being set up for in house production will allow us to reinvest in the various aspects that will make your experience with Red Box Games more efficient and better presented, as well as allow us to manage our working capital MUCH more efficiently.\n  We currently reinvest a disproportionate amount of our profits into maintaining reasonable stock levels across the entire breadth of the red box games line. This is a HUGE investment that grows every time we add new products to the line. It also means we have to rely on kickstarters much more because we simply cannot afford to just put new items in to the store without knowing that the funds are already there to pay for the production and stocking of said items.\n\n  Once set up for casting we will be able to keep the funds of the business' success where it belongs, in the future of the business. It also has the added advantage of allowing us to afford lower prices across the board and able to take chances on items which are too risky to produce through out sourcing such as larger monsters and cavalry and Rank and File sets appropriately priced for army building. \n\n  To insure that the high level of quality you have come to expect from Red Box Games is faithfully maintained, I will be training in casting with a VERY talented and experienced mold maker and caster. I wont be handling the entire burden of casting right away so there is no need to worry that this development will slow down delivery of the Kickstarter or the regular course of business for RBG.\n\n  My molds will continue to be made by one of the industry's best studios as well so there is no need to worry that the burden will overwhelm me or that the overall quality of the Red Box Games product will suffer.\n\n  I cannot do any of this without your help so please consider backing this kickstarter! You will get some really cool stuff for a GREAT price in a reasonable amount of time and I will FINALLY be able to set up for my own production and make some real progress in this industry!\n\n  AAAaaannndddd without further Adieu...... ON TO THE MINIATURES!!!\n We intend to fund as many figures as this kickstarter will allow and at the outset of the campaign we have 19 figures ready to go with a few slight details needing to be added before they are ready for production and I still have several more underway which will be shown as they are completed and added to the campaign as the funding allows. \n   Please se as follows for the full selection of miniatures offered in this campaign;\n  KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE!! Thorarnr the Storm Hammer!!\n  available as a free addition to all pledges of Warband or Alla Njorngarna but available as a selection option or $8 add-on as well!\n       Any of the miniatures shown above can be selected as singular selections. or the entire group can be selected. \n Backers can pledge for an entire warband ( 25 figures in total as of the launch of the campaign ) cast in high quality white metal, or pick and choose individual figures from the selection funded by this campaign.\nHERO ..................This pledge level rewards backers with 1 copy of any one of the figures successfully funded through this campaign cast in high quality white metal.\nCOUNCIL.......

However some figures may need to be cast in multiple parts to allow for the most reliable casting. These figures will also be cast in high quality lead free white metal as well.\n All packages will be shipped in BOXES rather than envelopes with any appropriate extra packaging needed to insure your rewards are delivered perfectly intact. It is my hope to also be able to invest in some fancy schmancy marketing materials and snazzy packaging to go in with your beautiful Red Box games minis.\nAll packages will be fullfilled from the United States. Postage will be collected within the kickstarter pledge. However it is not always possible to predict when / if postage costs increase to deliver to foreign countries. As a result we must reserve the right to bill for any additional postage needed to cover the shipment of your rewards. We do not try to profit from the postage of our packages and will always keep the cost of delivery exactly in line with the actual costs.\n For those who are unfamiliar with me as a sculptor and with my business red box games I am a sculptor of finely detailed 28mm scale fantasy miniatures.

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our last Kickstarter at more than double the funding level, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital. What better way to participate in creating the miniatures you want while supporting the hobby we love?\nKicktraq\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and Challenges\n\nThere is practically no chance of this project not being fulfilled once the successful funding level is reached. Fortress Figures is one of the oldest professional miniatures production companies with more than three decades of experience casting the finest white metal miniatures and capabilities for casting several thousand figures per day. All molding and casting is done in house by our dedicated staff of three well experienced individuals. Only the sculpting and printing is outsourced and the sculpting portion of the project is already completed. We have again, allowed ourselves what we consider to be an extraordinarily abundant amount of time to complete this project. We have, so far, completed 4 Kickstarter projects.

Lead the sinister Wretched Hive in a dangerous criminal underground, or find yourself entangled in the strange motives of the inscrutable Wilderkin.\nThe Wretched Hive Kickstarter campaign offers the opportunity to add amazing new characters to Relicblade. New Faction Sets not only present the chance to expand the game, but also offer a great entry point for new players. The Wretched Hive Kickstarter campaign promises to deliver all-new factions, characters, unit types, upgrades, and powerful magic spells. These faction sets have been meticulously designed to add exciting new play-styles to Relicblade!\nGet both of the new expansions and eight incredible metal miniatures with the recommended Bold Adventurer pledge level!\n The Wretched Hive\nIn The Wretched Hive we delve into the sinister underworld that exists on the fringes of society.\nThe iguan are a ubiquitous reptilian race whose myths claim a primordial origin predating all human civilization. The pragmatic iguan do not build cities of their own, but rather opt to live in nomadic groups operating with a network of semi-permanent encampments on the outskirts of large cities. Traveling bands will meet to trade with the settled iguan, who in turn offer goods and services to the wider markets. \nDue to their peculiar psychology many iguan find full integration into civilized life distasteful and traditionally work as laborers and sailors. They never shy from dangerous work, and take special pride in their ability to endure. Despite the obvious value of strong workers, the complex cruelty of civilization has branded the iguan as the lowest class. Merchants gain hordes of wealth while the workers struggle to survive. \nIn the absence of true justice, following the law is a luxury few can afford. Thus we enter the vile black markets of the Wretched Hive. Where cruelty is the law and only the strong survive. \nThe slave trade is perhaps the most depraved of the black market practices. The legality of slavery may vary from kingdom to kingdom, but legal status only truly changes how public the slave auctions are. \nThe Iguan Slavers are powerful fighters and bitter task masters.These depraved individuals offer harsh motivation to their comrades in brutal fashion. Slavers are rightly feared for the sinister depths of their inhumanity.\nPoachers are almost universally nomadic in origin. Many ply their humble, if illegal, trade as hunters. However, in the harsh depths of the black market, not every poachable entity is a beast.\nThe brutal wilderness takes its toll on nomadic tribes. In the harshest seasons many poachers turn their unmatched skill as scouts and trackers to the benefit of dangerous crime lords. With highly valuable skills and keen javelins, these deadly warriors are rightly prized.\nAccording to their customs a select few are chosen and groomed from birth to assume a terrible duty. The elder crone prepares these youth for many years. Until the fateful day they must read from the unpronounceable black pages of agog. The black pages tether the iguan to their primordial gods. As the chosen study the dizzying passages their inner minds are assailed by terrible dimensions beyond reality. \nSadly, many are utterly consumed by madness. Those who survive are honored and assume their place as iguan witches. These witches are respected councilors and powerful sorcerers. They peer into the void to observe the threads of fate, command plagues, and call upon the boiling depths of the earth. These powerful women form an integral core of iguan political and religious society.\nNomadic iguan have formed strange alliances in their bid for survival. One such partnership is with a the mangrove basilisk. A long snouted sub-species endemic to the brackish badlands.\nThese cold-blooded beasts have a near super-natural hypnotic gaze and are extremely venomous. The Iguan Witches made connections with the beasts and have used them as powerful assets for generations. These pitiless creatures grant an exotic edge to an iguan fighting force. They paralyze combatants as swift warriors descend upon their ill-fated foe.\nThe Wilderkin\nWilderkin is a broad term describing individuals of fay ancestry. Elves, while rare, are the most common in settled society. However, the term Wilderkin is often reserved for more conspicuous outlanders.\nIt is generally believed that the fay realm and ours were more closely tied in ancient times. In the terrible cataclysm known as the sundering, when great empires were brought low and from which there is only a faint hope of recovery, the relationship between realms was irrevocably changed. In this new and unstable landscape the otherworldly races adapted in strange and marvelous ways. From the peculiar gnomes to the indomitable stonekin, the Wilderkin abide by their inscrutable ways.\nGnomes are largely unchanged by our changed world. Gnome interactions have always been centered on their fanatical devotion to craft. These pint-sized hobbyists have only the slightest concern for the greater world. They are even known to forget entirely the plight of our modern age! Instead they focus with razor precision on mastery of a given craft. \nGnomes are still intimately tied to the fay realm and may even travel between worlds. Accordingly they are visitors with minor alliances to a select few. It seems their primary endeavor in our world is to explore their passions. Once a gnome fixates on a craft they are utterly obsessed. They may be captivated by anything from shoe-making to the most complex alchemical sciences.\nDue to their tiny stature, gnomes rarely travel without an animal companion. They have been seen riding everything from common mountain goats to exotic creatures only imagined in the most obscure folklore.\nThe stonekin were elves once. In the tumultuous years when civilization collapsed a sect of mystical artisans took extreme measures to survive. In desperation they placed irreversible enchantments on their families, forever changing their bodies to lifeless stone.\nWith a faint hope the artisans went to work. Employing unknowably ancient secrets, once used to create marvels beyond reckoning, the artisans worked into the fading twilight of all civilization to finish their final masterpiece. The world burned, but the work was complete.\nThe stonekin were born. The artisans had saved their beloved people. A new race, half-elf and half-stone, arose. They were completely alive, not living statues or enchanted stone. The stonekin were reforged in the fires of a dying world, and emerged a race fit to survive in the coming dark age.\nThe Battleborn comfortably faces multiple combatants.\nMany stonekin live peaceful lives as farmers and artisans. However the brutality of the changed world demands certain concessions. The battleborn are a reserved caste of fearless warriors. They stand as the definition of stonekin fortitude and strength. The stonekin battleborn are imposing giants hardened for the rigors of battle.\nSummon explosive stone spires to smash your enemies.\nThe wild elves owe their earnest allegiance to nature and regarded the sundering as a natural shift. Embracing the chaotic heart of creation, the wild elves humbly adapted in the midst of mass extinction. They plunged themselves deeper into asceticism and immersed themselves in the changed environment. Some individuals became indistinguishable from nature itself.\nThe wild elf druids adopted powerful beast forms to live in brutal harmony with the wilderness, while the geomancers tap into surging rivers of energy that course through the earth. Embracing the wilderness, the geomancers enjoy a place of privilege in a chaotic world. Though they are wanderers in a savage wilderness, geomancers compose themselves in complex formalities and are utterly dedicated to the discipline of the earth. As servents of the enigmatic wilds, the geomancers often find themselves entangled in heroic endeavors.\nThe Wilderkin follow the serpentine paths of fate. Forever entangled in the intricate patterns of an altered world. For as the wind blows, life is chaos.\nRelicblade is a fantasy skirmish miniature game. Players command heroes or monsters as they battle to claim powerful magic relics lost in the ancient world. Players only need between three and six figures per side, and games only last about a half hour. The rules are simple and easy to learn, but there is a lot of depth in the available characters and upgrades.\nEnjoy an immersive hobby experience as you collect, build, and paint your miniatures. Relicblade models are made of white metal for wonderful crisp detail. Games take place on a two foot by two foot area, so creating detailed scenery is very manageable. While beautifully modeled terrain is a delight, you can play on any surface you have available by simply using stacks of books to represent the troubled wilds of Relicblade.\nDive into delightful tactical depths with each new game. Specialize your characters utilizing a vast arsenal of upgrade cards. Tactics, items, weapons, potions, and spells create a wonderful framework to customize each character in your war party. Faction sets include a booster pack of cards with new characters and upgrades, so as each new set is released the options continue to grow with dynamic new list-building options. In the example below this Iguan Slaver has a combination of defensive and ranged attack upgrades, which shifts his battlefield role and greatly increases his survivability. This particular build includes cards from The Wretched Hive, The Lone Guard, and Core Game Deck.\nCards from the new sets will be in full-color for your viewing pleasure!\nFor players interested in narrative campaign play, the Seeker's Handbook is packed with great content. Rather than simply selecting characters and upgrades based on a point total, you will construct a base and lead your characters as they undertake dangerous adventures to claim magical treasures. There are six scenarios, four environments, dangerous wild monsters, and rare treasures that pack each game with new dangers and unique challenges. The Seeker's Handbook is a wonderful source for limitless adventure. \nBattle Pigs personally congratulate the rangers on finding the lost relic!\nYou can learn a lot more about the game and how it's played on YouTube! There are gameplay overviews, unboxings, and battle reports ready to be consumed! Ash and Owen of Guerrilla Miniature Games and Gaming With The Cooler played a full Relicblade campaign on their channels. So check it out!\nChoose the pledge level that's right for you. Remember, by backing Relicblade you're helping it exist! Get ahold of this delightfully unique miniature game. Relicblade is 100% natural, pure, and unfiltered imagination that is bottled at the source. It is untouched by the sanitizing influence of a board-room or stock-holders. Enjoy the benefits of live and active gaming cultures.\nIf you're new to Relicblade the \"Champion of Adventure\" is AWESOME! At this mega-rad pledge level you'll get the core game along with the \"Wilderkin\" and \"The Wretched Hive\" expansions. This pledge level includes twenty one metal miniatures, the rulebook, tokens, dice, and 70+ unique cards including all kinds of amazing characters, magic swords, advanced battle tactics, and powerful ancient relics from time immemorial.\n What's a Custom Character Card?\nImagine the possibilities.\nYou tell me about a D&D character you used to play or any character you can imagine. Then I will do an original illustration of that character. But the fun won't stop there! I will also stick that character in a special COLOR character card and make up some sweet rules and stats for your them! The custom card will be your ideas collaboratively realized in Relicblade. You're welcome to create heroes, villains, relics, or monsters, whatever your heart desires.\nYou get the original illustration and copies of your character card along with the other Legends from this campaign. All ten custom character commissions will be collected in the \"Legends 2\" booster pack. This booster pack will be an official expansion for Relicblade for players to collect and enjoy. The first Legends set was extremely popular, so don't miss out on being part of a new generation of legends!\nIt is my earnest hope to raise enough money to produce the two faction sets above. But within the production timeline for this project I am happy to add a little wish-list in the form of stretch goals.\nStretch goals are a great way to boost the project outcomes as the budget increases. If we raise enough money to produce the new sets, then the money we continue to raise will push toward even more new content! Newly unlocked content will be available as Add-Ons once the goal is reached.\nGuest Artist: DARKWIZARD BERSERKER\nThe Relicblade: Guest Artist Series RETURNS!! I'm beyond excited to offer another off the wall collaboration. As the creator of Relicblade I enjoy unbridled creative freedom. This privilege is granted by my generous Kickstarter Backers, so in this campaign I hope to extend the mantle of creative power to a deserving guest artist!\nTriptych by Darkwizard\nScott Wygmans is known under the name Darkwizard_Berserker on Instagram. I almost feel like that's enough to get him the job, but he deserves it for more than a badass Fighting Fantasy name. His style is both absolutely brutal and undeniably fun. He's got one foot firmly planted in heavy metal dungeon badassery and the other cheerfully placed in a fun-loving world of adventure. It's precisely this balance of light hearted savagery that makes Scott the perfect fit for Relicblade.\nI particularly love collaborating with artists with loads of style. Scott manages to evoke hardcore nostalgia of classic pen and paper gaming while always delivering something completely fresh. I encourage you to dig deep into his portfolio and let your imagination reel. It's going to be a special delight to sculpt based on his work. Let's make this happen!\nThis is a gross wizard.\nNOTE: The Shadow Fox and Gnome Alchemist are separate characters who form a cavalry pair. Now with the Ibex and Battlesmith you'll be able to swap riders and mounts to explore new combinations. As more cavalry models are released there will be more fun options to explore. \nFate of The Firstborn\n        \"The First Born King once ruled a mighty empire. His fertile lands stretched far and wide from his island borne ziggurat. His armies marched and his navy sailed, bringing tribute from the conquered. His sorcerers and alchemists sought and distilled the secrets of life. His seers and soothsayers predicted the rise and fall of mighty kings, dynasties, and empires. But for all his power and knowledge, The First Born King could not save his own.\nThe Firstborn still skulk in their hidden tombs and foul fens to this day, silent guardians of the treasures of their ancient empire. Animated by foul magics, they have remained strong and aware despite the loss of their primitive humanity.\nNow, bold adventurers and dastardly villains scour The Fens of The Firstborn in search of ancient treasure and powerful relics. From the be-swamped port city of Fen\u2019s Moore, they set out into the murky frontier to find their fate and fortune.\nJoin them if you dare, but know that wherever you go, The Firstborn will be waiting.\"\nFate of The Firstborn is an all new expansion for Relicblade!\nJust look at how cool these are in the video below. The Ancient Waystones scenario requires players track which objectives have been activated this round, and the Braziers will play a significant role in upcoming Relicblade Adventures!\nThese paint up really nicely, too. They make wonderful additions to your tabletop.\nThe additional Stone Spire miniature will be extremely useful for playing the game. I realize that most of you have the hobby skills to make as many rocks as you need. But I think an extra spire miniature will make the Geomancer more playable right out of the package. :) \nALSO. I can't believe I'm writing a stretch goal for 30k. THANK YOU!!! \nThe add-on marketplace is a way to add a few extra items to your pledge. That way you can rest assured you are getting all the Relicblade goodness you can handle.\nI highly recommend that new players pick up a copy of The Seeker's Handbook. This book contains the full rules for Relicblade, along with the awesome campaign rules. Link your games into an ongoing narrative, claim rare treasures, and assail terrible monsters on your quest to claim the mighty RELICBLADE! You and a friend will be equipped to play a full campaign with this book and the Bold Adventurer pledge level.\nNOTE: All the non-stretch goal add-ons are presently available at Relicblade.com. So if you're excited about trying the game you should place an order to get shipped to you right away! These add-ons are of particular interest to my EU friends who have had their eye on these treasures but didn't want to deal with customs. \nmnmNOTE: The terrain featured in the photographs was hand built by our amazing studio staff (me :D ). It's mostly made out of painted insulation foam, however I must draw special attention to the rad dungeon terrain. For the dungeon I used materials and resin/metal accessories from Firedragon Games. I cannot recommend their products highly enough! I built my full dungeon in one day, and painted it all the next day.

Funds will go to the necessary development tools and time needed.\nChallenge Mode [REACHED!]\nWe'll have some extra resources to put towards a unique challenge mode! Put your Flynn skills to the test in the arena with survival and boss rush trials!\nAnimated Intro\nWe'll be able to work with our pals over at Studio Yotta to create an animated intro for Flynn: Son of Crimson! It'll be pretty and juicy and whoa!\nRozia Story DLC\nAn alternate character in a DLC story played alongside Flynn's journey! We already have this story planned out, these funds would help it become a reality! All backers receiving the game will get the DLC at no charge.\n  Flynn: Son of Crimson is a 2D action adventure platformer with metroidvania elements. Set in a wondrous world with a looming darkness beginning to awaken yet again.\nWhat can you expect?\nExplore a wondrous world filled with discovery, taking place in unique regions designed with non-linear exploration.\nSwap between multiple weapons with quick and satisfying combat.\nDive in to a land with ancient mysteries and rich story.\nTravel across the lands, discovering new ways to roam and opening new paths using the power of crimson.\nDip in and out of an alternate dimension to make unique alterations to the real world.\nView a realm full of life, carefully formed with hand-crafted pixel art.\nTrade trinkets for new combat techniques and runes with an old war veteran.\nCall on your companion Dex in times of need, a mystical and loyal creature.\nTest your strength in the feared Rustwood coliseum among other challenging feats.\nTake on the role of Flynn, a young man orphaned as a child who sets out to chase the shadows of his beginnings whilst awakening the ancient power of Crimson within him. \nDiscover relics of ancient Rosantica, effigies and monuments to the goddess Sorrell that reveal hints at Flynn\u2019s beginnings and unlock new powers. Reveal secret pathways, trade with villagers, battle fierce monsters, hang out with dogs.\n    What about the Switch?\nWe've received a lot of requests for the Switch, we hear you! We'd love to launch on as many platforms as possible, but there is a problem. Flynn is being created in Gamemaker Studio 2, which is a great engine, but it currently does not support porting to the Switch. If we were to go for it now, Flynn would have to be recreated in an entirely new engine, which as you can imagine is a lot of work. Just know that Yoyo games is working hard on trying to make a Switch port possible! We can set up a later stretch goal for a Switch port, but until then we'll have to hope for the port to become available during Flynn's development! We'll keep everyone updated as Yoyo games and Nintendo work it out.\n  From the very first stages of development, we began designing Flynn: Son of Crimson with fast paced, satisfying combat. We\u2019re strong believers that \u2018game feel\u2019 should be priority in any video game so we've been injecting as much juice as we can to make sure every hit packs a punch and feels extra tasty.\nTrade gems and trinkets acquired throughout the game to learn new techniques for Flynn\u2019s arsenal, and you\u2019ll soon find that you can figure out your own favourite combination of attacks (Smash, bash, tickle, tickle, bosh!). Designed with quick and easy weapon swapping in mind, you\u2019re never more than a button press away from your desired weapon so you better dispatch your foes with flair, else you\u2019re not the cool hero everyone thought! \nThe Crimson Blade, a staple in Flynn's arsenal (and the default starting weapon, but that doesn\u2019t sound as appealing!) is the first weapon of Crimson energy gifted to Flynn by the Goddess Sorrell in a great time of need. Unlocking and mastering the uppercut will provide some serious hang time to any foe that is on the receiving end. Or why not slice through many baddies with the piercing dash? Piece of cake.\nThe Crimson Axe demands precise timing and enemy prediction, trading the quick cuts of the crimson blade for a weighty windup, this axe packs a punch sure to leave your enemies as a smear on the floor. Use the axe to crush your enemy's shields, and smash brittle walls to access new areas with brute force. It\u2019s a wonder how the young one can lift this, but as we wrote this we realized it is made of energy, whoops.\nThe Crimson Claws, a swift and energetic set of weapons used to stagger enemies with high attack speed and air superiority, if that\u2019s your sort of thing. Unleash your inner wildcat with unique wall climbing (go home, Knuckles) and a spiral drill attack (you too, Taz) to tear into enemies and dig through soft ground, these high mobility weapons will have you on your toes and keep your hands warm.\nWhat would our youthful hero be without a ranged weapon? That's right, a hero without a ranged weapon. So here's a bow, not any old bow, but a Super Awesome Crimson Bow\u2122 (nice). Acquired early on in the game, this will help you hurt/take out weaker foes from a distance. Use the bow to trigger traps and puzzles, and even augment with elemental arrows such as ice, electricity, and explosive (explosions are an element, right?). Once you've unlocked them, it's your choice which to roll out with, depending on your play style, whoa!\nSet in the world of Rosantica after the Great Conflict, a war that carried on for decades between parallel worlds, one of humanity, one of gods. The worlds once kept in peace by the Crimson Goddess Sorrell and Lord Zealock, now torn between each other.\nThe Great Conflict between overlapping worlds, caused by Sorrell\u2019s forbidden love of a mortal knight, Allistair. Falling for humanity's innocence and good nature, Sorrell leaves her world for another, sending Zealock into madness with her involvement with the \"frail humanity\".\nDecades of war have gone by between worlds, as things begin to look grim for the people of Rosantica. Realizing she can do no more to protect them from Zealock's growing rage, Sorrell initiates an ultimate sacrifice with her and her love, giving their lives to banish what has now become The Scourge. Locking Lord Zealock and his followers away to the malicious world they have created.\nBut don\u2019t live in the past, the world around you is brimming with exploration and discovery. Track down a mysterious stranger that appears to be following you as the barrier between worlds begins to crack, and investigate her ties to The Scourge and Zealock.\n  Roam the fantastic world both on foot and with your loyal companion Dex, a last gift from Sorrell and a guardian of Rosantica, helping both man and beast alike take back their homes. Will you follow Flynn on his journey through this war torn land?\n  Venture into the heart of evil itself, and tackle the horrors of The Scourge head-on. A once pristine land of gods, now an infested land filled with hatred. Track clues about your past and the Crimson power that grows within you leading to this nest of evil, and uncover what really lies at the heart.\nFlynn must hurry, with every passing day The Scourge\u2019s hold on Rosantica grows, slowly plunging the world into madness and decay with its noxious corruption. You must seek to end Zealock\u2019s reign of disease and lunacy before it\u2019s too late. \nTraveling between dimensions, Flynn controls the ability to tear open portals to The Scourge with the power of Crimson. Finding alternate paths and searching for trapped Rosanticans taken away from their homes. But be wary, The Scourge has many eyes in search of Flynn.\n    Journey through the vast island of Rosantica in search for answers to stop the land from falling victim to the corruption. The world is pieced together to transition seamlessly as you travel across the 5 unique regions.\nExplore the frigid Mistral Peak \u2013 a frozen over mountain once brimming with enterprise and discovery of its rich natural resources and fossils, now fallen victim to The Scourge\u2019s wretched influence in the form of a supernaturally dangerous blizzard. Discover what infernal power has summoned up this ferocious storm and help put a stop to it.\nWade through the once secluded and dazzling waters of The Hollow's Isles. A group of seaside caverns and alcoves that were once the pinnacle of natural beauty and serenity that have been ravaged by the relentless winds brought on by the blizzards of Mistral Peak above. Track your quest into the damp caves to battle off the mutated crustaceans that have forced out the indigenous Neptyn to flee their ancestral homes.\nLose yourself in the sprawling gardens of Rustwood. Home to the legendary proving grounds of the warrior tribe, the Mazir, and their Fighting Coliseum. The Mazir are a beetle-like people that are honor bound to prove themselves capable warriors by duking it out in this immense arena. Be warned, however, for The Scourge has seeped even into this land of once sacred trials. The swamps of Rustwood grow darker as each day goes by, causing hazardous poison storms to awaken.\nYour quest for knowledge will eventually lead you to the home of all scholarly pursuits, the famed Shivering Spire. What used to be the beacon of knowledge and symbol of Rosantica\u2019s prosperity, is now home to a portal of the netherworld, with its devout healers and once benevolent sorcerers now becoming vessels for The Scourge\u2019s evil magic to pour into the world of Rosantica. Flynn will be bombarded with acolytes that are now driven mad by their enhanced dark powers, as well as assaulted by powerful warlocks that once dared to challenge gods themselves.\nIn between journeys, Flynn will return to Sanctia. A stronghold where his most valued allies reside, banding together to help Flynn fight off the corruption. Here Flynn will barter rare Crimson Shards found throughout the world for new techniques and upgrades, as well as complete quests for the villagers.\nFlynn: Son of Crimson features crisp, hand-crafted pixel art that's designed to compliment its frenetic gameplay. Readability and strong visual tells are key components in our artistic process, as we realize how important it is for a game to be crystal-clear in its visual feedback to the player.  \nEach chunky pixel is deliberately and thoughtfully placed to create a memorable world for players to explore. Mischievous goblins, big-bellied fish men, blood-thirsty wolves, and more are brought to life with expressive animations brimming with personality.\nFrom concept art, to character sprites, and final polished animations - we aim to deliver a product we're truly proud of, and one that communicates to our players how much we truly care for the timeless and endearing craft of pixel-art!\n    From our composer, Jacob Lincke: Starting with a clean slate is always exciting and inspiring. \u201cFlynn: Son of Crimson\u201d needs satisfying music to accompany its already magical looking art style. I started looking at things I thought the game reminded me of; other games, movies and even places in the real world. I want the soundtrack to have its own unique voice, instantly connecting it to the game.\nI have a deep love for traditional folk music from all over the world which made me think of all sorts of fun instruments and what they could bring to the table. Flutes and keyed fiddles are combined with medieval lutes and finally mixed together with a grand orchestra making you feel less alone. All of this and a touch of retro synths to go along with the cute art style results in a collaboration between Scandinavian folk music and the Far East.\nI imagined Flynn wandering enchanting forests such as those found in Ghibli movies and traversing cold mountains of my homeland Sweden. I want the music to help Flynn telling his story, setting the atmosphere and be beautiful at the same time.\n    Always felt like you needed something Crimsony for your wall? Me too. Put this pretty 18\" by 24\" poster all over it and have your friends say, \"whoa\"! A beautiful illustration by Jaya Ply (@Nikingply).\nGet warm with this high quality t-shirt designed by miski! Printed on a 50/50 blend shirt for maximum comfort. We may or may not kiss each one before they ship. T-shirt sizing and possible color options will be provided after the campaign.\nDig your eyes intothe Official Flynn: Son of Crimson art book containing used and unused concept art, pixel art, level design sketches, fan art, a deeper look into the lore, and more! Size of the book to be decided later in development, based on our content. \nBecome one with the game with your spooky skeleton in the ground, and your likeness drawn in to your own gravestone to be placed in the Rustwood Graveyard. In other words, your face on a rock. \nDesign an NPC to fit in to the game! We'll contact you to work on your NPC's design, personality, dialogue (nothing naughty!), back story, and favorite things.\nGet your own custom room! You choose its location, style, what it's full of, maybe a bit of lore, maybe a bit of graffiti, maybe your face everywhere, I don't know. Put your own flair in to it!\nCombine every design tier before to create a sidequest! Include your secret room and your NPC in this quest to make Flynn fetch a bucket of water, or to do 50 pushups, whatever your heart desires!\nA story being told right from our hearts and fingers, Flynn is a young baby boy that has been on our minds over the last two years. As we write this, we are roughly one full year into development on Flynn: Son of Crimson from when we began putting this design all on paper.\nactual paper!\nSo far being funded completely by our own money, we feel we're now in a good place to introduce Flynn to Kickstarter. In order to continue to fulfill our dreams in making Flynn a real boy, we need your support! We're very confident in the head start we have on the basics in design and development, with a lot of the core features already built and working. A large portion will be going to the art, allowing us to give our artists more consistent hours and maybe even hire extra help. Additionally, the sound is very important to us, so that will be a big investment as well.\nIs this your first game? \nFirst bigger scale game, yes. We have 2 other games we released in the wild on mobile though, which can be found here:  \nSamurai Blitz\nRaccoon Rascals\nWe also have a couple projects we have worked on in the past that didn\u2019t quite make the cut (we all have them), but we see them as more of a learning process and who knows, we may come back to them in 50 years time.\nSpecial Thanks\nAndrew Filip - Web design/development, help with the trailer.\nJohan Aronson - Being part of Flynn's original birth long ago, and the title screen.\nmiski - Being the greatest for designing the t-shirt last minute with us.\n           This project is promoted by Jellop, a direct\u00ad response online advertising agency specializing in Kickstarter campaigns on Facebook Ads and Google AdWords.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks and challenges for a project like this.

A miniatures board game designed by Sen Foong-Lim and Jessey Wright, The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena pits 2 players against each other in a sports game that features deep, strategic, head-to-head gameplay, highly detailed and dynamic miniatures, deck crafting and building, and team customization.\nThe game play of The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena is closely modeled after the popular Pro-bending sport featured in the first season of Avatar: The Legend of Korra. As such, the game is designed for 2 players, each controlling a team of 3 benders: earth, fire, and water.\nBased on the events of Avatar: The Legend of Korra, Pro-bending Arena focuses on the championship match between the fresh-faced Future Industry Fire Ferrets and the sneaky and brutal White Falls Wolfbats.\nThe objective of the game is simple: be on the other team's side of the arena when the game ends and you will be victorious, or dominate the competition, pushing all their benders off the back of the arena to end the game immediately and claim the championship as yours!\n  The below videos will give you an understanding of not only how The Legend of Korra Pro-bending Arena plays, but also an understanding of how to play it, plus the strategies involved.\n      The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena encourages players to experiment with their team's techniques and trick load out. This deep customization rewards players with endless ways to build their teams and defeat their opponents. \nDuring your match, you'll be able to focus your benders' chi and purchase new technique cards from one of their three strategy decks, each one separated by bender type. Not only does this mid-game deck building give players a chance to turn the tide of the match when a powerful card comes up for purchase, but it also allows players to min-max each of their strategy decks. \nThe strategy deck can be crafted before the game by players really looking to give their team an offensive edge. Being selective about what cards go into each one of your bender's strategy decks will give you the opportunity to control the plays you'll have access to as the game progresses. \n  Not only can you customize your team by crafting your strategy decks before the game, but you can really show your style via the trick cards you can load your team with.\nThere are two types of trick cards: incredibly powerful ones that can only be used once, or slightly less powerful but much riskier cheats that can be used multiple times but require players to roll a referee die each time they're used.\nCollect 2 yellow fans on a single bender and they're out of the game, putting you at a serious disadvantage.\nTricks allow players to supercharge their attacks, escape incoming barrages of elements, or even make their benders impervious to being pushed back. Deciding which tricks to take, and whether or not they're the risky yellow-fan cheats or one-time powerful tricks really allows players to make a team their own.\nDuring the course of this campaign, we will be unlocking 7 mystery teams as a free upgrade for your pledge. These are not stretch goals, they are guaranteed to be a part of your pledge no matter what our funding level ends up being! \nAdditional teams offer you a ton of new strategies. Not only will each team come equipped with their own unique special ability and strategy decks, but they also come with 6 universal trick cards that can be used by any team in the game. Meaning that even if you've already built your favorite team,  any additional team you add to your game will expand the options you have for your perfectly-tuned machine.\nOnce you've learned your new teams' quirks and perks, maximized their power potential, and earned your first championship, why not switch it up and draft your dream team?\nAdding teams to your core game will also allow you to participate in the Fantasy Draft variant. In this game mode, players can mix and match their favorite members from their favorite teams and experience the fantasy of combining two powerful special abilities into one devastating power play. \nWhen missing team members, all members still get their specific special ability, triggered by their technique cards. This can allow for unbelievable power combinations that will have Fire Ferret team members counter-bending elements alongside Wolfbats, dazing the opposition with illegal techniques.\n        The White Falls Wolfbats are the reigning Pro-bending champions. Being fan favorites, any question of the legality of their techniques and the legitimacy of their champion status is often brushed off as loser jealousy. Still, something about the way they play does ring a little unfair to even the most die-hard fans.\nIn The Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena, the White Falls Wolfbats have access to the some of the dirtiest tricks in the book. Their team special ability, Daze, allows the Wolfbats to put their opponents at a serious disadvantage with cheap-shots that cripple their next plays.\n    Fresh-faced and newly-formed, the Future Industry Fire Ferrets are the surprise stars of the Pro-bending league. Hailing from Republic City, the Fire Ferrets are best known for their teamwork and mastery of the elements. Well, okay, that's the second thing they're known for; they're primarily known for being the team with Avatar Korra playing for them.\nFocusing their chi on mastering the elements, the Fire Ferrets have become proficient in redirecting overly aggressive plays back against their opponents. Counter-bend takes your opponents' element tokens and adds them as part of your attack. These counter-bend techniques can change the course of the game in a single, well-planned play.\nKnown on the Pro Bending circuit for their teamwork, the all-female, all-amazing Rabaroos coordinate to unleash a rapid-fire flurry of elemental attacks. Ada, Ula, and Umi are guaranteed to bring you to your feet with their lightning fast bending. It\u2019s always action-packed when the Rabaroos are in the Arena!\nRally and Blitz \nWhat makes the Rabaroos unique are their twin icons, Rally and Blitz. Activate Rally to gain Rally tokens which you can then spend when you activate Blitz. Blitz permits you to draw a card from the top of your Main Deck, immediately launching an additional action!\n  The self-proclaimed \u201cBullies of Black Quarry\u201d, the Boar-Q-Pines specialize in relentless pressure. Many a team of Pro Benders have withered under the attacks of the rough-and-tumble Boar-Q-Pines. Chang, Xin, and Shui may be a little prickly, but they should never be underestimated!  \nPressure\nPressure tokens are this team\u2019s unique modifier, making your elemental tokens count for double when they hit. Even the weakest attack from the Boar-q-pines is a credible threat to be taken seriously!\n  The nimble and evasive P\u2019Li is one of the rare fire benders who has the ability to focus Chi into a concentrated line of concussive force. This Combustionbending is nigh impossible to block and nearly as difficult to avoid. After years of being held deep in the frozen wastes for 13 long years by the Order of the White Lotus, P\u2019Li has escaped and is once again after her quarry - Avatar Korra! Do not stand in her way!\nP\u2019Li's unique and powerful bending type makes her such a fierce competitor that she doesn't need any teammates by her side to be a Pro-bending champion. Her combustionbending cannot be stopped, meaning that elements placed in an attempt to defend against her attacks cannot annihilate her attacks. P'Li is limited by the amount of combustion she can bend, since she is only allotted 6 combustion tokens. Players using her as a team will need to be careful about how often they deploy those tokens, as after all combustion tokens are deployed any combustion icons played are ignored. \n  The pride of the Golden Temple, Haka, Josei, and Kano come to Pro Bending with years of experience under their belts. As they\u2019re not spring chickenpigs anymore, the Tigerdillos rely less on their athleticism and more on their wisdom as veterans of the sport. They know when it\u2019s best to fight and when it\u2019s best to regroup and refocus.\n Veteran\nThe Tigerdillos, while capable benders, may be past their prime in terms of raw athletic prowess. However, their Veteran status in Pro-bending gives their team members a sense of when to take advantage of the shift in battle gain even more of an edge over the competition.\n  The Buzzardwasps have mastered the art of attacking pressure points at a distance, making precise strikes against opponents instead of using brute force. Their infamous \u201cSting\u201d technique can make even the most iron willed Pro-bender lose focus. Shan, Ko, and Loong are aiming to take the championship trophy back to Bau Ling! \nThe Buzzardwasps deliver precision attacks directly to identified weak points. Their famous sting has a powerful bite, distracting opponents, causing them to lose focus and opening them up to more attacks.\n  Kuvira is not only a political and military genius, her Metalbending is without peer in single combat and her acrobatics allows her to dance between multiple foes. Kuvira can switch from attack to defense and back again within the same, seemingly effortless, sequence of complex moves. Underestimate the grace of \u201cThe Great Uniter\u201d of the Earth Empire at your own peril!\nKuvira, Superior Combatant\nKuvira\u2019s prowess at executing advanced techniques makes it impossible for a referee to judge whether she's cheating or not. As such her Prowess ability is versatile and powerful if you choose from all of the tricks available. To ensure that the game is fair, Kuvira cannot use Tricks that prevent her from being knocked back (such as Determination).\n  Unalaq's infamy goes beyond his devious machinations and his skilled waterbending, his ability to siphon off his enemy's spiritual energy makes him a foe unlike any other. Pro-benders find themselves imagining what facing-off against such an unconventional bender would be like. How would Unalaq's soul siphon affect them in the arena, how wound he combine his most peculiar ability with his incredible waterbending skills?\nSoul Siphon\nIf you have your Spiritbending token on your Villain board, you may spend it (return it to the supply). If you do, choose 1 bender in the target space of an attack. Your opponent must discard a card of that bender\u2019s element from their hand. If they do not have a card, return your Spiritbending token to your Villain board.\n      If you'd like to add the Amon expansion to your pledge please press the \"Manage my Pledge\" buttom at the top of the page and add $30. \nThe Legend of Korra: Pro-bending Arena Amon's Invasion expansion includes 3 game modes: \n1.

Amon and his equalists are controlled by an A.I. dekc that indicates what they will do.\n2.

This campaign is specifically for the funding the creation Issues 8 and 9, which will complete Volume1. That means MOST of the book is already complete. I only have about 50 pages to go out of the 225+ pages in the series.\nNew to the story? Not to worry!  All of Volume 1 is available in this campaign. Also Issues 8 and 9 will be of course available as well for those who have already been following along.\nThanks to the lovely and amazing Kickstarter community I've had Issues 2 - 7 funded on previous campaigns. This project began years ago and has slowly turned into something I am really devoted to and would love to work on for years to come.\nGIRRION is a sweeping sci-fi fantasy story of a hero's journey in a distant world in a distant time. The saga is told through the eyes of Jarra, a poor factory worker who dreams of escaping his world of endless toil. His wish comes true, though not in a way he would have ever wanted, when his city is attacked by a dark entity called the Halodron. He escapes the conflict, but only to be thrust into a war of other-worldy magic and weaponry.\nAmidst the destruction, history begins to unravel as soldiers of a forgotten war resurface and the secrets of a mysterious technology known as Girrion come to light as its scattered remains suddenly start to \u201creawaken\u201d. With little time and resources, the hero must help save his crumbling empire from its destructive past.\n        Inking in progress\n        Volume 1 cover art in progress\n     Girrion started off as a hobby over 15 years ago. Initially it was more of an illustration portfolio than a story. I wanted to be a concept artist, so I would spend a lot of time designing characters, ships and environments.\nI didn't consider myself a writer back then, but I started getting ideas for a story. When I would draw environments or characters the ideas would just pop in my head. One scene led to another, then another etc. It took a lot of time, but the experience put in over the years not only helped the art, it also gave me time to develop the story more and give it more depth than it had in the earlier drafts.\nAge Range: (PG - PG-13 )\n- No sex or bad language\n- No excessive gore. Girrion is primarily about a war so there is cartoon violence similar to the level of Star Wars, but more of it.\n            This will be the first campaign where a full volume book is available. It will be 225+ pages in length. 6.14\" x 9.2\"\nVolume 1 mockup. Cover art and design are in progress.\n Previous campaigns single issues were available in hardcover or softcover, and these formats will be available in this campaign as well. \nSample Hardcover (Issue #7)\n Hardcover comic issues are 6\" x 9\". Grey cloth with a dust jacket. Each issue is anywhere from 22 - 26 pages in length.\nSoftcover samples (Issues 1-9)\nSoftcover comic issues are 6\"x9\" and have a glossy cover with a stock thicker than standard comics. The interior art is full color and has a watercolor feel.\nSample Character Sketch\n  Sample 4\" x 6\" print\n  How Do Add Ons Work?\nHere's what you do:\nClick \"Manage Your Pledge\" in the upper right corner (blue button) Add the total of your Add On to your pledge amount. (i.e. one Giclee Fine art print is $25.) You don't need to change the tier you've selected You are done! Later you'll get a backer survey asking how you spent your add-on dollars and for other pertinent info. Thank you!\n  Generally, about half of my expenses come from printing the books and mailing them. The other half of the budget is going into the production. Most of what this campaign money goes towards is large chunks of time for me to focus fully on the book. One issue takes me 300 - 400 hours. If I'm able to knock off some days working freelance on other jobs, the books come out much faster.\n  Scout Comics is now publishing Girrion! They released Issue 1 last October and will be releasing books up through this Fall. They are an indie publisher\u2013 very supportive of their creators and just a great group of people all around. They also have a wide range of comics which you can check out on their site. www.scoutcomics.com\nFollow\nWebsite: www.girrion.com\nTwitter: www.twitter.com/Girrion1\nInstagram: www.instagram.com/girrion1/\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/girrion1/\nMusic from Kickstarter Video: \"Night Owl\" by Broke For Free", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBeing that this is not the first comic I've made there aren't too many major challenges with getting the book made, but there are some small ones:\n\nSome of the artwork on certain pages goes fast, some takes very long. There are some complex scenes in this issue with lots of characters and elements that need strong design. Again from past experience, the artwork can sometimes take a bit longer than expected. Also, keep in mind I have to mix this work in with the day job.\n\nI've learned a lot from previous Kickstarter campaigns, and I am getting more and more efficient. I'm also trying to find ways to make rewards as cost-effective as possible too. One way of doing this is to do more than one issue per campaign, which cuts down on mailing costs. Before it took so long to complete just one issue and I could only offer one per campaign, but now I plan on doing 2 -3 issues per campaign from now on.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "CURIOUS ABOUT GIRRION", "descp": "-Issue 1 PDF format", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["27 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 4 or more", "title": "ISSUE 8 & 9 (PDF)", "descp": "Continuing the Saga!\n-Issue 8 & 9 PDF format", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["52 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 6 or more", "title": "CHOOSE ANY 3 ISSUES (PDF)", "descp": "-Miss an issue or want to start from the beginning?

As Spymasters, position your Spies and Specialists to outmaneuver your opponent and dominate the battlefield.\nPlayers must stay one step ahead of their opponent on a battleground that is as much in the minds of the Spymasters as on the board. Predict your opponent\u2019s moves to prevent them from gaining ground, and when all hope seems lost, snatch victory away from your opponent with clever use of your Specialist agents.\nIf you are the first to capture both parts of the Doomsday Device, it\u2019s game over for your opponent.\nA quick review of the game board and object will reveal that Pocket Ops is based on the familiar framework of tic-tac-toe \u2014 but don't write it off as child's play just yet! The prediction mechanic and Specialist abilities have been proven to offer playtesters both challenge and laughter. Don't believe it? Check out the sample Print n' Play files below:\n   ...or check out the Tabletop Simulator mod on Steam!\n  Pocket Ops is the first published design of Brandon Beran, with art and graphic design by industry veteran Josh Cappel.\n         Pocket Ops is quick to pick up, because you already know how to play; If you've played Tic-Tac-Toe before, you have the fundamentals: place markers in a grid, trying to get three in a row. But wait! The simple but game-changing twist with Pocket Ops is that before you make a move, the other player gets to secretly predict where you are going to go. After your move, if they were right, your move is canceled. In addition, a variety of Specialist tokens that introduce all sorts of sneaky abilities will change the way you place and predict. Pocket Ops takes a classic framework and breathes surprising life into it.

However, to help offset the shipping costs a bit, we have created the 4- and 10-copy levels with lower pricing per copy.\n     We are very happy to bring this project to you via Kickstarter. Keeping true to our philosophy, we have asked for an amount that will get us halfway to what we need to produce the game. It will take about twice as much money as we are asking to bring Pocket Ops to life, and our part is ready. You showed amazing support for the Guild with Unreal Estate, and we know we can count on your for this current project. \n~Fondly,\nMarc Specter, GuildMaster", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups and delays. Many board game projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards and transparency we expect from other board game publishers and our previous projects, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\n\nAside from artwork changes that may come about as a result of stretch goals, this game is finished and ready to go to Bang Wee, the experienced manufacturer of our two previous titles.\n\nWe learned a lot from our first Kickstarter campaign, and we feel confident that those lessons will help us make this campaign successful.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Spy in training", "descp": "Support our project + 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 14 or more", "title": "Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\nFREE shipping within the US, $5 Canada, $10 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["933 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 28 or more", "title": "Stroop Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["55 backers", "Limited (195 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 36 or more", "title": "Unreal Estate Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$5 for shipping within the US, $9 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["45 backers", "Limited (205 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 48 or more", "title": "Spy Hard", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 4 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 4 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$7 for shipping within the US, $12 Canada, $15 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["19 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 52 or more", "title": "Guild Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 1 copy of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 1 copy of Stroop\n\u2022 1 copy of Unreal Estate\n\u2022 1 copy of the Gothic Estates expansion\n\u2022 1 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pin\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $15 Canada\nLimited to 250 Backers", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only certain countries"}], "stat": ["43 backers", "Limited (207 left of 250)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 100 or more", "title": "Santa Spy", "descp": "All Backers at this level will receive:\n\u2022 10 copies of Pocket Ops with all stretch goals\n\u2022 10 KS Exclusive Doomsday Device lapel pins\n\u2022 1 Pocket Ops Deluxe PnP download delivered in July 2017\nAll physical items in this reward level will ship together with Pocket Ops.\n$10 for shipping within the US, $20 Canada, $30 everywhere else", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["6 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 1,000 or more", "title": "\"Bond...

Kickstarter has enabled a renascence in miniatures by allowing manufacturers to appeal directly to their fan base. With the success of our last Kickstarter at more than double the funding level, we were able to have several more figures sculpted, printed and put into production than we initially planned. The funding level directly affects the expansion of the range with our backers literally funding our efforts with their venture capital.

All you need is to learn this simple method of Cognitive Drawing and you will soon be decoding and memorizing how to draw things like you never imagined possible. \nHow can I make such a bold claim? Because this technique is exactly how I taught myself how to draw.\nI believe that with Cognitive Drawing you will quickly learn how to test yourself and force your brain to start memorizing what you are learning. \nWhat is Cognitive Drawing?\nCognitive Drawing will be an easy (90+ page) workbook designed to teach you how to learn to draw anatomy from memory. Not only will you learn to draw but you will learn to do it in a way that helps your brain retain what you learned. \nThis book is perfect for beginners and intermediate artists of all ages.\nThe technique in this book is exactly how I (Jason Brubaker) taught myself to draw as a teenager without an expensive art education. At the age of twenty I was hired by a storyboarding agency in Los Angeles and I have been a professional artist ever since working in storyboards, animation and visual development on some of the biggest movies and commercials in Hollywood. (You can see my IMDB credits here.)\nWe are printing the book on sketch book paper perfect for drawing with pencil.\nHow did Cognitive Drawing start?\nBack in the mid 90's when I was trying to learn to draw, I developed this method while trying to memorize anatomy and different artistic styles. Although I didn't have a name for it yet, it was the way that I was able to learn anatomy quickly. It was't long before I was able to draw anatomy and styles quickly from memory and I attribute much of this success to this method.\nOver the years I have tried to explain the Cognitive Drawing method to friends assuming that others were doing it as well. To my surprise, I have never found anyone teaching or using this technique. Twenty years later I decided to make an experimental worksheet to show a drawing class how to quickly learn to draw things on their own. To my surprise, about 90% of the students found my method surprisingly easy and highly effective for learning to draw from memory. \nSince it worked so well for others I decided that it was time to try to make a Cognitive Drawing book using this technique to aid in learning one of the hardest things to learn to draw: anatomy. I announced the idea on my Youtube channel and nearly 100 people signed up to be beta testers for an experimental 40 page anatomy book using Cognitive Drawing. \nAfter a few months of testing Cognitive Drawing the beta testers were finished and sent me their results and I was once again blown away with the high percentage of positive feedback and massive improvement for almost all of the beta testers.\nThe beta-test worked better than I expected again but it still needed much improvement to be a real workbook. I received much needed feedback from the testers and studied all the problem areas in their drawings I was able to refine Cognitive Drawing into an amazing and fun daily exercise designed to walk a beginner artist through the entire male figure (from any angle or pose) within a month.\nWhat is in the Cognitive Drawing Book?\nCognitive Drawing will be a 96+ page workbook book designed to fold flat so you can draw on all the pages. \n(The page count will keep growing as we hit stretch goals. I would like to get it up to 140 pages if possible.)\nAbout 60% of the workbook will be cognitive drawing worksheets and the rest of the book is full of lessons and exercises to help you tie it all together. This book will help you memorize proportions of body and face, muscle groups, poses and more and will show you how to use Cognitive Drawing to learn how to memorize any drawing style you find. \nAlong with Cognitive Exercises the book is filled with muscle breakdowns and other exercises that helped me understand how to build a figure from scratch. Here are some samples of some of the daily exercises:\nThe book will be a combination of Cognitive Drawing exercises mixed with anatomy breakdowns and other drawing lessons.\nOnce you complete the book, not only will you know anatomy but you will also be able to use this technique with all kinds of other reference material like: anatomy books, comic books, robots, dinosaurs, aliens, monsters, machines, manga, your favorite artists or even photos. The sky is the limit!\nWho Is Cognitive Drawing For?\nThe book is designed for Homeschoolers, Drawing Groups, Classrooms and personal use. There is no nudity in the book so it's safe for all ages.\nI have seen much improvement in students ages of 8 and up. As long as there is a desire to learn to draw and you can spend about 30 minutes a day focused on doing an exercise then this is for you.\nBacked by Science?\nInterestingly enough, some of my findings agree with what scientists have learned about how the brain learns and retains information. This is the field of Cognitive Psychology. I have even interviewed a Cognitive Scientist who experimented with my method and he has helped me develop it to be even better than I expected.\nI will post an interview with him here where he breaks down the scientific principles used in Cognitive Drawing and why they work.\nProduction Timeframe\nThere are about 3 months of production left on the book depending on how many extra pages we can get funding to add. I would like to be able to make the book 140 pages but this would mean hitting stretch goals. So depending on how many pages the final book is will determine how quickly it goes to print.\nOnce printing begins it will take about 3 months to have the books in my studio and they will be shipped out shortly after that.\nI am setting the delivery deadline to April 2018 as a worst case scenario. But the funding amount will determine the exact timeframe and we might be able to have the books in your hands by this Christmas. \nMoney\nI am planning to print 3000 copies of this book quoted at $10,410. With shipping estimates as well as Kickstarter fees and Card processing fees, it will be over $16,000. We need another 9k for the remaining production costs and assistance to complete all the pages and worksheets. This brings our total to $24,900 to make sure this book can get off the ground.\nIf we don't reach this goal then I will not be able to invest the time or money to get the book printed so please help by sharing this with everyone you know who wants to learn how to draw.\nWho Am I?\nI'm Jason Brubaker. I am a self taught artist. I started my professional career at the age of 19 and have worked for more than 20 years in the entertainment industry on big movies (Blade, Pitch Black, Kung Fu Panda 1, 2 & 3) and hundreds of commercials before launching my own company to publish graphic novels and books. Now I self-publish graphic novels for a living. You can see my books here: http://CoffeeTableComics.com\nI've spoken at grade schools, high schools, colleges, libraries and comic conventions about making comics and doing art for a living.
