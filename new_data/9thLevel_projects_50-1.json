[{"backer": "9thLevel", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Oh boy, here we go again.\nGood morrow, fellow box-and-dice aficionados! This Kickstarter we\u2019re introducing Keychain Spellbooks, leather bound hand-finished boxes crafted to store miniature gemstone dice (made from real gemstones!). In the past Elderwood has brought you Spellbooks and Spellbook Minis, so if you think we took our last idea and just smushed it, you\u2019re probably (and also exactly) correct.\n\nLike their predecessors and their predecessor\u2019s predecessor, Keychain Spellbooks are lovingly crafted from a variety of stunning natural wood options, wreathed in lush foil-stamped leather, and embellished with your choice of signature art. Except even smaller. Available in two types of interior and teeming with tenacity (and teensy gemstone dice), these tiny two-inch tomes are tailor-made to tend to your teeny treasures. \nKeychain Spellbooks are guaranteed (not really-- in life there are no guarantees) to make your keys harder to lose.\nThis campaign we\u2019re partnering up with Norse Foundry to bring you Mini Gemstone Dice exclusively available to bedazzle the interior of your Keychain Spellbook. Mini Gemstone Dice are just like regular Gemstone Dice, except it\u2019s easier to fit a whole set in your mouth. Read on to learn how to customize your Keychain Spellbook and add on Mini Gemstone Dice to your pledge.\nThey took all the raves that didn't happen in 2020 and put them into K9 Crystal Gemstone Dice.\nWood\nBegin your itty-bitty journey by selecting which of our hand-sanded, oil brushed woods speaks to you in the loudest, tiniest voice.  Classic woods are available for all Classic Keychain Spellbooks. Check out our Pledge Guide to calculate your additional pledge amount for Premium and Elite woods, and visit our build preview tool to see how your choices might look. \nWood so smooth you could... do something that requires a smooth wooden object.\n Leather & Foil\nPLAY\n\nKeychain Spellbooks are swathed in your choice of luxuriously durable leathers stamped in a gorgeous foil of your choosing. Our time-tested and supremely supple Granada leathers are available in seven of our classic colors, so you can drape your little friends in a drum-dyed cloak that most vividly expresses the spirit of their moon sign, or something.\nIn this Kickstarter, you'll be able to pick a different foil color for the border and the icon selection. Choose from these lustrous foil colors: gold, silver, bronze, maroon, forest, ocean sky, pink, rose gold, and pewter. Down below you'll see a handy reference image that displays what each of the available foils looks like pressed on the available leather choices. We are so thoughtful.\nNot pictured: Rose Gold, favorite among millennials.\nYou're getting veeeeery sleeeeeeepy. Unless you're not, in which case please ignore.\nArt\nDress up your Keychain Spellbook with a selection from our classic signature art options.\nInterior Configuration\nChoose between two different interior options for your Keychain Spellbook - Open and Spiral styles.  \n\nThe Spiral Interior holds 7-10 mini dice while the Open Interior can hold, like, a lot more.\nKeychain Eyelet Loop\nAww, look how happy this gargoyle is with his little Keychain Spellbook ^_^\nYou can put this bad boy on your keychain to ensure you're never without a set of tiny, shiny dice. We've force tested the leather eyelets and they're able to withstand up to 25lbs of force with the leather alone. We want to ensure the long life of the product and will be including antiqued metal reinforcement for the eyelet on all production versions.\n  If you just want to put this cutie in your pocket (or you have no keys and no keyrings), you can order without the eyelet, too.\n  Something something obscure Minecraft joke about Dice Plains Spikes etc.\nFeed your pint-sized puck some delicious little dice. We've got a veritable sm\u00f6rg\u00e5sbord of tiny math rocks to offer, from gemstone to metal to resin. Check out the menu below, and then reference the pledge guide to see how to upgrade.\nMini Gemstone Dice (add $60 to any pledge)\nExactly like regular Gemstone Phoenix Dice, but cuter and infused with more positive karma. These sets include D20, D12, D10(dec), D10, D8, D6 and D4.\nPick your engraved font - Phoenix vs Norse styles\nAll Mini Gemstone dice are expertly cut and polished from their source stones. Phoenix and Norse editions of Mini Gemstone dice give you the chance to select from two different engraved numeral styles. Phoenix edition is an elegant flowing font with a phoenix engraved on the d6, and the Norse edition features a Dwarven stone-cut runic font.\nHey, does just one of you want to come to electrical with me?\nFinal versions of the Mini Rose Quartz Phoenix Edition will feature gold numerals\nMini Metal Phoenix Dice (add $20 to any pledge)\nLike death metal is to music, these dice are to other dice. Need we say more?\nNorse Foundry Pebbles (add $20 to any pledge)\nResin Dice (Free with all Keychain Spellbooks)\nTake a gander at this guide to determine how much to add to your pledge to get the exact configuration your giant heart desires for your tiny Spellbook. If you want a visual representation of your potential build, check out our build preview tool!\nWHAM BAM KABLAMMO CHECK OUT THAT SPECIAL KICKSTARTER PRICE!\nThe typical dimensions for a wild-caught fairy are approximately 2.1\" wide by 2.9\" tall with a .9\" thickness. In accordance with divine fate, those are also the exact dimensions of a Keychain Spellbook.\nMeasurements and features...and wood, oh my?\nThis photo isn't overexposed, we're just actually ghosts.\nElderwood Academy is a collective of dedicated faetomoligists who work tirelessly to imbue chunks of wood with fairy dust for some reason.

A galactic age.\nAn age of bounty hunters, vagrants and bleeding-heart outlaws.\nThis is the NEW REBEL ERA, and the only thing worth a damn is the sweat off your back, the bullet in your chamber and the fuel in your tank. The galaxy is a lawless expanse, known as the FRONTIER GALAXY, and you are an INTERSTELLAR OUTLAW. Together with YOUR SHIP and YOUR CREW you have to eke out a living in the Frontier Galaxy, and chase down the intergalactic dream of freedom and success.\nORBITAL BLUES is a new lo-fi space western roleplaying game from SoulMuppet Publishing, written by Sam Sleney & Zachary Cox.  A roleplaying love-letter to off-beat sci-fi, vintage music, and cooperative old-school styled roleplay, Orbital Blues allows you to play out rules-light tabletop adventures in the style of space westerns such as Cowboy Bebop, Firefly and Guardians of the Galaxy.\nStepping into the shoes of Interstellar Outlaws, players band together to form Crews, and navigate a hard-going, gig-economy living on the fringes of a space-faring society.\nDeveloped on the critically acclaimed rules-lite system of Best Left Buried, Orbital Blues uses a simple D6 based system with 3 basic stats - MUSCLE, GRIT, and SAVVY - to handle rolls and uncertainty - putting the narrative and relationships of the player characters at the heart of play without the baggage of hefty mechanics, classes or roles. \nIn addition to the three core stats, characters also have GAMBITS, and TROUBLES. Gambits are a measure of a character's special talents or unique abilities, whilst Troubles track the heartbreaks, set-backs and blues that Interstellar Outlaws gather around them on their adventures in a difficult universe.  With these simple values and a wealth of gambits and troubles in the core book, players can build a wide variety of unique, storied characters to explore the Frontier Galaxy. \nWorking together, Crews generate a scrappy ship to call home, and must balance their Credits & Debts  in order to stay afloat. Whether it's knowing how they'll pay for a bowl of bell peppers and beef, or where they'll find another clip for their 9mm, the session-by-session play of Orbital Blues is driven by  the rollercoaster lives of Interstellar Outlaws and the work they have to constantly seek out.\nWhether it's hauling salvage across back-water systems or getting boots on the ground sniffing out the Frontier Galaxy's most dangerous bounties, the core book of Orbital Blues is brimming with generators, adventure hooks, play prompts and even a sand-box setting for storytellers to get memorable campaigns going, whilst player characters contend with their own interpersonal relationships and troubles. \n\nOrbital Blues is a 120-Page Trade 6\"x9\"Hardback Book,  with writing and creative direction from Sam Sleney and Zachary Cox, furnished with stunning art from Josh Clark and layout work from Lone Archivist. Edited by Jared Sinclair, Orbital Blues is tight, stylish roleplaying package for all your lo-fi, sci-fi needs. \nWe're printing Orbital Blues with two alternative covers; the standard Day cover, saturated with the big blue sky and the desert dust,  and a Kickstarter-exclusive night-mode cover for those who like to keep their book collections subtle and sophisticated. \nDay Cover\n*WIP - As a Kickstarter Exclusive we really want this one to shine...\nWe use a size slightly larger than A5, Trade (6\" x 9\") across all of our books, to help us stuff more goodness into each page. The hardcover books are planned to be offset, allowing us to feature higher-quality paper, smyth-sewn bindings and all kinds of bells, whistles and ribbons with additional funding.\nThe internals of the book are being beautifully laid out by Lone Archivist, incorporating art, text and tables seamlessly into visually stunning and easy to navigate pages and spreads.\nSpread pages from Crew Ship Generation.\nA spread from The Sutler System, a sandbox adventure included in the core book.\nAs for shipping physical books,  US Distribution will be handled via Exalted Funeral, and the UK & RoW distribution will be handled in house by the SoulMuppet Publishing team. If the campaign is successful and exceeds expectations, we've got specialist fulfilment contractors in place to help fulfil and navigate shipping.\n For backers who pledge for the PDF version, we\u2019ve successfully distributed files via DriveThruRPG and Kickstarter previously and are confident we can do it again.\n\nThis campaign aims to fulfil orders for a print-run of Orbital Blues. At the time of writing, the manuscript is finished, gone through extensive playtesting with a public playtest beta, and is currently being laid out - we're just looking to get it finalised and printed in the quality it deserves, and into your hands. We have pledges for the core book at .PDF and Physical Hardback tiers to deliver on this plan.  \nFollowers of SoulMuppet Publishing know the work and care that's been put into our flagship game, Best Left Buried. With Orbital Blues, we're looking to do the same for sci-fi roleplaying as we did for dark fantasy roleplaying with BLB. We want to make a modern, robust,  and affordable game with a lifetime of support and releases.  Once this Kickstarter funds, we'll immediately start enacting plans to give this game the same longevity, support and accessibility that Best Left Buried enjoys.\nTo stay true to the vintage music roots that inspired the game, we've also collaborated with musician and tabletop writer Chris Bissette to create a  cassette tape LP of music from the universe of Orbital Blues, with Chris performing as the fictional band The Deltas. The tape comes beautifully packaged in a crimson red rave case with an small adventure on the case insert. You can pick the tape up with your book in our Bounty Hunter pledge.\nIf you're eager to dive into our visions and the sounds of Orbital Blues, Creative Director Sam has compiled a living playlist of music, containing tracks and artists that inspired the writing, creation and atmosphere of Orbital Blues.\n Music has been a huge influence in the writing of Orbital Blues, and Sam has curated this playlist to reflect the sounds and styles that have imbued the project with so much life. We have no affiliation with any of the artists in this playlist (though if anyone knows anyone, hook us up... - S) and it's purely a curation of tracks that inspired the making of the book. You can listen and follow on spotify here, and you can expect updates to the playlist whenever we have pen to paper in the future.\n\nWith Orbital Blues already sitting pretty as a completed product, and now funded, the only way is up. We're looking to support Orbital Blues as a flagship game here at SoulMuppet Publishing, and we know the best way to do that is with more adventures and expansions to the core book. Along with additional art and higher production values, each incremental amount raised for this campaign after we hit goal will fund further material from guest writers. Depending on how far we go after funding, we'll also look at adding additional tiers with extra merch. Keep an eye on the tracker below!\nOnwards and upwards, and as we approach the final 24 hours of this campaign, we're setting our sights on one last stretch goal - an upgrade to the cassettes that so many of you have pledged for. How much can you upgrade a 60 year-old storage medium, we hear you wonder. Well, at 700% funding we'll be;\nAdding Limited Edition Orbital Blues Guitar Picks to each Cassette\nPutting more content on the inlays\nAdding an A6 Tri-fold Scenario to every Cassette\nWe're looking into ensuring the Cassettes are of the highest quality, so even if you don't have a tape player, they will still make for stylish display pieces in their own right. Currently we're looking at BandCDs to fulfil the cassette prints, and you can see a portfolio of their work below - we're confident the Orbital Blues Cassette will be a gorgeous compliment to an already stunning game.\n\nUpon reaching \u00a360,000, we're proud to announce we'll be putting this additional funding towards adding the talented Basheer Ghouse to our roster of contributing writers on Orbital Blues, with one last job...\n The job was simple. Run the briefcase to the Rock of Tariq, make sure no-one opens it, and get the sort of pay-out that crews retire on. The journey wasn't exactly safe, but for that sort of money, who cares?\nYet when you arrived at the Rock, you found your employer dead and no-one able to pay you.\nNow half a dozen factions want the cargo, and most of them are willing to kill to get it. Now you're in a race against time. Figure out what's going on, offload your cargo, and get out of there. Or else you'll join the growing list of bodies on the infamous Rock of Tariq.\nBasheer  (@BasheerGhouse) is a writer and cultural consultant based out of San Jose, California. In addition to work for companies like Kobold Press and Rowan, Rook, and Deckard, he's independently published RPGs that range from absurdist comedy to collaborative horror. His contributions can be found in products like Alien Archive 4, Warlock Grimoire 2, and Spire: Shadow Operations, and his personal work can be found at his itch.io page.\nFor us, Basheer is delivering a pulp pressure cooker of an adventure, where Interstellar Outlaw Crews will find themselves pitted against dangerous opponents in a high-risk, high-stakes, and high-reward play of intrigue and action.\nIn reaching 50k, we're confident in announcing that a set 4 Orbital Blues dice will now be included with all Interstellar Kingpin pledges. This will not increase the price on that pledge.\nWe'll have some proofs of the dice with us within the week, but rest assured, they're just as glossy and polished as the rest of the project.\nIf you want to pick up these dice outside of the Interstellar Kingpin pledge, they'll be available in the post-campaign pledge manager for add-ons.\nUpon hitting \u00a345,000 in funding, we've added Giuliano Roverato (@KnightRamen) to our ever-growing team of contributing writers! Giuliano is a Brazilian narrative designer that lives for good food, tough choices and exploring weird dungeons forgotten on the corners of our reality. Best known for the culinary adventure, Bakto\u2019s Terrifying Cuisine, he is wondering if the post-fantasy RPG Brave Zenith will ever see the light of day. Oh, and he really wants to write a bossanova inspired adventure for Orbital Blues too, so let's hear about what he has in store for us!\n\"I want to see the golden shores of my old home, feel its warm sands on my feet, hear the bittersweet melodies, the ones sang to me in bedtime stories by sobbing workers. Day and night the people of Tradis station toil away, forced to clean the planet-side wasteland that the corp calls the \u201cfuture of living.\u201d\nWe are tired, angry and dying. We have nostalgia for a home that is unknown to us. This is not a strike. This a call for help. Bring us home, outlaws. Chega de Saudade.\"\n\nIn Giuliano's stirring exploration of themes of home, nostalgia, place and being, Interstellar Outlaw Crews will visit Tradis station and discover the meaning of Saudade, know the plight of its workers, and be tempted by corporate money beyond their wildest dreams. Here, you can\u2019t save everyone.\n\nThought-provoking and emotive, Giuliano's pitch is one we're incredibly excited for, and we're thrilled to have him onboard.\n Music is a key part of Orbital Blues, and we want to make sure that comes across in a full and proper way. At 400% funding, we've commissioned Chris to further extend the EP Cassette by a third, adding 3 all-new, original tracks to the runtime on both the cassette itself, and in the MP3 collection. These tracks will be perfect for use as background in your games, as atmospheric cornerstones or rip-roaring soundtracks to the adventures of Interstellar Outlaws.\nAt \u00a335,000, we added the work of Tom Mecredy to Orbital Blues' roster of adventures, providing an open, sandbox-styled storyteller's toolkit adventure for your games of Orbital Blues.\nPlaceholder!\n You'll have seen Hagstrom's glossy ads, with their smiling, weather-beaten workers mopping their brows, or relaxing in sleek habitation units, surrounded by their enthusiastic families. You'll have also heard the rumours that Hagstrom's workers are actually indentured to the company, forced to pay off their passage with hard graft. Wollaston's Hold is only a jump away - spool up the drive, and find out the truth.\nAll That Glitters pitches your outlaws into a system full of trouble - a corporate cold war is about to turn hot, revolutionary workers are amassing arms to throw off their oppressive masters, and an ambitious pirate queen is looking to pull off an audacious bullion heist. Keep a hand on your gun, don't trust anyone, and you might just make it out in one piece.\n\nTom Mecredy (@TomMecredy) is a writer and game designer based in the north of England, drawing upon his passion for history and Cold War espionage thrillers to weave tangled conspiracies and revolutions across the stars.  Tom's recent work includes High Speed Low Drag, an introspective, solo-play experience about going to war and the effects it has on soldiers, and Condotto, a Forged in the Dark game about running a company of mercenaries in 14th century Italy.\nAll That Glitters adds a true sandbox experience to Orbital Blues' adventure roster, with a variety of Factions, NPCs and jobs for crews to engage with - it's a style of play that fans of games such as Blades in the Dark will be familiar with, and we're super excited to see it added it to the ever-growing library of supplemental content storytellers can utilise for Orbital Blues.\nUpon reaching \u00a330,000, we added Momatoes to our writing team! Momatoes (@momatoes) is a Filipina game and graphic designer who has written RPGs about memory, legacy, and the dear price wizards pay for their ambition. Her biggest project, ARC, is a rules-light, tension-heavy RPG that\u2019s coming to Kickstarter in 2021 and is one of Dicebreaker\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d upcoming RPGs. For her stretch goal, Momatoes plans on writing a confounding yet compelling mystery wrapped around a deeply human heart. Not a literal heart, though\u2026 unless\u2026? \nPlaceholder!\n Alexin Arius was a pioneer, an eccentric inventor who built wondrous automatons and augments. Now, decades after their disappearance, a desperate sheriff hires a crew of Interstellar Outlaws for what looks to be a straightforward bounty: track Alexin in a promising new location, the long-forgotten Everjoy space station and amusement park.\nBut not all is what it seems, and the supposedly abandoned Everjoy is steeped in endless mystery. Rust and decay run rampant - but why does the jingle still play over the stale air? No customer had set foot in its towering rides or souvenir shops for years - but why do the animatronic mascots still greet you with a smile? And the wide-eyed children who watch you from edges and corners - who are they, and what secrets lurk in the utopia they\u2019ve built?\nVisit Everjoy now, where the good times must never end.\n\nMomatoes' EVERJOY adventure will now be available in .PDF, and will be distributed, fully illustrated, along with Sinta Posadas' A STARBORN RESISTANCE, once the core book has shipped, ensuring that everyone will have a nice shiny core book to run their adventures with! We can't wait to see what Momatoes has in store for us, and what else the future may bring for Orbital Blues!\nWe've received nothing but kind words and praise for our art direction, so as such we're taking the leap to collect all the creative energies that have made this project a reality, with Wayward Stars: The Art of Orbital Blues. A coffee table art book in miniature (we're looking at 6\" x 9\" A5 horizontal) Wayward Stars will delve into the artistic process, world-building and step-by-step explorations of how a tabletop game's art is made, with words from Josh Clark.\nPlaceholder!\nA deep-dive into the worldbuilding of Orbital Blues.\nWayward Stars will be available as an add-on, or available in the WAYWARD STAR, SPACE COWBOY 2 or INTERSTELLAR KINGPIN pledge levels, and physical copies of Wayward Stars will ship alongside core books in August 2021.\nPostcards from the Frontier Galaxy were our first stretch goal,  available from \u00a315,000. These will be included free at all pledges levels of Space Cowboy and above. We're polling 12 pieces of art to decide 3 final pieces, and Bounty Hunter pledges will receive a collection of all 3. Interstellar Outlaw pledges will get 2 of the postcards, and Space Cowboy pledges will receive one.  These Print Postcards will add no additional costs to pledges or shipping. \nAt \u00a320,000 we added the talented Sinta Posadas to our writing team! Sin Posadas (@diwataMANILA) is a game designer and illustrator obsessed with the galaxy and all of its possible tragedies that lie in wait, just out of reach. \nSin has pitched us an adventure called A STARBORN RESISTANCE, which we'll be releasing in .PDF form.\nPlaceholder Cover.\nVaris X-0 was once a gleaming jewel in the crown of the Wings of Valor Confederacy. The Confederacy constructed \"Harvester Homes\" of the Scintilla Commune, a string of asteroid belts fitted onto an intra-atmospheric nuclear power harvester, home to any colonist willing to risk their necks for the promise of cheap lodging and a regular wage.  \nAfter a cheaper extraction method was found a few million light years away, the Confederacy abandoned the system, leaving the Harvester Homes to rust. These days, it's just a few Interstellar Outlaws trying to keep the place afloat: salvaging equipment, finding food and power, fighting off bandits and worse. In this delapidated backwater, communities need help to keep things afloat. But what happens when a representative of the Confederacy returns, promising to restore glory to the Scintilla? At what cost? To what end for the Confederacy? And what's in it for you?\n\nUpon reaching \u00a320,000 in funding, A Starborn Resistance began development, and will release as a .PDF adventure shortly after the release of the physical Orbital Blues core rulebook in August 2021. Should we reach levels of funding to commission a several contributing writers, we'll compile their works into a compilation for physical release later in the year.\n\nOrbital Blues is a SoulMuppet Publishing Production, but it has been brought about by a crack-team of independent talent to make something fresh & exciting. Here's the run-down on who's who.\n\nSam Sleney (@samsleney) is a freelance writer, and Creative Director for First Falling Leaf Publishing. Orbital Blues is Sam's manuscript and creative vision, born out of a lifetime love of space westerns, and being raised on the records of Bruce Springsteen in lieu of a father figure.  Together with artistic realisations from Josh Clark and the mechanical mind of Zachary Cox, Sam has fused the team's talent into the Interstellar Blues Explosion that is Orbital Blues. \n\nJosh Clark (@tinywoodsman) is an artist and creator who has worked on everything from album covers to business cards and video games to podcast art. His work can be seen in First Falling Leaf's \"Sins: Dead City \", From Sorrow To Serenity's \"Trifecta EP Project\" and in the worldbuilding booklet \"The Quiet Future\". He can be found at TinyWoodsman. As our lead artist, Josh brought the world & creative vision of Orbital Blues to life from the Day 1, and made the project what it is today. \n\nZachary Cox (@JellyMuppet) is the Managing Partner of SoulMuppet Publishing, dabbling in everything from printing, distribution, management and social media. The original creator of Best Left Buried, Zach has contributed to the mechanical writing and masterminded improvements on Best Left Buried's engine for Orbital Blues, adapting the original SRD and mechanics to perfectly accompany lo-fi, space western roleplay.\nJared Sinclair (@infinite_mao) is an editor and sometime writer of games and games-related material. His work as a writer includes Anti-Sisyphus, What's So Cool About Outer Space?, Prismot!, and The Vanilla Game. He also runs Spear Witch, an independent online bookstore specializing in small-creator game books and zines. As our editor, Jared cut the manuscript of Orbital Blues into shape, making it into a lean, cohesive and accessible book that cuts right to the heart of thematic play. \n\nLone Archivist (@LoneArchivist) is a game and graphic designer based out of Southern California. His work includes writing and design for a handful of third-party modules for games such as Mothership and Best Left Buried as well as several self-published system-agnostic game supplements. When not working on games he can be found crate-digging for a new Jazz record or adding yet another book to the TBR list. Lone is currently hard at working coalescing the manuscript, art and style of Orbital Blues into a tight, stylish and striking print. \n\nChris Bissette (@Pangalactic) is a Manchester-based game designer and musician. His game The Wretched - along with its original soundtrack - was selected as one of Tabletop Gaming Magazine's Best Games of 2020 and has spawned hundreds of games using its Wretched & Alone engine. Chris is performing as the fictional band The Deltas on their debut Cassette LP, Orbital Blues, which you can pick up alongside the core rulebook as a keynote piece. You can find Chris' music, games, and more at LootTheRoom. \n\nSin is the designer of the Planted RPG series, a small collection of tabletop rpgs where you play as sentient plants defending your homes from evil bugs. Their other works include explorations into your deepest fears in the Deep, Deep River, fanciful food trips in Lutong Banwa, and playing out the dramatics of being agents of a Tower racing against the Apocalypse in Navathem's End. They're currently working to complete Navathem's End after it was successfully funded as part of the recently concluded #OurShores Kickstarter campaign. You can find their other melancholic games here, on their itch.io page. Sin will be writing A Starborn Resistance, an adventure for Orbital Blues achieved as a stretch goal. \n\nMomatoes (@momatoes) is a Filipina game and graphic designer who has written RPGs about memory, legacy, and the dear price wizards pay for their ambition. Her biggest project, ARC, is a rules-light, tension-heavy RPG that\u2019s coming to Kickstarter in 2021 and is one of Dicebreaker\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d upcoming RPGs.  Momatoes will be writing EVERYJOY, an Orbital Blues adventure that we unlocked as a stretch goal.\n\nOrbital Blues began life as an internal passion project, that snowballed into release through enthusiasm and available connections in lockdown. We're looking to diversify the team for Orbital Blues with immediate stretch goals for writers and contributors from a greater wealth of backgrounds than the core team, and will be adding such individuals here once we've hired them at competitive rates. If you're interested in writing for Orbital Blues, get in touch here, with writing samples, pitches or portfolios.\n\nWe've had a few people now from various parts of the world asking for more detailed shipping information so they can make an informed decision about pledging. When you take Brexit, the global pandemic and shipping delays, and add them to the fact SoulMuppet Publishing only has experience in smaller scale print-runs from calmer times, it's been hard to make estimated guesses on the prices of shipping for a project that's shaping up to be this successful. However, we've gone away, done our homework, made some enquiries and ran some numbers, and below are our current shipping estimates.\nWe'll update this image where it appears on the main campaign body actively whenever anything changes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our book already being in final stages of completion and this Kickstarter serving as a means of production, we don't have any concerns for the completion of this project.

Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow. We'll also notify you when late pledges are available after the campaign.\n Tinkerer: $20 With this pledge you get everything the Whisperer gets, plus a full color PDF version of the physical game, including all of the art. This version will be released shortly after we have sent our files to the printer and you'll have access to it before the physical copies have been delivered.\n Warrior: $50 (plus shipping)All of the benefits of both the Whisperer and the Tinkerer plus you'll get one full color hard cover edition and access to all Stretch Goals. You can choose to keep your physical copy of the book or donate it to a reservation library. If you donate, we'll handle the shipping. \n Healer: $100 All of the benefits of Whisperer, Tinkerer, and Warrior, PLUS we'll ship a full hardcover copy of Coyote and Crow to a Native American reservation library in your honor. You pay for the shipping for your copy and we'll pay for the shipping to the reservation copy.\n Scout: $150 (plus shipping) For Friendly Local Games Stores Only. With this pledge you'll receive 6 copies of Coyote and Crow (1 case). You'll receive these at the same time as other Kickstarter backers, in advance of the general release.\n Seeker: $400 (plus shipping) (ALL GONE) For those that really want to support Coyote and Crow! All of the benefits of the Whisperer, Tinkerer, Warrior and Healer pledges, but your book will be signed and numbered by Connor Alexander. You'll also receive three high quality art prints of art used in the book (which ones, to be determined). This level is limited to 50 backers.\nIt still hungers. Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

A friend messaged me over the weekend and was already mulling some ideas for a Saga.

A very kind person pointed out that our icon for the Warrior was almost identical to the modern icon used in Black Power messaging. This was entirely an error on my part. I used a placeholder mock-up instead of our final icon and we've since remedied that. You can see the actual icon for the Warrior in the current image on the Campaign page. The icon that was there previously was an internal use only illustration that was meant as a developmental reference and was never intended for print.  I apologize to anyone who was confused or concerned, and I truly hope there was no offense caused.  We have the deepest respect for our Black allies and our icon was always meant as a nod to them.

I may not know if I have Nahua, Chorotega, or maybe even Chibcha roots, but I still know I'm indigenous! Nevertheless, you will still find pure indigenous tribes in every Latin American country who continue to practice their traditions; I'm not just referring to uncontacted Amazonian tribes! In Nicaragua alone, there are 7 indigenous groups recognized by the government with populations ranging from 2,000 to 200,000+. And even with groups like the Taino, who experienced a more complete genocide, and more than 80% of the Taino were killed, there still remain Taino people and historians who are practicing and preserving their heritage. In short, a few tribes may not have living practitioners, but that's what written records and anthropologists are for, and you don't want to underestimate the number of tribes and groups still out there.

After playing in over a thousand collective West Marches games and successfully fading back into obscurity after a callout from Matt Colville, we\u2019ve decided to take a short break from making fictional women kiss to spread our #sworddream design sensibilities with whomever is interested. \nThe zine is written by Lyn Artimez, Jacob Metz, and Lucky Fudge. All of our art is lovingly crafted by Vinn\u2019s Box, our beautiful rage gremlin. Lyn is responsible for project management, fulfillment, and all nebulous twitter garbage. Audio mix for our animated short was provided by SquareKohai. Lucky, in addition to his other responsibilities, remains a crucial source of wholesome farm empathy for the team.

There isn't an edition of it that spends any effort at all providing scaffolding that will capture the imagination and prompt players or gamemasters to explore the process of creation. Oh, don't get me wrong: I've had plenty of fun spending hours pouring over tables figuring out what options are available to my characters, calculating costs, finding new magic items in supplements and figuring out how to best exploit them, but with few exceptions did I understand how my character was actually enchanting a sword or what ingredients or processes went into brewing a potion beyond how much money or time I had to spend (and in some editions XP cost and feat qualifications). I remember the wonder I felt the first time I encountered Brown Mould in a session and thought \u201chow can I use this to make a refrigerator?\u201d There were no rules for that, and I had a lot of fun working out with my GM how it would work, getting investors, and starting a business selling Leif's Brown Chests, an alchemical solution to your cold storage needs! I imagined a campaign where players designed or researched items, secured the materials to build them, and distributed them, but it fell apart when I realized that the most fun part was discovering materials and exploring how they might fit together, and that simply wasn't a part of the game we were playing. Two editions later it still isn't.\nThat was 15 years ago, and I've learned a thing or two about the hobby. I've read and written tools to capture that feeling of discovery that enchanted me once upon a time, and more importantly I've written a theory of magic that can guide game masters as they focus on the story of how magic items are made, and I present it here as it relates to making potions for your game, with an aim to make it feel like a part of a living, breathing world, hopefully versatile enough to fit in any system and adaptable to any setting. \nA Little Taste....\nPlaceholder cover. Rhipsalis Bracchia \u00a9 2021 Becca Junop\n'Of the theme that I have declared to you, I will now that ye make in harmony together a Great Music [...] but I will sit and hearken, and be glad that through you great beauty has been wakened into song.' -J.R.R. Tolkien, The Silmarillion\nJust as the Ancients knew that the pitch of a note was related to the length of a string, that musical theory formed a cycle, and that the ratios and relation of notes map onto celestial orbits, they also spoke of the harmony of terrestrial bodies and the symphony of life. Whether divinely inspired or merely a beautiful if cold constant of the multiverse, scholars disagree, but the theory of Musica Universalis does go a long way towards predicting outcomes in Alchemy and so an enterprising student of the craft would do well to study it. Bego of Q'op first made the connection between the Great Music and the variations of hue that fire produces when burning different compounds. Maatharxas writes of a complex series of pipes and tuning forks used to measure the density of vapours produced when plants were heated to different temperatures. And of course the great mage Pythagoras Harmon published his Principia Tetractys which provided a proof for Ethereal Tone Theory. This text will not concern itself with commentary on these proofs, but does suggest to new readers Gartholomewp Bitter-Taste's Thoughts on Pythagoras and Mrs. Bitter-Taste's Critiques on My Husband.\nSubsidized Copies\nIf you're BIPOC, disabled, LGBTQIA2S+ or just broke hit me up and I'll send you a free PDF from the pile sponsored by the Wandering Apothecarist and Master Alchemist tier.

You intended to come alone, but a red fawn has taken to following you for the past few days. It chews on the grass at your feet. As always, your beloved is never late, although you have been waiting since dawn. Their arrival is heralded by the call of a large black raven and the wind seems to pause; a moment of calm descends. They always had a flair for drama.\nThey wear the traditional robes, freshly dyed in the deep blue of a plant that you do not yet know, and lean on an almost perfectly straight and uniform branch as a staff. There is a colourful spray of flowers that seems to be growing in their beard, and a bright green vine holds back their hair. They always had the ear of the plants. \nYou eschewed robes many seasons ago. You wear only the skin of a large brown bear, and carry only a smooth rock. You had suggested bowers in the woods for this meeting, but they suggested this place. You can see much of your land from here. They always had a knack for choosing.\nYou smile at them, perhaps showing a bit too many teeth. They nod back, but there is some warmth in their eyes. There are no greeting words in this ritual. You hear raven squawks again, and you look up to see a small murder circling above you. You sense it is time to begin, but you wait. They always go first.\nA Divorce of Druids and the Division of their Domains is an I-Cut, You-Choose. Print-And-Destroy, Craft-RPG-Game Subscription Web Zine for exactly 2 players. It takes about an hour to play. \nA Divorce of Druids and the Division of the Domains is a game about a druidic dyad splitting up and dividing their domain, which includes a variety of creatures and plants. The druids are torn between taking what they need to form a harmonious land for themselves and leaving their once beloved partner druid with enough to create a harmonious land as well. \nIt is a game about endings and beginnings, about being fair and about getting what you want.\nI-Cut, You-Choose\nYou and another player will divide your once-shared domain, including the plants and creatures within it. This requires literally cutting printed sheets of the land into two pieces. Each turn, one player cuts the land and the other gets the first choice of which piece to take.\nPrint-and-Destroy\nAs part of playing the game, you will destroy the game. Each issue also has an element of discovery, and has been designed to be played only once by each druid. That's why we intend to make four issues available - one delivered each season.\nHybrid Craft-RPG-Game\nThe game asks you to inhabit the role of a druid undergoing a ritual of separation from their beloved, and also asks you to consider how to win, as part of the experience. It blends the line between player and character more than traditional board games, but has more structure and less preparation than a roleplaying game. Also: you get to cut things, glue things, and colour in woodland creatures.\nSubscription Web Zine\nInspired by the spirit of Zine Quest, we\u2019ve designed this as a physical zine product but also as a digital product that you can make physical with the magic of a home printer. We're taking things one extra step and going magazine-style, with a subscription option to keep the spirit alive all year long.\nThis is a game for two druids about the end of their dyad and the transformation of a diminished land into two new lands. It takes about an hour to play. Players want to divide their land so that each of them has enough to form a harmonious new domain... but they also want their new land to be more harmonious.\nThe rules provide prompts and instruct players to speak. You don\u2019t need to use the exact words (you\u2019re not some wizard-by-memorisation), so have a little fun with it. Let the spirit of the ritual flow through you.\nModes\nBefore starting the game, you choose which mode you will play. True Neutral is the intended default mode, but Neutral Good offers a true cooperative experience.\nNeutral Good\nDruids aim to create the best outcomes for both themselves and their beloved. At the end of the ritual, your shared destiny is determined by the druid with the lowest score.\nTrue Neutral\nDruids place a greater emphasis on their own destiny, but still care about their beloved. At the end of ritual, your destiny will be determined by your score, and influenced by your partner.\nNeutral Evil\nYou play antagonistically against your beloved, with your destiny determined by the difference between your score and your partner. \nThe Characters\nThe game starts by establishing the characters you will each play. \nChoose one trait for yourself and one for your beloved, while they do the same. Traits provide ways to manipulate the game.\nYou also collaborate with your beloved to establish names for yourselves and your dyad based on your traits. Finally, you declare a reason to end your union. The ritual of separation isn't about blame.\nThe Division of Lands\nEach turn, one player is the Divider while the other is the Decider. The Divider literally cuts the land into two distinct fragments, and then the Decider chooses which to take first. \nEach player forms their new domain by gluing these land fragments onto a blank map. Fragments may be divided again using a limited number of additional cuts. After you glue things onto your land, you can colour them in.\nThe Laws\nDruids typically co-steward lands with a circle of several other druids, each with separate but overlapping responsibilities. A dyad is an uncommon circle configuration, as it tends to be quite fragile. In dyads, druids steward the land in almost binary fashion, without overlapping responsibilities. \nEvery living thing within your land has a Law determining how it scores at the end of the game. As a half of a druidic dyad, you have been responsible for half of the things within your land, so you only know half of the laws of your land. Your beloved knows the other half. \nThroughout the game, you will question your beloved about the other Laws, gaining knowledge about how to score.\nDetermining your Destiny\nWhen the druids have formed their new domains, end the game and your dyad by calculating your score and referencing the score of both druids to a table of outcomes. This gives you an outcome and some dialogue prompts to help you and your beloved narrate the ending of your story.\nFinally, you have a few moments of quiet time to name your land and finish colouring it in.\nA completed, coloured and named game\nWe're trying something a bit experimental with this project. We'll be doing a quarterly subscription to deliver a fresh seasonal issue of the game  every three months throughout 2021. \nEach issue will be a standalone experience, with new mechanics, content, and illustrations. We hope people will appreciate receiving these experiences delivered as the seasons change throughout a year.\nOur goal is to ship (whether digital or physical) at the peak of each season: \nOstara (Vernal Equinox) - March 20\nLitha (Summer Solstice) - June 21\nMabon (Autumnal Equinox) - September 23\nYule (Winter Solstice) - December 22\nAlthough this project isn't about juicy Kickstarter *bling* we do have some stretch goals in mind... \nDesigner\u2019s note\nFirst of all, I would like to acknowledge the First Nations people as the Traditional Owners of Brisbane, the land where this game was designed. I recognise the country north and south of the Brisbane River, as the home of both the Turrbul and Jagera nations. I pay deep respects to all Elders past and present and future.\nSecondly, and within the context of the above acknowledgement, when I started designing a game about connection to land and creatures, I needed to make a choice about which land and which creatures. I made the choice to take the traditions of the only living culture that I have any right to, that of the world\u2019s most popular roleplaying game. \nThe druids you play in this game are not intended to be references to the Celts or other pagan traditions which continue today. They are the druids that stayed behind, when their peers left to beat up rats in taverns and buddy up with religious zealots for fame and experience points. They are the druids that actually care for the land and each form. They are True Neutral, and they are a metaphor for you and your relationships and your connection to your past via the objects in the life that give you joy and bind you in place.\nI\u2019ve specifically avoided any specific reference to traditions that aren\u2019t just fantasy nonsense, as they are not mine to make. We're syncing up the seasons to the northern hemisphere to fit in with the chosen creatures depicted in the game. \nHave fun, be cool, spend time in nature, and tend your forests and your friendships. \n- Jason \nJason has been wandering the forest of game design and development for a while now. As a studio unto himself, he made Hedron and almost Ragnaroll (sorry, no, I\u2019m not currently planning on revisiting it), and was a developer for Rule & Make on Hand of Fate: Ordeals. He can also be found frolicking in the digital fields with his Living Rules system.\nAsh has been working full-time on boardgames for almost four years (mostly on Vampire: the Masquerade - Heritage).

It\u2019s also about leadership, friendship, and empathy. That\u2019s why we have the Tenderpeak Pals system! With the help of our camp\u2019s artificial intelligence Digital Organization Tool for Teaching/Tethering Youths (DOTT/TY, for short), we organize campers into small groups to improve their educational opportunities and performance! Some groups may not get along, but DOTT/TY has assured us that disagreement can help campers bond and learn the benefits of cooperation!\nEvery day is full of adventure! Learn exciting new skills at camp, like hydron reactor maintenance, summoning ogre dogs, and woodworking! Explore the realms surrounding the grounds, such as the deep underwater kingdom of Nimerea or the robot-filled stronghold of the Fortress Technica. They may find local denizens that need help, jerks that need a whoopin\u2019, or a new experience that needs trying!

We have a 99% success rate with those children that make it home!\nThe Heroes of Radness: Camp Tenderpeak is an RPG inspired by many animated adventure series, such as Adventure Time, The Bravest Warriors, Infinity Train, and Summer Camp Island. The story is guided by a player who takes on the role of the Head Counselor at Camp Tenderpeak. The other players are campers, learning how to become great heroes.\nThe camp\u2019s \u201cbunks\u201d are actually small one-person bungalows that are lined up in three rows, which represent the three heroic disciplines:\n the Arcane -- heroes that focus on magic\n the Technical -- heroes that focus on science\n the Innate -- heroes born with innate abilities\nEach camper is assigned a specific row based upon their talents and given a bungalow on that row.\nAs campers learn new skills, they\u2019ll earn the most coveted relics of all: MERIT BADGES! Each badge has specific requirements to earn, such as specific tasks or displaying proficiency. They\u2019re all tracked in the Camp Tenderpeak Merit Badge Guide and Manual, which is kept by every camper. At the end of each week, campers gather at the Bonfire, where they will regale the camp with their adventures, determining if merit badge progress has been made. If the Lead Counselor agrees, the task is marked in the guide. When the required tasks are completed, the merit badge is awarded by the Head Counselor during the Ceremony of Merit during the Bonfire.\nThe Heroes of Radness: Camp Tenderpeak runs on an experimental evolution of the Story Pillar system used in Home by Dark, allowing for campaign-style play and character improvement. It still focuses on relationships and character interactions while introducing skill resolution and growth paths found in traditional tabletop RPGs.\nCharacter growth and story arc completion are the primary ways to \u201clevel up\u201d in this game.  Learning how to work better with your friends will improve your ability to overcome obstacles, while resolving character plots and flaws will improve your character\u2019s capability.\nThis exploration is something we\u2019ve wanted to do for a while and Kickstarter\u2019s ZineQuest 3 event is giving us an opportunity to bring you along with us on the journey!\nThe Heroes of Radness: Camp Tenderpeak contains everything you need to have adventures in Camp Tenderpeak\u2019s pocket dimension:\n Campers\u2019 Guide -- Information on Camp Tenderpeak, the staff, and its traditions. It also contains details on the neighboring lands that surround the campgrounds.\n   The Rules -- Details on building your camper, how to resolve interactions and obstacles, and what to expect from adventures at camp.\n   Head Counselor Manual -- All the information that a Head Counselor needs to run an adventure and how to host a Bonfire and the Ceremony of Merit.\n   Camp Tenderpeak Merit Badge Guide and Manual -- A copyable booklet that acts as camper character sheet and merit badge progress guide.\n   Sheet of Merit Badges -- The end of the book will contain a copyable sheet of merit badges that you can print and cut out for the Ceremony of Merit.\nWhat do you get for backing each tier? Let\u2019s find out:\n Day Camper -- This is our support tier for those who want to help out a bit. This tier will give you access to backer-only updates.\n   New Camper -- A digital version of the zine, distributed through DriveThruRPG.\n   Camp Counselor -- Both physical and digital versions of the zine, saddle-stitched with a full color cover and black-and-white interior.\n   Camp Director -- Not only does it have physical and digital versions of the zine, but it also comes with two full color merit badge sticker sheets! Add a bit of color to your campers\u2019 badge collection! NOTE: Extra sticker sheets will be available as an add-on in BackerKit after the Kickstarter ends.\nPledge Management will be fulfilled by BackerKit, one of the most popular pledge management systems out there. We\u2019ve used them before and they were great! Only makes sense to use them again!\nShipping costs will be added to the pledge during the final preparation stages. This reduces our estimated budget, giving us a higher chance to meet our goal, and ensures that shipping will be more accurate when we ship the final product.\nAll of our digital products will be released via DriveThruRPG.\nThe focus of this project is the zine itself, but we do have a couple of stretch goals that we hope you\u2019ll help us achieve:\n $2750 - More Illustrations -- If we reach this tier, we\u2019ll be able to increase the art budget, bringing in more awesome illustrations for the book!\n   $3250 - Camp Tenderpeak Merit Badge Guide and Manual Upgrade -- Instead of being part of the zine, the merit badge guide will be its own standalone booklet. It lists all of the merit badges, their requirements, and a spot to stick the earned badge; it\u2019s part character sheet and part sticker book! It will give the camper a tangible artifact of their character\u2019s progress! 5.5\u201d x 4.25\u201d (quarter letter page size).

A multitude of factions in the city seek to purchase, discover, commission, and otherwise acquire a vast collection of items to be used, investigated, or traded.\nA Catalogue Chimerical is a zine of one-hundred-and-forty-four items described and illustrated by an Aydinlar Cataloguer, a specialist in analyzing and describing these fantastic objects for later use. The zine is framed as a magical mail-order catalogue. Members of their University back home acquire items by spending votive ink, the currency of the Aydinlar Suzerainty.  \nEvery backer of this campaign will also get a digital copy of Lost and Found, a d36 zine of Pentolan magical items! \nWhat's inside the zine?\nEach of the thirty-six pages in this zine includes four items and at least one sketch of the items on that page. There will also be an art-free version with half the page count, ideal for printing at home.\nAt the base level of funding, the art edition of the zine will have one illustration for each page, meaning one quarter of the items are given custom illustrations. At higher levels of funding, additional sketches will be added until all the items are illustrated.\nHere are a few examples of the writing for such items:\nThimble of Bloodsweat Endeavors - Example Item\nThis small porcelain thimble is chased in scarlet and has a crimson silk slip cover. The markings on the thimble itself are minute and depict a cheerful but strained proprietor hawking various wares from a cart.\nIf the bearer spills enough of their own blood into the thimble to fill it, they are unable to use any magic for the day, though they find all mundane ventures one step easier. Each time the thimble is used, it seems to grow in size.\nFrostgiver Pendant - Example Item\nThis lapis lazuli pendant is miraculously strung not with wire but with thin ironoak, mysteriously supple whilst held. The engraving on the pendant shows a woman offering her cloak while snow falls thick.\nAnyone whom the wearer lends clothing to finds that they are utterly immune to the cold. Until the item is returned, the pendant wearer frosts everything they touch, though their extremeties slowly become frostbitten over the next several days unless the item is returned or they give away something else.\nMoonberry Ring - Example Item\nThis thick ring is made of smoothly polished granite and topped with an ironoak relief of the watchful moon at its zenith over a berry bush. It smells of crushed raspberries.\nThe bearer of this ring is compelled to kiss it and to seek out fruits to satisfy their newfound sweet tooth; every day that circumstances keep them from eating such fruit they become bitterly selfish. All tastes become extraordinarily more potent, their tongue an order of magnitude more sensitive.\nMarblewound Khopesh - Example Item\nThis olive-handled khopesh has a Pentolan marble blade, pale green veined with gray. The hilt is polished smooth and inlaid with tiny discs of gold which hum softly unless in moonlight.\nWhen the curved blade inflicts a wound it calcifies the damaged flesh, leaving an obvious marble scar and preventing most forms of mundane healing without further surgery.\nFlamekeeper Vambraces - Example Item\nThese puce drakeleather vambraces are tooled meticulously in the image of roiling flames, the heart of each of them embossed with bronze.\nWhen worn, anything held in either hand shrinks to half its normal size in a flash of scorching light, returning to normal size when let go, but glowing-hot.\nLet's talk about the Art for this Zine.\nThe Catalogue is not just a collection of written items, however. It's also going to feature at least one illustration for every four items (36 in total!) - and, if we unlock enough stretch goals, expand all the way to ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR illustrations, one for every last item in the Catalogue.\nThe art will be in the form of sketches by the Cataloguer themself (Aaron Radney being the artist on Earth pulling this off), meant to be quick illustrations of the item for the readers of the Catalogue to get a visual for. Each will be roughly A9 (1.5\" x 2\") in size.\nAaron has an extremely well developed sketch style that was much of the inspiration for this project - when we conceived of a catalogue of magical items, it was obvious there was only one choice for who to illustrate it.\nHere are a couple examples of Aaron's work in the sketch style that will be in the zine:\nAlt Text: An image sketched in brown pencil on white paper of a thin, relatively androgynous figure with kinky hair sweeping back from their head, again with distinctly African features and seen from the waist up. They wear a cloak that sweeps forward sa if blone in the wind. They carry two scimitars, one in each hand and are leanly muscular wearing a wrap of some sort across their chest, loose pants and a cloth wrap around their waist with their midriff bare.\nAlt Text: A picture of a male elf, seen from the shoulders up and sketched with brown and white pencil on tan toned paper. He's looking out of the corner of his eyes. He has African features, a close cropped afro and high cheekbones. The ears are long, pointed and adorned with rings. The image is lightly crosshatched for its shading.\nNotes on Accessibility\nBoth versions of the zine will fully meet the PDF/UA Standard, ensuring that they are as accessible as we can make them. We'll also publish an epub version of the item text for easier/more accessible reading on tablets and e-readers.\nWe will also be producing a WCAG 2.0 Accessible website for the magical items (no art included) which will include all of the items from the zine as well as bonus items - this site will have full text search, collection pages for both bonus items and Catalogue items, and random-item selector. \nYou can find a preview of that website at catalogue-chimerical.netlify.app - we'll be updating it as writing and editing is complete, putting it out as soon as they are completed so you don't need to wait on the PDFs/epub. You can actually view the bonus items right now!\nBacker Tiers - what they cost and what you get for them\n$1 - Curious Onlooker Tier\nThis tier primarily provides support to the team - every single penny and pledge helps this project be successful. You'll get a digital copy of Lost & Found, a print-at-home zine with 36 magical items in it and have access to the community copies, physical and digital alike, before anyone outside of Kickstarter gets access.\n$7 - Home Scrivener Tier\nIn addition to prior rewards, this tier gets you a copy of the artless PDF version of Catalogue Chimerical, enabling you to print a copy at home without using all of your ink.\n$12 - Chronicler Tier\nIn addition to prior rewards, this tier gets you a copy of the illustrated PDF edition of Catalogue Chimerical so you can revel in the beautiful art. You also make a digital community copy of both editions of the Catalogue available!\n$24 - Archivist Tier\nIn addition to the rewards from prior tiers, at this level you get a physical copy of the illustrated PDF edition of A Catalogue Chimerical. Every 5 pledges at this level makes a physical community copy of the zine available for other folks! \n$48 - Neighborhood Advocate Tier\nIn addition to the rewards from the Archivist tier, at this level you fund six digital community copies instead of one and every backer at this tier funds two physical community copies as well! This tier exists for those folks who have the funds and share the belief with our team that art should be made as widely available as possible.\n$72 - Artisan Tier\nIn addition to the rewards from the Archivist tier, at this level you also get an hour consultation with Michael on an artisan NPC - he will then go on to create a print-at-home PDF for you that includes the NPC and six items made by them, just for you! Every backer at this tier also secures both a physical and digital community copy of the Catalogue.\n$144 - Dozenal Dealer Tier\nThis tier is primarily intended for retailers; it includes a dozen copies of the print edition of A Catalogue Chimerical and funds 12 digital and 4 physical community copies as well!\nWho's on the team for A Catalogue Chimerical?\nThe writing for this project is by Michael T. Lombardi, the illustrations are by Aaron Radney, editing is by Samuel Mui Shen Ern, layout is by Dai Shugars, worldbuilding consultancy for the Aydinlar Suzerainty is by Bee Scerri, and character consultancy, sensitivity consultancy, and voice acting is by Persephone. Finally, if the audio format is unlocked, Adil Leghari will join the team as our audio engineer.\nAaron Radney - Illustrator\n Aaron Radney is a fantasy illustrator who loves stories, world building and how the two intersect within the field of illustration. He grew up on a steady diet of fantasy books and shows as well as a healthy dose of mythology and dragons provided by his mother\u2019s substantial book collection. He studied at Memphis College of Art in Memphis, Tennessee and is focused both on helping clients bring their ideas to life and illuminating the power of diverse heroes through drawing heavily from non-Eurocentric inspirations. \nHe\u2019s currently based out of St. Louis Missouri living there happy with his partner and tolerating her needy tuxedo cat. In his spare time he plays fantasy card and tabletop games as well as writes to feed the world building addiction and cooks to feed his belly.\nMichael T Lombardi - Writer\nMichael T. Lombardi is a kitbash enthusiast game designer and developer based in in the St. Louis region of the United States. He is interested in exploring procedural generation, gameable lore, and alternative models and modes of development. He splits his free time between game and open source development (currently working on Platen, digital tooling to make hosting accessible and interactive editions of digital games easier and cheaper).\nSamuel Mui Shen Ern - Editor\nSamuel Mui Shen Ernis a game designer, writer, editor, musician, and visual artist from Malaysia. Their works explore real-world topics like death, relationships, and emotional brokenness with an unwaveringly brutal honesty and a sense of fun(?)! When she\u2019s not working on hir next big thing, he\u2019s probably zoning out to k-pop, experimenting in the kitchen, or reading autobiographical comics.\nDai Shugars - Layout Artist\nDai Shugarsis a graphic designer and publisher out of Orlando, Florida known for such books as Libret\u00e9, The Demon Collective, Lorn Song, and Mystic Punks. He's also written several articles on PDF accessibility and how RPGs could stand to better utilize the medium.\nBen \"Bee\" Scerri - Worldbuilding\nBen \"Bee\" Scerri is a non-binary bisexual Maltese Australian tabletop- and video game producer, writer, designer, and community builder, living in Melbourne, Australia. Their work focuses on themes of diaspora, disability/critical illness, self-actualisation, and found family, often through the lenses of their ethnic and queer intersections. When not writing for or about games, they're likely talking about language, cooking, baking, folklore, and/or fashion.\nPersephone - Consulting & Acting\nPersephone is a writer, content creator, model and sensitivity consultant working in multiple fields. She is also an active Twitch streamer, working to build a platform that promotes inclusion and acceptance.\nShe is also the DM of her own actual play podcast, Fast Times at D&D High, and the creator of the upcoming 5th edition parody game, Critical Love. You can find her @Persephiroth on Twitter, Twitch, TikTok, and more. \nAdil Leghari - Audio Engineer\nAdil Leghari enjoys creative pursuits, playing with audio, video, and images. When not working on DevOps and Automation, he enjoys long walks on the beach, candlelit dinners, and designing stickers.\nWhat are the stretch goals for A Catalogue Chimerical?\n$8550 - Expanded Illustrations Stretch Goal\nAt this level, the zine will include an additional 36 (total of 72) custom illustrations by Aaron Radney, covering half of the items in the zine. \n$10,500 - Expanded Illustrations II Stretch Goal\nAt this level, the zine will include an additional 36 (total of 108) custom illustrations by Aaron Radney, meaning 75% of the items get an illustration.\n$12000 - FULLY ILLUSTRATED Stretch Goal\nAt this level, the zine will include an additional 36 custom illustrations by Aaron Radney, meaning every single item in the zine will have an accompanying illustration!\n$18000 - Audio Format & Diaries Stretch Goal\nAt this level, we will pay Persephone to read each of the entries in A Catalogue Chimerical as the Cataloguer; in-world, the document itself can carry both written word and the diction of the Cataloguer. This means that the very act of reading the Catalogue puts the voice of the Cataloguer into your head, so you hear their diction and cadence and don't have to rely on the written word alone to grasp intent and nuance.\nWe'll also write 12 short diary entries from the perspective of the Cataloguer, making their written form available on the website.\nAdil Leghari will be editing the audio for both the diary and item entries. After the kickstarter campaign wraps (and the work is done), this audio-format for both the items and the diary will be made available separately on bandcamp! Backers at any level will have access to the digital audio if we unlock this stretch goal!\nWhere is the budget for A Catalogue Chimerical going?\nThe breakdown of funding for this project includes:\nWriting and Editing ($1,440) \n36 item sketches ($900)\nLayout for 54 pages [36 with art, 18 for the condensed artless version] ($840)\nWorldbuilding consultancy ($1200)\nCharacter & Sensitivity consultancy ($1800) \nA pie chart showing the budgetary breakdown for the base goal\nOn top of these expense items, we are including a 25% overhead/emergency fund, which includes Kickstarter's own cut. That accounts for the $7,725 initial budget.\nAdditional funds beyond the budget and stretch goals will be split between the team members with the writing and publishing portion of the revenue split going into the general fund for the Gondolieri Cooperative.\nWhat is the Gondolieri Cooperative?\nThis project is being organized under the Gondolieri Cooperative, a new creator-owned organization under which this and all future Pentola projects are being worked. We seek to change the industry by proving out a new model which remunerates everyone involved equitably for their labor, funds the creation of art and games, and reinvests in the community both directly (supporting projects and creators, buying equipment and software, etc) and indirectly (helping keep creators housed/fed through hard times, seeding funds for creative endeavors, establishing re-usable contracts and templates). Our members are international as is the scope of our impact.\nAt this time, the Gondolieri Cooperative consists of three members: Pam Punzalan, Viditya Voleti, and Michael T. Lombardi.\nHow is digital fulfillment for A Catalogue Chimerical being handled?\nAfter successful funding and completion of this project, backers of the project will receive access to printable PDFs of the artless and full version of the zine, as well as the epub editon, via LeanPub, where future sales of the digital copies will be available.\nAdditionally, access to the writing only will be available for free on catalogue-chimerical.netlify.app. That site will be updated as the project writing is completed, meaning you won't need to wait for the final shippable product to start using these items in your games.\nHow is physical fulfillment for A Catalogue Chimerical being handled, and by whom?\nPhysical fulfillment will be handled by Spear Witch in the USA, Monkey's Paw Games in Canada, and Glaucus in Australia.\nBackers at a physical level will be given an at-cost coupon for the physical copy in these stores and have shipping calculated at the time that they use the coupon, meaning backers will pay for shipping via these storefronts.\nThis should be overall safer and cheaper for everyone, especially international folks, who won't have to absorb the international shipping costs from the USA we would otherwise have to charge.\nTo be abundantly clear: YOUR BACKER PLEDGE DOES NOT COVER SHIPPING. YOU WILL NEED TO PAY FOR THAT LATER VIA THE FULLFILLER STOREFRONT OF YOUR CHOICE.\nWhat are community copies and who is getting them?\nCommunity copies are copies of the zine which are earmarked specifically for folks who for any reason cannot afford to purchase a copy for themselves, no questions asked. We will not be means-testing submissions for community copies nor will we be checking to see if you \"need\" one - if you think it's for you, it is. If you don't, it probably is anyway! We do not and will not vet the claims for these copies. We trust you and the community at large to know your own situation and we absolutely encourage that these copies be claimed.\nEvery pledge for a copy of the zine (physical or digital) will seed a digital community copy of the PDFs as well. Every five pledges for a physical copy of the zine will seed a physical community copy as well. Every retail-level pledge will similarly seed four physical copies and twelve digital copies.\nThere is additionally an Advocate tier that seeds even more community copies for anyone who wants to support the community but doesn't want to buy a dozen copies for themselves.\nWe will be making community copies, physical and digital alike, available first to backers of this campaign, even at the $1 level, before opening them up to the wider community (assuming any copies are left).\nWhat sort of schedule for updates can we expect during and after the campaign?\nWe will be posting at least daily updates to this project during the campaign (each including a draft of a new magic item) as well as point-in-time updates when we reach any relevant milestones. We will commit to biweekly updates afterward, posting a status update every other Sunday to keep you in the loop.\nA note on the icons used for this campaign page\nWe used several CC-BY icons on this campaign page - the icons for the items came from game-icons.net while the stretch goal and backer tier icons are FontAwesome.\nThe FontAwesome icons were all licensed CC-BY 4.0.\nThe icons for the items were:\n Pouring Chalice by Lorc under CC-BY 3.0  (The Thimble of Bloodsweat Endeavors)\n Gem Chain by Lorc under CC-BY 3.0 (The Frostgiver Pendant)\n Ring by Delapouite under CC-BY 3.0 (The Moonberry Ring)\n Sparkling Saber by Lorc under CC-BY 3.0 (The Marblewound Khopesh)\n Bracer by Delapouite under CC-BY 3.0 (The Flamekeeper Vambraces)\nThe only changes made to any of the icons were to make them purple-and-white to fit with the colors of this campaign.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've run kickstarters which have successfully funded and delivered before.

Designed as a one shot tabletop RPG experience in the vein of 1917,  All's Quiet on the Western Front, and A Farewell to Arms, Pro Patria Mori is  a tragic two to three hour narrative of hopelessness and loss in the context of war. \n\nPro Patria Mori uses open copyright and creative common licensed art created by participants and witnesses of the war.\nThe game's title is taken from the poem Dulce et Decorum Est by Wilfred Owen. \nThe full collection of works are attributed in the book and listed below: \nUnder the hood, Pro Patria Mori was inspired by the following games and mechanics:\nQuantum Load and Downtime from Blades in the Dark.\nBicameral Stat and Resolution mechanic from Honey Heist. \nMetanarrative Structure and Ruin Track from Trophy Dark. \nd66 random tables from our previous game, The Love Balloon. \nPlayers take on the role of British soldiers on the Western Front in the year is 1917, creating a character by generating a background and assigning a hope to their characters.\nFrom there, the Commanding Office generates a mission using random tables.\nThe game then proceeds through a set metanarrative structure, with two additional Setting and Encounter tables to help prompt the fiction. \nPlayer Characters have two stats - Fear and Grit - which both begin at 3. To resolve actions, players choose which skill and roll a single d6 and succeed when they roll under their stat. If players fail a roll, their Fear increases by 1. If players succeed rolling Grit, their Grit goes up by 1. \n\nIf either skill reaches 6, a specific end state is triggered: the character becomes either Hardened or Shellshocked. \nCharacters can use Rations during interstitials to reflect on their journey thus far, moving 1 Fear to Grit or vice versa as they ponder their eventual fate.\n\nOnce again we are working with Pressman Printing based in Burbank, California to deliver a beautiful limited run saddle-stitched zine.\n6x6\", 40 sides, full color, offset print, 12 pt. cover + 60# interiors.\nPro Patria Mori is created by Vincenzo Ferriero & Ray Chou, with layouts by Vincenzo Ferriero under the banner of Mythopoeia.

Whether it's a staple of your game or something you avoid, when it happens you'll need a weapon!\nFresh From The Forge presents a collection of rules for weapons and combat that can be dropped into and used in any fantasy adventure game! It has been designed first and foremost for use with the Old-School Essentials retro adventure games, but you should have no difficulty dropping it into any other RPG with a similar weapon damage range to the fifth edition of the worlds most popular fantasy RPG i.e. using the full range of standard polyhedral dice.\nMockup of the Front and Back Cover\nFun Instead Of Weapon Simulationism\nThe book doesn't aim to simulate all the intricacies of how weapons work. Armour has not been reworked to be more realistic. You won't find any intricate striking distance measures or precise weapon dimensions in this zine. \nThe goal has been to prioritise something that meets the expectations of adventure game weaponry, while making all options equally valid. Players won't find themselves with one obvious choice of equipment that trumps all others, and these changes will be more meaningful than simply moving damage numbers around.\nIn addition to this, the book will provide examples of weapons, but by no means aims to be a complete collection of every possible weapon your players may wish to use. Instead, it aims to provide templates you can adjust to taste to fit the weapons you create or your players wish to use.\nMockup of Combat Rules\nWhat's In The Book\nFresh From The Forge first and foremost provides a set of rules for you to understand the balance behind weapons and their various uses, both in and out of combat. It will explain the various benefits of each and allow you to better balance any custom weaponry you might design!\nIntroduction: Get to know the book\nOptional Rules for Combat: An alternative to miniature combat\nOptional Rules for War: Extending the dungeon combat system into a war system\nMelee Weapon Types\nAxes: powerful but imprecise\nBlades: precise and consistent\nBludgeons: versatile at a cost\nSimple: usable by all\nMelee Weapon Classes\nLight: throwable with dual weapon fighting\nOne-Handed: keep one free for a shield\nTwo-Handed: hit harder with more force\nPolearm: distance is no obstacle\nMissile Weapons\nBows: the standard weapon at range\nStones & Slings: quick and easy to use\nJavelins: powerful shieldbreakers\nBlowguns & Darts: subtle and precise\nCrossbows & Firearms: primitive but deadly\nNets: to stop them from moving\nMagic Weapons\nEnhancement: simply better than the rest\nBanes and Slayers: kill one thing really well\nSpell Storage: weapons with magical properties\nSpecial Effects: elements, aoe, and everything else\nThe Weapon Shop: Example prices and weights for common weapons\nMockup of the Axe Rules\nHow Much Is Done, What Still Needs Doing?\nShortly after Old-School Essentials released PDFs to Backers, I began using those rules as written to run a large westmarches style campaign. I quickly grew unhappy with the state of weapons, among other things axes being strictly inferior to swords and the clunkiness of \"slow\" weapons made me want to make adjustments.\nSeveral spreadsheets and over a year of playtesting later, I've created something I'm quite proud of. The rules provide meaningful choices at character creation of which weapons you'll start out with, and make choosing which of the weapons you find in the wild you want to bring with you more impactful. That +1 sword you find on your first quest might not always be the best tool for every job anymore.\nThough the rules are written, they could do with a lot of polish and presentation (all of the text you see in mockups on this page is non-final). I'll be focusing on making the layout accessible and easily usable for table reference. After that, it will need proofreading and finalising. Then, it will need to be sent to the printers (who have already been picked and have given a quote for this project). Finally, once it's printed, it will need shipping.\nBecause not everything is finalised yet, I can't give you exact dimensions, but the final product should be around 50 A5 pages in a stable bound booklet printed on at least 130gsm paper.\nMockup of Enhancement, Bane, and Slayer Rules", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk associated with this project is the current state of shipping from the UK.

You've blown up a pipeline before, and you'd gladly do it again because you care about the future of your world. It's not a question of if raw magic will spill from pipelines and freighters to transform local wildlife into bloodthirsty abominations\u2014it's a question of when.\nYou thought the bloodthirsty abominations smelled bad on the Outside\nYour enemies are not to be trifled with: there's the Magic Fund, a cabal of ultrarich (did you ever notice how \"rich\" rhymes with \"lich\"?) capitalists invested in magic extraction; the Office of Magic Licensing and Abuse, the powerful and secretive government organization that subsidizes magic extraction and regulates citizen magic use; and the Burning Bones, a growing necromantic citizen militia whose bootlegger extraction operations fuel their mission to fulfill an unhinged prophecy about a coming lich-messiah. You suspect unsavory links between the three.\nThat's why the Black Shields don't trifle: your order possesses secret knowledge of ancient, sustainable magic cultivation; the spells they can cast with this magic are uniquely well-suited to radical revolutionary action; and they care deeply about each other and humanity's collective well-being. The Shields envision a future in which magic is harvested without exploiting the land, the poor and working class, or future generations.\nThe Black Shields are planning their next assault: a raid on the Feystone Hex-L Pipeline, which is being constructed to exploit a new underground magic vein beneath Allegheny National Forest in Pennsylvania. But more than raw magic lies beneath these woods. \nI also want to punch rich extraction capitalists, but what is this?\nThis is a series of RPG modules crammed into zines! And when I say crammed, I mean we're talking straining staples with 50-60 pages per module. Brevity might be the soul of wit, but just check out how long I can keep this sentence going without even breaking a sweat; these zines will be thicc, or I'll eat my shorts.\nThe modules are system-agnostic, meaning that (with minimal-to-no number fiddling), they will work with your favorite dice-based TRPG system.\nThe zines will present a continuous storyline, but I'm designing the content to be totally cannibalizable for one-shots, sandbox environments, creatures, and so on. Strip my carefully constructed fantasy epic for parts, you beautiful junkyard jackals.\n OK, take me on a fantasy journey. \nCrawler is set on an alternate Earth with a few key differences from ours:\nIt's populated by Humans and Elves and Dwarves and Orcs and all the fun fantasy friends are invited (but none of the racist fantasy tropes)\nMagic exists as a raw natural resource that is fracked, drilled, and mined out of the earth at massive scale, then refined to power society and produce consumer commodities; individual magic use is very strictly regulated, which makes you and your fantasy pipeline-hating comrades a band of charismatic outlaws \nInstead of warming, the planet is cooling dangerously quickly towards a catastrophic ice-age. This is indeed linked to human magic extraction, but the industry is super great at lying about it\nInstead of fascists and idiot militias, Crawler's got liches and necromancy gangs \nThe story begins on the surface world, and then follows a foul plot deep below the earth. Adventurers will descend (and descend, and descend) and discover that the source of magic is inextricably linked to earth's past mass extinctions, and to a dark secret in the Black Shields' history. Oh, and giant fantasy insects from space.\nDon't judge a space bug by its gigantic cover\nThe Zines\nOver the next yearish, I will create four Crawler zines to lay out this campaign arc.\n1. Extraction | In the first Crawler zine, you'll live out the fantasy of foiling the greedy magic extraction industry's plans with cunning spells, creative violence, and collective action. Plan attacks on multiple magic extraction sites while dreaming up a better future! But you know what they say about best-laid plans: sometimes, they go sideways when a bunch of necromancers show up to fight you. What? No one says that? Well, it's true.\n2. Extinction | Follow the Feystone Hex-L Pipeline underground and discover a devastating secret. Vent your rage and despair by bludgeoning the reanimated fossils of animals that early humans ushered towards extinction as we discovered how smart and cool and violent we have the potential to be. Also, this one's got liches.\n3. Chicxulub | The angry spacerock that squad-wiped the dinosaurs 65 million years ago touched down in Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, near the present-day town of Chicxulub (which loosely translates from the Yucatec Maya to, \"demon flea\"). Because of this, that dino-hating rock is called \"the Chicxulub impactor.\" This zine asks the totally normal question, \"what if instead of an asteroid, this had been a gargantuan bug from space crawling with smaller bugs (also from space) that crash-landed because it was riddled with necro-parasites, and also this was the origin of necromancy on earth?\" Nailed it.\n 4. The Great Dying |  The party learns some hard truths about fantasy bug history, then faces some hard choices about fantasy bug futures. As in our world (in which insects are disappearing at an alarming rate), bugs are a key part of every ecosystem, so threats to them threaten everything. This terrifies me. Can the party save the day and prevent icy cataclysm? That might depend on how they feel about crawling through the innards of a humongous spacebug, confronting a parasitic space-lich, and sacrificing their own ability to use magic forever.\nWhat will these zines look like?\nPlease note that NONE of the concept art on this campaign page is final and I'll be whipping up fresh inky nightmares from scratch. These zines will be in black and white, and look somewhere between the art that I made for Bunker and a webcomic I'm working on.\nMaybe something like this!\nPlanning to print on earth-tone + earth-friendly paper!\nThis is weird. You sound weird.\nThank you! You're sweet. I'm Michael, A.K.A. Haunted Meat, an artist and game boi who loves nature and being an organism on a healthy planet. My first career goal was to be a dinosaur; soon after, it shifted to entomologist; somehow, I ended up a filmmaker and a community organizer for the Sunrise Movement.\nWhat I do have are a very particular set of skills; skills I have acquired over a very long career.\nMy dream is to make nature documentaries; as I've pursued that dream, I've learned too many details about the extinction and environmental injustice crises we face. I started building the world for Crawler in 2015 as an outlet for this accumulating sobering knowledge, mostly via drawing the concept art on this page (which you might recognize from my first-ever game zine). \nLater, I started a homebrew D&D campaign set in the Crawlerverse to help refine a plotline. We played every other week for over a year, during which time we got to explore many different storylines (and laugh many fantasy laughs, and savage many a pizza) together! Success.\nThe Crawler story arc planned for these four zines is a finely distilled v2.0 of that homebrew campaign, updated with lessons from co-creating Bunker and with all the ways that 2020 radicalized me into an even filthier ecosocialist.\nI secretly (um?) hope that playing this game inspires a handful of folks to celebrate the interconnected beauty of our planet, and to investigate how they might help to protect our home.\n Is there someone else I can talk to?\nOf course. The friendly folks at Exalted Funeral (your online home for weird literature including indie RPGs, heavy metal zines, and occult texts) will handle fulfillment, so please do direct all of your important, non-fantasy-insect-related questions to them. Speaking of which, let's talk about...\nShipping!\nDomestic Shipping & Handling will differ by tier, but it'll work out to around $4 - $5 per physical zine. You'll sort this all out in pledgemanager after the campaign. See Timeline? right below for the projected shipping schedule.\nBetween COVID and Brexit and who-knows-what's-coming-next, International shipping is currently obstacle-ridden and outta-whack. We hope that things will be moving more smoothly by the time that Crawler is printed. With that in mind, if you're from outside the U.S.A. but would like Crawler in print, please back at a PDF-only level for now; there'll be an option to upgrade to print copies at these Kickstarter-exclusive prices via Exalted Funeral later.\nTimeline?\nI'm starting with an outline that cherrypicks player-approved encounters, creatures, dungeons, and magical mysteries from 200+ pages of Crawler worldbuilding notes and campaign narrative. Also, a few sketchbooks full of concept art and dungeon maps.\nFrom March --> May, I'll write a first draft of Extraction and Extinction.\nMay --> July, I'll playtest and I'll make art for both zines.\nJuly --> August, I'll revise and lay out and deliver the PDF of Extraction. I'll also be drafting Chicxulub and The Great Dying.\nAugust --> September, I'll revise and lay out and deliver the PDF of Extinction. I'll also be playtesting and illustrating Chicxulub and The Great Dying.\nSeptember --> November, I'll revise and lay out and deliver the PDF of Chicxulub. We'll get Extinction and Extraction printed and shipped.\nNovember --> December, I'll revise and lay out and deliver the PDF of The Great Dying. I'll also begin working with the printer to print all four zines.\nDecember 2021 --> January 2022, we'll print and ship physical copies of the final two zines.\nStretch Goals?\n$3.5K Every backer gets a bonus PDF content pack akin to this one for Bunker. It'll include Welcome Packets for your players, pregenerated characters, and higher-res illustrations & maps.\n$5K Every backer gets a PDF Crawlerverse Bestiary x Minigame. This'll contain all the sludgy skeletons and interstellar insectoids from Crawler, and also a solo game (kinda like my old zines Ranger Danger and Crawler: Monster Manual #1).\n$7K Every backer gets a Dungeon Generator PDF that'll guide you through making Crawlerverse crawls on the fly!\n$12K Every backer gets a PDF of the Crawler Grimoire, which'll detail custom schools of magic and spells to replace/augment your system's offerings.\nAt the Crawler School of Lichcraft and Wizardry, you'll learn such fundamentals as demonology, necromancy, and fungal berserking\nIf the unthinkable happens and we blast past that, I'll add some stuff here as soon as I stop joy-sobbing.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI learned a lot from making Bunker, my 2020 zinequest project: mostly, to give myself more time.

Our God Is Dead is an ultra-light comedy RPG about playing as a group of fantasy devotees who wake up to discover their god has unexpectedly died. Nobody respects the cleric of a dead god and you aren't particularly ready to give up that distinction, the only solution is to create a ruse and fool everyone!\nThe game is completely GM-less, requires no prep at all, and is played in a single session. So grab your friends, some dice, and a desire for mischief, then prepare to fool everyone into thinking that you're all very respectable people service a god that is very much alive.\nOur God Is Dead is played out in a series of 3 acts. The first act is about setting the scene and making up a bunch of strange details to fill in who your god is... or rather was. You'll work as a group to show a day in the life as a devotee to your god with all of the players adding ever stranger details about your god's domains and tenants.\nAfter you've set the scene it's onto the scheming. Hatch plans together and put them into action because at any moment your ruse could come falling apart. Unfortunately, none of you are particularly deceptive and will inevitably find yourself getting into trouble as your plans go awry. The game uses a simple d6 and success or failure is determined by trying to beat your previous roll. This means that you're bound to roll both successes and failures, creating all kinds of complications and trouble in preparation for the third act.\nThe final act is where everything catches up with you. All of the lies you've told come back to haunt you while you're left scrambling to cover up the mess you've made. How far are you willing to go to keep the truth from coming out and what will it cost you?

A silence spread across the room as the sheriff walked to the bar, all eyes drifted to the black clad elf with the pointed boots. As the sheriff ordered a drink, the elf\u2019s hand slid to the holster on his hip.\nWithout turning around the sheriff responded, \u201cElgor, we both know this is gonna end with one, or both, of us dead.\" \nThe room collectively held its breath.\n\"So how \u2018bout we skip to the end and finish this before anyone else gets hurt.\u201d\nThe sheriff threw back his drink and turned for the door. \u201cI\u2019ll be outside,\u201d he stepped back into the midday sun, \u201cbest not keep me waiting.\u201d\nOutlaws \u2018N\u2019 Owlbears takes place in a fantasy wild west that never was. Elementals bound to the hearts steam engines opened the new frontier as train tracks spread across the map. Dangerous creatures and locations dot the rugged landscapes. Sorcerers and wizards claim a nexus of their own to harness the wild magic. Prospectors hunt for rare and exotic materials. Bandits prey on the vulnerable for easy money. Snake oil actually works. \nOutlaws \u2018N\u2019 Owlbears is a d6 roll under system. The rules are simple and intended to make play fast. Fights can be brutal though, leaving characters seriously injured or dead after only a few rounds.\nOnO has no classes, build the character you want by choosing talents. Want to be a mage, choose magical talents. Want to be a gunslinger or a brawler, choose those talents. Want to mix and match, you can do that too. \n\nThere are 4 species in OnO, each with their own unique species trait.\n Elves are naturally intoned with magic, and can more easily learn how to use it.\n Dwarves are slow and steady, they don't move fast but are hard to slow down.\n Humans are deterministic, and sometimes can choose not to die.\n Goblins are naturally sneaky, and can be hard to spot.\nIn OnO your equipment can mean the difference between life and death. You have decisions to make about weapons, armor, ammo, upgrades, and magic items. Use guns, explosives, melee weapons, and other equipment to survive the world. \nThe plan is:\nPrint at 5 \u00bd x 8 \u00bd\nPages will be black ink on white copy paper, maybe slightly off-white\nThe cover will be black ink on a cream colored cardstock, and have helpful references printed on the inside\nWe're looking at 32 pages right now\nThere will be the full rules for playing, including a GM advice section, and bestiary\nAn introductory adventure (not currently written, but ideas about a snake cult stealing a town's water supply come to mind)\n$400 More playable species. The Revenant and Beastmen species will be added.\n$500 Expanded bestiary. 3 more pages of NPCs, monsters, and advice on making your own. \n$600 An advanced equipment guide will be added as a digital reward to all digital editions.\n$700 Another adventure will be included with all digital editions. I'm thinking something about rustlers, as it gives an excuse to add more rules about mounts.\n$800 A world guide will be added to digital editions. It will be a look at the world of the fantasy west and more information on the people that live there and what their life is like, maybe include some more talents.\n$900 One more adventure in digital editions. I like the idea of a hunted mine, maybe the pioneers unearthed something that was best left berried. \n$1000 All the digital extras will be collected in one volume, a digital copy included with digital editions, and a physical copy to be sent to physical edition backers.\nLast year I had a Kickstarter for a fully self published cyberpunk themed comic. I had planned on launching another comic sometime last year, but well 2020 and all.\nThis project started it\u2019s life as something else, but from what I\u2019ve heard most projects like this do.\nI like RPG\u2019s and comics, I like making both, I also like painting minis. I have another job that is currently my \u201cfull time\u201d job so this is one of my \"side\" projects.

I'm intending to send Outlaw and Owlbear levels to backers in two parts the standard and distressed each when available. I'll probably have to figure something else on the whole table pack, If need be I'll stuff envelopes as full as I can and send several.\n\nI also cant promise that I wont suddenly, absolutely, hate everything I've made when doing a \"final\" pass and have start all over again, delaying everything by months. I should have gotten most of that out of my system for this project already since I've completely reworked just about every part of the rules no less than 5 times in the past 10 months or so.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Tip-Jar", "descp": "Weather you just want to follow along or throw in a couple bucks, thanks.\nFell free to hop into the comments and say hi.\nI'll also post hires copies of some of the images in the book where only backers can see them.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2021"}], "stat": ["0 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 3 or more", "title": "Digital Edition", "descp": "Can you even call it a zine if it isn't paper?\nGet a digital copy on Outlaws 'N' Owlbears.\nI'll include both an easier to read digital copy and the easier to print and bind at home copy.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital Edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Apr 2021"}], "stat": ["29 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Print Edition", "descp": "Printed in the most premium of zine materials, copy paper.

In it, you play an ambitious minor wizard who's come into possession of a grimoire beyond your arts. Can you study and unlock it? What wizardries does it contain? Into what troubles and adventures will your ambitions lead you?\nSince then, I've written several more games set in the same world -- The Barbarian's Bloody Quest, The Last Adventure, The Thief & the Necromancer -- and also additional grimoires for the original game. Each offers new characters to play or new wizardries to unlock and master.\nI'd like to bring these games to a wider audience. In all, I've already written enough material to publish 7 issues of a zine, so that's what I'm going to do!\nGameplay: the Grimoire\nAt the heart of the game is the grimoire: a text of many sections and its own set of rules. Each section represents a wizardous advancement you can achieve, a new spell you can learn or act of wizardry you can undertake, but each also has its own rules for unlocking and studying them. Don't read ahead! You can only read the sections you've unlocked and studied.\nMost wizards' grimoires also include \"safeguards,\" sections you unlock by improper study. These include magical curses, setbacks, and disasters. Trigger a safeguard and the spellbook may rewrite itself, summon a destructive creature from another world, or even send you reeling 10 minutes back into the past. Keep trying to study it without disarming the safeguard, and it'll keep sending you back!\nYour first grimoire is a challenging 1st-level text called \"The Signature of Aibesta of the Two Courts.\" Aibesta of the Two Courts was a powerful wizard of an age some four centuries past. Her grimoire includes the techniques to summon an Impeccable Servant, a powerful familiar and bodyguard, an act of wizardry that Aibesta undertook but never accomplished.\nWork your way through the entire grimoire, and not only will you learn powerful new spells, you'll establish your workroom, the foundation of your future seclusium; you'll learn techniques to better subdue and study future grimoires; and you'll accomplish what Aibesta herself couldn't: the summoning of an Impeccable Servant!\nGameplay: You and Your Volunteers\nTo play The Wizard's Grimoire, you need two volunteers (or three works fine) to play against you. Only you, the wizard player, need to know the rules. You're responsible for knowing your own rules and making your own calls. You're also responsible for telling your volunteers any points of continuity that you want them to know.\nIn this way, the game upends the normal player-GM relationship. Instead of a GM saying, \"hey, I have this game I'd like to run, who's in?\" you say, \"hey, I'm trying to get my wizard through this spellbook, do you have a minute?\"\nEach session that you play is an episode in your wizard's study and adventures. They can be as short or as long as you like, you can play as often or rarely as you like, and you can have different volunteers, or the same ones, every time you play.\nGameplay: System & Dice\nThe Wizard's Grimoire uses a dice pool version of the good old PbtA moves.\nYou have ratings for your moves based on your qualities -- for instance, your rating to exert yourself subtly to take surreptitious action is equal to your Ambitious + your Cunning, while your rating to exert yourself violently against an enemy is equal to your Bold + your Cunning. Roll that many dice, count the 4s, 5s and 6s as hits, and if you roll no hits, it's a miss. Usually, you get to spend your hits on things you want to happen or questions you want to ask, but you know how it is with moves, they each work a little differently.\nSince you both call for your own rolls and interpret their results for yourself, the moves answer to different design concerns than they do in a conventional PbtA game. I think they're pretty interesting, and if you're a PbtA-head like me, I think you will too.\nFuture Issues (Spoilers!)\n The Dictum of Polume the Farer: An easy and useful 1st-level grimoire, including such spells as creating a scampering lantern and summoning a jarful of plasmic hornets. You can study it alongside Aibesta's Signature for very good results.\n The Barbarian's Bloody Quest: Can you find and slay the wizard who butchered and subjugated your family? Includes \"The Book of Doomed Wizards.\" \n The Three Scrolls of Jorvelte Wild-Crowned: A 2nd-level grimoire, including the wizardous techniques to enchant magical items, including a useful and dangerous staff of glimmering menace.\n The Last Adventure: In your youth, you were a warrior and a hero. Now you're dead, but no one brought you the sup of oblivion. Take up the memory of your old sword, the memory of your old helmet, and make your last adventure here in the land of death. Includes \"In the Land of Death\" and \"Answering the Calling Voice.\" \n The Red Tome of Salabrusto the Wise: A 2nd-level grimoire, including an almanac of alien worlds and planes, and wizardous techniques both to travel to them and summon entities from them.\n The Thief & the Necromancer: You're friends, a gifted necromancer and a thief and street performer. You've both escaped bad situations and you've thrown in together to take on the world. Includes \"Goerne, a Ghostly Tutor.\" \nAttention: Patrons\nIf you support lumpley games on Patreon, you'll already get the digital version of The Wizard's Grimoire as a patron reward. Don't sign up for it here!\nIf you'd like a copy in print, though, this is the best way to get one.\nReduced Price Level & Community Copies\nTimes are tight!\nIf you want to support the project but the full price is a stretch, or if you're curious about the game but can't justify paying full price sight unseen, we've been there!

Magical heroes and villains used to zip through the skies and streets of Pacifica City. Their clashes were never deadly but always awesome.\n\nThen the Unkind showed up. It took one day for this otherworldly evil to eliminate the heroes and strip the villains of most of their magic. As the last hero died, they reached to the sky and cast a spell. It bound all magical beings in the city to a pact: \u201cKill no one of this world, protect Pacifica City, and defeat the Unkind.\u201d\n\nThe villains\u2019 magic was not lost. It was fused with random objects around the city, turning those objects into monsters. Pacifica City needs new heroes. Unfortunately, they\u2019ve got are a bunch of Necrojerks.\n\n\nNecrojerks is a d10-based game ideal for 2-6 players with a GM. It is run like an episodic television show where you, the villains, must punch the magic out of monsters and defend the city you used to torment. Each episode starts with players taking on the role of \u201cred-shirt\u201d NPCs who exist as human happy meals for that week\u2019s monster.\n\nCharacters, or Jerks, are created by answering a series of background-generating questions, assigning points to Traits, picking Powers and starting possessions. Necrojerks is a classless system where you can either build your character from scratch or use and modify one of the six archetypes; see below. Once you\u2019ve build your Jerk, the book details how to build your group\u2019s lair.\n\nArchetypal Jerks\n Flextanks: musclebound beeftatoes covered in Roidrunes. They start jacked and become stupid-jacked.\n Puzzlefaces: some folks carefully perform rituals to bring infernal magic into the world. Puzzlefaces skip steps.\n Boogen: some are tall, some are small, but you should avoid them all. Twisted faces, extra limbs, the Boogen are gangly nightmares.\n Hextronicons: Mash a Megaman villain and Decepticon together then scrawl Sigil Circuits across them, you've got a Hextronicon.\n Geist: Brooding, loner-type masked vigilantes who use fighting sticks for wands that, through magic, are turned into grappling hooks, ricocheting weapons and other awesome tools.\n Werebuddies: They were once inanimate objects that soaked up evil magic radiation. Think of a kawaii cute can with fur sprouting out of the top like mold. It wants to hug your face with its teeth. \nA Werebuddy is the cute, inanimate object with lycanthropy that you've always wanted to play. Here's one before they get all snarly.\n\nJerks can amplify their abilities at a cost. Here we have an amped up Puzzleface bursting with squiggly bits.\n\nHow does it play? First off, $1 donations get you a copy of the playtest in April so you can find out for yourself! It is light on rules and the GM should both challenge and cheer for the players.

Brutal and dangerous, even the most routine beasts spew damnation at the mere presence of you: the Manipulators. The unique denizens of each realm aspire to purge you in whatever malicious possible ways available in an effort to gain more power and bring the imbalance of reality towards a coming doom.\n\nAether Operations is a unique self-contained tabletop RPG system. Leaning into the  unique art-heavy physicality of the zine, it is designed as both a streamlined, collaborative, and creative conflict-focused roleplaying game and an intense and special art object. \nAeOps is for 2-5 players including a gamemaster with optional rules for gm-less play. Players, as Manipulators embodying Spirit, Brain, Bone, or Meat, use up to seven six-sided dice (7d6) to \nTraverse the Quantum Realms\nAnnihilate Keepers, creatures and denizens\nCleanse powerful Relics\nwhile the GM uses a diminishing Balance Die, downgrading from d12 to d4 with each stage representing further destabilization of the Realms and a quickly approaching reality cataclysm.\nThe game encourages players to creatively interpret their list of Skills, determined at the start of play by the Realm you embody and expanding over the course of the game. Each Stat has a number of d6 you may gamble on any given check. The highest value rolled determines your success but every 1 result is a problem, regardless of success. If you roll really poorly, you can lose all of the dice wagered, whittling down your Skill list and vitality with repeated defeat. \nManipulators travel between the Realms on their whim, expanding the canon of your setting as you explore the landscapes and are punished by the unique denizens of each.\nThe Aether Operations printed zine is approximately 125x175mm (about 5x7\") when completely folded and 500x700mm (about 19x27\") when completely unfolded, featuring unique graphic spreads on each growing \"page\" as you unfold. The completely unfolded form is a large format poster. It is printed on broadsheet-sized newsprint, creating a unique feel and presentation. \nhow the zine works\nWatch a session of play hosted by +1XP below that starts right around 0:04:25, and listen to an interview  about the design in the same video starting around 1:47:00.\nWe've crafted a playlist for you to get in the vibe of the setting and visuals, listen to the unofficial AeOps playlist on Spotify or Apple Music.\nRewards\nThis campaign is kept simple to keep our focus on making the best zine we can with our budget and time. As such, there are no stretch goals and only these simple pledge levels:\n Digital Edition: the illustrated PDF and RTF (rich text format) files of the game.\n Physical Edition: full unfolding broadsheet sized zine, approximately 700mm x 500mm unfolded and 125mm x 175mm when folded, with complete rules and artwork by Adam Vass. Also includes the digital edition above! \nShipping\nFloating Chair Club will be fulfilling all physical pledges when the print edition is finished.  Orders will ship weekly in batches per received surveys until they're all out the door. We expect delivery to begin in March 2021.\nDomestic orders of the zine will ship USPS First Class (current estimate is $5).\nInternational shipping is also available but to keep the cost down it will be sent as a letter and so it will not be trackable and will be slightly less padded.

We\u2019re thrilled beyond belief that so many of you joined us in White Ash to get to know Glarien. If you missed this kickstarter, we\u2019ll be back again soon with more White Ash.\n\nHello everyone, we're thrilled to be back on Kickstarter for the 8th time to launch GLARIEN, an all-new comic book miniseries for mature readers set in the White Ash Universe. \nWritten by Charlie Stickney, with art by Romina Moranelli, colors by Fin Cramb and letters by Conor Hughes, the 40 Page first issue of Glarien follows the early days of White Ash's most dangerous elf, as told through the eyes of Rachel, a young woman living in 1970's New York City.  Think Red Sonja meets Taxi Driver... but with Elves and demons.\nGlarien: Chapter One cover by series artist, Romina Moranelli\nIf you\u2019re returning to the White Ash Universe, THANK YOU so much. We owe everything to our Kickstarter community. If you're new to White Ash, WELCOME.  Glarien is a stand alone miniseries where you don't have to be well-versed in White Ash lore to enjoy the ride. But, if you want to get caught up on all things White Ash, we'll have tiers for that, or you can grab the single issues directly from Scout Comics. \nSo beyond the tagline, what's Glarien about?  \nGlarien follows the stories of two women and the different paths they take to overcome life-altering tragedies. Jumping from the elf realm of ancient Alfheim to the gritty streets of New York City circa 1971, two seemingly-unrelated tales will slowly weave together to reveal a critical piece of White Ash's complicated past. Oh, and because Glarien is involved, expect carnage... lots and LOTS of carnage. \nFor those readers coming from White Ash, we do want to reiterate, Glarien is a more MATURE book.  White Ash follows Aleck and Lillian, two PG-13 characters in an R-rated world.  Glarien is an R-Rated character... in an R-rated world.  And as such, to appropriately tell that story, there are themes that are intrinsic to her character that need to be explored. But perhaps the best way of showing you all what Glarien is all about is to jump right into an...\n EPIC 15 PAGE PREVIEW \n That's a good question.  And you'll find that answer inside...\nWe appreciate the motto, \"Go big or go home.\" All of our books are solid reads.  Not wanting to buck that trend, Glarien: Chapter One clocks in at --  FORTY-FREAKING-PAGES.  And that kind of content deserves a premium paper weight.\nWe print DOMESTICALLY (so you get your books quicker) on a heavy 80 lb glossy paper stock with a cover on 100 lb glossy cover stock. When you pick up one of our books, you'll feel the  difference.\nTo help introduce Glarien to a larger audience, we've brought in a slew of talented women (and White Ash's Conor Hughes) to do variant covers for us to showcase her stylings. \nThe first variant cover is a virgin variant from Rosi K\u00e4mpe (Spider Gwen, Extraordinary X-Men, Destiny NY) focusing on the dual worlds narrative of the Glarien storyline. \nRosi K\u00e4mpe Variant Cover\nOur second variant comes from the jaw-dropping color pallet of Liana Kangas (Star Wars Adventures, 2000 AD, TRVE KVLT, She Said Destroy).\nLiana Kangas Variant Cover\nUp third, we have a haunting, Rachel-centric cover from White Ash's Conor Hughes. \nConor Hughes Variant Cover\nAnd last, but certainly not least, from Yishan Li (Hellboy, Buffy, Swing), a virgin variant of Glarien in action.\nYishan Li Variant Cover\nJUST UNLOCKED.  A COVER BY IVAN TAO\nIvan Tao Variant Cover\nThis stretch goal cover is even more limited.  We only have 35 available to backers as a reward tier.  However it CAN be selected as part of the Pick Two reward and comes as part of the ALL FIVE (now six) COVERS reward.\nWe love packing our campaigns with extra goodness.  IN ADDITION to Glarien: Chapter one, our reward tiers are filled with goodies.  Here's what you can get this time around.\nAll backers receiving physical rewards will get a 6\" x11\" print of our kickstarter page banner image on glossy card-stock.  On top of that, Conor will sign & number copies for the first 300 print backers.\nGet to know Glarien.  All backers will receive this digital bundle of Glarien's previous appearances (White Ash 1/2, Glarien 1220, and Glarien 1880).\nHeads, NYC. Tails you're in Alfheim. No matter how it lands, you win, as ALL physical backers in the Variant Cover Tier (or higher) will receive this limited edition, 1.5\" commemorative Two Worlds Coin. It can also be added on to any physical tier.\nNew to White Ash?  Catch up in style with our 200 page, oversized (7.75\" x11.25\") hardcover collecting the first arc of White Ash.  That's over 2lbs of White Ash goodness delivered straight to your door.  This is a beautiful book you'll be happy to have on your coffee table or adorning your shelf. \nGet a sketch cover of Glarien: Chapter One  drawn by White Ash series artist, Conor Hughes.  Conor will take (reasonable) requests as to the subject mater. There are ONLY 20 of these available. A must have for collectors.\nWe know what it's like to open up a package and find a mangled Kickstarter comic inside. We pack our books with the care that we used in making the comic and the love that we have for our backers.\nEach comic is bagged, boarded front and back and sent in stay-flat packaging. Multiple issue orders will be mailed in our custom-made, comic boxes.

Every backer will receive a behind-the-scenes PDF showing the different stages of 16 curated pages from Glarien as they go from script, to layout, to inks and finally to color.\nStretch Goal #4 ($30,000) Might I Have Some More, Sir UNLOCKED\nEvery backer will receive an extra, all-new, digital Glarien short story drawn by the incredible Emily Pearson. This will be added to the haul you\u2019re already taking home. \nStretch Goal #5 ($36,500) Cover Upgrade, UNLOCKED. \nWe are adding a spot UV finish to to the main Romina Moranelli cover.\nStretch Goal #6 $40,000 Get to know us faster UNLOCKED\nIf you back at a catch up tier, we will be mailing those books out first.

You can select this as a reward.  It also can be selected as part of the pick two package.  And our ALL FIVE covers is now our ALL SIX.  Anyone who pledges at the ALL FIVE COVERS Tier will automatically get this one as well. \nStretch Goal #8 $52,000 MYSTERY STRETCH GOAL\nWill This Series Be Available Through Stores?\nYes!  But not for a while (at least until mid-2022).  We LOVE our partnership with Scout Comics.  Scout has expanded the reach of White Ash, putting us into shops across the country.  In fact, we're betting some of you reading this now, may have just picked up the Scout Glarien one-shot last week. (NOTE: THIS SERIES is all new) But we also have a very loyal audience here on Kickstarter that's been with us since the beginning.  And we want to honor that legacy by bringing new White-Ash related content to you first.  \nThrough limited-runs and exclusive-editions on this platform, we're able to put together the high-quality content that our fans are used to, and make sure our collaborators are paid wages commensurate with their talent.  Simply put, without Kickstarter, we (and many other creators working today) couldn't afford to make these issues at the level of quality the story deserves.  \nMeet the team.\nCharlie Stickney is Co-Publisher of Scout Comics, and writer of comic books like White Ash, The Game and The Adept.

You can then print it out and fold it into a tiny book : )\nYou can print them at home as often as you want. I would recommend papersize A3.\nThen you simply fold them all into small mini books. \n\n\nFill them with your own thoughts whenever you feel like it.

To roughly lay out the story. \n\nA MYSTERY ZINE:\nNo explanation here... You will have to let yourself be surprised. It could look like all the others, but it could also be something that completely misses the point... hehe\n\n2 Versions of all zines that are already filled out:\nI'm already filling out all the zines.

A red sea of dust is broken by jagged mountains dotted with the ruins of ancient pyramids. Evil sorcerers rule supreme. You play Knights of the House of Mars. The only ones who can bring life back to this planet.\n What is This?\nKnights of the House of Mars is a role-playing game where players take on the role of knights who accompany the Last Seer eastward to the Pyramid of Tharsis. The world is dead; the way it became so and the reason you journey eastward are questions to discover the answers to through play with your friends at the table.\n\nKnights of the House of Mars was a project I first started in 2018 as part of the 200 Word RPG Design Challenge. It ended up placing as a finalist that year. This zine edition is a fully re-imagined re-designed table top game for 2 - 4 players. It makes use of a single deck of ordinary playing cards. \n\nKotHoM is a GM-less cooperative game where each player in turn sets a scene about their knight as they journey eastward, answering questions and determining their character's fates.  Play resolves these scenes using a deck of cards and player detailed characteristics. \nA Doom That You Shall Never Escape\nEach character is made up of Traits, Gifts, a Duty & a Doom. Each of these are player determined and act as ways to fictionally position the character in scenarios determined during play. They act mechanically also and are assigned card values that form the players' hands, drawn from the deck of playing cards. These characteristics are used in the conflict resolution system. \n\nWhen it is not your turn or scene, you play as the NPCs or antagonists. When conflicts arise you play cards sifted from the Seer's Scrying Pool. The Scrying Pool is a spread of cards determined at the start of play that remain face up until they are pulled and played. Watch as the portents of your fate slowly fade from in front of you. \n\nAt the end of play, once the Seer safely arrives at the pyramid, players shuffle cards they have earned from succeeding at conflicts and draw one final card from that shuffled spread. This card determines their final fate. What happens to these knights once they reach their goal? Their ultimate fate lays between the stars at night. \nA Point-Crawl of Role-playing Scenes\nFrom the Forest of Broken Dreams, to the Doom Prism of Exalted Light, all the way to the Pyramid of Tharsis each scene you choose to play out leads you closer to your fate, and the end of your journey. Whether it be an intimate conversations by the camp fire, or your caravan under attack -there is always room for conflict to arise in every scene!\nmock up: designs may not be final\nmock up: designs may not be final\nmock up: all may not be final\n\nRewards\nThe Zine will be 20-ish pages on top quality paper, saddle stitched and printed at A5 format by Mixam Printing.  Both the pdf and the print copies will include the same content. I intend it to have a great 'hand-feel' while holding and reading, and a UV coating so that it lasts a long time. \nI've also included an option for a POD Zine that will be available through DrivethruRPG. This POD option is for all international (outside of the United States) backers. They will receive a coupon for an at-cost print (estimated cost ~$2.97) and pay for their own shipping. The benefit here is that DrivethruRPG prints both in the US and Europe and this should help keep shipping for international backers to the minimum cost. \n\nThe PDF Zine will be digitally fulfilled through DrivethruRPG. \n\n A Deck of Cards will also be available as an option for POD - printed by DrivethruCards. Backers that select to have the custom set of cards included will receive a coupon allowing them to have the cards at print cost (Estimated cost ~$4.68/deck) and pay their own shipping expenses for the deck of cards. \nEmbossed Stock: 11.0-pt. (280 micrometers) thickness, 320 gsm, black core card stock from German paper manufacturer Koehler. Embossed cards incorporate a subtle raised texture that creates air pockets for easier shuffling and dealing.\nThese cards will be standard U.S. Poker sized 2.5\"x3.5\" (6.35x8.89mm).\nproof of concept - art may not be final\nStretch Goals! \nAt $2000.00 all backers at the $25 pledge Collector of the Cosmos will receive an off-set print of the cards - these will be better quality than print on demand.

Inspired by Blaseball, Jelle's Marble Runs, Space Jam and, of course, the WNBA, Alley-Oop! turns the joy of rolling a fistful of dice into exciting collaborative storytelling.\nA preview of the zine, layout and text not final.\nLet's talk rules!\nYou and the other players will each represent a basketball team that has made it to the championships. Each player on your team is represented by a polyhedral die. When it's time to play ball you shake your players and ROLL! Depending on the results, cards are drawn to discover what amazing feat of basketball your players accomplished. You narrate the action, add absurd details, provide sports commentary, and act out player interviews. The outcomes of the game may be left to chance, but whether you are playing a legion of all-stars or a scrappy bunch of rookies, you control how you tell the story of the game and its players.\nAn example of Kat's art, our internal illustrator!\nAfter every Game Day there is an Off Day. This is where we get to see the players lives unfold off the court. From training montages, to chance encounters in the cafeteria, to filming commercials, this is your chance to open the story beyond basketball and learn more about the lives of the players.  Inevitably, Game Days affect Off Days and Off Days affect Game Days. By the end of the championship you've not only found who has won the championship but how the players lives were changed in the process.\nBasketball at the Limits of Your Imagination! The world of Alley-Oop! is not set in stone because we want to help you imagine new and amazing scenarios each and every time you play. One time, you might be a group of aliens and cartoon characters, in another game you might be a group of sea monsters blowing off steam. As long as your world gives them plenty of chances to interact and the players are open to the characters developing romances and rivalries, you're good to go.\nWe include prompts for developing your own setting, but the book will have additional starting scenarios in the back. Layout and text not final.\nNot a fan of basketball? Don\u2019t have time to invent a whole scenario? Don\u2019t fret! We\u2019ve put thought into the types of folks who would enjoy this game and have made sure to make a level playing field (pun intended) for basketball experts and power gamers alike. The game includes a glossary of basketball terminology and slang to help spice up your narration, as well as ten starter scenarios in case you want to kick-start your game. \n\nThe game, the glossary, the seed scenarios, the tables, and the beautiful art will make this a nearly 40 page zine!\n\nWe need your help!\nAlley-Oop! has been fully designed and play-tested but we need your help turning it into a beautiful zine that is easy to read, and exciting to page through.\nWe have a layout artist, a few illustrators, a copy-editor and printing press lined up. All of these amazing collaborators need to be paid for their hard work turning our Google Doc into a fantastic zine for you to behold. Then we need to print and ship our game to you. All of this takes both time and money.\nA sample of Molly James' work, our cover artist!\nOnce you've helped us fund this project, we'll spend the next 3 months working with our collaborators to perfect the pages and then the following 3 months getting the zine printed and shipped to you, our backers. This is a generous estimate because this is our first time running a Kickstarter. We believe this will be enough to get all our ducks in a row but in case of any delays we, of course, will keep you updated every step of the way.\n\nCo-created by gay wife team Kaysy Ostrom (right) & Legendary Vermin (left), the inspiration for Alley-Oop! came after we watched a full season of WNBA together in quarantine (Go Seattle Storm!) Vermin, an accomplished game designer (What's So Cool About Giant Robots?, Skirmish, BEACH EPISODE, \u00c6thernet) approached Kaysy with the idea of turning a basketball championship into a trpg. Kaysy, a newbie game designer but an avid role-player, theatre artist and award-winning playwright (Devushka & the Cat, Plant & Her, Sweet Sweet Justice), was eager to bring her passion for theatrical storytelling into her first game. Together, our love for role-playing games, women's basketball, and queer storytelling is at the heart of Alley-Oop!\nMaria Mison is a piece of queer filipina sunshine from manila who loves anything slice-of-life, catharticly vulnerable, everyday lyric magick performance dream game stuff. She really likes collages & layout lately.\nKat Taylor is a nonbinary artist from Boston by way of the PNW! They love drawing action poses, girls, and gay stuff, so they\u2019re super excited to lend their talent to this amazing project! When Kat isn't drawing, they like to enjoy a good (or bad) monster movie, eating delicious food, and absorbing any kind of comics they can get their eyeballs on. When they *are* drawing, their art explores the many faces (literally!) of humans as well as monsters. You can find them on most social media as @katatomicart, or their website.\nLexi Antoku is a professional Oxford comma advocate and casual cat advocate. They respect English in the same way one might respect hot stoves or wires with frayed insulation.\nMolly James is an artist living in Seattle with her partner and a growing collection of Magic cards. When not drawing monsters, she makes comics about delinquent robots.\n\nBudget Breakdown\nWhy $1,500 you ask? This is a hefty zine and we want to pay all of our artists and collaborators what they are worth while being cautious about fees and unexpected costs. Anything that does not end up costing what we expect will be reinvested in our artists and collaborators and of course the zine itself. Here is our budget breakdown:\nArt - $150\nLayout - $300\nPrinting/Shipping - $150\nEditing - $500\nKickstarter Fees/Taxes - $200\nUh Oh Fund - $200\n\nStretch Goals\nIf you help us move above and beyond our goals we have some exciting ideas to make this project even better!\nAt $1,700  we will be able to pay our artists to double the amount of art in the zine. Double the art, double the fun! \nAt $2000 we will be able to make custom team-tracking sheets that help you organize play.\nAny additional funds will be invested in our artists and collaborators and of course the zine itself!

You will collaborate to gradually fill out just what sorts of wonders and mysteries abound, both on campus and between each other as companions.\nBuild your campus, deciding not just its architecture, but also just how reality-warpingly magical it is. Is your school located among the clouds, underwater, in a modern public school's classrooms, hidden in a shoebox, or even just the village midwife's cottage? \nYour own player characters, or Companions, form a closely-knit friend group. You are also invited to populate the school with peers, rivals, friends and tutors. Once these elements are introduced, they remain persistent across sessions thanks to a handy stack of index cards that grow into a detailed Reference Deck.\nCharacter traits and school lessons are both organized around the same set of five attributes, detailing the traits that your academic studies seek to inculcate and cultivate within your Companions:\nEsoterica: Your grasp of complex mathemagical theory, and capability to express it in evocations of power.\nCraft: Your skills of maintenance, repair, and creation across a broad suite of tools, reagents, and skills.\nDrive: Your motivation and perseverance, permitting you to push through any obstacles between you and your aims.\nAttunement: Your perception of and connection to your surroundings, permitting acts of adroit intuition and disarming empathy.\nWit: Your nimbleness of deed and tongue, suitable for getting you both out of and into absolute heaps of trouble.\n\nThe Day's Long Arc\nPlay proceeds through several phases over the course of a day of school life\nEach plot arc of Arcane Academia represents one day of classes, from the groggy, yawning morning all the way through to the late-night escapades that will leave you just as sleepy tomorrow. Each arc is meant to occupy one session of play, though there aren't any particular consequences if you break it up over multiple sessions. If desired, these arcs chain together neatly into an extended campaign with a growing continuity, but the game also performs admirably as a standalone one-shot!\nA core, repeating element of play repeatedly is congregating to share meals together. Breakfast, lunch and dinner here serve as regular check-ins with each other, opportunities to take a break, and chances to steer events and tone into more exciting and/or comfortable territory. \nIn the course of your studies into the strange and magical, you will earn the plaudits of your peers and humiliations from your tutors, and vice-versa. These provide your Companions with the motive and means to roll with the circumstances and make the best of them--or give you ample room to burn goodwill and leave yourself more desperate.\nChoose how you spend your precious free time, whether that means taking some time alone to clear your head, making up for past messes, or starting a whole new mess of drama.\nAfter dinner, sneak off on daring escapades. Will you wreak mischief upon rivals whom the day's events have brought you into conflict with, or discover the deeper secrets and mysteries of your campus?\nWhat sorts of teachers will you create for your own school? How will you characterize them?\n$3000 - Stretch goal #1: Alone In My Ancient Tower\nAll backers will receive a free extra game! Digital pdf copies of the author's one-page game Alone In My Ancient Tower to all backers, and an additional printout copy to all physical zine-level backers and above. \nAIMAT cover art by @sasha_reneau\nThis solemn and melancholy meditation takes place at the opposite end of a magic-wielder's lifespan than their halcyon school days: venerable and ancient, you wander your empty fastness and dwell upon artifacts and memories of times past. It is written in the mode of the Alone games, as codified by Takuma Okada.\nThis stretch goal will allow me to replace my aging laptop, ensuring fewer technical difficulties and risks during production as the author wrangles the layout staff, editing team and content-typewriting monkeys (read: as I wrangle me, me, and me) through production in Affinity Publisher.\n\n$4500 - Stretch Goal 2: Free Time activities written by guest authors!\nAt this level, I will commission five fellow ttrpg writers $150 apiece to write me one-page minigames that will plump out the roster of possible activities that your Companions can stir themselves to, given the opportunity.\nThese games won't be strictly limited to one page. That said, these guest authors will be asked to turn in minigames that are close to 500 words long, which puts their rate of pay at approximately 30 cents per word.\n\n$6000 - Stretch Goal 3: Coursework class alternates written by guest authors!\nAt this level, I will commission another five writers at the same rate to come up with one-page minigames to serve as alternative classes. These will optionally replace existing classes during the Coursework phase to allow for a more flexible curriculum, increasing replayability and providing variety for long-form campaign play.\n\n$8000 - Stretch Goal 4: Lavish Feasts, illustrated by guest artists!\nAt this level, I will commission full-page art for Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner splash pages for $250 each from three artists. I would love to see what fun details these artists bring to the commissions, and to see their own spin on how a magical academy would feed such a chaotic, festive mass of hungry students.\n\n$10,000 - Stretch Goal 5: pay guest writers more, and extra Challenges\nAt this level, all previous guest writers will receive a $50 pay bump. After this point, every stretch goal created will also include a further pay raise for guest writers and artists.\nThe Challenge phase of play represent the higher-stakes, more involved minigames at the end of the night. This is where you cash in your hard-won experiences throughout the day to earn a payoff. At this stretch goal, I will write an additional five Challenges for the game, providing a much broader range of scripted plot beats for you and your Companions to face together.\noh, what a cheeky scamp\nInfluences\nArcane Academia owes a great deal to the Firebrands Framework, as pioneered by Meguey and Vincent Baker. It also draws extensively from the structure of my previous game, Celestial Bodies, Orbital Mechanics, my entry into #ZineQuest2 last year.\nArcane Academia is inspired by a childhood spent immersed in fantastical stories. It is woven from a love of Discworld, Earthsea, Redwall, the Old Kingdom, Bartimaeus, The Once and Future King, The Name of the Wind, the Edge Chronicles, Discworld, and the Dying Earth, among so many others. To reduce it to any single influence would be reductive and insincere.\nIt also represents an opportunity to imagine our own worlds of magic, wonder and delight. It offers worlds tailored to whim and fancy. It permits worlds that suit us both as we are and as we dream to be. It can be an exorcism of old ghosts.\n\"as long as this catalyzes properly, there's only a slim chance that\u2014uh oh, it's started smoking\"\nThis project is a participant in #ZineQuest3, among good company.\n\nLet's do another Zine Quest!

The regions of this sea can be neatly divided by their Dooms; apocalyptic events that are threatening the very existence of not only the islands, but the world as we know it. \nIs it your job to stop the Dooms? I don\u2019t know. Maybe. But regardless, this zine will function as a guide to one such region, its Doom, and the end of the world as we know it. Welcome, dear reader.\nhex map\nThe hex map was put together in Cecil Howe's Hex Kit with Nate Treme's \"Tiles of Xark\" set. It features art from the amazing Evlyn Moreau, and an additional map from the illustrious Dyson Logos. \nIt features 36 explorable hexes with a variety of interesting and weird encounters, including sky pirates, a strange crystal drug that lets you live inside someone's mind, and Doom Cultists who are trying to summon an ancient demon through a volcanic eruption. No big deal, really.\nThe most exciting part about this is that the adventure starts you off with a boat, dubbed \"The Colossal Waste\" with stats and all that good stuff. PLUS it has enough space for a 'Porco Rosso'-style biplane to take off and land, letting you engage with the sky pirates in their domain (or do some solo scouting, if you're feeling brave!).\nHexes\nWith a help from my co-author and friend, Batts, we have some preview images of the zine to show off some of the art & hexes involved! As a DM, they're aimed to hopefully get you as excited to run this as I am. \n\nRobin Berry, your friend in the islands!\nMeet Robin Berry! She's everyone's friend, and she'd love to follow you along on the boat. She can be a very useful guide, even if she doesn't know everything about this place. Help her fulfill her dreams, or at least have a chat with her about...\nVolcano, it's the DOOM!\nThe great volcano! The resting place of the great calamity, Garamond itself. Will it be the final resting place? Not if these cultists have anything to say about it. They're chanting, sacrificing, and praying to any dark power who will listen to them to help them awaken their burning lord of magma. Will you find a way to stop them; or perhaps find a way to join them? Either way it goes, there's plenty more to see in these islands...\n\nA magnificent crab, and a magnificent beard!\nWhen out sailing, it's very easy to run into strange things. A hermit, keeping secrets on a deserted island? Sure! The most beautiful and magnificent crab to ever grace the seafloor? Why not! They're simple enough encounters for any kind of party to put their own spin on. These two stand out as especially enjoyable for any fellow druids, to me.\n\nThe crystal drug, and the Dragon\nThis is a miniature view of the crystal meteorite, and what has grown from it. What you're not seeing is the page on the crystal drug effects, the two forested hexes above it, and the beautiful two-page spread of Blackbeak itself! I wrote a bit more about this particular piece of art as an update, but a computer screen hardly does it justice.\n\nMeet all of these people, creatures, and travel to the beautiful locations soon, when you get your hands on this terrific island.\n\nDOOM\nThe DOOM of this region is the volcano. Inside of it is the demon Garamond and his many, many faces. With each eruption a new face has been carved, and the cultists swear that this upcoming eruption (their 1000th) will bring about the final face and release Garamond for good. Well. Evil, but you get the point.\nThe zine comes with a tracker to measure the time until the next eruption, and the encounter and weather tables each have a second column for post-eruption options. All of this to say that the zine does not expect you to care about saving the world, in fact, maybe you can join the cultists and Garamond will reward you with a terrible, horrible, life-altering pact!\nzine\nThe zine is sitting around 44 pages right now, it will be staple bound, and printed with mixam.com. Shipping will be collected after the campaign with backerkit so that we can make sure international shipping rates are up to date.

As I found my way to the back booth, I was sure this client and case would spell trouble.\"\nWhat is Hardboiled?\nHardboiled is a detective RPG zine with a noir edge.  Players take the role of a Chandler-esque detective  in the 1920's solving cases in the fictional city of Blackport.  This is a stand alone system and setting, but much of the mechanics can be used to add a hardboiled edge to other systems.  You can play the game as one shots or as a larger campaign with a broader narrative.\nThe game utilizes a narrative form of character creation instead of standard stat rolling.  Players also have input on each others characters during character creation and collaboratively design the group's detective agency.  The narrative creation allows for players to design their character through the use of a fill in the blank narrative paragraph, similar to a mad lib, that focuses on adjectives and imaginative descriptions to shape the character instead of randomly generated statistics.\nThe Narrative paragraph is a good place to springboard off of to more fully detail out NPC's and characters.  For example, rolling an NPC named Sven Jorgunson, the tables determine he is blonde, handsome, and seductive.  Once the narrative is filled in, a few little changes can yield something like this:\n\"Sven Jorgunson tapped lightly on the doorframe. I only knew his name from hearing him flirt with the secretary outside.  A habit for him, surely, as he was more blonde than she was.  Whatever issue brought him here didn't seem to weigh too heavily on his mind. A corporate interest, perhaps.  I waved him in and he smoothly disengaged from the secretary and took a seat. Ladies would be no problem for this guy.\"\nThe game also has a case generation system included.  This allows narrators to quickly roll and determine clues, crimes, and plot twist and then incorporate them into the game.  By using a flowchart for scenes and setting, narrators can establish what clues link various scenes together and then fill in details as needed.  This can serve as an excellent initial structure for more detailed and complex adventures, or as a quick way to generate pick up and play one-off cases.\nThese mechanics, the games narrative focus and case design, coupled with player facing combat and play help make the game dynamic and enjoyable for players of all experience levels. The rules light system is quick to pick up, but still memorable.  The game is also enjoyable over longer periods of time, and transferable to other mechanical systems.  There are game options for narrators running a single player as well.\nThe Hardboiled genre is often overlooked within the roleplaying game community, but it's wonderfully entertaining and full of memorable tropes.  The genre's focus on society's ills and political corruption makes it a good choice for adaptation into a role-playing game and a satisfying game to play and run.  There is a wealth of literary sources to draw inspiration from, each of whom have introduced variations on the main theme. All of these translate well to different character archetypes and group playstyles. \nExample of interior art\nWhat's in the Zine?\nThe zine contains all you need to play Hardboiled.  The booklet includes:\n*  Mechanics for character generation and agency generation\n*  Mechanics for running the game\n*  Generators for NPC's and locations \n*  Brief descriptions of some locations in Blackport and the different neighborhoods\n*  Tips and tricks for running a detective RPG\n*  A case generator   \nIn addition to the above, the game includes discussion of how to generate cases.  While a Narrator should spend some time thinking of the details of the case, the generator does work for creating quick adventures that can be run as pick up games, or it can be used to lay out the basic structure of a larger adventure.  The generator includes a way to create clues and help them link scenes together.\nWhile Hardboiled is far along in its development, there is still a bit left to work with on it.  My aim is to have a 32-36 page zine + cover when the game is ready to ship.  The interior art is all black and white sketches from the same artist.  A stylized map of the city will also be included in the game booklet.\nThe Team\nI am mainly working on this project by myself in my spare time as I work full time as a high school math teacher in Texas.  The game mechanics and design are all my own. While this is the first RPG I have attempted to publish, I have been fiddling around with similar rules for years and have 30 years of TTRPG playing under my belt.  I have wanted to put this sort of project out there for awhile and have finally jumped out to do so.\nFunds raised from this Kickstarter will go primarily to printing copies and finishing art.  I have some art for the game already and the artist is ready to complete more work on the project.  The game has had some play testing already but needs a final round to iron out some kinks from the latest changes.  The booklet feels about 90% ready to me at the moment and I am proud of how smoothly it  has come together.

You have decided to spend today taking care of yourself.\nYou start by getting an early diner breakfast with a sweetheart that spent the night.\nYou and your special someone have a favorite place, where they know you and cook the best pancakes in town. You often find yourself here together after your more strenuous evenings together. The waiter brings you orange juice with your menus, and asks if you want the regular. What is the most indulgent item of your regular order? You nod and make small talk with them for a few moments about your plans for the day. While waiting for your food, your companion cozies up next to you in the booth. How do they express their affection for you? You exchange greetings with a few other patrons that recognize you.

At each point during the day, you will have several choices of which activity you want to do next, and each activity will provide several questions for you to shape Rowan's inner life, relationships, and self-image. Each activity ends with two affirmations - reclaiming the word fat and giving you and Rowan a truth that is commonly denied to fat people.\nVolume 1 will be a 24-page, 5.5\"x8.5\" staple-bound zine that includes at least 21 scenes like the one above, all written by fat contributors and designed to be gender-ambivalent - you can play Rowan as any or no gender with the body characteristics or your choice, aside from being fat, which is mandatory.

Dreading medical visits because of how the doctor will inevitably tie any health issue back to your weight, avoiding changing clothes around others because you don't want to inflict yourself on them, not ordering the food we want, feeling unable to trust the relationships around us because of what people might be saying behind our backs or what they will eventually say to our face. The scenes in this game are our attempt to take these lived experiences and reimagine them in ways that turn them into positive, affirming moments. This is a non-exhaustive list of all the ways society is dangerous or hostile to fat people, but it covers some of the situations included in Fat Self Care: Volume 1. \n\nCreating this collection has been very rewarding and has shown how much potential there is for creating small, albeit imagined, spaces for us to exist and love and move and thrive in our fat bodies. This first volume will cover a variety of situations, but future editions will have themes - find more about plans for Volume 2 below!\nEyes 2 by Robohaven - a gray filigree pattern with a repeating eye pattern and leaf motif\nWhat else can we get? (Stretch Goals)\nIn the spirit of Zine Quest, there are going to be limited stretch goals to keep the scope of the project manageable. There have been changes to these since the project launched due to conversations with artists.\n$2000 - At this level of funding, we will be able to get custom cover art for Fat Self Care: Volume 1 and for the eventual Volume 2.\n$3000 - At this level of funding, we will be able to set aside money to pay contributors for Fat Self Care: Volume 2, which will focus on relationships and intimacy. All backers will get a digital copy of Volume 2 when it is released.\n\nEyes 1 by Robohaven - another gray filigree pattern with an eye motif.\nWhere does the money go?\nThe money from this Kickstarter is primarily needed to fund the print run and distribution.  Printing and art costs will take up 30% of the funds raised of the initial goal. Kickstarter fees take about 10%. All contributors have already been paid $20 for their 200-word scenarios, and the remaining funds raised will be split equally amongst them as well.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSince Fat Self Care: Volume 1 is being designed by Aven, who runs Tabletop Hotdish, the business that will be handling printing, there are many fewer potential delays. Here are the ones that we might have:\n\nArt licensing - the art has been licensed for a limited number of physical and digital copies. If we get more backers than that limit, there might be small delays while that is sorted out - either licensing new art or simply updating the existing agreement. This delay, if it occurs, will become apparent before/when the campaign is over so we can start working on it ASAP\n\nDesign, writing, layout - Aven does have several disabilities, but works full time on the print shop and gaming. There is a chance that Aven's health may need enough attention that the design takes longer than expected, but that has been figured into the fulfillment timelines already. Only severe circumstances would cause enough delay that we would not fulfill on time.\n\nPrinting - Tabletop Hotdish is working with a few other Zine Quest campaigns. Depending on when those other games are ready to print, the actual printing of Fat Self Care might take longer than expected. This is unlikely but possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\n100% recycled paper\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nPrinting and assembly will be done by myself through my printing company Tabletop Hotdish.

The interest in this project tells me that there are folks out there hungry for these stories, and there are so many more of them to tell!

Download the playtest rules!\nBlood Feud is a role-playing game about toxic masculinity: certain common attitudes and behaviors among men, that cause great harm to them and to others around them. This is a game about people being nasty to each other and about figuring out why.\nIt\u2019s also a game about vikings of pre-christian Scandinavia; about honor and blood feuds, courage and brutality, corruption and consequences. Above all it is a game about what it means to be a man in such a world\u2014and what consequences that has on the communities they live in.\nThe goal of the game is to explore and experience toxic masculinity, while at the same time creating a thoughtful drama about relationships, competition and social consequences. With this game we want to make toxic masculinity easier to spot for a wider variety of people in our roleplaying communities\u2014and encourage critical discussions about how men behave, and why.\nThe central theme of this game is power\u2014specifically the power of men: How you earn it, what you have to do to keep it, and most importantly what you do with it.\nTo make power visible, we use a currency called Honor Tokens. Throughout the game these tokens  will get moved around between the players as their main characters interact with each other\u2014depending on how \u201cmanly\u201d or \u201chonorable\u201d their actions are.\nSince there is no Game Master, all players must pay attention to the seven Moves that cause honor to shift. In this way, every player has to learn to recognize these behaviors and how they affect the power structures. The seven moves are:\nSharing someone\u2019s bed\nGiving someone a gift\nCommenting on a woman\u2019s appearance\nPraising someone\nInsulting someone\nEscalating\nStriking a deadly blow\nApart from moves, the game uses a concept called Narrative Freedom to handle questions of narrative authority. This means that every player has equal say in describing the fictional world and what happens in it\u2014up until a move is triggered. Players may interrupt each others\u2019 narration, but only to do one of two things: making an addendum or adding an obstacle.\nAn addendum is an extra detail added to what was just said.\nAn obstacle is a roadblock that explains why something that was about to happen, didn\u2019t happen.\nAddendums and obstacles allow for playing out scenes in an improv style, instead of using traditional resolution tools such as dice or cards.\nThere are also mechanics in place that deal specifically with the role of women in the game. The first one: there must always be at least one woman present in every scene. When the last woman in a scene leaves, the scene simply ends. We are only interested in what happens publicly when looking at honor, so what happens when women are not watching doesn\u2019t count.\nSecondly, at the end of each scene, the players who played women must decide which of the men in the scene was the least manly. That man loses one honor token. Hence, the men must always compete for the attention of the women and their implicit approval.\nThe printed zine will be a ~50-page A5 saddle-stitched booklet, with a sturdy paper cover.\nThe game is illustrated by Ronja Melin, with rune carving ornaments by Jonas Lau Markussen.\n\u201cI loved how Blood Feud was both a serious game and a game filled with relatable comedy. It was liberating to embody parts of the patriarchal male gender norms that I still encounter in my life today. The best thing about the gaming experience was not play itself, but the discussion that the experience prompted afterwards\u2014about our characters\u2019 choices and motivations. Another thing that sticks out is the power the female characters had in forming the narrative. It is an intelligent game design that shines a light on gender structures in a natural manner.\u201d \u2013 Siri Sandquist, playtester\n\u201cBlood Feud is an intelligent and thought-provoking role-playing game. It charmed me with its mechanics and made me invested in its narrative tools. Most importantly, it gave me the one thing I wanted: A great story with compelling characters.\u201d \u2013 Emil Hannu, playtester\n\"An interesting twist on the Dream Askew engine. More interested in what's actually in the Icelandic sagas than other viking games. Excellent instructions for establishing relationship maps, and making them useful in the game. The honor system is a great tool to discuss how we see each other.\" \u2013 Pontus Kjellberg, playtester\n\u201cThe story and the gaming experience were unlike anything I have played before. The game explores a very difficult topic that allows for some really dark experiences\u2014provided your group is comfortable with that. The game has several mechanics to ensure a safe and respectful gaming environment. Everyone who plays Blood Feud will gain new knowledge about themselves and their surrounding world\u2014what it is depends on the player and the group. I realized how quickly an insignificant dispute can escalate into a blood feud, bringing down the whole community with it.\u201d \u2013 Anna Sandberg, Svartviken Rollspelspodd \n\"No Game Master, no dice resolution mechanics. Just a narrative SJW circle-jerk is what this game is\u2014if you want to call it a game even.

Massive, it smashes through buildings and destroys everything in its path. The two of you have escaped it thus far. There is every possibility you will die in the next 5 minutes, but before you do, you have a secret to tell....\n Crush is about getting what you need to out in the open before being crushed by a kaiju.\nIt's two micro RPGs in one! The Single Player component is a solo journaling game and the Multiplayer can be played by 2 (or more) players. The physical rulebook is 16 interior pages, covering both games. The multiplayer game requires a tumbling wooden tower game and the solo requires a journal or notebook to collect your adventure as you write it.\nInspired by the kaiju/monster genre of cinema, disaster fiction, and the chaotic competitive board games of the 1980s and 90s, Crush can be either a game about coming together and moving forward or winning- it's all up to you!\nBackers will receive the rules to both games and handouts with kaiju designed by artist Joey Weiser. These can be printed, colored, or cut out for pop ups at home.\nPLAY\n\n Crush has two modes:\nPhoto by Mike Baumeister\nThe ground rumbles and the building shakes around you. You look into your companion's eyes and know this might be the last conversation you ever have. You have to tell them... but maybe just hear what they have to say first...\n\nTwo player games will take place over mere minutes, or can last an hour. It all depends on your skills. Players have something dire to tell each other. There is a secret they have carried for years, and have sorely regretted not telling it. In these dire circumstances, players feel the urge to tell the truth, but are still afraid of how their companion will react.\nAs players have what might be their final conversation, they pull from a tumbling wood tower. Adding to the stress of the situation are the rumblings of the creature raging through the city. The vibrations of its rampage can be felt within the room, and take the form of a vibrating timer (or cell phone alarm), set to disrupt the conversation and possibly upset the tower.\nYour goal is to not have your secret told first. Whoever has their secret told first, either by them or through the other player guessing first, loses the game. If the tower falls, the monster has found you and you both lose. If one person guesses another\u2019s secret before they can tell it, they are the winner.\nPhoto by Katie Smith\nYou wake up with rubble piled around you and dust clogging the air. You are alone. Where have your companions gone? How will you find them again? Things are quiet, now, but is the creature still talking the streets, looming above and waiting to strike?\n\nThe single player mode of Crush is a solo journaling RPG. For each day, you receive a prompt. With the help of random tables of events and descriptions, you will start to build the narrative of what happened after the creature came. You will answer questions like what was destroyed, how has it affected you, and what have you had to do to survive.\nMost importantly, you will search for the companion who was with you when it all started, and over the course of a month, determine their fate while defining your own. The journaling component takes the form of a choose your own adventure narrative with prompts shifting as the days continue based on decisions you have made before. This makes it a replayable solo RPG!\nPhoto by Ke Wen\nThe Single Player mode is played with a pen, paper, and prompts. Occasionally the aid of provided tables to randomize the story may be used to move things along. It is a month-long project you will complete by writing once a day, or at your own pace. This is a solo journaling RPG that may be incorporated with a game of Multiplayer Crush, or stand on its own.\nThe Multiplayer uses a tumbling wood tower and vibrating timer (like that available on most cellular phones) and something to record your secrets with. Players will take turns speaking and pulling a brick from the tower until one has revealed their secret, or the tower falls. Environmental effects in the form of the timer will also effect the difficulty of the situation. Multiplayer games are typically shorter affairs, where rushing or delaying too long may just cost you.\nThe world of Crush is kept intentionally vague. You can explore it and describe it in-depth in Single Player mode, or you can keep it a light, city-shaped idea while you try to win Multiplayer. The kaiju themselves are also kept abstract and atmospheric until you decide to talk about how they look- if you've even seen them.\nAn early version of the zine alongside handouts designed by Joey Weiser.\n Zine Quest backers will receive the following in physical or digital format:\nRulebook containing both Crush Multiplayer and Single Player\nColor Handouts designed by Joey Weiser\nBlack & White Handouts designed by Joey Weiser\nPhoto by Daniel Hooper\nThis game is inspired by movies, but it also came from mashing all my action figures and Barbies together for ultimate monster movie mayhem in a city crafted from my blankets and blocks. Crush is not just about big, possibly goofy monsters. It's about imagining, exploring, and, most importantly, playing.\nFilms like Ishir\u014d Honda's Godzilla, Matt Reeves' Cloverfield, Guillermo del Toro's Pacific Rim, and Bong Joon-ho's The Host, gave us terrifyingly large horrors to face off with and run from. They also built characters and relationships that have stuck with us for decades. Each film about monsters extends its themes to societal issues, environmental concerns, political maneuvers... and at their core leave us with characters who resonate with us in cities we recognize. They help us better understand where our home is, and who makes that home.\nPhoto by Teo Zac\n$750 - More art by Joey Weiser!

Waterlogged and corroded, there's no chance it still works, right? Still, once it has fully dried, you blow into the bottom of the cartridge, stick it into your ghost of a console, and press the POWER button...\nTitle Screen\nThe Barrier & the Sound is a 1-player tabletop game about the beauty and strangeness of the coast. It's inspired by the storm-tossed barrier islands of Pamlico Sound, the rugged evergreen coast of the Pacific Northwest, and the crumbling sandy cliffs of Southern California. In terms of media, it draws on the haunted oceanside of Oxenfree and Bones of the Coast, the dreamlike islands of Link's Awakening and Oracle of Ages / Seasons, the surreal lighthouse shores of the Southern Reach trilogy and Song of the Sea, and the lonesome ruins of Monument Valley, Journey, and Sky: Children of the Light.\nBooklet Cover (draft) -- original photo by Philipp Pilz (Unsplash)\nThe game itself is a 5.5x6.5-inch saddle-stitch booklet, designed to resemble a video game cartridge. Inside, a step-by-step guide supports the player's exploration of an imaginary coastline filled with the perplexing \"ruins of the future.\" Aside from the cover, the interior maps and illustrations are made of 1-bit black & white video game sprites, hand-drawn and arranged by the author. The booklet will be at least 32 pages long, possibly more.\nExample Image 1 (draft)\nWhy 1-bit sprites? First, they're really fun and visually arresting, despite being even simpler than the Gameboy's four-shades-of-green graphics. It's a fascinating challenge to work within their constraints. Second, their two-color nature makes them arguably the best pixel graphics format for zine printing.\nExample Image 2 (draft)\nThe rules are simple and gamebook-like, but require more meaningful input from the player -- answering open-ended questions, deciding where to go and what to do, and determining how things feel. My design approach is weird and experimental, but I'm also building on a well-developed game design tradition that includes recent indie TRPG hits such as Avery Alder's The Quiet Year, Laura Simpson's Companions' Tale, Meguey Baker & D. Vincent Baker's Firebrands, Hannah Shaffer's 14 Days, Ross Cowman's The Fall of Magic, and Alex Roberts' For the Queen, among others.\nExample Page with Game Instructions (draft)\nThe poster map (see the higher pledge level) is not at all required to play the game, but is an homage to the fold-out map that came packaged with the original Legend of Zelda cartridge. It will not actually be folded, but instead shipped flat or rolled, depending on what seems safest.\nInitial sketch of poster map (minor spoilers!)\nI have some ideas for extra touches that could improve the project. Now that we're into Week 2 of the campaign, I'm ready to announce more details about those.\nIf we sell out of all 200 print copies, then I will add a \"DO NOT OPEN UNTIL INSTRUCTED\" card or envelope to all of the print copies. This will contain hidden information & content that you can uncover later on in the game, opening up new possibilities. For digital backers, this will be included as a separate \"DO NOT OPEN\" PDF file.\nFor every 50 digital-only backers we get, I will add +1 track to the CHIPTUNES SOUNDTRACK for the game, which you can listen to while playing or just by itself. I'm already working on the title track, so all backers get that one for free (including crunchy noise-channel waves).\nOnce all print copies are shipped, I will RELEASE THE GAME'S SPRITE SET under an open-source license so that other game designers -- both analog and digital -- can use and adapt it. The project's already been very successful, so this is just a general \"thank you\" to everyone for helping make it happen, and passing along something that might be useful to others.\nThis is a solo creative project by just me, though I will hire someone to edit and proofread the text, as well as recruiting a handful of folks to playtest the final draft. I also plan to make the PDF version available early to backers, since that seems to be a useful way to crowdsource last-minute typo-spotting before it goes to print.\nAs for myself, I've been involved in indie TRPG circles since ~2002, but most of my games have been released informally or with relatively little fanfare, occasionally becoming cult classics or -- more often -- obscure curiosities. I'm probably best known for the early GMless survival horror and map-drawing game Geiger Counter, the urban planar freebooting Planarch Codex supplements for Dungeon World, the apocalyptic subway board game Metrofinal, the IndieCade-featured zombie card game Restless, the freeform larps Tomb-Priestesses, The Lofty Beacons, and Tacklebox, the demon-whaling Leviathan Song supplement for Blades in the Dark, and for shepherding the venerable game jam Game Chef from 2009-2012.\nI'm currently a parent, instructor, grad student, and critical scholar (of interactive media and science & technology studies), roughly in that order. I am also an incorrigible designer of weird indie games. My favorite digital platform is the Nintendo Gameboy. I like long walks on haunted beaches.\nZine Quest 3 logo", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile this is my first solo Kickstarter, I've been an active part of the indie TRPG publishing circles for nearly 20 years and have backed over 200 Kickstarter projects (mostly indie games). For better or worse, I've witnessed or directly experienced many of the problems that can potentially arise.\n\nPrinting, shipping, and unexpected costs & delays are often the biggest hurdles.\n\nFor printing, I plan to work with Smartpress -- who I've worked extensively with before -- or Mixam, both of which are online printing services with fairly solid customer service. If problems come up in the printing process, I'm confident that I can deal with them. If this project is incredibly successful, I might switch to printing with Scoutbooks, a specialty printing co-op in Oregon, but their minimum orders are much higher (250+ print copies). I am a giant nerd about layout and printing, so I'll be carefully watching to make sure things turn out okay.\n\nWhile shipping is a nightmare for most print projects, the zine format makes things significantly easier because I can mail them in a sturdy envelope using standard USPS postage. Additionally, I've planned for a relatively modest number of shipments, limiting the printed zines to 100 and the posters to just 10. If these sell out quickly, I might expand the numbers, but not by too much. I want to get a couple small Kickstarter projects under my belt before I try something ambitious.\n\nUnexpected costs & delays are seemingly inevitable. That said, this is a very modest project in the grand scheme of things, without much risk of major trouble. I can absorb additional costs if I have to, since there is flexibility built into the budget, and most backers are very gracious about delays as long as communication is clear.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nIt's a fully paper product, aside from the staples, so it's recyclable and biodegradable.\nSustainable materials\nI plan to use 100% recycled paper for the printing.\nSustainable Distribution\nI will use minimal packaging and paper envelopes, avoiding any plastics.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Digital Dabbler", "descp": "While not fully intimate with the oddities of the coast, you are unquestionably a dabbler.

But it's not something I do anymore.  Why not?  WHY?  \nOkay, I will.  I will make a zine.  I want to do this.  I am excited. \n\n\n(three hours pass) \n\n\nI Made a Zine\nAnd I am zining the fuck out of this zine.  \nBack in my day, I hoarsely declaim while waving my cane, zines were quick and dirty and often embarrassingly personal.  Inside that majestic blue tub there is a possibly -infinite- number of diary zines detailing the random thoughts of punk rock teenagers in small towns in the midwest.  And that, THAT, that is what I am decanting into this thing I am making you.\nIt's a zine that I never made back when I was in high school, a fantastic imagining of what I might've done.  And it's a game.   A game for three players.  \nNay, not just a game, a simulator.  A teenaged Tim Hutchings almost-virtual-reality experience in which you and your two brave companions  (I am actually choking with laughter as I write this) get to be me for an evening.  And I tell you how to play D&D, among other things.  In fact, the name for this zine was originally Tim Hutchings Tell You How to Play AD&D because it's true and it's an homage to Rodney Anonymous Tells You How to Live, a music program hosted by the lead singer of the Dead Milkmen--my favorite band at the time described in this zine.  \nThere's a Gimmick?\nThis zine is being printed in three colors--red, blue, and yellow and the colors that blur in between.  It will come with three pieces of plastic gel--red, blue, and green.  When you hold a plastic piece to your eye you will experience ZINE MAGIC as the colors are, more or less, separated out and hidden drawings emerge!  Complementary colors turn black and the others (mostly) disappear.  Magic.\nSo the top image here is the opening page spread in the zine.  The three images below it are the same spread viewed through different colors of plastic.  I took these photos of the screen through a piece of plastic.  These are early test photos and I've improved the system since then.\nI'll say this again in a different way:  There'll be a mess of blue, red, and yellow lines, look at the pages through various colors of plastic and some lines will disappear while others emerge.  PLAYERS SEE DIFFERENT INFORMATION ON THE SAME PAGE THROUGH THE COMBINATION OF MAGIC AND SCIENCE THAT IS COLOR THEORY.  LIKE THIS.\nFYI this was stupidly hard to figure out, even with the groundwork laid down by Carnovsky and other sources.  I \nDisclaimer:  This is going to work, more or less.  The blues are pretty dark and you'll need a bright place to play.   But it should work.  But maybe it will fail?  Probably not.  \n\nThis is one of the three colored layers that make up one page spread.\nAre There Two Gimmicks?\nSort of.  Maybe the second isn't a gimmick so much as a stance.  This is a zine in concept and making.\nThis isn't really a gimmick as much as my commitment to the format:  I don't know if this zine is any good.  I am making it in character and that character is me.  I'm channeling young Tim and, to be frank, young Tim was an idiot.  He makes dull old Tim look like a genius.  \nZines are messy, they are poorly thought out, mistakes are fixed with white out and anger and the anger gets worse because the white out wasn't given enough time to dry and fuck I've ruined my pen.  Zines are shat out quickly and you don't look at it because it's gross, you just stuff it all into envelopes and mail it to other people like yourself and get things sent to you in return.\nThis zine is messy, its poorly thought out.  I had no white out so I only had anger to fix mistakes with and that doesn't work at all.  \nI sat down and wrote this zine in two or three hours, starting at 11pm.  I was bleary and confused by the end.  I worked like a teenager whose about to lose his access to free copies when his buddy goes off shift in half an hour.  \nIn short, it's a zine being a zine.\nAre You Being Some Sort of Elitist Grump About What Zines Are?\nNo!  Well, yes, but NO.   I'm telling you what zines mean to -me- and what games mean to -me-, and how my experience within the medium affects what I am making for you right now. \nBut for me a zine is something different.  The word 'zine' fires my blood in a way that ain't like most other folks making things here.   I don't want anyone to be disappointed because the thing I'm delivering has fundamentally different goals than  most of the ZineQuest 3 projects.\nOkay, Okay, Give Some Specifics.\nOkay, I guess I can do that.  \nYou're getting THREE digest-sized, sixteen page zines (they are all the same zine).  It'll be full color, probably printed by McNaughton Gunn--those are the same folks that printed Thousand Year Old Vampire.\nYou'll get three small squares of plastic with the zine which will allow the eyeball magic to emerge.  Probably they'll come in a little envelope that'll be tucked into the zine.  \nThis is a sort of game for three players.\nI am timing this so that the zine will come out of the printer at the same time as the secret TYOV companion book.\nUPDATE:  In the interest of gaming on the cusp of post-covid I am providing THREE copies of the zine to Kickstarter backers.  That way you don't have to hunker around one book and breath up each other's air.  You're still only getting one pack of plastic viewing bits though.\nSecret TYOV companion book?  \nYes, it's an add-on you can get when you Kickstart this project.  You'll also be able to pre-order it through the regular thousandyearoldvampire.com site.  Let's maybe talk about that in the faq or something.  \nSo There Are Add-ons and Stuff?\nYeah, that's new to me to.  Kickstarter has it set up now so that you pledge for a reward tier and then there are add-ons that should appear beneath the pledge.  You can add on copies of Thousand Year Old Vampire, the companion book, some pins (including a new one!) , and another zine game I'd made.  \nAgain, while one person is seeing this image the other two players are seeing coexisting images that are completely different.\nAll Right Then, So Tell Us About The Game.\nCan't you just trust me?  No?  Well, that's sensible I guess.  \nThe game is pretty light.  Three players peer through their plastic pieces and see information that is unique to their colored piece of plastic, more or less.  The players tell the story of a slightly idealized, barely remembered amalgam of summer evenings of youthful freedom when I could drive but still have no responsibilities.  And I go play AD&D with friends.  \nYou negotiate the story together, each player operating from a different body of information.  You might find a use for dice for part of the game, but they aren't required. The authorial voice in the zine flickers between the viewpoint of Young Tim, the memories of Old Tim, and a sort of dispassionate aping of zine makers I've absorbed into my being.  \nIs That Really A Game?\nOh don't be that fucker.  I mean, it doesn't really have rules or goals or even a real structure but neither do zines.   There's just an amorphous knowledge of how it works, an arc of excitement and disappointment.  \nCouldn't This Just Be Three Separate Booklets?\nOh jeez, you're right.  I, uh, guess that it wouldn't be as clever?  \nActually no, I'm going to double-down on the color thing.  It's important to the structure of the experience that you are given a messiness of information blended together on a single page and each player looks at that mess through a different lens and pulls out strings of meaning.  It's like a memory, which this game is about.  And it's like being a person who is a child and an adult and smart and an idiot all at once, flickering constantly between states as you move between different social spaces and nodes of responsibility.\nBut I guess that'll be the PDF format.  Three separate PDFs, one for each player to allow online or print-and-play.\nWere You Serious About This Being Made Quickly Or Is That A Fake Authenticity Thing?\nThe authenticity and roughness of the work process on this is me being true to my own understanding of what zines do in the world.  It's also me working off some of the hyperpolished perfection of that vampire game.  \nIt's an homage to John Porcellino, Funkapotamus, punk zines, and all the little diary zines with drawings of suburban landscapes that I do so love.\nAnything Else We Should Know?\nI'm excited about this!\nAnd don't poke yourself in the eye with the corner of a piece of plastic.   Seriously.  Do this at your own risk.   Wear safety glasses or something.   I'm going to put that on the book, no shit.\nYou Should Probably Say Who You Are.\nOh, yeah.  My name is Tim Hutchings.  I'm a game maker and a college professor and used to be a reasonably accomplished fine arts guy.  If you are here you probably know the game Thousand Year Old Vampire--I made that.  It won four big awards and I'm very proud of it. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI think I have this one under control.

My name is Andrew, and I created Occupied Hex games. I am a passionate game designer as well as player, and STREETS is my first Kickstarter for #ZineQuest! STREETS is a tabletop role-playing game where players take on the roles of stray dogs and cats in a rules-light game that anyone can grasp quickly and have a blast playing.\nIf you don't even know what a tabletop role-playing game is, it's simply a story the players and game master tell together, and dice are used when risky situations pop up to add suspense and unpredictable results.\nThe game engine is built around simplicity-- you only need one or two regular ol' six-sided dice to play. When you run into a challenging situation and need to make a skill check, you roll 2d6, add them together, then add whatever skill modifier you might have. If even that sentence sounded overly complex, I promise you the game is easy to jump into.\nThere are no hit points or armor classes, but there are still consequences for risky actions that fail! If you get hurt you roll for the body location and then take an injury, which impacts your skills and can lead to even more dire consequences!\nIf you'd like to see the game in action, here is a full game we played! *NOTE this video contains R-rated language at times)\nThere are a LOT of dog breeds out there to choose from, but I wanted players to feel like they had unique, customizable stats for their dog, regardless of what breed they chose. I devised a 'class' system using the seven AKC breed groups so whatever dog breed you decide to play as, you'll have an easy source for your stats.\nYou can also play a mixed breed! Mixed breed dogs have even more customizable stats, plus an extra point for their hardiness.\nYou can even play as a cat. Cats have slightly worse stats than dogs, but a lot more luck, which enables you to re-roll failed skill checks! \nBut your character doesn't just have their stats at their disposal, they also have two unique talents, which give them special abilities, such as Houdini: You can open doors with your paw or teeth. These talents give each character even more depth but are immediately easy to understand. \n\u2022A player section for creating dog or cat characters, as well as the game basics.\n\u2022A simple, easy-to-read character sheet.\n\u2022A game master section for running games, along with tips in case it's your first time.\n\u2022A scenario generator so you can just roll dice and come up with the ingredients for running the adventure.\n\u2022An alternate 'hard mode' aimed at adult players, that trades some of the lighthearted tone for real stakes.\n\u2022Specific one shot adventure snapshots to use or inspire you.\n\u2022PLUS a one shot adventure written by ace game master Jared Logan from Stream of Blood.\n\u2022PLUS a campaign adventure for an epic story that spans multiple game sessions.\n\u2022PLUS the expansion module IT FELL FROM THE NIGHT, which gives your dog or cat superpowers!\n\u2022PLUS a map by Josh Smith!\nSTREETS is designed to make the fun, communal storytelling of an RPG easy for everyone. Players do get the satisfaction of their dog or cat's unique stats and talents, but the gameplay is very smooth once you set sail. \nI originally created this game after being stymied trying to play D&D remotely with my daughter's middle school RPG Club.

I\u2019m DW Dagon and I\u2019m a table-top role-playing game creator. Over the last two years, I\u2019ve produced art and written for several TTRPG projects that have since gotten Electrum, Gold, and Platinum bestseller awards from DM\u2019s Guild; and one Ennie award for a collaboration product. So! Let me tell ya a little bit about this project!\n  What the hell is \u2018YOU REPUGNANT HUNTERS\u2019\n\u2018YOU REPUGNANT HUNTERS\u2019 is a system-agnostic zine that has rules and some sticky flavor for running a dark/metal fantasy campaign where players acquire hunting seals which allow them to hunt monstrosities too putrid for the average hero.\nHunters undergo a ritual to a Hunting Insignia which will determine their style of hunting and type of prey their Insignia. Hunting down and ceremonially eviscerating prey will lead to appeasing a Hunting Insignia, and gaining occult powers.\n\nCompatability\n'YOU REPUGNANT HUNTERS' rules only need d6 dice and lust for filthy, gory bounty hunting. This rule system is designed for M\u00d6RK BORG however can be run in pretty much anything.\n Running a M\u00d6RK BORG campaign? No worries! Just throw it in there! It even has Omens!\n 5th Edition D&D? Pick some horrible creatures to hunt and get it started!\n Mothership? Add \u2018space\u2019 in front of random nouns and you\u2019ll get stuff like \u201cSpace-Templar of Torment\u201d. Players will be none-the-wiser!\n Quest RPG? I mean, you could, but I seriously question your theme choice...\n  Why Hunt?\n\u2018YOU REPUGNANT HUNTERS\u2019 began when I had watched about 15 hours of Bloodborne lore on YouTube and then read through the M\u00d6RK BORG rulebook. The world of TTRPGs like M\u00d6RK BORG, Shadow of the Demon Lord, and Trophy are harsh and doomed places, and though I love that kind of universe, something in me wanted to create a supplement that gives some element of control and side-questy purpose to campaigns of such damned existences.\nHunter's Seal\nThe \u2018Zine\n\u2018YOU REPUGNANT HUNTERS\u2019 is currently a 16-page zine featuring rules, flavor/lore, hunt rewards, and player handouts for five hunter types. Once the project is fully backed, stretch goals for extra random tables of items, variant prey features, and other goodies will be added to the project; thus extending the page count but not the cost to back it!\nContent has already begun being created and come completion of the Kickstarter, the project is on track to be complete and ready to send off for printing.\n\nLimited Basic Hunting Seal\nI'm one of those GMs and players who is a sucker for props at the table. That's why I thought \"wouldn't it be fantastic to have one of the seals to pass to players who are rolling a meditation roll (when a character meditates on a seal to gain visions of their next prey)?\". So I went ahead and created a prototype of a hunting seal prop for a limited amount of pledges (and let's face it, for me to use at the table). The prop is calico canvas, ink, and the wax seal is 3d printed PLA painted red. I thought to make an actual seal but for longevity and repeat use, I didn't want people having cracked and broken wax all over the shop. Prototype of the hand distressed hunting seal is below!\nPrototype of hand distressed, Limited Edition Basic Hunting Seal prop\n\nStretch Goals [Update: NEW SOCIAL STRETCH GOAL!]\nThe following stretch goals will add to the zine if achieved. The zine and pledge costs won't increase at all. It'll just be added value and content. :)\nUNLOCKED! $450 - TROUBLE BREWING: +1 hunter type; the alchemist\nUNLOCKED! $500 - DESPICABLE YOU: despicable variant prey features\nUNLOCKED! $550 - REPUGNANT TRAITS for REPUGNANT HUNTERS: repugnant trait chart\nUNLOCKED! $600 - LOCK'N LOAD: hunter load-outs\nUNLOCKED! $650 - RUTHLESS REWARDS: ruthless insignia faction rewards\nUNLOCKED! $666 - BLOOD-CLOTTED'N CURSED: everything printed in a blood-clot ink\nUNLOCKED! $1266 - PUS PAPER COLOUR: Softly yellowing, creamy, paper colour to compliment the deep blood-clot red writing and art.\n\nSOCIAL STRETCH GOAL #1\nLOOT! The current ruthless rewards are a Roll 1d6 table of rare items that can be bestowed. This social stretch goal will increase the number to 20 foul-yet-desirable items and a rule where the higher the Advanced Seal Rank, the higher the roll and rarity. \nTo achieve this social stretch goal target will be 66 posts on Twitter about what you would love about hunting horrid and unholy entities with the below link and the hashtag of: #YouRepugnantHunters\nLink: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dw-dagon/you-repugnant-hunters?ref=project_tweet\nKeep in mind that no one likes spam so only tweet something interesting; even your own thoughts on what your hunter vibe would be. I won't be counting spam tweets coz, y'know. That's just not sporting. Not very hunter-like..\n\nDELIVERY\nThe content has already begun being designed and I'm estimating that it will take a month for art, editing, and layout (as I'm doing most of this by myself and art takes longer than I always think).\nPostage is not included in the pledge cost and will be added on when checking out in the pledge manager once the campaign finishes.\nOnce the product has completed its printing phase (two weeks maximum for a small run of meeting the Funding Goal), it will be mailed out by standard post. Due to COVID, internationally posted products are expected to take roughly a month to be delivered. To keep track of estimated delivery times, one posted product from each country will have tracking so I can update backers on when to expect their countries' deliveries to begin arriving.\n  Budget\nFor such a small run of zines the production costs, tax, and Kickstarter project fees will be eating up most of the budget at the current Funding Goal. The Funding Goal works out that I can print a run of this zine and won't be at a loss for estimated damaged stock and (gods forbid) missing deliveries. If the project exceeds the funding goal, extra funding goes to the artist (me, operating at nothing per hour at this stage) and a bonus for the contributors which is an extra 66.6% (\ud83e\udd18) on top of their hiring costs (editors and layout folks deserve their weight in gold). All contributors are paid hiring costs up front and the bonus after the campaign has been funded.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWorking a full-time job and doing TTRPG creation on the side means that my main risk is taking longer to do art and layout due to emergencies or general life stuff. If there is anything that causes the production part of the project to go longer than usual, backers will be briefed as such.

This Zine is no exception. She reached out to the corners of the internet (okay, her trashy lesbian girlfriend, her DMs and one really really gay message board) and rallied a ragtag bunch of creative mavericks to pull off what can only be described as the bestworsttrashy lesbian romance novel: the game.\nRemember those kids in the class that complicated your group projects? You know the ones. Instead of just making the thing in the assignment they wanted to make:\nthe world the assignment would live in\nthe characters in the world that would make the assignment\nthe marketing campaign for the assignment\nthe assignment itself\n  We were those kids. We are those adults.\n\nMake up an author. Make up the author's trashy lesbian romance novel. Make up the characters in the trashy romance novel. Act it out.\n\nThis Could Be You\n\n\nEver wished you were a character in the novel you were reading? Yeah.

And you have bills to pay. For fear your toast will never meet an avocado again, you turn to mass market, specifically romance novels.

We've been toiling away, so you won't!\nOne of the great things about backing Denial & Yearning is that the game is mostly done! It is designed and playtested. The rules are sitting nicely in an InDesign layout. All that awaits is the last editing pass and some finalized art assets.\nMeaning if our project gets funded, we'll be able to send you your digital copy right away when the campaign ends!\n\nThe sentiment behind Denial & Yearning is lighthearted fun and we are very excited to share it with the world! But whenever we have the opportunity and platform to share our values in a public way we take things a little more seriously.  We'd like to take this time to draw attention to some values that are very important to us (that informed game design & writing).\n\nSafety and Consent\nDenial & Yearning is a game about romance, physical intimacy, and perhaps even sex. These are powerful and potentially difficult topics, and your safety, and the safety of your partner, are always more important than the game. With that in mind, Yearning and Desire includes a discussion of consent before play begins.\nMany romance novels are joyously dirty and erotic, but others fade to black when things get sexual, or portray romantic relationships that aren\u2019t sexual (Pride and Prejudice is tragically straight, but it\u2019s still pretty good). Your in-game novel can fall anywhere on that spectrum. Make sure that you only portray things in your game that both players are excited to explore. And of course, anyone is allowed to change their minds at any time during play.\n\nGender and Pronouns\nThis is a also game about lesbian romance. The lesbian community is diverse, and it includes people who experience gender very differently. There are butches and femmes who find those identities profoundly healing, and other lesbians who find those terms alien. There are people who have lived as straight men until they come out as trans women, and people who have lived as lesbians and then come out as trans men. There are non-binary people with all sorts of experiences.\nWe celebrate the diversity of lesbians, and we are not here to tell you who is not a lesbian. We often use she/her pronouns to refer to our characters and players, but this is a game for anyone who wants the trashy lesbian romance novel experience and your characters might not use she/her.\n[Will continue to be updated throughout project]\nAs the campaign progresses we'll be updating with fun behind the scene moments, and the design process. It will include pictures of our discord goofing, pictures of our test prints, early art assets, as well as true process gems like this mockup Allison made for Micah:\nAnd behind-the-scenes discord moments, like when Dee found her true calling:\n\nConcept Art by Micah.

Death is likely, but what did you have to live for anyway? At least out there is the chance to make something of yourself, and maybe even get back at those who wronged you.\nSurely, this is no life for decent folk. But you\u2019re not decent folk. You are an Errant. \nErrant is a classic fantasy role-playing game in the vein of the first few editions of that role-playing game and its many imitators and descendants such as Knave, Into the Odd, and The Black Hack. It is freely compatible with material for all those games as well as the newest edition of that role-playing game, with conversion guides provided within.\nErrant is designed with the following principles in mind.\n Keep it Simple, Stupid \u2013 No math above a 2nd grade level necessary.\n Cut to the Chase \u2013 The procedures in Errant are designed to create a gameplay experience in which the smallest possible time between meaningful decisions is maintained.\n Active, not Passive \u2013 To that end, player abilities are designed around the player making active choices, not receiving passive bonuses. Even using armour to defend is a choice!\n Options, not Proscriptions \u2013 All rules and procedures in Errant are intended as guidance, to provide a toolbox for play. Rules are written to be open-ended, extendable, and use natural language wherever possible. We trust you to make good decisions.\nSo why drop your hard-earned dollars on yet another fantasy heartbreaker retroclone? What makes Errant unique?\nErrant is rules light, procedure heavy.\nWhat does that mean? Well, it means that the rules you need to play Errant are simple to understand and minimal. At its core, the basic mechanic is to simply roll a twenty-sided die and try to get a result that\u2019s in between two numbers (\u201croll high under\u201d or \u201cblackjack\u201d) to resolve tasks.\nHowever, Errant has a number of procedures that are designed to help you navigate different play situations in fair and interesting ways. Want to know how to run an exciting chase scene, or establish a fried cockatrice restaurant, or sue a demon for emotional negligence? Errant has procedures that can help you do that!\nProcedures are not rules, but neither are they vague, general guidance. They provide a framework to structure the game, and can be adjusted, ignored, hacked, mangled, broken, stolen, or seasoned to taste.\nWhile designed to be more comprehensive than the lightweight rulesets of many newer old-school role-playing games, all the rules and procedures of Errant are streamlined for ease of use and understanding. They have been hammered into shape by five years of rigorous playtesting; every rule or procedure within the book has come into contact with a live player, and has changed as a result. \nClickthrough for higher resolution.\nDon't take my word for it. Check out a preview of the game right now at https://errantrpg.carrd.co.\nErrant comes in two volumes, both 64 page 5.5\" x 8.5\" saddle-stitched, black & white zines. The PDFs will be hyperlinked and bookmarked.\n$10 gets you both volumes in PDF form.\n$20 gets you both volumes in Print & PDF. \nFulfilment of physical orders will be handled by Exalted Funeral. U.S. shipping is $5, Canadian is $14 and international is $16. Digital files will be shared via itch.io.\nProfits from the Kickstarter will go towards paying the hardworking people who made Errant a reality. We\u2019re keeping stretch goals limited for that reason.\n UNLOCKED: $1750 \u2013 Illustrated character sheets and a printable Guide's screen done by D.L. Johnson, will be made available to all backers as digital PDFs.\n UNLOCKED $2000 \u2013 A short adventure module illustrated by Ramonkey will be made available to all backers as a digital PDF.\n UNLOCKED $2500 \u2013 A suite of digital tools will be created, including a digital SRD, a character generator, automated event dice, and more!\n UNLOCKED $3500 \u2013 An additional digital zine will be produced, intended for use as a worldbuilding toolkit for Guides. It will feature five new Covenants for The Zealot Archetype, five Settlements with fleshed out NPCs, five Threats, five Rival Companies, and more!\nYe wretches have glutted your fill, and now it is time for us to receive our due!\nThere will be no more stretch goals past this point; every extra bit of funding from here on out goes towards improving the product. That means more art, increasing the accessibility of our PDFs and webtools, and paying the contributors more.\nPlease note that the PDF adventure and worldbuilding toolkit may be delivered to backers at a later date than Vol 1 & 2 of Errant itself.\nAva Islam, writing and design \u2013 Ava Islam is a fool, a wretch, a rogue, and a rapscallion. She has done nothing of note to date. You can start fights with her on twitter.com (@yungdumbitch) or read the ravings of her brain worms at permacrandam.blogspot.com. She\u2019s not your mom, so you don\u2019t have to listen to anything she says.\nChris Mennell, campaign management \u2013 Chris Mennell is a dreamer and maker of things and very much a work in progress. He co-founded In Search of Games which has published the Ennie-nominated module Santa is Dead, as well as running the seminal RPG blog Beyond the Weird. He recently published a zine of the same name, and has  since partnered with Ava to launch a new endeavour, Kill Jester. All this is very impressive since Chris is, in reality, a manatee in a people suit.\nNick LS Whelan, layout \u2013 Nick LS Whelan has somehow gone unpunished for his litany of book crimes. His works include such unwholesome publications as Miscreated Creatures, Deadly Dungeons, Faux Pas, and The Bloodsoaked Boudoir of Velkis the Vile. This rampage of mangled word wrangling will never stop until someone has the courage to take away his keyboard. When not doing words badly, he can usually be found washing dishes, taking himself too seriously, or failing to understand jokes. Most of his work can be found on PapersPencils.com.\nJoseph H. Vilas, editing \u2013 Joseph H. Vilas is absolutely unqualified to do anything at all. He has been known to pick nits, pet both foreign and domestic animals, and drink glasses of water for entertainment. He lives in Durham, NC, and likes the crispy feeling of line-dried cotton clothes.\nIan Hagan, cover illustration \u2013 Ian Hagan is a hermit whose day job involves collecting bits of colored paper with numbers on it as well as shiny bits of round metal. When not doing that other stuff, he uses electro-magic to make pictures that are not based on reality. You can see theses strange creations here. \nAlex Demaceno, cover illustration \u2013 Alex is a gnarled monster who makes his living by drawing creatures and maps for the errants wandering the underworld. After hoarding enough gold, he dreams to become the overlord of his own dungeon. His work can be found here.\nD.L. Johnson, interior illustration - D. L. Johnson is a miscreant illustrator and game designer living in the mountains of Montana. After blackmailing Pelgrane Press into letting him draw for Ken Hite modules, he vomited forth books like Gathox Vertical Slum, Quake Alley Mayhem, and Grandpappy Cromdar's Whizbang Zoo! Portfolio work can be found at ironimagestudios.org.\nJester by D.L. Johnson\nMorrie B, interior illustration \u2013 Morrie B wishes she was a beaver. Can you imagine how wonderful life would be as a beaver? You get to build your own home and paddle around in your personal lake you made to be safe from nasty things. In the winter, you don't have to hibernate. Instead, your cabin is heated and you're free to swim in the water under the ice. What an ideal life.\nBird Traveller by Morrie B\nGus L, interior illustration \u2013 Gus L is a distempered recluse living in the wilds of the Western Shore. He writes about Owlbears and is furious about the great chain of being. Rex anseris aequabis non potest peccare...\nGoose King by Gus L\nLazy Litch, interior illustration \u2013 Lazy Litch is a slothful undead who spends most of his time chilling in the dungeon watching whatever is on the scrying orb. Once in a blue moon he will draw a picture.\nDeath Knight by Lazy Litch\nVeronica Vance, interior illustration \u2013 Veronica Vance absolutely requires adult supervision. But being the only adult in the vicinity she often finds herself free to impose upon people\u2019s eyes her filthy arts and wicked crafts. Sometimes a writer, sometimes an artist, always tired. She often reveals herself on twitch, and from there attempts to expand her salacious social media presence.\nThe Fool by Veronica Vance\nThe final draft of both volumes is on track to be done by the end of February 2021. After that, they\u2019ll go through their editing passes and into layout. Our estimated delivery date of February 2022 is giving us all an ample amount of time to get these books done and provide a buffer against any unforeseen circumstances, but we should hopefully deliver earlier than that.\nThese first two volumes are just the start.

More to the point, it's a Zine full of different columns and articles presenting different aspects of languages and linguistics, and how you can incorporate them into your game.\nWhy?\nLanguage in RPGs is usually neglected or handwaved, beyond maybe an accent here or there, even then missing out on many of the finer aspects one can include in an accent. Languages are complex and multifaceted, and an integral part of our existence as human beings. Every aspect of language, from syntax to pragmatics to sociolinguistics, is rich with content that can be mined for an RPG campaign. Whether you want to make a unique accent, or differentiate cultures by the nuances of their speech, all of this and more can only be achieved by delving into the inner workings of language.\nWhat's in an issue of The Journal of Fantastic Linguistics?\nThe Zine is built of columns and stand alone articles: Columns present a topic through a different lens each issue. Stand alone articles are pieces that present a single topic, whether a specific aspect of language, different tables for inspiration, or a short plot hook (all related to languages, of course). Each Zine is comprised of four columns and one stand alone article.\nIn Issue #1 you can find\nAccents 101 - A guide to the various elements that an accent contains, and how to use them in your own accents.\nAnatomy of Accents - A column examining how the anatomy of different species could affect how they communicate.\nLost in Translation - Various plot hooks revolving around miscommunications and faults in languages and their uses, each issue provides hooks related to some aspect of society.\nCreature Communication - A bestiary containing one or two monsters that affect, or are affected by, language.\nTalking with Taboos - A stand alone article examining how cultures can use language to mark their taboos - and the people who break them.\nA human(oid) and a dragonborn articulatory system side by side\nA note on accents and linguistic prejudice\nMany tables just pick several real world accents and stick them on the various cultures or races in their campaign. Not only does this perpetuate harmful stereotypes, it also limits the representation of your in game culture. Constructing accents isn't difficult, and you can build accents that are easy for you to use and remember, not limiting yourself to the handful of impersonations you know.\nThe Budget\nA picture is worth a thousand words:\nThough in this case it's only worth around twenty: The budget accounts for art (250$), Kickstarter fees (200$), Printing (210$), and shipping (1000$), leaving a buffer (340$) for unforeseen problems.\nThe budget is planned around the most costly scenario - the project succeeds with exactly 2000$, all coming from 100 backers backing at the print level. In this case the budget should just cover everything. Any extra funds will go towards art for future issues (and maybe printing if all goes really unexpectedly well), as well as maybe buying me a few energy drinks.\nThe Team\nZiv Plotnik (He/Him): A linguistics grad student with a burning passion for both linguistics and roleplaying games - who finally hopes to combine the two in a way that can be spread to as many people as possible.\nAlyssa Schein (She/Her): A freelance artist and roleplaying enthusiast, you can find her works here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the first large scale project that includes physical items that I'm undertaking, and it's scary.

I wrote it in 2019 after a particularly bad spell of hearing loss, as the first RPG which I wrote and published, and this Kickstarter will be the first time it has been in print.\nThis is a quiet, reflective, and introspective story game for two people to play together in a single session. Simple and easy to play, it's great for newcomers to roleplaying games and experienced players alike. \nWhat to expect from the game\nA Loud Noise in a Quiet Place is a tabletop story game inspired by games about the lived experiences of real people, like Hannah Schaffer's 14 Days, and by games for small groups, like Shawn Tomkin's Ironsworn.\nTemporary hearing loss changes how you perceive the world around you in profound ways, because we rely on the subtle balance of our senses. The sudden shift in this balance is a powerful source of introspective drama: the condition is always inconvenient, usually difficult, and sometimes painful. This is true both for me and the people around me.\nThe game itself is an asymmetric game for two players, with one player taking the role of someone who has temporarily lost their hearing to some degree. Through short scenes, they play out seven days in the life and relationships of their character, with each vignette culminating in a defining sound, heard or misheard, and a single die roll which resolves the scene.\nThe other player takes up the mantle of these heard or misheard sounds, but throughout the main part of the game, they avoid speaking. Instead, they listen carefully, responding to the other player's narrative by setting the difficulty of the dice roll.\nThe consequences of failure or success are immediate and lasting, showing the randomness and difficulty of adjusting to a radically different sensory experience of the world.\nIf you back the game at any level, you'll get immediate free access to the first edition of A Loud Noise in a Quiet Place (available at Marx of High Water on Itchio).\nWhat to expect from the zine\nThe finished zine will be a 16-page booklet, printed on recycled stock using a Risograph copier and inks. The cover will use black and one additional colour, and be printed on coloured, heavyweight paper stock. Inside, the text will be in printed in black ink on off-white paper. There will be a digital version of the zine published in PDF format.\nEarly mockup of the printed zine\nThe zine text will be laid out to be as accessible as possible for low-vision and dyslexic readers, and the PDF will be as accessible as possible to users of screen-readers.\nThe game is mostly complete; my original game has been through development editing and playtesting, which have led to a few changes to the base mechanics which need to be implemented. After that, the game text will be laid out and illustrated by me with kit-bashed stock art. For everything else, I've swapped favours so far, but from here I need to actually pay people. \nWhat this Kickstarter is funding\nYour money will be funding the work of an accessibility designer who'll be working to make this game as accessible as possible to blind and low-vision players. I'll also be hiring several sensitivity readers and consultants so that the experience of deaf and hard of hearing people feed into the game.\nIn addition to this valuable and important labour, your money funds the production of the zine at my local printshop, whose specialty is zine printing. They focus on providing environmentally friendly printing and distribution, and also operate as a cooperative, a mode of collective production which I support and practice.\nGaining funds beyond my funding target will allow me to put more money back into the hands of some of my favourite creators in the indie TTRPG community: professional artists, graphic designers and copy editors.\nThis project is done out of love, and I won't personally profit from it. Should I greatly exceed my expectations, I'll take a little money to cover the time taken to deal with the logistical work involved. Otherwise, money will be going to my friends and collaborators, and to other parts of the indie scene.   \nWhat more money means for the project\n\u00a31,275 - Professional cover art - UNLOCKED!: At \u00a31,275, I'll be able to pay Bri de Danann, a wonderfully talented artist, to create a professional two-tone cover for the zine.\n\u00a31,550 - Professional touches - UNLOCKED!: At \u00a31,550, I'll be able to pay for professional services including copy editing by Nynphaiel, proofreading, graphic design by Facu Kaper and book layout by Francita Soto.\n\u00a31,850 - Internal comics: At \u00a31,850 I'll be able to commission Bri de Danann, who is also an accomplished comic artist, to produce two full-page comics to act as examples of play, expanding the zine to 20 pages.\n\u00a32,150 - More comics: If we can get \u00a32,150, I'll commission Bri to create three more comic pages, expanding the zine to 24 beautiful pages. \nHow we can help promote others\nI'm a diehard indie TTRPG enthusiast. I want every creator to get as much exposure and promo as they need, and Zinequest is the perfect opportunity for that. Through February, my indie TTRPG interview podcast Yes Indie'd Pod is running at least 18 short interviews with amazing creators from other Zinequest campaigns. I'm encouraging backers to go and listen to these interviews, and follow Yes Indie'd Pod on Twitter, as well as the interviewees.\n50 New Followers - Audiobook: If the Yes Indie'd Pod Twitter account gets 50 new followers before the campaign finishes, I'll use my quality recording equipment and editing experience to create an audiobook version of the game text, for people whose learning preference is auditory.\nIf you'd like appear on Yes Indie'd Pod, to talk about or just advertise your TTRPG project, there are two reward tiers for that, both of which include a signed copy of the zine, delivered free worldwide.\nThe creators behind this project\nMarx Shepherd (author) is a game designer and editor for the San Jenaro CoOp and the in*die zine, as well as host of the Yes Indie'd indie interview podcast.

Check out his Zinequest project on Kickstarter!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter campaign, although I have followed and backed dozens of projects in the last few years. I am familiar with the process of campaigning and fulfillment, and my work in the indie TTRPG space has helped me get to grips with running a creative project. Managing complex projects is also a part of my day job. All-in-all, I'm pretty qualified to run this project. That said, there are always challenges and risks, and I'll address the biggest of these below.\n\nFirstly, Brexit. This project is conducted in British Pounds, and the effects of the UK leaving the EU still aren't certain. As most of my collaborators take payment in US Dollars, their cut of the funds in pounds might be higher than predicted. This will be covered by a small contingency allowance, and won't affect delivery.\n\nSecondly, postal services. My local supply chain is small and stable: I collect the zines locally and use one of the longest running postal services in the world to deliver them. However, there is still uncertainty in overseas delivery, due in part to the pandemic and in part to the United States Postal Service, the state of which affects many other countries. As such, international delivery may be delayed or have other issues. I will replace any copies lost or damaged in the post once the expected delivery window has past.\n\nThirdly, managing freelancers. Some of my collaborators do this work as a sideline, and the ongoing pandemic affects their regular employment prospects. This may mean that their personal circumstances may add delays to the project. If this becomes a problem, I will seek other freelancers instead. Any additional costs incurred will come from the contingency pot.\n\nFourthly, me. Most of the delivery of this project is on me personally, which carries the biggest risk. Whilst I am committed to delivering this project, should my personal circumstances change dramatically, I may have to pass on the responsibility of fulfillment to someone else.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nI'm using heavier weight paper and card stock than books and zines typically use. This will reduce wear, allowing for a longer lasting product.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe zine will be made from recycled paper, and aside from the spine staples, it will be fully recyclable. Shipping packaging will consist only of paper and card.\nSustainable materials\nUsing recycled paper reduces the use of virgin materials, and in addition, I have specified uncoated paper, which is a more environmentally-friendly option in terms of carbon emissions and material use.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nThe zines will be printed by a local printing co-operative who are committed to sustainable, low impact business. I trust them implicitly to do this right - beyond any of my expectations, they have suggested the sustainable materials, paper treatments and printing techniques outlined above.\nSustainable Distribution\nI'm using local businesses, so I'll be collecting the printed zines on my pedal cycle. Likewise, I will take the zines on foot to my local Post Office. This will reduce the carbon impact of delivery as much as is possible.\n\nUnfortunately, fast international shipping generally relies on airmail. However, after funding, those from outside the UK or EU can opt for International Economy delivery, which is a \"surface mail\" option using ships and trains. This helps to reduce the carbon impact of delivery.\n\nMany of the project backers will choose to receive the zine in digital form only. This results in less carbon emissions and material usage compared to printing and shipping a booklet.\nSomething else\nAs an engineer I regard sustainability holistically, encompassing environmental, economic and social aspects. In terms of sustainable economies, I'll spending money in local businesses, minimising profits and contingency, and providing hardship pledge tiers for those in need. For social sustainability, I'll be commissioning marginalised creators, and focusing on document accessibility for sensory impairment and neurodivergency.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Supporter", "descp": "Get all the updates as they happen, and show your support for this project!\nINCLUDES:\nImmediate access to the first edition", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2021"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a33 or more", "title": "Digital edition - hardship", "descp": "A digital copy of the finished zine, with any digital stretch goals that get produced.

It also happens to be your 20th reunion. Unbeknownst to you, there are seven other professional killers in attendance. You will mingle and reminisce, and then, when the time\u2019s right, you\u2019ll decide if you\u2019re ready to pull the trigger (or draw your sword or whatever.)\nPressure Drop is a one-shot larp (about 2-4 hours long) in the American Freeform tradition that explores what happens when people who do terrible things have to face those who knew them best. It's inspired by the film Grosse Pointe Blank though you needn't be familiar with that movie to enjoy the game.\nPlaying Pressure Drop \nHere's how play goes:\nBefore the game the facilitator will read through the game and familiarize themselves with the game, the workshop, and the safety tools. Then they'll prep the play materials (printing some stuff out, cutting a few things out, making a playlist, finding a stapler.)\nThen everyone gets together and gets ready to play. This means going over the safety rules to make sure everyone is taken care of (people are more important than the game!) and doing a little Action Sequence workshop to practice what it means to perform combat in this game (see below!)\nThen everyone gets together and makes their characters. There are eight assassin archetypes. I will not be stretch-goaling to a ninth assassin archetype. If I think of another one before the zine goes to the printer I'll include it. If you have an archetype you think I should include please send it to me and I won't even charge you more to include it if it's a good idea. Wow what a magnanimous game designer. If I don't think it's a good idea please don't cancel your pledge. You can also just hack it in there later, I have literally no control over what you do with this game once it's in your hands. Wow pretty scary stuff!\nOkay anyway then after you pick your archetype there's a sorta mad-libs-style character creation to generate your backstory (who you were in high school, who you have fond memories of, etc. etc.) this is collaborative and fun (people have told me it's fun if it's not fun please don't ask for a refund of your pledge.) You also find out who your target is (it's another player's secret identity.) You also find out what is Your Song while this song is playing you'll have to confess your secret identity to someone. Hope they're not also an assassin (they are.)\nThen there's a bit of introduction to the game and you start playing! It's almost as awkward as a real reunion, you get to see people you haven't seen before! Lie about who you are and what you've been doing with your life! Try to grab a bit of the fleeting emotion of the last time you were truly seen before your shitty job and lack of meaningful human connection ground you down to a thin paste! Typical reunion shit!\nThen you maybe get to try to kill each other.\nThen the game is over!\nSince the character generation is random, you could in theory play this game infinity times. At that price you can't afford not to buy this game! In all seriousness though I've facilitated this game like five times and it's still a blast.\nAction Sequence\nOne of the cool things about this game is at the end you get to decide if you want to partake in a action sequence to try to take out your target. Or maybe you decide not to or maybe you decide to just try to protect your best friend who you haven't seen in twenty years TWENTY YEARS!\nI was inspired by Evan Torner's Hell is Other Vampires for the low-speed/turn-based action sequence he devised to capture a bit of strategy without bogging the game down with a ton of rules. \nThe effect is a little bit of kids playing pretend (I get you with my sword! I shoot you with my SMG!) but wrapped in just enough game to let you think strategically. The playtest materials are available on itch pwyw if you're interested in checking them out.\nThe Zine\nI'm keeping this simpler than My Jam (which by the way we did before the first zinequest so if you think about it something something.) My goal with the layout is that you can just open up the staples and play if you want, or print the pdf or make copies or whatever.\nUnless this super blows up I'll be printing at home on a laser printer on French paper. Maybe the cover will be like neon green or something. I've been really into neon green lately. If this super blows up I'll find a printer to work with.\nI also wanna have some art! I think it's a nice little addition to the physical zine, and I love working with awesome artists! This art will only appear in the physical zine!\nFor this project, I'm working with Filipa Namorado an illustrator with a background in graphic design whose work is informed by shoujo manga and mid-century children\u2019s literature. They are passionate about fashion, gender and sexuality, having written and illustrated their own picture book about gender diversity. Here are some of the early sketches they've sent over of the eight character archetypes:\nDesign Process\nI watched Grosse Pointe Blank like a hundred times. Not really as part of the design process just because it's a brilliant film. It's so funny and violent and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.\nThen Jeff and I wrapped up My Jam and I was adrift with no design projects, so this kinda trickled in. You can probably see the relationship to My Jam. Both have music, both have high school.\nThen I wrote up some playtest materials and tried it out at Dreamation 2019. Got some good feedback, made a few small changes, then ran it again at Big Bad Con 2019. Then we stopped being able to do larps because of a global pandemic. Come to think of it why am I kickstarting a larp in the middle of a global pandemic. Anyway. Please ignore that and back my project anyway. I'm sure we'll be back to mingling with strangers in no time haha nervous laughter.\nAnyway the game is done. I don't plan to keep designing. I might edit the copy a bit from what's available on itch, but mostly I just need to do a print layout of the game as it exists.\nI wrote down a bit of my iterative process on my itch devlog for the game.

It is inspired by Hallmark and Lifetime style holiday romances such as The Spirit of Christmas, Let It Snow, and A Royal Christmas but the system works equally well for romantic dramedies in the vein of Gilmore Girls and Good Witch.\nHere you will follow the denizens of a nosy small town, a tight knit group of urban friends, outsiders, and more as they mature, fall in love, strengthen their bonds with each other, and learn the meaning of the season. Enjoy the smell of espresso in the corner coffee shop, revel in the warmth of the fire at the inn down the lane, defend the community park against the plans to pave it over, and stumble over your words in front of the stranger with the sparkling eyes.\nThe game is Powered by the Apocalypse, using the same engine for many popular games and zines like Apocalypse World, Monsterhearts, and Girl Underground. With some inspiration drawn from teen drama Monsterhearts but filtered through a rosy, cozy lens, it might even be fun to say that Warmer in the Winter is Powered by the Heart. \nWarmer in the Winter is geared toward brief stories of a few sessions or even oneshots. The game contains a variety of sample side characters, locations, and scheme prompts that players can use to quickly tailor their experience or even get the creative juices flowing to craft their own cozy world with a minimum of prep time.\nThe zine includes:\nGuidelines and sample Troubles to help Matchmakers\n10 Roles for player customization\n1 Sample town for a slice of small-town life\nZine to be A5 size with final page count TBD.\nWarmer in the Winter digital Kickstarter copies will be fulfilled through DrivethruRPG.\nPossible Cover Mockup\n\nAny great holiday romance movie or series has a cast of memorable characters and iconic locations. Here's a small sample of those included in Warmer in the Winter.\nRole Examples:\n The Busybody - You\u2019re into everyone\u2019s business. Busybodies are rewarded for knowing more than anyone else and using that knowledge to bend events in their favor.\n The Dashing - You have a greater sense of noblesse oblige than others. Dashing characters have a Duty, something they perceive as bigger than themselves that they devote their life to.\n The Rival - You\u2019re going to prove that you\u2019re the best. Rivals are headstrong and often stir the pot in pursuit of their own goals and accomplishments.\nWork In Progress Interior Mockup\nPlaces round town:\n The Rosewood Inn - The coziest little B&B this side of the Appalachians. Everyone who comes to town stays here.\n Cafe Angelica - While there are other places in town to get a meal, none of them provide the same charm and downhome goodness.\n Heartstone Apothecary - The shop of our sample supernatural character, solutions for nearly any ailment can be found among the potions and crystals in this store.\n Want to know more about Zinequest, Warmer in the Winter, and what's being updated from the free beta version that we put out in 2019? Listen to the podcast episode discussing these things.\n And listen to some discussion on what makes Warmer in the Winter unique with mechanics like the Matchmaker, the supernatural character, and the upcoming addition of locations.\n\n\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about Warmer in the Winter, check out our beta copy for free on DriveThruRPG or Itch.io.\nCHANGES FROM BETA:\nTweaked terminology and corrected some phrasing. \nExpanded Supernatural Character.\nAdded Locations to help provide setting and inspiration.\n\nBackers get a copy of my new solo romance RPG built on the Second Chance System.\nThere, that\u2019s it.

That quick flash of smile.\nYou dive in with a heady rush, but will you swim or drown?\nThe Date is a solo romance RPG on a single page. It is the second  game created using the Second Guess System first used in the One White  Eye RPG. Here, the system of impending dread and self deception is  instead turned to the uncertainty and trepidation of a first date with  your new crush. All you need are a d20, a d6, and something to record  your journal entries on.\nSometimes people surprise you.\nWill Lentz is a game designer, podcaster, and standard office day job holder from The Ozarks.

Based on John Harper\u2019s minimalistic and streamlined World of Dungeons, it is designed for quick pick and play, with complementary chapters expanding the game towards longer campaigns.\nIn Noctis Labyrinth a red desert encompasses the known world. Only one bastion of civilization remains, Cardea, the last refuge of humanity; a city held together by a tyrannical ruler and the feeble alliances of a its rival factions. The characters \u2014adventurers, rebels and outcasts\u2014 are pushed towards the barren lands searching for treasure and the artifacts of ancient civilizations, deeply buried inside a maze-like series of canyons and tunnels that scar the Red Desert.\nFearsome beasts, strange demons, roaming bands of bandits and the powerful spirits that shift the sands to their whim stalk these lands, and you are charged with delving into the domains of the most dangerous spirit of all.\nThis product is a re-edition of an older version (now completely out of stock). Built upon years of experience running improvised open tables at my local community, Noctis Labyrinth is a collection of what I\u2019ve learned over time, condensed into a series of modules fit for GMs who play on the run.\nKickstarter will help me fund the translation, expansion and illustration of the game. With your backing I will be able to collaborate with editors and cartographers to release a series of modules that will give you hours of thrills and adventure.\nInside this zine you will find three modules designed for different playstyles. You can run it as is, picking which adventures better fit your gaming needs, or utilize its interconnectivity to build a full blown campaign: \nQuickstart: Finding the Singing Stone\nAt its core, this module is designed for pick and play, with streamlined procedures for you to crack it open and start running, no preparation required. Just follow the text and start the adventure.\nIt holds expanded character creation rules, a map of the labyrinth dotted with dangerous locations, a series of exciting encounters, and rules for exploring the dangerous lands of the Red Desert.\nOne-shot: the Renegade Wizard\nA one-hour one-shot module designed for time-constrained environments (like running at an event, a club, or just a very short session), the Renegade Wizard is an action scenario where tge characters have to confront a mad sorcerer who threatens to overtake Cardea, and in doing so, destroying civilization as we know it.\nIt is written as a broad encounter, with rules for fighting powerful enemies, dark magick, and strange technological phenomena. It also comes with 4 pregen characters, and a new unlockable spirit for your wizarding players.\nThis module fits easily into Finding the Singing Stone, and can be used add a climactic finale to that adventure.\nDungeon crawling: Fire-Eye Ruins\nA classic dungeon crawling adventure, filled with artifacts of a forgone era, dangerous creatures, and cryptic clues about the true origins of Cardea; the Fire-Eyes Ruin are described in depth, and designed for a slower paced, longer play.\nIn this module you will find a full map, new creatures, and rules for dungeoneering.\nAlongside the Renegade Wizard, these modules are interconnected with Finding the Singing Stone, for groups who want to delve repeatedly into the Labyrinth and play a the complete campaign.\nAccessibility:\nA clearly organized, text-only version of the game and all unlocked stretch goals will be available to facilitate text-to-reader apps alongside your rewards.\n200 copies print run\nDue to some bad experiences with Print on Demand services, I have opted to do a limited 200 copies print run.\nThe physical version of Noctis Labyrinth will be a 64 pages long black and white zine (more on that later). \nIf you chose to pledge for the physical copy, the domestic US shipment will be covered in the reward. Any international shipping must be paid by the backer (yes, even mine). As a South American creator I completely understand if you cannot afford shipping outside the US and wholeheartedly recommend you go for the digital version instead.\nT-Shirts?!\nYes. This is a very ambitious project, and for that I would need every penny I can get. But it\u2019s not like I want to leave you empty handed, so to that end I decided to partner with Basilisk Online to handle t-shirts PoD printing.\nPledging at this level will get a discount code at BasiliskOnline.NET/shop to redeem an exclusive Noctis Labyrinth t-shirt. You would only have to cover shipping!\nNoctis Labyrinth contains a series of modules built for World of Dungeons by John Harper \u2014a free, streamlined Powered by the Apocalypse sword & sorcery fantasy game\u2014. On top of that, Noctis Labyrinth offers the following expansions:\n PbtA compatible moves for exploration and adventure, with advanced rules for travelling, fighting, and helping your fellow companions face the dangers of the Red Desert.\n Expanded character creation rules that will guide your group to make rounded characters who will be intertwined with the weird world around Noctis Labyrinth and the great City of Cardea.\n A new character class: the Reliquarian, adventurers trained in deciphering ancient relics, tinkering with strange schematics, and discovering the archeological secrets hidden inside the Labyrinth.\n Quests to hook your players into exposing their characters to the threats of the Red Desert, face the dangers of the Labyrinth for silver and glory, and get involved with the machinations of Cardea\u2019s most influential factions.\n Adventuring locations, organized on a map (beautifully drawn by the talented Vandel Arden) that showcases the maze-like canyons of the Labyrinth, dotted with mysterious ruins and inhabited by dangerous creatures that stalk it\u2019s darkened corridors. \n Exciting encounters with the beasts, vandals, and spirits that populate the Red Desert, fully described and stat-blocked for you to drop upon the unsuspecting characters.\nLike most Powered by the Apocalypse games, these rules can be easily retrofitted into your current campaign, or compatible interact with moves from your favorite games, in case you want to expand on the Labyrinth.\nAs a throwback to classic fantasy adventure games, World of Dungeons\u2014 and by extension Noctis Labyrinth \u2014can be adapted to other old school games of your choice with a little tinkering.\nU$D 2800 Extra map: Fire-Eye Ruins\nReaching the first stretch goal would let me commission Vandel Arden with another beautiful map: a full fledged dungeon for your characters to explore. Although the map is already underway, as for now I am paying it out of pocket, so, fingers crossed!\nU$D 3500 Full color PDF\nFollowing a classic zine format, Noctis Labyrinth is meant to be printed on black ink over white or colored paper. However, a full color version will help Noctis Labyrinth hit that weird-fantasy vibe; bringing a bright, psychedelic palette to the weird creatures, outlandish adventurers, and strange landscapes that constitute the Red Desert.\nThe full color version will be a digital-only alternative version. \nU$D 4000 Supplement: Cardea, City of Dominion\nA companion PDF to Noctis Labyrinth, Cardea, City of Dominion describes the greatest and last bastion of humanity.\nInside you will find:\nA ton of adventure hooks; \nAn intertwined web of rival factions to spur further intrigue; \nExpanded rules on magic and spirits; \nMore creatures and adventuring locations; \nAnd rules for your characters to set up a base of operations and spend their hard earned coin.\nA great supplement to support longer campaigns and consecutive delvings into the Labyrinth.\nU$D 4500 Tharsis, the City of Liquid Fire\nDid I say Cardea was the last bastion of human civilization? Well, I lied: far beyond the Labyrinth the secret city of Tharsis has harnessed the power of fire to create a perfect utopia. Or that\u2019s what it seems. \nA technologically advanced civilization prospers under the watchful eye of the God Heads, a cabal of ancient artificial intelligences that control every aspect of human life: will you endure their ironclad rule? or will you rebel from your inhuman masters?\nTharsis, the City of Liquid Fire describes this secret settlement, while adding more adventure hooks and two new character classes: the Mutant and the Pyromancer.\nU$D 5000 Colored paper copies!\nThis is the true vision I had for Noctis Labyrinth: a beautiful, color coded physical version. Each module would be printed in rich black ink over a different set of colored paper to both help you navigate the book and convey each chapter's personality.\nThis is the most ambitious project I have run, and will love to deliver a striking zine into your hands. Getting to this stretch goal would upgrade the black and white version into it's true potential. \nAs mentioned before, this will be a limited 200 copies run, meaning that unless some kind of miracle happens, only 200 physical copies of Noctis Labyrinth will exist. \nNo project can materialize on its own, and I'm very fortunate to count with the support of an awesome team of artists, writers and promoters with years of experience in the industry. Let's hear from them:\nMordite Press is a sinister cabal of artists,  designers, and dungeon crawl enthusiasts whose previous successful Kickstarter campaigns include the ongoing Grind zine and the The Vagrant's Guide to Surviving the Wild for the Torchbearer RPG. \nThey've fulfilled several successful Kickstarter campaigns and have half a dozen published works under their belt, putting thunder and metal towards fulfilling their loyal acolytes' wishes. Though mysterious and unknowable, they must be trusted. \nMordite Press will be handling distribution, store the print run and fulfilling all physical rewards.\nYou can discover more about their work by following their blog, and buy their games at DriveThruRPG.\nMarx Shepherd (they/he) is a tabletop roleplaying game designer, editor and project lead, as a freelancer and for the San Jenaro CoOp.

See a free example adventure in the setting here!\nDesigned to be droppable into almost any campaign, this is a setting that focuses on being evocative over exhaustive. This will be broadly usable with any old school system as well as 5e. The focus is not just on the fantastical world, but on what that means to the players and how it interacts with their beliefs. \nWhy does this opaque slime remind you of home? As it plops to the cavern floor, it wiggles with life. Its movements become serene, reminding you of your mother. Eyeless it stares then mouthless it chirps, a soothing tone reminiscent of your grandfather. The chirp turns to a song. The song of your ancestors.\nUnion Organizer\nOur Vale of Discontent details a community on the brink of war with itself. Two tribes brought to conflict over their legacies. While the players may choose sides, the focus is not on war but on community. \nThe Pingks, named for the tinkling sound of glass, have pushed the power of wind and glass to new frontiers in their mountain homes. Led by the resolute Condis Silico, they have kept dominion over those in the valley, the Drpock, and crushed their recent rebellion. Condis wants nothing more than to reclaim the peak her ancestors lost, regardless of how it tears apart everything around her. She doesn't understand what truly haunts the peak, or the manipulation that lurks around her.\nThe Drpock, named for the sound of dripping water, are trying to rebuild and meet greater tribute demands from the Pingks. They have abandoned cultural rules around business and given ever greater power to industry. Even the oozes, a manifestation of their stories, have become commodities to be exported. They pull more heat from the ground and earth from their mines; how much longer can they sustain this pace?\nThe Fwoom, named for the sound of their vacuums, are the workers who brave the caves and harvest the oozes. As hardships grow so do their demands for justice. The continual escalation and the refusal by the company to address their concerns means that it won't be long before they must take up arms.\nThe KRRKT, named for the sound of a reloading rifle, are a mounting resistance dissatisfied by all sides. They strike at night and wield weapons of clay long forgotten. They want peace and they want it to be fair for all.\n\nWill the adventurers ally themselves with the Pingks and Silico\u2019s vanity project, band together with the Drpock with their ooze-merchandising enterprise, or join forces with the discontent uprising from both tribes?\nOur Vale of Discontent is a 36-page self-contained adventure with no fixed settings. It is designed to be dropped into an existing campaign or run as a one-shot. Broadly compatible with most fantasy or modern settings, the zine contains:\nXP systems centered around building community\nDescriptions of both tribes, the ooze harvester union, and the bubbling resistance\nA dynamic escalation system to make the events that unfold your own\nOozes, given character and life\nA description of the valley and surrounding mountains\nA guide to unions and organizing within RPG worlds\nMethods of introducing solarpunk technology to your game\nRandom tables for NPC relationship generation, flora,  and more.\nStats for NPCs and creatures compatible with OSR / 5e games\nPingk Chief\nFinal size: 5.5\" x 8.5\" \nPrinted with Mixam \nInterior: 120gsm uncoated\nExterior: 250gsm uncoated \nPDF will have hyperlink and bookmarks\n $750: Funded\n $1500: Additional artwork \n $4000: Page count goes up to 48!\nWRITING: Seth Treber and Franky Stein are both long-time members of the RPG community, recently venturing into OSR.

The time passed, and they became a myth known as the four Tezcatlipocas.\nNow a new evil arises plotting to take over the world, starting with Mexico City. The descendants of the guardians of old, foreseeing the coming disaster if evil forces are left unmatched, searched the land for four worthy individuals to become the Mexica Sentai Tezcaranger. \nTezca Sentai is a tabletop role-playing game for two to five players, one game master, known as evil leader, and the tezcas, collectively known as sentai. The evil leader will send monsters to take over the city, and the sentai has to defeat each monster until they save the world.\nThis project will be a black and white 52+ pages zine in A5 format, with additional tools available for digital download to make the game easier to play. The zine will be divided into a Sentai section and an Evil Leader section. It will contain all the rules, powers, and everything else you need to play, except for some six-sided dice.\nLayout mockup\nThe Setting\nSeasonal Play\nThe game is played as if it were a season of a popular tv show. The evil leader has a hidden plan that tries to accomplish using different monsters each week. The tezcas must thwart this plan while facing the internal turmoil that arises in each episode.\nAs the season advances, the tezcas will improve their powers until they defeat the evil leader in a final climactic battle.\nTezca blue suit and helmet design\nThe Sentai\nThe heroes of the game. Each of them will take the role of a tezca and use their power to defend the city against the forces of evil.\nThe tezcas are inspired by Super Sentai and Power Rangers tropes mixed with the myth and powers of the four Tezcatlipocas from Aztec mythology. They are:\n Tezca Red - The guardian of the east, the crimson Coyote, wielder of the powers from Xipe Totec\n Tezca Blue - The guardian of the south, the brave Hummingbird, wielder of the powers from Huitzilopochtli\n Tezca Black - The guardian of the north, the smoking Jaguar, wielder of the powers from Tezcatlipoca\n Tezca White - The guardian of the west, the feathered Snake, wielder of the powers from Quetzalcoatl\n Tezca Pink - The guardian of Twilight, the guide Axolotl, wielder of the powers from Xolotl.\nSentai members will have to learn to work as a team and overcome conflicts that may arise between them. Any unsolved conflicts will reflect on the team dynamics making their superheroic actions harder.\nThe Evil Leader\nThe evil leader is the opposition of the tezcas, and their objective is to complete their evil plan to take over the world by the end of the season. They control minions, elites, and monsters of the week against the tezcas.\nRoboCroc, an elite from the technologic forces of evil.\nAn evil leader will be able to choose between three themes on which to base their monsters.\nTechnologic. Enhanced with high tech and lasers, gadgets, and metallic armor. The monsters from the evil forces of this theme are robots, cyborgs, and androids.\nOrganic. Beings evolved into more powerful and menacing creatures. The monsters from the evil forces of this theme are mutated animals, chimeras, and sentient plants.\nMagic. The arcane forces boost the abilities of this army of evil. The monsters from the evil forces of this theme are mythological creatures, wizards, and fallen knights.\nTezca black suit and helmet design\nGame System\nThe system is inspired by Forged in the Dark \"fiction first\" approach and team mechanics with changes to keep the superhero flavor.\nWhenever a character wants to do something, and there is uncertainty about the result of their action, they must make an action roll to see how it turns out. The player must state what their goal is and how they want to accomplish it. Then, the evil leader shows the difficulty of the action, and the player rolls the dice.\nAction Roll\nFirst, the characters must state their goal, will they stop the minions from reaching the civilians by fighting? Or maybe they can distract them first? Perhaps tezca black can use their illusion powers to create a diversion. They roll 3d6 and check against their action rating to see if they score a hit.\nSuccess Bar\nThe success bar is a new mechanic, and it represents how well an action was carried on. The more hits you get, the better, and you even might get special effects.\nSentai Points\nMaking poses during the combat, saying catchy phrases, and supporting your team earn you sentai points. Sentai points can be used to improve rolls, heal yourself, improve your damage, and many other things.\nThe Monsters\nAll monsters have a dice rating and success difficulty. The stronger the monster, the more hits the tezcas need to face them. The monsters have a dice pool representing their life and fighting ability. As they take hits from the tezcas, this pool shrinks until they flee the scene or are destroyed at the end of the episode.\nNote: The system will not include giant mecha fights. Although we would have loved to, the space available on the zine is limited, and we didn't want the mecha fights to feel just as any of the other fights with a skin on top. Depending on the success of this zine, we might release in the future a mecha fight supplement for this project or an independent mecha inspired game compatible with this one.\nTezca white suit and helmet design\nActual Play \nAll backers will get a digital copy of the Tezca Sentai zine rulebook, the four tezca playbooks, the evil leader playbook, and any open stretch goals.\nBackers of the Super Mode pledge level or higher will also get a print on demand of the Tezca Sentai zine rulebook. You will need to pay for the printing of the game at DriveThruRpg. The estimated cost is less than 2.5 USD for each printed copy.\nCommunity Copies\nWe know that not everyone has the monetary means of buying the game. Money can make games inaccessible to marginalized people, and we want to help those in this situation. We are offering discounted copies in the True Companions pledge level; this includes the same as the Roll Call pledge level. If you cannot pay for the game during the campaign, we plan to have community copies available after the game launches.\nDuring the campaign, any backer that pledges at the Team Finisher level adds five more copies to the community pool, allowing us to give the game at the discounted rate without affecting our small co-op's finances.\nStretch Goals\n750 USD~15000 MX: UNLOCKED - Campaign funded\n1246 USD~25000 MX: UNLOCKED - 5th Tezca, Tezca Pink\n1746 USD~35000 MX: UNLOCKED - Extra evil plan scenario for the Evil Leader\n2256 USD~45000 MX: LOCKED - 6th Tezca, Tezca Green\nMore Coming Soon \nTezca red suit and helmet design\nWe will be fulfilling this zine through DriveThruRPG. Axo stories used this in the past for Maze and delivered the PDFs and the print at cost samples.\nWhen the zine is proofed and ready, you will get a discount on your account that allows you to download the zine for free. When the print at cost code is ready, you will get a code that will enable you to purchase the zine at the cost of printing. Then you put your address and pay shipping charges during checkout.\nDriveThruRPG offers international shipping around the world. Make sure to check their page to estimate the shipping to your location. Since this is a zine project, the print cost is estimated to be around 2-3 USD.\nThis system allows us as creators from Mexico to get you a physical book without increasing costs due to money conversions and rates.\nSergio Ake - Axo Red, Game designer/Project management\nA long-time Power Rangers fan and a recent Super Sentai fan, he loves superheroes in general and tries to keep a positive attitude.

You sit in the tavern before you embark on your journey and hear the tales of those who claim to have been beyond the edge. A few have scars. Some have poorly drawn maps they want inordinate amounts of money for. Most are drunk and run their mouth. You listen and make notes in the hope it might save your life, or better yet, make your fortune.\nKey points:\nproduce a map live at the table with your players\nfill it with rumour and adventure\nthe GM gets the accurate version\nloads of random tables\n\n\nHave You Heard About The Beast?\nHave You Heard About the Beast? info\nHave You Heard About the Beast? is a game of tavern rumours and hearsay. More often than not it turns out to be entirely true.That beast the drunk saw? Every bit as foul as he said.It\u2019s all about creating ludicrous encounters with beasts for oneshots or campaign play. \nYou can hear an actual play of HYHATB over on the Party of One Podcast. This is a great example of how the game can create an encounter and turn it into something special with the collaboration of the players.\nHYHATB is already available to buy via itch.io, this campaign is to fund an artwork update and print run.

His ink work really evokes the feeling we want for the game. We'll have some art previews available as soon as we have them.\nStretch Goals\nTLDR; not really.\nStretch Goal #1 - double what we're paying our artist. If we hit about 800GBP we'll be able to do this.\nStretch Goal #2 - stickers and cool bookmarks / art prints. If we get north of 1000GBP we'll be able to fund printing some cool little extras that'll go in backers' envelopes for free. They won't be exclusive, but backers will get more than when this stuff hits retail.\nStretch Goal #3 - at the dizzy heights of 1500GBP we'd start looking at getting art/layout/maps commissioned for We Sail Beyond The Edge.\nStretch Goal #666 - if we make a cool million (GBP/USD, it doesn't really matter) we'll buy a remote log cabin and whittle effigies of our enemies.
