Today, this new home offers opportunity and peril. Remnants of ancient civilizations hold dangerous knowledge and forbidden power. Your people build settlements on new worlds, but those places rarely offer a safe haven. Conflicts often rage between people and factions. Pirates prowl the spaceways in search of easy prey. Baneful creatures and dark forces dwell on corrupted planets and in the abyssal void between stars.\nEncounter creatures both wonderous and horrifying (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nThe default tone for Starforged is human-centric science fiction on a perilous frontier. This is a scavenged future, with starships cobbled together from salvage. People cling to survival on inhospitable worlds and in remote space stations. Much has been forgotten or lost.\nVisit Remote Settlements on perilous worlds (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nIt's a dangerous life for anyone living in the Forge, and doubly so for the Ironsworn\u2014those adventurers bound to sworn quests.\nSwear iron vows and see them fulfilled or forsaken (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nInspiration comes from the the quest-driven adventures of The Mandalorian, the lived-in aesthetic and outer-rim locations of the original Star Wars trilogy, the workaday exploits of Firefly, the isolated suspense and industrial grittiness of Alien, the desperation and retro-tech of the modern reboot of Battlestar Galactica, the mysticism of Dune, and the cosmic mysteries and class struggles of The Expanse. It's all blended together into a heady stew of perilous sci-fi adventure, and topped with a dollop of Guardians of the Galaxy gonzo.\nMost aspects of the setting can be adjusted to your preferences. The campaign launch exercises offer inspiring prompts and guidance to immerse you in a galaxy of your own creation. \nThe Art\nStarforged is packed with amazing illustrations by lead artist Joshua Meehan. Josh composites photos, textures, 3d objects, and hand-painted elements to create a vibrant, cinematic rendering of the people, places, and perils of the Forge.\nSet off on perilous expeditions (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nJosh uses the Starforged oracle tables and generators to help build the unique subjects and aspects of each illustration. The art is directly inspired by the game!\nDevelopment process for an Ironsworn: Starforged illustration - from initial concept to finished piece (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nExplore mysterious precursor sites (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nIt's a perilous galaxy, so consider bringing an ally (Art by Joshua Meehan).\nFace deadly foes in high-action battles (Art by Joshua Meehan)\nThe System\nStarforged is true to Ironsworn's roots, tuned to fit the spaceborne setting, while incorporating experience and feedback from years of development and play. \nIf you're new to Ironsworn, here's a summary of how it works.\nThree Ways to Play\nLike it's predecessor,  Ironsworn: Starforged offers three ways to play.\n Guided: One or more players take the role of their characters, while a guide moderates the session.\n Co-Op You and one or more friends play together to overcome challenges and complete quests. A guide is not required.\n Solo: You portray a lone character driven to fulfill vows in a dangerous galaxy. Good luck!\nYour Character\nThe Starforged playscape, with print-and-play asset cards and character sheet.\nYour character in Starforged is composed of stats and trackers. These elements help you determine the outcome when you perform risky actions.\nAs you complete quests, make discoveries, and form bonds, you gain experience. You spend this experience to add assets\u2014vehicles, modules, paths, companions, and deeds\u2014which deepen your abilities and options.\nCharacter creation is fast and flexible, with a guided exercise to help define your background, resources, expertise, and goals.\nMoves\nMoves are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or question. There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations you encounter in Starforged. \nFor solo and co-op play,  moves help resolve your actions and trigger new opportunities and complications. For guided play, moves take an active role in the conversation between the guide and the other players.\nSample move from Starforged.\nIronsworn: Starforged moves are inspired by the innovative, fiction-first mechanics of the Apocalypse World system created by D. Vincent Baker and Meguey Baker.\nMomentum\nThe momentum meter is one of your character's most important mechanical attributes.\nMomentum is a special mechanic which is core to playing Starforged.  You can gain momentum as an outcome or option when making moves. This represents securing advantages, acquiring new insight, and making progress in your quests. You lose momentum when you suffer a cost which causes a delay or puts you at a disadvantage.\nYou can use momentum to gain a decisive result \u2014 or avoid dire failure \u2014 on a critical move.\nAction Roll\nWhen you make a move representing a risky or uncertain action, roll three dice at once:  An action die (D6) and two challenge dice (D10). Add your relevant stat and any bonuses to your action die. This is your action score.  Then, compare your action score to each of the challenge dice and check for a strong hit, weak hit, or miss. The move will tell you how to interpret the result.\nThere are three possible outcomes for the action roll:\n Strong Hit: Your action score beats (is greater than) both the challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.\n Weak Hit: Your action score beats only one of the challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.\n Miss: Your action score doesn't beat either challenge die. You fail, or must make serious concessions\nThe Oracles\nStarforged Oracles are random prompts and generators which help answer questions in solo or co-op games, or provide creative backup for the guide in guided play. They are an inspiration engine--ready to introduce amazing locations, surprising revelations, and dire challenges to your Starforged campaign.\nMockup of oracle tables within the Starforged rulebook.\nIf you loved the oracles in Ironsworn, you'll find much more to love here. It's an entire galaxy of possibilities! Plus, these tables are largely system agnostic and can be paired with other sci-fi systems. \nStarforged oracles are included in the Preview Edition, which is an immediate reward for backing this campaign.\nShipping Info\nThe pledge levels do not include shipping. After the Kickstarter concludes, you will pay shipping for any physical rewards through the pledge manager. \nHere is a list of shipping estimates by region. \nContiguous USA: $11-$16\nEU/UK: $20-$25\nNorway/Switzerland: $33-$41\nCanada: $20-$25\nAustralia: $21-$25\nNew Zealand: $21-$34\nChina, Macao, Hong Kong: $12-$17\nRest of Asia: $24-$36\nAll Other Countries: $57-$120\nWe are customs-friendly in the UK/EU and many other regions! Check the FAQ for details.\nPledge levels and the shipping fees above do not include VAT. If VAT fees apply in your region, you will be charged those fees in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. However, we want to alleviate these charges as much as we can,  so we will cover 50% of your VAT fees!\nLegacy Add-Ons\nIn collaboration with DriveThruRG, we are offering Ironsworn books and cards as add-on rewards during this campaign. These materials are not completely compatible with Starforged, but include mechanics, tips, and guidelines which might help enrich your Starforged campaigns. Plus, they allow you to experience vow-driven quests in the perilous fantasy setting of the Ironlands. These are the existing editions of these books and cards, and are not new versions or reprints.\nThe bad news: Shipping on these legacy items is managed separately through DriveThruRPG, and shipping cannot be combined with physical Starforged rewards. \nThe good news: You'll receive your reward codes after this Kickstarter campaign ends. You can order your legacy books and cards at that time, rather than waiting for release of Starforged. \nAs a thank you for supporting Starforged, printed legacy add-ons are discounted from current prices by about 15-20%. You can select these add-ons when choosing your backer level. If you add a legacy item to your pledge, you'll receive a code to purchase that item from DriveThruRPG for the cost of production and shipping.   Check this page at DriveThruRPG for current estimated shipping costs.\n Ironsworn Print Edition - Set off on perilous quests with this 270-page core rulebook. Winner of a Gold ENNIE award! \n Ironsworn Asset Deck (Printed Deck) - Upgrade your Ironsworn playscape with a deck of printed asset cards.  \n Ironsworn: Delve - With a vast array of new options and tools, Ironsworn: Delve is the perfect companion for your Ironsworn campaign.

They have experience with fulfillment and logistics, and will help ensure a smooth delivery for our valued backers.\n\nBecause this project involves a larger team than previous Ironsworn products, we may encounter delays due to a specific individual's availability. We will put measures in place to ensure that no one (including Shawn) is an indispensable resource that would cause a failure to deliver. We will keep the backers informed about what is happening with the project, and will provide regular preview releases of the book as it is developed. \n\nWe may also encounter delays due to unexpected issues with production and shipping. Working with our fulfillment partners, we will make our best effort to identify and resolve any issues before they impact the backers. \n\nShawn has always believed in open and transparent communication with Ironsworn fans, and this project will be no exception.

The book will feature the beautiful art work of  Joel Bisaillon,  brought to you by New Comet Games, the same people who brought you the award-winning Call of Cthulhu book Devil's Swamp.\nCorsairs of Cthulhu is a rules and setting supplement to the Call of Cthulhu role-playing game and focuses on the period between 1650 and 1730 CE. Your keeper can set up your investigators as crew on a pirate or privateer ship, freelancers in one of the Caribbean ports who love the gold doubloon more than a foreign governments rule, or even provide your investigators with their own ship. Working together the investigators must face evil Mythos, real and imagined. Curses left by ancient civilizations and hidden nightmares around the world.\nThe golden age of piracy is a time of spreading empires. England, France, Spain, Italy as well as several other smaller countries are planting their flags and colonies on any piece of land they can find. Empires rise and fall, Spanish ships are hauling new found gold from the new world back to Spain and ships are lost to pirates and storms regularly. Governments authorize privateers to sail under their flag but can raise the black when needed.\n There are new skills, new professions, famous NPCs and new weapons that the investigators must learn to use if they want to survive against not only the dangers of the Mythos, but also against disease, dehydration, sea monsters, warships, and other pirates.\nCorsairs of Cthulhu is not just a setting book anticipated to be approximately 360 pages, but also contains a full campaign, The Map of the Astronomer. This campaign will take your investigators to ports unknown, fantastical lands out of this world and come face to face with some of the most dangerous Elder Gods and dark creatures ever faced. Can anything prepare the investigators for the finale and the most terrifying deity of all time.\nMany of the adventures could be run as standalone, but it is designed as a full campaign. Your ship and ports of call will provide replacement investigators as needed. \n $10,000 FUNDED (UNLOCKED!) \n $13,000 Add Silk Ribbon Bookmark (UNLOCKED!) \n $16,000 Add 4 More Art pieces (UNLOCKED!) \n $20,000 Add 2nd Pirate Port of Call (UNLOCKED!) \n $25,000  Add Player Characters (UNLOCKED!) \n $30,000 Add 3rd Pirate Port of Call (UNLOCKED!) \n $35,000 Add 4 More Art pieces (UNLOCKED!) \n $40,000 Add 2 Adventure Plot Hooks (UNLOCKED!) \n $45,000 Add extra ship layout Map (UNLOCKED!) \n $50,000 Add 2 More Adventure Plot Hooks (UNLOCKED!) \n  $55,000 We're adding material for the Pulp Cthulhu\u2122 source-book!

A roleplaying love-letter to off-beat sci-fi, vintage music, and cooperative old-school styled roleplay, Orbital Blues allows you to play out rules-light tabletop adventures in the style of space westerns such as Cowboy Bebop, Firefly and Guardians of the Galaxy.\nStepping into the shoes of Interstellar Outlaws, players band together to form Crews, and navigate a hard-going, gig-economy living on the fringes of a space-faring society.\nDeveloped on the critically acclaimed rules-lite system of Best Left Buried, Orbital Blues uses a simple D6 based system with 3 basic stats - MUSCLE, GRIT, and SAVVY - to handle rolls and uncertainty - putting the narrative and relationships of the player characters at the heart of play without the baggage of hefty mechanics, classes or roles. \nIn addition to the three core stats, characters also have GAMBITS, and TROUBLES. Gambits are a measure of a character's special talents or unique abilities, whilst Troubles track the heartbreaks, set-backs and blues that Interstellar Outlaws gather around them on their adventures in a difficult universe.  With these simple values and a wealth of gambits and troubles in the core book, players can build a wide variety of unique, storied characters to explore the Frontier Galaxy. \nWorking together, Crews generate a scrappy ship to call home, and must balance their Credits & Debts  in order to stay afloat. Whether it's knowing how they'll pay for a bowl of bell peppers and beef, or where they'll find another clip for their 9mm, the session-by-session play of Orbital Blues is driven by  the rollercoaster lives of Interstellar Outlaws and the work they have to constantly seek out.\nWhether it's hauling salvage across back-water systems or getting boots on the ground sniffing out the Frontier Galaxy's most dangerous bounties, the core book of Orbital Blues is brimming with generators, adventure hooks, play prompts and even a sand-box setting for storytellers to get memorable campaigns going, whilst player characters contend with their own interpersonal relationships and troubles. \n\nOrbital Blues is a 120-Page Trade 6\"x9\"Hardback Book,  with writing and creative direction from Sam Sleney and Zachary Cox, furnished with stunning art from Josh Clark and layout work from Lone Archivist. Edited by Jared Sinclair, Orbital Blues is tight, stylish roleplaying package for all your lo-fi, sci-fi needs. \nWe're printing Orbital Blues with two alternative covers; the standard Day cover, saturated with the big blue sky and the desert dust,  and a Kickstarter-exclusive night-mode cover for those who like to keep their book collections subtle and sophisticated. \nDay Cover\n*WIP - As a Kickstarter Exclusive we really want this one to shine...\nWe use a size slightly larger than A5, Trade (6\" x 9\") across all of our books, to help us stuff more goodness into each page. The hardcover books are planned to be offset, allowing us to feature higher-quality paper, smyth-sewn bindings and all kinds of bells, whistles and ribbons with additional funding.\nThe internals of the book are being beautifully laid out by Lone Archivist, incorporating art, text and tables seamlessly into visually stunning and easy to navigate pages and spreads.\nSpread pages from Crew Ship Generation.\nA spread from The Sutler System, a sandbox adventure included in the core book.\nAs for shipping physical books,  US Distribution will be handled via Exalted Funeral, and the UK & RoW distribution will be handled in house by the SoulMuppet Publishing team. If the campaign is successful and exceeds expectations, we've got specialist fulfilment contractors in place to help fulfil and navigate shipping.\n For backers who pledge for the PDF version, we\u2019ve successfully distributed files via DriveThruRPG and Kickstarter previously and are confident we can do it again.\n\nThis campaign aims to fulfil orders for a print-run of Orbital Blues. At the time of writing, the manuscript is finished, gone through extensive playtesting with a public playtest beta, and is currently being laid out - we're just looking to get it finalised and printed in the quality it deserves, and into your hands. We have pledges for the core book at .PDF and Physical Hardback tiers to deliver on this plan.  \nFollowers of SoulMuppet Publishing know the work and care that's been put into our flagship game, Best Left Buried. With Orbital Blues, we're looking to do the same for sci-fi roleplaying as we did for dark fantasy roleplaying with BLB. We want to make a modern, robust,  and affordable game with a lifetime of support and releases.  Once this Kickstarter funds, we'll immediately start enacting plans to give this game the same longevity, support and accessibility that Best Left Buried enjoys.\nTo stay true to the vintage music roots that inspired the game, we've also collaborated with musician and tabletop writer Chris Bissette to create a  cassette tape LP of music from the universe of Orbital Blues, with Chris performing as the fictional band The Deltas. The tape comes beautifully packaged in a crimson red rave case with an small adventure on the case insert. You can pick the tape up with your book in our Bounty Hunter pledge.\nIf you're eager to dive into our visions and the sounds of Orbital Blues, Creative Director Sam has compiled a living playlist of music, containing tracks and artists that inspired the writing, creation and atmosphere of Orbital Blues.\n Music has been a huge influence in the writing of Orbital Blues, and Sam has curated this playlist to reflect the sounds and styles that have imbued the project with so much life. We have no affiliation with any of the artists in this playlist (though if anyone knows anyone, hook us up... - S) and it's purely a curation of tracks that inspired the making of the book. You can listen and follow on spotify here, and you can expect updates to the playlist whenever we have pen to paper in the future.\n\nWith Orbital Blues already sitting pretty as a completed product, and now funded, the only way is up. We're looking to support Orbital Blues as a flagship game here at SoulMuppet Publishing, and we know the best way to do that is with more adventures and expansions to the core book. Along with additional art and higher production values, each incremental amount raised for this campaign after we hit goal will fund further material from guest writers. Depending on how far we go after funding, we'll also look at adding additional tiers with extra merch. Keep an eye on the tracker below!\nOnwards and upwards, and as we approach the final 24 hours of this campaign, we're setting our sights on one last stretch goal - an upgrade to the cassettes that so many of you have pledged for. How much can you upgrade a 60 year-old storage medium, we hear you wonder. Well, at 700% funding we'll be;\nAdding Limited Edition Orbital Blues Guitar Picks to each Cassette\nPutting more content on the inlays\nAdding an A6 Tri-fold Scenario to every Cassette\nWe're looking into ensuring the Cassettes are of the highest quality, so even if you don't have a tape player, they will still make for stylish display pieces in their own right. Currently we're looking at BandCDs to fulfil the cassette prints, and you can see a portfolio of their work below - we're confident the Orbital Blues Cassette will be a gorgeous compliment to an already stunning game.\n\nUpon reaching \u00a360,000, we're proud to announce we'll be putting this additional funding towards adding the talented Basheer Ghouse to our roster of contributing writers on Orbital Blues, with one last job...\n The job was simple. Run the briefcase to the Rock of Tariq, make sure no-one opens it, and get the sort of pay-out that crews retire on. The journey wasn't exactly safe, but for that sort of money, who cares?\nYet when you arrived at the Rock, you found your employer dead and no-one able to pay you.\nNow half a dozen factions want the cargo, and most of them are willing to kill to get it. Now you're in a race against time. Figure out what's going on, offload your cargo, and get out of there. Or else you'll join the growing list of bodies on the infamous Rock of Tariq.\nBasheer  (@BasheerGhouse) is a writer and cultural consultant based out of San Jose, California. In addition to work for companies like Kobold Press and Rowan, Rook, and Deckard, he's independently published RPGs that range from absurdist comedy to collaborative horror. His contributions can be found in products like Alien Archive 4, Warlock Grimoire 2, and Spire: Shadow Operations, and his personal work can be found at his itch.io page.\nFor us, Basheer is delivering a pulp pressure cooker of an adventure, where Interstellar Outlaw Crews will find themselves pitted against dangerous opponents in a high-risk, high-stakes, and high-reward play of intrigue and action.\nIn reaching 50k, we're confident in announcing that a set 4 Orbital Blues dice will now be included with all Interstellar Kingpin pledges. This will not increase the price on that pledge.\nWe'll have some proofs of the dice with us within the week, but rest assured, they're just as glossy and polished as the rest of the project.\nIf you want to pick up these dice outside of the Interstellar Kingpin pledge, they'll be available in the post-campaign pledge manager for add-ons.\nUpon hitting \u00a345,000 in funding, we've added Giuliano Roverato (@KnightRamen) to our ever-growing team of contributing writers! Giuliano is a Brazilian narrative designer that lives for good food, tough choices and exploring weird dungeons forgotten on the corners of our reality. Best known for the culinary adventure, Bakto\u2019s Terrifying Cuisine, he is wondering if the post-fantasy RPG Brave Zenith will ever see the light of day. Oh, and he really wants to write a bossanova inspired adventure for Orbital Blues too, so let's hear about what he has in store for us!\n\"I want to see the golden shores of my old home, feel its warm sands on my feet, hear the bittersweet melodies, the ones sang to me in bedtime stories by sobbing workers. Day and night the people of Tradis station toil away, forced to clean the planet-side wasteland that the corp calls the \u201cfuture of living.\u201d\nWe are tired, angry and dying. We have nostalgia for a home that is unknown to us. This is not a strike. This a call for help. Bring us home, outlaws. Chega de Saudade.\"\n\nIn Giuliano's stirring exploration of themes of home, nostalgia, place and being, Interstellar Outlaw Crews will visit Tradis station and discover the meaning of Saudade, know the plight of its workers, and be tempted by corporate money beyond their wildest dreams. Here, you can\u2019t save everyone.\n\nThought-provoking and emotive, Giuliano's pitch is one we're incredibly excited for, and we're thrilled to have him onboard.\n Music is a key part of Orbital Blues, and we want to make sure that comes across in a full and proper way. At 400% funding, we've commissioned Chris to further extend the EP Cassette by a third, adding 3 all-new, original tracks to the runtime on both the cassette itself, and in the MP3 collection. These tracks will be perfect for use as background in your games, as atmospheric cornerstones or rip-roaring soundtracks to the adventures of Interstellar Outlaws.\nAt \u00a335,000, we added the work of Tom Mecredy to Orbital Blues' roster of adventures, providing an open, sandbox-styled storyteller's toolkit adventure for your games of Orbital Blues.\nPlaceholder!\n You'll have seen Hagstrom's glossy ads, with their smiling, weather-beaten workers mopping their brows, or relaxing in sleek habitation units, surrounded by their enthusiastic families. You'll have also heard the rumours that Hagstrom's workers are actually indentured to the company, forced to pay off their passage with hard graft. Wollaston's Hold is only a jump away - spool up the drive, and find out the truth.\nAll That Glitters pitches your outlaws into a system full of trouble - a corporate cold war is about to turn hot, revolutionary workers are amassing arms to throw off their oppressive masters, and an ambitious pirate queen is looking to pull off an audacious bullion heist. Keep a hand on your gun, don't trust anyone, and you might just make it out in one piece.\n\nTom Mecredy (@TomMecredy) is a writer and game designer based in the north of England, drawing upon his passion for history and Cold War espionage thrillers to weave tangled conspiracies and revolutions across the stars.  Tom's recent work includes High Speed Low Drag, an introspective, solo-play experience about going to war and the effects it has on soldiers, and Condotto, a Forged in the Dark game about running a company of mercenaries in 14th century Italy.\nAll That Glitters adds a true sandbox experience to Orbital Blues' adventure roster, with a variety of Factions, NPCs and jobs for crews to engage with - it's a style of play that fans of games such as Blades in the Dark will be familiar with, and we're super excited to see it added it to the ever-growing library of supplemental content storytellers can utilise for Orbital Blues.\nUpon reaching \u00a330,000, we added Momatoes to our writing team! Momatoes (@momatoes) is a Filipina game and graphic designer who has written RPGs about memory, legacy, and the dear price wizards pay for their ambition. Her biggest project, ARC, is a rules-light, tension-heavy RPG that\u2019s coming to Kickstarter in 2021 and is one of Dicebreaker\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d upcoming RPGs. For her stretch goal, Momatoes plans on writing a confounding yet compelling mystery wrapped around a deeply human heart. Not a literal heart, though\u2026 unless\u2026? \nPlaceholder!\n Alexin Arius was a pioneer, an eccentric inventor who built wondrous automatons and augments. Now, decades after their disappearance, a desperate sheriff hires a crew of Interstellar Outlaws for what looks to be a straightforward bounty: track Alexin in a promising new location, the long-forgotten Everjoy space station and amusement park.\nBut not all is what it seems, and the supposedly abandoned Everjoy is steeped in endless mystery. Rust and decay run rampant - but why does the jingle still play over the stale air? No customer had set foot in its towering rides or souvenir shops for years - but why do the animatronic mascots still greet you with a smile? And the wide-eyed children who watch you from edges and corners - who are they, and what secrets lurk in the utopia they\u2019ve built?\nVisit Everjoy now, where the good times must never end.\n\nMomatoes' EVERJOY adventure will now be available in .PDF, and will be distributed, fully illustrated, along with Sinta Posadas' A STARBORN RESISTANCE, once the core book has shipped, ensuring that everyone will have a nice shiny core book to run their adventures with! We can't wait to see what Momatoes has in store for us, and what else the future may bring for Orbital Blues!\nWe've received nothing but kind words and praise for our art direction, so as such we're taking the leap to collect all the creative energies that have made this project a reality, with Wayward Stars: The Art of Orbital Blues. A coffee table art book in miniature (we're looking at 6\" x 9\" A5 horizontal) Wayward Stars will delve into the artistic process, world-building and step-by-step explorations of how a tabletop game's art is made, with words from Josh Clark.\nPlaceholder!\nA deep-dive into the worldbuilding of Orbital Blues.\nWayward Stars will be available as an add-on, or available in the WAYWARD STAR, SPACE COWBOY 2 or INTERSTELLAR KINGPIN pledge levels, and physical copies of Wayward Stars will ship alongside core books in August 2021.\nPostcards from the Frontier Galaxy were our first stretch goal,  available from \u00a315,000. These will be included free at all pledges levels of Space Cowboy and above. We're polling 12 pieces of art to decide 3 final pieces, and Bounty Hunter pledges will receive a collection of all 3. Interstellar Outlaw pledges will get 2 of the postcards, and Space Cowboy pledges will receive one.  These Print Postcards will add no additional costs to pledges or shipping. \nAt \u00a320,000 we added the talented Sinta Posadas to our writing team! Sin Posadas (@diwataMANILA) is a game designer and illustrator obsessed with the galaxy and all of its possible tragedies that lie in wait, just out of reach. \nSin has pitched us an adventure called A STARBORN RESISTANCE, which we'll be releasing in .PDF form.\nPlaceholder Cover.\nVaris X-0 was once a gleaming jewel in the crown of the Wings of Valor Confederacy. The Confederacy constructed \"Harvester Homes\" of the Scintilla Commune, a string of asteroid belts fitted onto an intra-atmospheric nuclear power harvester, home to any colonist willing to risk their necks for the promise of cheap lodging and a regular wage.  \nAfter a cheaper extraction method was found a few million light years away, the Confederacy abandoned the system, leaving the Harvester Homes to rust. These days, it's just a few Interstellar Outlaws trying to keep the place afloat: salvaging equipment, finding food and power, fighting off bandits and worse. In this delapidated backwater, communities need help to keep things afloat. But what happens when a representative of the Confederacy returns, promising to restore glory to the Scintilla? At what cost? To what end for the Confederacy? And what's in it for you?\n\nUpon reaching \u00a320,000 in funding, A Starborn Resistance began development, and will release as a .PDF adventure shortly after the release of the physical Orbital Blues core rulebook in August 2021. Should we reach levels of funding to commission a several contributing writers, we'll compile their works into a compilation for physical release later in the year.\n\nOrbital Blues is a SoulMuppet Publishing Production, but it has been brought about by a crack-team of independent talent to make something fresh & exciting. Here's the run-down on who's who.\n\nSam Sleney (@samsleney) is a freelance writer, and Creative Director for First Falling Leaf Publishing. Orbital Blues is Sam's manuscript and creative vision, born out of a lifetime love of space westerns, and being raised on the records of Bruce Springsteen in lieu of a father figure.  Together with artistic realisations from Josh Clark and the mechanical mind of Zachary Cox, Sam has fused the team's talent into the Interstellar Blues Explosion that is Orbital Blues. \n\nJosh Clark (@tinywoodsman) is an artist and creator who has worked on everything from album covers to business cards and video games to podcast art. His work can be seen in First Falling Leaf's \"Sins: Dead City \", From Sorrow To Serenity's \"Trifecta EP Project\" and in the worldbuilding booklet \"The Quiet Future\". He can be found at TinyWoodsman. As our lead artist, Josh brought the world & creative vision of Orbital Blues to life from the Day 1, and made the project what it is today. \n\nZachary Cox (@JellyMuppet) is the Managing Partner of SoulMuppet Publishing, dabbling in everything from printing, distribution, management and social media. The original creator of Best Left Buried, Zach has contributed to the mechanical writing and masterminded improvements on Best Left Buried's engine for Orbital Blues, adapting the original SRD and mechanics to perfectly accompany lo-fi, space western roleplay.\nJared Sinclair (@infinite_mao) is an editor and sometime writer of games and games-related material. His work as a writer includes Anti-Sisyphus, What's So Cool About Outer Space?, Prismot!, and The Vanilla Game. He also runs Spear Witch, an independent online bookstore specializing in small-creator game books and zines. As our editor, Jared cut the manuscript of Orbital Blues into shape, making it into a lean, cohesive and accessible book that cuts right to the heart of thematic play. \n\nLone Archivist (@LoneArchivist) is a game and graphic designer based out of Southern California. His work includes writing and design for a handful of third-party modules for games such as Mothership and Best Left Buried as well as several self-published system-agnostic game supplements. When not working on games he can be found crate-digging for a new Jazz record or adding yet another book to the TBR list. Lone is currently hard at working coalescing the manuscript, art and style of Orbital Blues into a tight, stylish and striking print. \n\nChris Bissette (@Pangalactic) is a Manchester-based game designer and musician. His game The Wretched - along with its original soundtrack - was selected as one of Tabletop Gaming Magazine's Best Games of 2020 and has spawned hundreds of games using its Wretched & Alone engine. Chris is performing as the fictional band The Deltas on their debut Cassette LP, Orbital Blues, which you can pick up alongside the core rulebook as a keynote piece. You can find Chris' music, games, and more at LootTheRoom. \n\nSin is the designer of the Planted RPG series, a small collection of tabletop rpgs where you play as sentient plants defending your homes from evil bugs. Their other works include explorations into your deepest fears in the Deep, Deep River, fanciful food trips in Lutong Banwa, and playing out the dramatics of being agents of a Tower racing against the Apocalypse in Navathem's End. They're currently working to complete Navathem's End after it was successfully funded as part of the recently concluded #OurShores Kickstarter campaign. You can find their other melancholic games here, on their itch.io page. Sin will be writing A Starborn Resistance, an adventure for Orbital Blues achieved as a stretch goal. \n\nMomatoes (@momatoes) is a Filipina game and graphic designer who has written RPGs about memory, legacy, and the dear price wizards pay for their ambition. Her biggest project, ARC, is a rules-light, tension-heavy RPG that\u2019s coming to Kickstarter in 2021 and is one of Dicebreaker\u2019s \u201cmust-play\u201d upcoming RPGs.  Momatoes will be writing EVERYJOY, an Orbital Blues adventure that we unlocked as a stretch goal.\n\nOrbital Blues began life as an internal passion project, that snowballed into release through enthusiasm and available connections in lockdown. We're looking to diversify the team for Orbital Blues with immediate stretch goals for writers and contributors from a greater wealth of backgrounds than the core team, and will be adding such individuals here once we've hired them at competitive rates. If you're interested in writing for Orbital Blues, get in touch here, with writing samples, pitches or portfolios.\n\nWe've had a few people now from various parts of the world asking for more detailed shipping information so they can make an informed decision about pledging. When you take Brexit, the global pandemic and shipping delays, and add them to the fact SoulMuppet Publishing only has experience in smaller scale print-runs from calmer times, it's been hard to make estimated guesses on the prices of shipping for a project that's shaping up to be this successful. However, we've gone away, done our homework, made some enquiries and ran some numbers, and below are our current shipping estimates.\nWe'll update this image where it appears on the main campaign body actively whenever anything changes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith our book already being in final stages of completion and this Kickstarter serving as a means of production, we don't have any concerns for the completion of this project. As we already navigated the fulfilments in previous campaigns such as Best Left Buried: Deeper and Stygian Library, we also don't have any concerns regarding deliveries and distributions.

The one people whisper about. The one that has gone unlived in for years. Sometimes a few hearty souls creep in, it is said, to see what treasures or secrets they can find. Most find nothing\u2014just an empty old house. Some return shaken. A few don\u2019t return at all.\nYou\u2019ve seen this house before. If not in this city, then in some other. You\u2019ve heard the rumors\u2014and if you haven\u2019t, well, someday they\u2019ll find you.\nWhat happens to a house when it sits alone for so many long years? What jealousies and hatreds does it quietly nurture? What whispers echo through its empty hallways? What waits, crouched within its dark rooms, hungering for the return of life?\nFor you.\nThe Darkest House is a tabletop roleplaying game (RPG) product built from the ground up for online play, with unique features that take advantage of the online environment for an awesome experience. It's compatible with the game you're playing now. In fact, it's made for it! That\u2019s because The Darkest House derives its horror from the bonds, backstories, ideals, loves, and fears your existing characters bring into it. Experiencing it will add depth to your campaign, your party, and your characters\u2014those who come out alive!\nCross the threshold. Explore The Darkest House. The experience will change and challenge your PCs, their party, and your gaming group. And you won't have to wait long: You'll  have everything you need to bring The Darkest House to your campaign in May (with extras and exclusives to follow).\nScroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House!\nThe Darkest House is a digital product designed specifically to the needs of running and playing games online\u2014and built to take maximum advantage of that mode of play. Think of it like an RPG book reimagined to make the most of the online environment. Every image and map is conveniently shareable and downloadable. Each encounter is formatted to your screen, giving you everything you need in a single view. Text for sharing with the players is easily copied with a single click. A rich network of hyperlinks makes navigation simple and intuitive. The Darkest House is as easy on the GM as the house itself is challenging to the PCs.\nUse The Darkest House in conjunction with your preferred online TTRPG platform: run your game on Zoom or Discord, or use a virtual tabletop (VTT) like Roll20 or Astral. Only the GM needs a copy of The Darkest House\u2014like a conventional RPG product, it gives the GM the information, resources, and tools to run the game, plus loads of handouts, images, and other sharable items to distribute, as appropriate, to the players.\nThe Darkest House consists of:\nThe downloadable product, containing the many dozens of rooms of the house itself. This is what the GM will primarily use during play. There\u2019s enough content for many visits to the house, and dozens of hours of play\u2014and through stretch goals the house continues to grow!\n The Darkest House: Secrets of the House in PDF, a GM's guide detailing the House's background, conversion rules, and the House Rules set you'll use as your PCs explore, and try to escape from, the Darkest House.\n The Darkest House Player's Guide in PDF, which gives players the character conversion rules and everything they need to explore (and try to escape from) the Darkest House.\nTo use The Darkest House, the GM will need a desktop or laptop computer running macOS or Windows and a broadband internet connection. Scroll down to try a preview of The Darkest House.\nHow It Works\nAlthough The Darkest House is a completely new type of product, you'll use it in basically the same way you use a typical RPG book or PDF\u2014it's just easier and has a lot more features for online play. You'll still use a VTT or videoconference platform (such as Roll20 or Zoom) to run your game. Your players won't access The Darkest House app itself\u2014like a physical adventure book, it's just for the GM. (You will share The Darkest House Player's Guide PDF, and loads of handouts, maps, and images with them, though.)\nHere's an example: Charles normally runs his games using Zoom for audio and video, and Slack for text messaging, sharing JPGs of handouts, and rolling dice. In addition, he has his game books and notes open on his desk beside him, or PDFs and other files open on his computer. When running The Darkest House, he'll use Zoom and Slack the same way, and keep The Darkest House app open on his computer in place of all those books or PDFs. He can share maps, images, and text with just a click or two, pasting them into his Slack channel as the PCs encounter new rooms, creatures, and clues.\nLaTia runs her games on Roll20. The Darkest House works the same way in that environment, with one additional advantage: LaTia can set up her encounters in advance, downloading the maps and resources before the game starts and setting them up within Roll20.\nTry It!\nWant to see how it works?

Open it, have a look at the intro page, and explore as you see fit\u2014or take this little tour:\nClick Explore The Darkest House Now on the right side of the intro page and you'll find yourself in the Boundless Room, just one example of the House's many, many rooms.\nSee the words Pried Up Floorboards on the map?

Click The Giggling Ghost at the bottom right of the screen.\nUnder the first set of boxed text, and click the Copy Text button. Return to this Kickstarter, go into the comments, and paste. That's how easy it is to copy and paste info for the players. Features like these make the most of the online environment\u2014making it an advantage instead of an impediment!\nYou can also share images and maps just as easily. Go to The Family Portrait and click Download under the handout to download the image, or \"Copy Link\" to paste the link into a chat or browser window to share it that way. You can do the same with the room map and main illustration.\nThe portrait holds the secret to escaping this particular room. Click the link to the Interior Courtyard to continue your exploration of the House.\nContinue to explore to discover the many ways The Darkest House stands apart from conventional RPG products. This preview of the app is not final and only demonstrates a small portion of The Darkest House. The final product may differ slightly.\nThat old house that everyone whispers about. That apartment at the end of the hall where no tenant ever stays for long. That strange unit in the station quarters sector, where everything seems a bit off. These are among the many entrances to the Darkest House.\nLike an invasive vine or a creeping shadow, the Darkest House insinuates itself into any universe. It is a malignant and primal force, unconcerned with the specifics of the worlds it seeps into. The Darkest House exists in our world\u2014in your world\u2014in any world. Wherever there is hunger, the Darkest House can gain a foothold. It is perfectly happy to take root in your campaign.\nOr campaigns. The house draws from the many worlds it touches. It need not pull all its victims from the same setting. Imagine an experience that gathers your favorite characters from different campaigns to work together to survive its horrors. As a product specially designed for online play, scattered gaming groups can come back together for a unique reunion experience.\nThe Darkest House\u2019s effect on character development and backstory makes it really shine when introduced to existing characters and campaigns. It will influence the quality of play for long after the characters have escaped it. \nInject the Darkest House into your ongoing campaign as a horror interlude or as a recurring encounter. It works as a standalone one-shot, but there\u2019s far more to the house than that. With many dozens of rooms (and growing, through stretch goals) adding up to 30-50 hours of game play, PCs who escape the house might stumble upon it later, seek it out to further plumb its mysteries, or find themselves drawn into it again to free themselves and their world of its darkness.\nThe house has many aspects, and there will always be more to discover.\nThe House System\nThe Darkest House isn't just compatible with the game you\u2019re already playing\u2014it was made for it! Within The Darkest House, you\u2019ll use the House System. You\u2019ll quickly and easily convert your existing characters (it takes about five minutes) and use those stats while in The Darkest House. Once the PCs emerge, your players will return to their regular setting using their regular character sheets. The House System is a sort of RPG Rosetta Stone, allowing easy translation into and out of any game system\u2014and even letting you bring characters from different games together.\nThe House System is tailored for tension and terror. With each die roll, the players roll the House Die, which might indicate that the house itself takes an action. Players can call upon the essence of the house while they're within it to turn a failure into a success, but every time they do so they accumulate personal Doom. Escaping the house with the weight of such Doom on their shoulders, characters may find themselves scarred, cursed, or haunted in all manner of disturbing ways, carrying remnants of their experience back into their home campaigns long after they've left.\nIt's possible to launch a campaign centered around the Darkest House. But that's not what the house wants. It is strongest when it reaches into an ongoing campaign to test and challenge existing characters. That\u2019s because events in the Darkest House will change characters and alter the campaign setting. The house gets its metaphorical claws into those that cross its threshold, and the house itself changes based on who those characters are, who they have loved, who they have hated, and where they have been. Characters who explore the house and make it back out are never quite the same.\nWant even deeper mysteries? More secrets? More dangers? The Devoured Halls is a separate portion of the Darkest House, with its own rooms, its own secret entrance and exit, and its own mysteries to uncover. Within this section of the house, characters might discover that perhaps the house isn't fully in control of itself\u2026 the house itself might be broken. While The Darkest House is a complete package, The Devoured Halls adds its own flavor and offers its own experience in keeping with the rest of the house. It fits in seamlessly and offers additional depth and an entirely new mini story for characters to investigate. \nThe Devoured Halls backer level includes the complete Darkest House plus the additional content in the Devoured Halls\u2014a Kickstarter exclusive available only through this campaign. Backing at this level has even more exclusive benefits\u2014you also get:\nMonte Cook's secret tour of the Darkest House: In the style of a director's commentary track, Monte takes you on a video tour of the House covering his favorite rooms. He delves into their genesis and inspiration, gives you insights into the lore behind them, and talks about how he's used them in his own games.\nThe Darkest House digital art book: The Darkest House contains dozens and dozens of illustrations, all as mysterious as they are beautiful. The Art of The Darkest House presents all of them\u2014including illustrations from the Devoured Halls\u2014in beautiful detail. Annotations by Monte and Art Director Bear Weiter accompany many of the illustrations, and several also include details or alternate versions calling out their secrets and hidden features.\nMonte Cook has designed many RPGs over his 30+ year career, including Dungeons & Dragons 3rd Edition, the Cypher System, Numenera, and Invisible Sun. He wanted to share why he he was inspired to create The Darkest House, and what design decisions he made. Check out his insights below.\nI'm Monte Cook, and I created and designed the Darkest House. I've been using the essence of it in various campaigns for years, and I thought I'd take a moment to describe why I designed it the way I have, and hopefully why you'll find it intriguing and interesting as well.\nWhy Focus on Online Gaming?\nAt Monte Cook Games, we're spread out all across the continent. We've been regularly playing RPGs on Zoom or Roll20 since well before the pandemic, as of course many gamers have. In the 21st Century, gaming online has become a standard feature of tabletop games, and the last year or so has accelerated that aspect of running and playing games to an incredible degree. Gaming online has its own challenges, but it has its own strengths as well. As a designer, I've been pondering how to not just focus on the needs of online play, but to in fact embrace online play, bringing the aspects of gaming that it does particularly well to the fore. The ability to share art, to share text, and to send individual players direct messages are just some of the things that The Darkest House not just enables but shines a spotlight upon. Meanwhile, the difficulties of online gaming, such as managing lots of information, maintaining a mood, and dealing with cumbersome mechanics are all facets of the experience that the Darkest House eases.\nWhy Focus on Cross-System Play?\nOne of the things that's been true of a lot of us over the last year is a desire to reconnect with old pals or faraway friends. If your primary means of socializing is a video conference, people a thousand miles away are no farther away than those up the street. Still, talking to your friends through a computer screen can sometimes be hard. With all the additional barriers that online gaming can create, why should game systems add another?\nThe Darkest House offers an easy way to quickly convert the essence of any character from any system into a simple but interesting character who operates within the house's own, specific rules, tailored to the experiences within. My dream is that people will use The Darkest House as an excuse to rekindle that lapsed campaign with their old gaming group separated by time and distance, regardless of what system was being used. Or, perhaps even more exciting, the GM who's got a selection of friends who never regularly game together and use different systems can take their existing characters, temporarily convert them to the House System, and all go on an exciting and challenging (or horrifying) adventure together.\nI believe that RPGs bring people together, and I hope that The Darkest House brings people together who might not otherwise get to easily enjoy each other's company. (And what better way to rekindle old bonds than in absolute terror?) \nWhy a Haunted House?\nInspired by games like Kitty Horrowshow's Anatomy, books like Mark Z. Danielewski's House of Leaves, and films like Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, I realized that the horror genre and haunted houses in particular offer unique opportunities to shine a light on characters, and RPGs are all about characters. I wanted to create an adventure that would deepen the characters even as it put them through their paces.\nWhen PCs enter the Darkest House, they'll find far more than just a haunted house. It is a crucible of sorts, where their mettle and their minds will be tested. Those who fall short will suffer heavy consequences. Those who can hold their own, however, emerge more deeply developed with a greater insight into their world, their companions, and most of all themselves. The Darkest House forces players to think about their characters' deepest fears, dreams, their families, and their faith in their friends. Encounters are designed to focus less on damage dealt or resources used and more on the personalities, past experiences, and fundamental truths of a character. And if a character is lacking any of those, the Darkest House will enable the GM and players to work together to create them, or flesh them out, as needed.\nIf you've read this far, you've very likely picked up on the fact that within the Darkest House, it's the house itself that is the enemy. I have long had a fascination with fictional places with a mind or an essence all their own. And when that essence evolves over a long period of loneliness, neglect, and exposure to darkness and suffering, it makes for a truly unique \"villain\" far different than any ghost, specter, or demon could ever hope to be. And if that location, that house, grows and seeps in both space and time, devouring the very locations and loved ones important to those that cross its doorstep, well... I don't want to get into spoiler territory. Let's just say, if nothing else, The Darkest House certainly offers some unique experiences that will create stories your players will be talking about for years to come.\nIf you choose any physical add-on items, please check our Kickstarter Redemption page for information on reward redemption and shipping costs.\n\n This project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the nineteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

Well, provided you can survive the dangers lurking just beyond the edge of the known!\nBoth in ENGLISH and ITALIAN, plus a bunch of FREE CONTENT!!\nProduced by Lightfish Games during years of design and playtest, FARSIGHT is finally ready to project players into the future!\nIts game system, evolved from the 5th edition of the most popular rpg of all time, is simple and easy to learn, but capable of giving you all the depth and details that science fiction demands.\nWith an extremely flexible character-building system, players will be able to create the heroes they want and forge their own destiny, while game masters will have at their disposal fine-tuned tools for creating endless worlds for their adventures and campaigns.\nThe game places an emphasis on the far future and the ultimate frontier of sci-fi that is space exploration, but it's designed to allow you to shape the setting to suit your style and preferences: from the most epic space-opera to the darker cyberpunk or post-apocalypse!\nIf you have always wanted to explore the future in its endless possibilities, FARSIGHT RPG is the game you've been waiting for!\nFARSIGHT RPG will be available in two languages (English or Italian), thanks to the joined efforts of professional writers and translators.\nAt the end of the campaign you will be sent a survey to provide your address and select your preferred language.\nWe are open to collaborations to localize the game in other languages, contact us!\nAll pictures are for illustraton purpose. Final products may vary due to product enhancement.\nOther Add-ons will be added if we hit their stretch golas\nIf you\u2019ve already selected a reward tier but are still interested in adding some extra items without changing your pledge level, follow the instructions below.\nClick the \u201cManage your Pledge\u201d button on the project\u2019s page.\nEdit your pledge amount adding the extra cost of the add-on(s) you want.\nConfirm and save your pledge, without changing  the tier of your original pledge.\nAfter the end of the campaign you will receive a survey to your Kickstarter e-mail, to confirm your address and to introduce you to the pledge manager. The pledge manager will enable you to choose your add-ons, to add in some more if you want, and of course to change your selection later.\nPlease note: If you select some physical add-ons starting from a PDF only pledge, you'll be charged for shipping fees. Add-ons may also increase the weight of your pledge and as a result the shipping costs (see the SHIPPING section below for more details).\nStretch Goals will expand the book contents, provide adventures and additional exlusive materials, and more! But we need your support to make this happen! Help us unlocking as many stretch goals as possible! Share the project with your friends and on social media to help us grow Farsight RPG!\nFARSIGHT RPG is based on the 5E EVOLVED game system, a carefully designed adaptation of the 5th edition rules of the world's most popular RPG to science fiction. But don\u2019t get it wrong, it is not a simple hack!\nWhile retaining the essential style of 5E, the 5E EVOLVED implements new basic mechanics, major changes and several features designed to best fit a more sci-fi oriented game style, going as far as to change the canonical ability scores and even to abandon the iconic d20 by changing the basic ability check mechanic (WHAT? Well, yes).\nBut it doesn\u2019t stop there! Here's some key features:\n\n Double twelve craziness: Instead of using a single dice (d20) to perform most checks, you will use two twelve-sided dice (2d12). Such a roll creates variety in the outcomes, with a wide range of exploits and setbacks instead of simple critical successes or failures. But don\u2019t think that\u2019s all: advantage/disadvantage, EDGE Cards and other new mechanics will bring bustle and fun on your table!\n\n Fully customizable characters: Character creation and progression is handled in a modular and versatile way, allowing players to fully customize their characters\nSeveral playable species and lots of different backgrounds.\nThree fully customizable classes: the tough DELTA, the reliable SIGMA and the enigmatic PSI.\n Characters who grow with the story: Gain fame and wealth, weave important connections, or instead mess with the wrong people and fall into misfortune! Interludes in between adventures will allow characters to use their \u201cdown-time\u201d to pursue their personal goals, to build relationships, work, trade, do research or simply to recover.\n\n Tactical and deadly combat: Combat is frenetic and merciless. Surely you are heroes, but weapons are deadly and enemies are fighting for their lives as much as you are. Strategy is key: cover, distance, position, weaponry. All of this and countless other tactical choices can make the difference between victory and defeat.\nTactic and strategy are the key to survive. Well you will also need gear, weapons... and luck!\n Gear, vehicles & starships: Can a sci-fi game don\u2019t take into account technology in all its applications? Of course not! You'll have advanced and customizable weapons, armors and tech gear of all kind, and specific rules to create and customize any kind of means of transport, from the smallest planetary vehicle to the most huge starship!\nAn old and rusty spaceship is better than no spaceship at all... Well, maybe.\nAnd if you are wondering, yes, all the 5E EVOLVED core system is released under OGL! So, if you want to learn more about it, come visit us on our WEBSITE!\nFarsight RPG is designed to adapt to any sci-fi setting you want, but its main focus is the ultimate frontier of science fiction: space exploration. \nTo give you a glimpse of these frontiers, the Corebook will include an introduction to Chronicles of the Edge, a space opera setting that we hope to expand with your help, through a series of modules and adventures unlockable as stretch goals! Here\u2019s a brief presentation of what awaits you on the verge of the Known Space!\nCenturies ago, the Collapse forced the Union to retreat to the Central Systems, forsaking large portions of the Orion Arm.  After an era of oblivion, the now called Outskirts are finally slowly re-flourishing under the influence of new interstellar nations.\nThe 79 Suns Confederation claims the title of heir to the ancient Union while the Nargor Empire expands its domain by ensuring protection and civilization under an iron fist. Meantime, the traders of the Arkead Cross roam the old stellar routes seeking for deals and the envoys of the misterious Concordate bring reason and aid wherever they can.\nWhile the Known Space is shaken by tensions and turmoils, remote planets and unreached frontiers await to be explored. Artifacts emerge from ancient times, forgotten mysteries awaits to be revealed and unknown threats lurk just beyond the Edge, where every knowledge fades into the depths of uncharted space.\nOnly pledge levels with physical rewards require shipping. Shipping fees cover adequate packaging, fulfillment center costs, and postage. We'll ship anywhere in the world and, if this campaign is successful, shipping costs will be collected after the Kickstarter campaign. We work hard to keep these costs as low as possible.\nESTIMATED SHIPPING COSTS:\n Italy.   ~4\u00a3  (~5\u20ac) (tracked)\n Europe.   ~9\u00a3  (~10\u20ac)\n US & Rest of the Wolrd.   ~13\u00a3  (~15\u20ac/18$)\nWe ship all over the world by economy mail (no tracking) but you can upgrade to a faster and tracked solution...\nINTERNATIONAL TRACKED SHIPPING UPGRADE. 9\u00a3 (~10\u20ac/12$)\nYou can add the cost of the international tracked shipping to your pledge, as per add-ons (see above).

But I've formatted a special version of the PDF that should allow anyone who wishes to print off their very own copy to go in their collection. \nPlease take time to check out all the other amazing RPGs on Kickstarter during Zine Quest, they all look amazing!\n\nNow down to business. Here is my story:\nLockdown has been tough on everyone, and people have tried to find different ways to fill their time whilst stuck in their homes. This is what led me to designing and writing Captain's Log.\nI was inspired by the classic opening moments of every episode of Star Trek TNG, and those immortal words..\n\"Captain's Log..\"\nThat always let you know, you were in for an out of this world adventure, and I wanted to simulate the fun and excitement of those missions.\n\nCaptain\u2019s Log is a solo journaling RPG where you find yourself in the command of a ship, its crew embarking on a vast mission through space. \nThe limits to this mission are defined by your imagination, and the stories you bring to life.\nPlaying the Captain's Log is simple and offers hours of creative storytelling fun.\n\nCaptain's log has two modes:\nCampaign\nA 50 entry mission journalling adventure where you will be given the scenario outline of each log entry. Each of these entries will journel a mission, a day and event of note onboard your very own ship.\nFrom there it's up to you to decide where the story goes and what twists and turns await the ship and its crew.\n\nScenario Generation\nThese are one off scenarios that can just be generated by simply using a 6 sided dice, or failing that the random number sheet located at  the end of this RPG.\nThis system will see you generate a unique combination that becomes your scenario.\nThe system will give you:\nA location\nA Plot Event\nA Subplot\nThen as with the campaign the rest is up to you. \nThese can be played in single stand alone missions, or perhaps you want to chain them together and make another campaign to take your crew on.\n \nThis project is for anyone who enjoys creative writing.\nOr perhaps someone with a simple love of SCI-FI, who doesn\u2019t know just how creative they can be.\nThe results of your \u2018Captain\u2019s Log\u2019 can be as public or as private, as long or as short as you decide. Writing each entry should be a way to challenge yourself into being creative. You might expand characters and plots over the full campaign, or might just take it one scenario at a time and see where you take your adventure.\n\nThis RPG can be played however you want, and I encourage you to be creative. \nBut every new scenario dictates an adventure, a fresh scenario for you to bring to life.\nThen with each entry you make the world around you and your characters will grow, becoming ever more vivid as you journal the history of your ship, and it\u2019s colourful crew.\nTo start the campaign:\nYou pick your crew\nYou design your ship\nYou create new alien races\nYou create a nemesis, and give them a back story\nYou decide your ships mission\nPerhaps you'll borrow ideas from mainstream SCI-FI? Or Mix multiple films and shows together to create a new larger expanded universe?\n\nYou'll decide how your adventure unfolds.\nYou are the Captain, and this is the Captain\u2019s Log.\n\n\nMy name is Matt and I live in Leeds, and I own and play more tabletop games than I should admit. You can find me on Instagram  HERE \nI'll be honest I was undecided as to if I would ever complete this RPG, let alone share it with others. From my initial idea for the RPG I've been plagued with self doubt about how this would be received, and visions of having to refund the small amount of people who actually backed it.\nBut this isn't about failure, this is about creating something I'm proud of and sending it out into the world for the purpose of saying I did. Like this RPG it's about being creative to challenge yourself. So now I can turn round and say I created something.

The last vestiges of humanity are spread out across the Coil\u2014a megastructure built over the course of multiple lost civilizations. 2-4 players will build a Coil unique to your play session and then search the remains of what they build. Reliquary is designed to be played either as a one-shot or as a longer campaign as you explore multiple layers of the Coil.\nThis game is inspired by the brutalist environments of the game NaissanceE and the manga BLAME! as well as the weird architecture found in the art of H.R. Giger and Zdislaw Beksinski.\n\nCover details and design subject to change. Art by Juan Ochoa.\n\n\nThe Coil is made up of seemingly endless strata\u2014overlapping layers of ancient buildings, artifacts, and machines. One strata may house an entire culture, while another is an uncanny beast\u2019s personal hunting grounds.\nYou live in the city of Vasq\u2014the only major human settlement known to you\u2014and the Prytanium will always pay for maps, data, and relics from past civilizations. Players create Wanderers to try and deliver them, motivated by duty, honor, or profit.\nIn progress layout mockup: design and text not final.\nIn each play session, players will build their own unique version of the Coil by creating ideas for locations, spaced out on the table to create a map. These locations, situated around the home city of Vasq, create one strata of the Coil. Players will answer additional questions about their strata and about Vasq itself to give it their own flavor.\nEach player also creates a Wanderer and chooses a Perspective\u2014answering unique prompts through which details can be added to the world. Wanderers are our player characters, and discoveries will be interpreted through their eyes.\nPlay consists of moving between locations to explore them, interpreting what these locations hold based on playing card suits and values, and rolling dice to salvage supplies or information. Players will encounter new cultures, signs of past civilizations, artificial landmarks, and hostile entities lurking among the ancient machines.\nArt by Thomas Novosel\nPlayers manage a dice pool representing the resources available to them, choosing how many dice to risk when they set out to a nearby location. Each location contains a chance to acquire supplies as well as powerful Relic Dice that will help keep their society afloat. As players uncover Relics and explore locations, they'll build a timeline of the Eons of humanity, assigning their discoveries to the timeline to uncover the Coil's vast history.\nArt by Thomas Novosel\n\n A surreal, far-future, brutalist world: The Coil\u2019s strata could go on forever and wait to be explored.\n Clean, simple rules: Simple mechanics allow you to bring depth and detail to the world your characters are exploring.\n Emergent storytelling: Players work together to create the Coil and populate its enigmatic places. No GM or preparation needed.\n Millions of years of history: Create and recreate eons of human\u2014and inhuman\u2014civilization.\nIn progress layout mockup: design and text not final. Interior art by Juan Ochoa.\n Digital Backers will receive a PDF file of the game.\n Physical Backers will receive a 8.5x5.5\" saddle-stitched printed zine of the game as well as a PDF copy.\n Thematic Trilogy Backers will receive the physical and digital versions of Reliquary, as well as two other games that are very thematically connected: Palimpsest and Apotheosis. Both deal with the change in civilization over long periods of time, and are great games to play in tandem with Reliquary to create even more in-depth settings.\n Deluxe Backers will receive all of the above, but your physical copy of Reliquary will be signed, with a personal note included. I'll also write out on index cards 10 custom locations for your game.\nStretch Goals:\nUNLOCKED - At $3K I can commission 3-4 more pieces of art for the book from Thomas Novosel to help bring the setting of the Coil to life even more. \n\nShipping\nOrders will ship weekly in batches per received surveys until they're all out the door. I expect delivery to begin in June 2021.\nUS orders of the physical zine will ship USPS Media Mail, at $5.\nInternational orders of the physical zine will ship at $18.\nContributors to Reliquary include:\n Gordie Murphy, writer and designer (Apotheosis, Mainframe, Palimpsest)\n Thomas Novosel, artist (Runaway Hirelings, Greeblin's Journey)\n Juan Ochoa, artist (After the War, Callisto, Hall of Judgement)\n Tyler Crumrine, editor (Beak, Feather, & Bone)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, but I have seasoned Kickstarter veterans advising me.

The campaign funded and reached all of its stretch goals, with the support of over 500 backers,  and has since sold a further 800 copies on DriveThruRPG \nThis campaign is for DM Yourselves \u2013 a companion volume to the original \u2013 which explores a whole range of new techniques to add to your solo play, and introduces ways in which to play published adventures DM-less with one or more friends. \nDM Yourself introduced a new method for solo roleplaying, a way to play all those adventures I had lying around gathering dust. Its goals were:\nTo be able to play the adventure as close to written as possible, with minimum rule changes or preparation.\nTo be able to play with a single player character, but without that character needing to be an invincible superhero.\nTo achieve maximum immersion, so that the experience recreated some of the feel of playing a roleplaying game (rather than just reading-with-dicerolls).\nTo find a way to deal with the inevitable spoilers and hidden information, so that the player could still experience the story.\nTo provide a small set of unobtrusive rules to stop the player from cheating or bending the rules (DMing yourself is hard!).\nDM Yourselves takes these ideas and techniques further, giving new ways to bring your solo roleplaying fully to life, whether this is with D&D 5e or another RPG system, played out in full detail or just in casual story mode, on your own or with a friend (when neither of you wants to DM).\nDM Yourselves will be a 32-page A5 zine with the following content:\nCharacter Creation\nDM Yourself balanced the game for a single PC & Sidekick. DM Yourselves will give rules for having more than one Sidekick and/or PC and how to balance accordingly.\nPC Default Behaviours and Binding Decisions for Wilderness and Urban adventures.\nGold and Equipment for PCs/Sidekicks starting at higher levels.\nMultiplayer Solo/DM-less Play\nDM-less Duet (and general DM-less play). How to play solo together \u2013 for when nobody wants to DM or bother with the prep.\nAutonomous Sidekicks and PCs\nEmulate Sidekicks with depth and their own agenda and flashes of brilliance \u2013 \u201cWatch this!\u201d (alignment, secrets, goals, loyalty, suggestions, tricks, moments of inspiration). This means that sometimes your Sidekick may not do exactly what you want (and other times they may do more than you thought possible) \u2013 just like another player.\nIf you want to use DM Yourselves as a way to practice your DM skills, you can even go one step further and emulate the main PC as well as the Sidekick.\nMore Tips for Solo Play\nStep-by-Step Turn Summary (and Flowchart) \u2013 to be honest, this should probably have been in the first book.\nSeparating your DM and Player Role \u2013 more ways to keep yourself honest when dealing with spoilers and hidden information.\nGetting Started and Overcoming Blocks \u2013 it can be so difficult to actually pull the trigger and start an adventure, and sometimes a difficult encounter can derail you. DM Yourselves will give techniques for getting past these problems.\nEnemy Combat AI \u2013 more tips for handling combat (developments, surprise, tactics etc.) and examples for how to use the AI combat tables from the first book.\nExtended NPC Reaction Tables \u2013 methods for weaving together the information given in the scenario with tables to flesh out the characters and reactions of NPCs you meet.\nHow to Read Other Styles of Adventure \u2013 DM Yourself was based around the scenario format most often used for modern 5e adventures (numbered maps, boxed location descriptions). What do you do if your adventure doesn\u2019t fit that format?\nGroup Checks \u2013 and other rules to watch out for with low player counts.\nMaking Mistakes and Happy Little Accidents \u2013 and playing it your way.\nExperiments with Time and Space\nMontage (and other non-linear timescales) \u2013 experimental tables for breaking away from always being in linear time and instead using some scenes as montage, skipping travel with highlights, slow-motion etc.\nViewpoint/Framing/Scene Tables (and other film techniques) - experimental tables for breaking away from always being in first person and instead doing some scenes using other viewpoints and cinematic techniques.\nGetting Inside the Head of Your Character \u2013 sort of like the Immersion Table, but inside your character\u2019s head.\nZoomed-Out Play (how to drop the details but still get the story) \u2013 sometimes you want the story but without playing out every scene turn-by-turn.

In it, you play an ambitious minor wizard who's come into possession of a grimoire beyond your arts. Can you study and unlock it? What wizardries does it contain? Into what troubles and adventures will your ambitions lead you?\nSince then, I've written several more games set in the same world -- The Barbarian's Bloody Quest, The Last Adventure, The Thief & the Necromancer -- and also additional grimoires for the original game. Each offers new characters to play or new wizardries to unlock and master.\nI'd like to bring these games to a wider audience. In all, I've already written enough material to publish 7 issues of a zine, so that's what I'm going to do!\nGameplay: the Grimoire\nAt the heart of the game is the grimoire: a text of many sections and its own set of rules. Each section represents a wizardous advancement you can achieve, a new spell you can learn or act of wizardry you can undertake, but each also has its own rules for unlocking and studying them. Don't read ahead! You can only read the sections you've unlocked and studied.\nMost wizards' grimoires also include \"safeguards,\" sections you unlock by improper study. These include magical curses, setbacks, and disasters. Trigger a safeguard and the spellbook may rewrite itself, summon a destructive creature from another world, or even send you reeling 10 minutes back into the past. Keep trying to study it without disarming the safeguard, and it'll keep sending you back!\nYour first grimoire is a challenging 1st-level text called \"The Signature of Aibesta of the Two Courts.\" Aibesta of the Two Courts was a powerful wizard of an age some four centuries past. Her grimoire includes the techniques to summon an Impeccable Servant, a powerful familiar and bodyguard, an act of wizardry that Aibesta undertook but never accomplished.\nWork your way through the entire grimoire, and not only will you learn powerful new spells, you'll establish your workroom, the foundation of your future seclusium; you'll learn techniques to better subdue and study future grimoires; and you'll accomplish what Aibesta herself couldn't: the summoning of an Impeccable Servant!\nGameplay: You and Your Volunteers\nTo play The Wizard's Grimoire, you need two volunteers (or three works fine) to play against you. Only you, the wizard player, need to know the rules. You're responsible for knowing your own rules and making your own calls. You're also responsible for telling your volunteers any points of continuity that you want them to know.\nIn this way, the game upends the normal player-GM relationship. Instead of a GM saying, \"hey, I have this game I'd like to run, who's in?\" you say, \"hey, I'm trying to get my wizard through this spellbook, do you have a minute?\"\nEach session that you play is an episode in your wizard's study and adventures. They can be as short or as long as you like, you can play as often or rarely as you like, and you can have different volunteers, or the same ones, every time you play.\nGameplay: System & Dice\nThe Wizard's Grimoire uses a dice pool version of the good old PbtA moves.\nYou have ratings for your moves based on your qualities -- for instance, your rating to exert yourself subtly to take surreptitious action is equal to your Ambitious + your Cunning, while your rating to exert yourself violently against an enemy is equal to your Bold + your Cunning. Roll that many dice, count the 4s, 5s and 6s as hits, and if you roll no hits, it's a miss. Usually, you get to spend your hits on things you want to happen or questions you want to ask, but you know how it is with moves, they each work a little differently.\nSince you both call for your own rolls and interpret their results for yourself, the moves answer to different design concerns than they do in a conventional PbtA game. I think they're pretty interesting, and if you're a PbtA-head like me, I think you will too.\nFuture Issues (Spoilers!)\n The Dictum of Polume the Farer: An easy and useful 1st-level grimoire, including such spells as creating a scampering lantern and summoning a jarful of plasmic hornets. You can study it alongside Aibesta's Signature for very good results.\n The Barbarian's Bloody Quest: Can you find and slay the wizard who butchered and subjugated your family? Includes \"The Book of Doomed Wizards.\" \n The Three Scrolls of Jorvelte Wild-Crowned: A 2nd-level grimoire, including the wizardous techniques to enchant magical items, including a useful and dangerous staff of glimmering menace.\n The Last Adventure: In your youth, you were a warrior and a hero. Now you're dead, but no one brought you the sup of oblivion. Take up the memory of your old sword, the memory of your old helmet, and make your last adventure here in the land of death. Includes \"In the Land of Death\" and \"Answering the Calling Voice.\" \n The Red Tome of Salabrusto the Wise: A 2nd-level grimoire, including an almanac of alien worlds and planes, and wizardous techniques both to travel to them and summon entities from them.\n The Thief & the Necromancer: You're friends, a gifted necromancer and a thief and street performer. You've both escaped bad situations and you've thrown in together to take on the world. Includes \"Goerne, a Ghostly Tutor.\" \nAttention: Patrons\nIf you support lumpley games on Patreon, you'll already get the digital version of The Wizard's Grimoire as a patron reward. Don't sign up for it here!\nIf you'd like a copy in print, though, this is the best way to get one.\nReduced Price Level & Community Copies\nTimes are tight!\nIf you want to support the project but the full price is a stretch, or if you're curious about the game but can't justify paying full price sight unseen, we've been there!

For a free introduction to an earlier iteration of some of the game's core mechanics check out my game Alien Dark. \nPlayers take the role of people who previously made their living in Europe's overlapping  crime and espionage communities. That's how they discovered the Conspiracy behind the skein of what passed for their normal lives. The die was cast; they can never unknow what they have discovered; never go back to what they were before. \nDoing dubious and dangerous things for their country &/or personal gain has left them with few ties to family or friends, making the ones they have left all the more important. That's why they have to make a stand and take the Conspiracy down one corrupt piece at a time, before it catches up with them and anyone who still cares about them. \nYou can see the first of a 3 session series using the current playtest packet of Against the Dark Conspiracy, here.  If the players are happy for them to be released then Session 2 will be available during the campaign and Session 3 just after it finishes - find me on twitter @AlunRees14 for updates. I'm running a one-shot of Against the Dark Conspiracy for Gauntlet Community Open Gaming on 27 February.\nYou can also find a 'design diary' I wrote for The Gauntlet RPG Community blog, here.\n                                  The Zine\nThe Zine will be a 40-page, 8.5\" x 5.5\" PDF graced with greyscale cover art by Kasha Mika.\nIf, together, we successfully reach stretch goals then the page count will increase to match the growth of content and art options.\nThe Zine will offer tables to help the GM and players define the nature of the operations they will embark upon, as well as the powers and weaknesses of their supernatural foes. The GM will choose from those lists to create the kinds of supernatural threat they and their players want to see in their game.  The default antagonists are vampires, but stretch goals will expand the options.\nBackers at the Digital Enhancement ... level, and above, will also receive a code enabling them to get an at cost physical copy of the Zine shipped direct to them via DrivethruRPG.  \n The Game \nIn a setting inspired by Night's Black Agents (by Ken Hite), Against the Dark Conspiracy builds player characters based on what they used to do for an intelligence or criminal organisation along with their particular area of brilliance. This creates characters with a specific skill-set and expertise and ensures everyone gets their time in the spotlight. It explores their motivation for standing up to the Conspiracy and their relationships with other characters and the non-player character they need to protect from their foes. This gives the players plenty of hooks on which to hang their role-play.\nIf they lack a necessary expertise or need fictional positioning for some action, they can flash back to call on a contact for help, developing a network of NPCs they can (usually) rely on, but who may in turn attract the attention of the Conspiracy. Having your network driven underground is a real pain!  \nGameplay is designed around a cycle that sees characters:\n Gather Intel: to get answers to specific questions about their current operation but also increase their broader understanding of the Conspiracy and its activities. \n Spend Intel: to take some narrative control by defining the location, target, likely opposition and even the specific obstacles they'll face in an upcoming operation, or to force the GM to reveal the Powers or Weaknesses of their supernatural foes. \nCycle of Play\nDeciding how to spend Intel gives players some control over how quickly the level of threat increases, from mundane criminal or para-military pawns of the Conspiracy to supernatural foes of increasing potency. They decide if they want to know more about the supernatural or about the immediate obstacles they'll face in their operations. How much do they want to know for certain before they try to put a stake in the very heart of the Conspiracy?\nAll the while, there's a risk that the Conspiracy is finding out as much about the characters as they discover about it.  Clumsy and noisy failures move the Conspiracy from being just suspicious, through alarmed, to the point where they come after the team wherever they are. Alternatively, the Conspiracy may go after their network of contacts or the person they want (and need) to protect.\nDuring play characters will, inevitably, accumulate Stress and when their Stress track fills the player narrates how they leave the game. Heroically? Or will it be to become a pawn? Character generation takes only a few minutes so characters can be replaced on the fly if a player gets careless and fails to seek relief from the horror. Whether it's being drunk on the job, or indulging some other vice, or seeking solace from a friend or mentor in moments between the action, there's always a price to pay, but it can keep you going. Sometimes that price is paid by the character or the person that matters most to them, sometimes by the operation, and sometimes by another player character.\nFor a free introduction to an early iteration of some of the game's core mechanics look at Alien Dark.\nYou can see the first of a 3 session series using the current playtest packet of Against the Dark Conspiracy run for the Gauntlet RPG Community, here.

You play as trained agents of the External Containment Bureau, an organization tasked with the study, identification, and containment of paranormal phenomena. The Bureau authorizes agents to make use of these phenomena to give yourself incredible powers (so long as the proper forms are in order). But take care: using paranormal energies inches you ever closer to joining the ranks of the paranormal yourself. Will you transcend humanity in the line of duty? Play to find out.\nIf you enjoy media like Control, Fringe, The Magnus Archives, Men in Black, SCP Foundation, or X-Files... you'll love External Containment Bureau!\n\nCheck out the current state of the game in this actual play(test) session on our YouTube channel:\n Like what you see here? Eager to try it out for yourself? Click the button below to generate your own copy of a FREE Quickstart Keeper document powered by Google Sheets. Inside, you'll find an overview of gameplay and basic rules, pregenerated character sheets for up to four agent players, and a GM tab that tracks all important agent information and provides a sample mission to introduce you to the paranormal nature of the External Collections Bureau.\nClick the button above to access the Quickstart Keeper!\nThe Game\nThe Bureau\nThe work of the External Containment Bureau (ECB) is founded on three principles:\n Identify: Both in the office and in the field, it's the responsibility of agents to study and identify paranormal phenomena. The Bureau's various departments work together to add to the Bureau's knowledge base.\n Obscure: Paranormal phenomena and the mundane world don't easily mix. For the sake of both the public good and the health of paranormal sentience, it is the prerogative of every agent to obscure the true nature of paranormal phenomena.\n Contain: The Bureau's purpose is to preserve a healthy balance between paranormal phenomena and the mundane world. Agents are expected to find safe havens for the paranormal in their local environments or, failing that, provide adequate accommodations at Bureau HQ.\nWhile creating your agent, one of the major considerations is which department you work in at the Bureau. You'll transfer departments throughout your time with the Bureau, learning new skills and making use of specialized gear in each:\nExternal Containment Bureau Departments: Administration, Field Operations, Human Relations, Records, Research + Development, and Sanitation.\nGameplay\nExternal Containment Bureau makes use of a streamlined version of the Forged in the Dark design framework. Cut to the drama, take action, deal with the consequences, and balance your life between Field and Bureau phases of play.\nTwo of the core mechanics in External Containment Bureau are redaction and resonance. Don't like the consequences of your actions? Redact them from the record and roll the dice to see how much resonance you gain with the paranormal energies around you as a result. Gaining resonance gives you incredible paranormal powers but beware: eventually you might resonate so much with these energies that you transcend humanity. At that point, the work of the Bureau is beyond your consideration.\nTrained agents of the Bureau\nRedacted Material License\nFrom the very beginning, External Containment Bureau has been designed with easy hacking in mind. If you want to create your own games that make use of ECB's streamlined mechanics, paranormal themes, or bureaucratic processes, the game includes a free license to help you out. We're still working out the details, but all games inspired by ECB will be known as REDACTED MATERIAL.\nRedacted Material License Logo\nThe Campaign\n We're keeping our backer levels nice and simple for this campaign:\n Intern ($1+): Back at this level and receive our thanks for helping the External Containment Bureau succeed in its mission!\n Digital Agent ($10): Back at this level to receive a digital PDF copy of External Containment Bureau. This PDF is print-ready so you can print your own copy at a local print shop.\n Print Agent ($20): Back at this level for a print-ready digital PDF and a printed zine of External Containment Bureau. \n Manager ($50): Receive a print-ready digital PDF and five copies of the printed zine. You'll have enough for an entire team of agents!\n Director ($100): Receive a print-ready PDF and a printed zine of External Containment Bureau.

We'll commission Julianne Griepp (www.juliannegriepp.com) to create a gorgeous piece of art to replace the standard cover seen at the top of this page.\nUNLOCKED! Every $1000 More: New Art! After our first stretch goal, every additional $1000 in funding will give us the budget to commission a black and white illustration to appear on the game's pages. If we raise $10,000, we'll have paid for a full slate of art from Julianne. Everything beyond that will continue to raise the shares of each core collaborator.\nJulianne's work as seen on the cover of Alice is Missing, an RPG by Spenser Starke.\nFulfillment\nJust like with last year's Zine Quest game, The Mythic Gazetteer is handling fulfillment of physical copies of the zine in-house. Digital copies will be fulfilled via DriveThruRPG or Itch.io, whichever you prefer as a backer. \nDriveThruRPG is phasing out their saddle-stitched Print on Demand option so at the moment, this Kickstarter is the only way to get a print copy of the game.

It\u2019s both an open-ended adventure and plug-and-play setting; envisioned as a cyberpunk Xmas mashup of Die Hard and Alien Resurrection. In the adventure, your team of grizzled PCs will be torn between saving friends locked in the Medtech facility or crawling to freedom in the vents of the corporate-controlled Hardlight Station; all while avoiding capture by the brutal Blackshield Mercenary Company. Unbeknownst to all, however, Blackshield\u2019s invasion has caused the containment protocols at the Healthtek facility to malfunction. Now, in the bowels of the station, something horrible has awoken, and, after a long, torturous sleep, they hunger to feed.\nWritten by D. Kenny with layout by Eric K. Hill & art by Vil, we've designed Hardlight Station for flexible play. It works as a one-shot, mini-series, or as a part of your ongoing Mothership (or any other Sci-Fi RPG) campaign. It\u2019s filled with unique locations, scheming NPCs, and terrifying horrors on the hunt. A night on Hardlight Station is one you won\u2019t soon forget.\n\nDying Hard on Hardlight Station takes inspiration from two of the greatest sci-fi horror and action franchises of all time and jams them into a compact, highly gameable surface for your enjoyment. Every page of the station is packed with efficient, evocative details big on imagination and light on overlong prose to make the book as table-ready as possible.\n\nTons of sci-fi mayhem and haunting horrors await in the pages of Dying Hard on Hardlight Station, including:\n Three or more fully mapped station locations - Loaded with loot tables, adventure hooks, custom encounters, and interesting NPCs.\n   Three Original Factions - The Blackshield Mercenary Company, Station Administration Nakatomi Solutions Inc, and the ravening Alien Hybrids. Each vying to come out on top in the battle for the station.\n   The Hardlight Station Directory - a guidebook filled with shops, entertainments, NPCs and jobs for your crew... should anyone survive the initial adventure.\n   Custom art and professional design - Bringing it all to life in glorious red, black, and white.\n  Plus a whole lot more!\nWe've worked hard to make this the most gameable, tightly written, evocatively illustrated, and designed module it can be, and we are very excited to get it into your hands and onto tables around the globe.\nDying Hard on Hardlight Station is designed to be played using the rules for Mothership, the ENnie award-winning (Best Game, Gen Con 2019) sci-fi horror roleplaying game. Both the Mothership system and this module pride themselves on offering easy-to-run rules while keeping the stakes high. You can find the full rules for Mothership in the Player's Survival Guide which is Pay What You Want on DriveThruRPG. That said, if you already have a game-system of choice, this module is built to easily adapt to any TTRPG system you may prefer.\n\nDying Hard on Hardlight Station is written and produced by a top-notch team:\nWritten by D. Kenny (Nirvana on Fire).\nLayout and Design by Eric K. Hill (Nirvana on Fire, The Third Sector, and Dinoplex: Cataclysm). \nArt by Vil (Dissident Whispers, Horrible Wounds, and A Fistful of Creeps).\nEditing by Jarrett Crader of the Moonrat Conspiracy (Mothership Player's Survival Guide, The Ultraviolet Grasslands, Troika!, and many more).  \n\n\nDying Hard on Hardlight Station is on its second draft and is currently being polished through supplemental playtesting. We've completed initial layouts and commissioned our first round of illustration.  We're on track to fulfill before our August estimate which has a built-in cushion for any complications that may arise. With that in mind, here is our timeline:\nFebruary 2021 - Dying Hard on Hardlight Station Kickstarter.\nMarch 2021 - Writing, playtesting, editing complete.\nApril 2021 - All art submitted, layout and text finalized.

London\u2019s deeper secrets will only emerge over multiple playthroughs!\nThe gameplay of Mask of the Rose extends beyond dialogue. You'll open new locations on the map, gather outfits and disguises, work odd jobs and collect resources. Together, this will determine what you can attempt in social situations \u2013 and how much you can get away with!\nMask of the Rose will be coming to console platforms as well as PC, Mac and Linux. We\u2019re offering Steam or GOG keys as backer rewards. Mask of the Rose will also be available on Switch, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox One and Series X/S. \nMask of the Rose is set in Fallen London: a darkly hilarious gothic underworld where death is a temporary inconvenience, the rats talk, and Hell is only a train journey away. \nWe\u2019ve been exploring the Fallen London universe over eleven years and five different games (including Fallen London, Sunless Sea, and Sunless Skies). If you\u2019re a newcomer, Mask of the Rose is the perfect jumping-on point. If you\u2019re already a fan, it offers new discoveries and a chance to explore more personal stories, including encounters with favourite characters.\nMask of the Rose begins in 1862, just months after London was stolen by bats and relocated to the Neath: a vast cavern far below the earth. Down here, the sun doesn't shine, and Parliament has sunk into the Thames. Queen Victoria never emerges from her palace. Cats spy on their owners and whisper their secrets abroad. And it's rapidly becoming clear that London isn't going to be returning to the Surface any time soon\u2026\n\nWhen you create your character in Mask of the Rose, you\u2019ll choose what your life was like before you were caught in London\u2019s fall. Were your family landed gentry? Or did they own a tailor\u2019s shop, or work on the docks? Your choice will determine how you dress, what you know, and where you fit in.\nWhatever your origins, the Fall cut you off from your family and resources. Now, you are beginning a new job for none other than Mr Pages, one of London\u2019s mysterious new Masters...\n\nThe old laws are suddenly in disarray, and London's citizens must make new lives for themselves.\nFor your fellow lodger Griz, the Fall is a liberation \u2013 the chance to be taken seriously in a position that would have been denied her when she was 'Miss Griselda'.\nFor your other housemate Archie, the change is terrifying. What is a medical student supposed to believe in when even the laws of death no longer apply?\nAnd when Archie is arrested for murder (even though the victim has since returned to life, and is feeling much better now thanks) you may begin to moonlight in detective work. Can you crack the mystery of London's first homicide since the Fall?\nLondon is rather the worse for wear after being dragged below ground. Not everything survived, nothing is the same, and no one can quite explain what has happened.\nIn Mask of the Rose you'll be able to visit a number of different locations in the city, including:\n\nBefore London fell, Horatia\u2019s was your temporary home. Now it\u2019s the only place in the city that feels familiar \u2013 until, that is, one of your own is arrested, and Horatia starts taking in new lodgers \u2013 not all of them human.\n\nAfter surviving the Fall relatively intact, Tentergrounds has become a home to many. Among them is David \u2013 Fallen London\u2019s first murder victim \u2013 as he tries to understand his own death and return.\n\nCrucial secrets are hidden in your own fragmented memories of London's Fall. But are you brave enough to relive them?\n\nA new literary salon is gathering all the brightest stars in London. The host has amber eyes, a scalding handshake, and a previous address in Hell itself, but he\u2019s an excellent listener.\n\nOnce a 40-gun frigate, the HMS Ungulate has been converted into a temporary prison. Unless you can prove his innocence, Archie may be spending a very long time there.\nMask of the Rose is a story about love, in many forms. The choice is yours: will you be a brilliant matchmaker, connecting friends and rivals while remaining unattached yourself? Or are you looking for lasting love? Or shorter assignations? Or perhaps you're open to whatever comes your way?\nEvery major storyline will be accessible regardless of whether your approach is romantic or platonic \u2013 even if the final endings may vary.\nHere are a few of the characters you'll meet:\n\nRachel was halfway through her latest novel when normal, workaday London ceased to exist \u2013 and her literary inspiration along with it. But meeting Milton has rekindled her passion for writing. He might be her suitor; he might be her Muse; he might be an actual devil, if you believe in that kind of thing. Her brother David hates him, but Rachel isn\u2019t about to let that stand in her way.\n\nHarjit hasn't lived in London long. But when catastrophe struck, he knew someone would need to organise volunteers, dig out basements, and round up the lost. Besides, he had a missing person of his own to find. For lack of other options, he stepped into a constable's uniform \u2013 and into a job that grows daily more unpredictable.\nNow he\u2019s had to arrest Archie for murder. The evidence says Archie did it. Harjit\u2019s intuition points the other way \u2013 but lately, trusting his intuition has led only to heartbreak.\n\nFor a decade, Horatia has taken in lodgers and turned them into family. But since the Fall, supplies are scarce, and her boarders can't afford their rent. So when a man made entirely of clay knocks at the door, offering to pay handsomely for lodgings, she can hardly refuse.\n\nMr Pages runs the Ministry of Accounting and Recounting, which has embarked on the titanic endeavour of conducting Fallen London\u2019s first census! A lover of the written word, Pages has never struck such a rich vein as London.\nIt does have a lot of questions for you, however. How do people declare their affectioniments, in this fair city? How lasting are their attachments? Might a Londoner take an interest in a very tall, broad-shouldered, cloaked personage that leans towards the chiropterous, hypothetistically speaking?\nExpress Yourself through Fashion. In Mask of the Rose you are what you wear. Manage an expanding wardrobe that offers a host of options. Sometimes the right disguise or outfit will get you into a social occasion. Other times, the effect will be more subtle: giving you the confidence to take a reckless action, or provoking the reaction you need from another character.\nExplore widely. Experience the city through three seasons \u2013 the season of confessions, the season of Yule, and the season of the Feast of the Rose. Each day you\u2019ll read the news, learn of any recent events and opportunities, and then turn to the map to choose your next action. Will you find Rachel and interrogate her about the night of the murder? Comfort Archie in prison? Work at one of several jobs to earn money, or use your resources to unlock a new part of the city?\nCollect the stories of Londoners \u2013 and especially their affairs of the heart. You begin as a census-taker with a notebook full of questions. The more you learn, the more it fills up \u2013 and unlocks new lines of inquiry. For some reason, Mr Pages is especially keen for its census-takers to document the \u201cassignations and besotments\u201d of London\u2019s citizens. Why is it that London\u2019s new Masters are so preoccupied with stories of romance\u2026?\nOur digital rewards range from corvid companions to choosing a Fallen London character to feature in Mask of the Rose!

The items can also be accessed via Dropbox if you prefer not to create a Gametee account.\n15 goals unlocked a chance to interview one of the characters from Mask of the Rose! We ran a poll and Milton, he of the amber eyes and scalding handshake, won!\nThank you for the many (184!) questions you submitted for Milton. They have all been received, compiled and submitted for consideration. He answered Mr Pages' approved selection in this update.\n19 goals unlocked a future encounter in Fallen London with Horatia. Your landlady in Mask of the Rose has a heart of gold and a soft spot for the Neath\u2019s more unusual inhabitants \u2013 but how is she doing decades later, in the Fallen London browser game? We will make her current residence open to visitors, creating an opportunity to meet her! This will happen sometime after the campaign, but ahead of the release of Mask of the Rose. In the meantime, Horatia has something for you \u2013 may it keep you company until you meet in Fallen London.\nAll five stretch goals have been unlocked!\nMask of the Rose comes with three initial options to define your protagonist\u2019s background, allowing you to have grown up as a dockside urchin, as a worker in your family\u2019s tailor shop, or among the stifling  pomp and luxury of the aristocracy. Your choice will grant advantages with particular factions in the story, and equip you with some unique clothing options.\nThis is a fourth origin to select when creating your character: the Housebreaker\u2019s Heir, who has a pickpocket\u2019s deftness, several criminal acquaintances, and a fraught relationship to anyone wearing a badge. Each origin grants advantages with certain factions and some unique clothing items!\n Early in Mask of the Rose, your landlady Horatia takes in new lodgers \u2013 some human, some decidedly not. We\u2019ll add one of these lodgers as a new character to Mask of the Rose: a Clay Man, fresh from the living city of Polythreme.\nHe\u2019ll be one of the game\u2019s secondary characters \u2013 not as elaborately woven into the central narrative as the main cast, but an interactive character with his own story to explore. What emotions stir beneath his stony exterior? You\u2019ll be able to get to know him better, and perhaps even learn the secret that brought him to Horatia\u2019s door... \nA fifth potential origin for your protagonist: the Undertaker\u2019s Child! Thanks to your family business, you are acquainted with numberless vicars, solicitors, grave-diggers and hearse-makers. You also know perfectly well how Death is supposed to behave \u2013 even if Fallen London persistently defies your expectations.\nThe deviless Virginia will make an appearance in Mask of the Rose. In the years to come, she will go on to be many things in Fallen London \u2013 including its Lord Mayor \u2013 but she was around long before the city arrived in the Neath. Her story will give us an opportunity to show what she was up to in a newly-arrived, vulnerable London\u2026 \n A sixth protagonist origin will be added to the game: the Scholar of the Occult! The scholar is a historian of esoteric practices ranging from witchcraft to alchemy, and this background gives you an in with academics and the more disreputable sort of artist, and a gift for noticing disturbing things out of the corner of your eye\u2026\nWARNING: while the Neath could broadly be described as very occult indeed, its particular brand of the strange has little to do with alchemy, witchcraft, angelology, or other surface occultisms. A Scholar of the Occult is as likely to be bewildered by London\u2019s new home as anyone else, but perhaps they will be a little more accepting of the eerie and the uncanny.\nOur answer to this might be a little unusual. We're doing okay right now, and can fully fund development of Mask of the Rose (though any pledges we receive will reduce the risk and put us in a better position for the future).\nInstead, we're doing this to find out whether this is a game you want us to make.  We're excited about Mask of the Rose; we hope you are, too. The funding goal is not how much it will cost to make; it's the amount that would convince us Mask of the Rose will appeal to a large enough audience, so that we can safely commit to making it.\nWe won't be making Mask of the Rose available in Early Access, so we're also hoping to learn how you feel about different parts of the game, to help guide development. If you have thoughts to share on any part of the game, please let us know in the comments!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMask of the Rose is in some ways more complex than many visual novels. But it will be smaller and more focused than most of our past games, which can be enormous and \u2013 we confess \u2013 somewhat baroque.\n\nWe're familiar with the technologies we're using to make it, and have already built a vertical slice \u2013 a short, fully playable section of the game. We\u2019ve also had a fair amount of experience fulfilling Kickstarters: we\u2019ve run three successful ones, and delivered on all of them.\n\nFor these reasons, we're confident in our ability to complete Mask of the Rose. We think the biggest risk is instead that it might take longer than estimated. In particular, we have a tendency to delay our games if part of the design isn't working out as well as we'd hoped \u2013 it's more important to us to make good games than to release them quickly. Also, it's very important to us that our team doesn't have to crunch. That means that if some things take longer than we expect, we might have to push back the release (although we\u2019ve included contingency in the schedule to cover a certain amount of this).\n\nIf everything goes to schedule, we expect to be ready to release Mask of the Rose towards the end of 2021, but to account for these risks, the date we\u2019re committing to is June 2022.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSustainable materials\nThe scented candles are made with soy wax, a more sustainable alternative to paraffin.\nSustainable Distribution\nThe majority of our rewards are delivered digitally.", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a310 or more", "title": "The Citizen", "descp": "Welcome to the Neath!

You\u2019ll play as cyborgs, mech pilots, magic wielders, and rabble rousers pitted against varied factions who are all vying for control over the Garden: demon lords, criminal enterprises, cultists, and a corporate-sponsored fascist state.\nThe Cover\nSetting\nRavenous supernatural beasts roam the streets at night and cruel imperial soldiers march in the light of the day. Infrastructure and utilities are controlled by wealthy corporations based in the Tower, and the promise of admittance is used to exploit the masses who live in the Garden.\nNo one remembers how the world ended, but it did. Generations ago. The Tower was built before then. Back then it served as a testament to humanity\u2019s innovative engineering capabilities. When all of the cities were destroyed, it remained standing, and was a beacon of hope, offering its strength and shelter to travelers from near and far. But then the doors slammed shut and the refugee camps surrounding it grew and grew. They grew so large that they merged together into a sprawling city now known as The Garden.\nLast year, the self-coronated Emperor of the Iron Tower took a portion of their advanced military machine and went on a pointless crusade against a distant demon lord. Corporations have exerted their control and use the remaining military forces to quell uprisings and protect the exposed people of the Garden from demon attacks, while ignoring the basic human needs of the populace. The scene is set for guardians defenders to rise and protect the populace, or at the very least get what\u2019s coming to them.\nThe Enhanced Character Class\nThe Rules\nThe Tower & The Garden is based on a highly modified, somewhat simplified Forged in the Dark SRD.

Together with your fellow players and GM, you create the city of Nagara and its unique locations using a tarot deck. Each session your characters inch ever closer to a Doom they\u2019re working tirelessly to prevent, but must inevitably face as the chronicle ends.\nThe game has the dark horror feeling of a dungeon crawl, while focusing on mechanics that drive in-game drama and push personal stories. You\u2019ll get embroiled in the various wars raging between guilds in the city and try to secure a bit of personal peace, before all your efforts crumble around you. You\u2019ll strive to survive in a city that is literally trying to eat you, and siphon off its power to keep the ones you love safe.\nCity of Flesh takes inspiration from grimdark fantasy combining it with a feminine aesthetic to create an immersive gore-splattered roleplay experience where you delve into the dreams of a sleeping colossus and tear through fleshy reality to make your own fate.\nWhat You\u2019ll Get\n\nCity of Flesh is an A5 sized, 50+ page, soft cover zine.

The world is young, the Age of Titans draws to a close, but the city is ancient. Built in the womb of the slain Colossus, Nagara is both rich and powerful\u2014and already past its prime. A Doom approaches Nagara, as the world rebirths itself into a new, more rational form in which there\u2019s place for neither Titans, nor cities built atop their rotting remains. To facilitate this transition, the city\u2019s dreams birthed the Midwives\u2014people imbued with some of the city\u2019s primordial energy who must guide it to whatever comes next.\nThe Colossus is dead by any measure of human life, and yet she isn\u2019t\u2014 she still undulates with primordial creation, heaving and oozing to form a protective shell around Nagara. The magic of the Sovereigns keeps her dormant, as does the life-leeching magic of lesser citizens and their efforts to keep flesh at bay with fire and blade. Entire city blocks still live under overhangs of flesh as a result of the Years of Suffering, with some citizens carving houses into the red tissue.\nThe need to drive back the Colossus\u2019 flesh becomes more dire as Nagara expands. Sovereign Nemaida offers rewards to explorers who venture in the necrotic parts of the city to slay monsters and burn away the flesh. The Midwives often find themselves called to the danger the endeavor promises, for there is plenty that can go wrong.\nHow It's Played\nNagara is dying and will be reborn. At the start of the game you map the city by performing a three-card reading for each location in the city. You\u2019ll map seven locations and then place a single card on the Blooded Sanctum, the Doom\u2014the end of your story. Each location represents one session (roughly four hours) of your game, therefore you\u2019ll play seven sessions before the eighth final session where you encounter the city\u2019s Doom.\nAt the start of every session players pick a location focus\u2014this is the location the game session is crafted around. The GM crafts the plot of the session based around the conflict and threat of the location.\nDuring the game players perform more readings, drawing a tarot card from the deck, to modify the scenes based on how characters act. Readings help facilitate the drama in your character\u2019s life. Depending on how your Reading turns out, you and/or the GM ascribe meaning to the card drawn.\nExample of Play\nThe Midwives are caught in a waking nightmare of terror and blood where an unhinged Relic stalks and murders people in their sleep. Steffie\u2019s character Torga realizes maybe the Relic can be reasoned with, she asks the Relic if they can help it in some way. Liz, the GM, asks Steffie to make a Pacify reading, because Torga is trying to connect with the Relic.\nSteffie draws the Five of Swords. \nThe Relic explains that it's enraged, not because it can\u2019t fulfill its destiny, but more because it loved Hydrassa deeply and hates seeing her body so defiled.  Torga reveals she knows the sting of unrequited love too and swears to help. Seeing another being who knows its pain, the Relic asks Torga to take action by returning Hydrassa\u2019s body to her burial tomb. \nNice to meet you!\nSteffie de Vaan is a Dutch author and developer of role playing games and short stories.

Our hopes is that this won't affect the project, but if it does we'll keep everyone informed with the most up-to-date information we have.

Serenity. The Millennium Falcon. \nYou can\u2019t have a good space story without an iconic spaceship. Of course, more often than not, the heroes of the story aren\u2019t flying some shiny new cruiser. Those are for the wealthy, the elites\u2014not our lovable scoundrels. No, they fly the bucket of bolts\u2014the outworn, patched-up junker held together with hope, prayers and duct tape.\nThe eponymous 'bucket of bolts'\nThese ships weren\u2019t always hunks of junk though\u2014they have long and storied histories, and might even have been respectable vessels at some point. We only ever see a slice of that story though, a single captain and their motley crew. \nThis game flips the perspective.  \n\nThe Game.\nBucket of Bolts is a hack of Artefact, my game from last year's ZineQuest. Instead of creating a magical item, this time you'll be telling the story of a single spaceship. You\u2019ll create a brand new freighter, fresh off the manufacturing line, and explore its history through each of the people who captain it. Your ship will change as the decades pass - new names, new parts, fresh paint, fresh starts - until your story draws to a close.\nYou\u2019ll choose your Captains, bringing them to life with names and details, and create stories of their time with your ship using prompts and tables. When you\u2018re ready to move on, you\u2019ll choose a Fate for your ship. Maybe it\u2019s traded away fairly, but more likely it\u2019s stolen, captured or even wrecked. You might drift for a while as you wait for your next Captain, or the seat might still be warm when a new one takes over. Either way, the galaxy will change around you, and you\u2019ll see it all from the view in the cockpit.\nLike the original Artefact, it\u2019s a great way to spend an hour or two; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique ships for tabletop games like Edge of the Empire, Traveller or Scum & Villainy, with rich backstories, fun details and tonnes of personality.\n\nThe Zine.\nFormat \nA little paper prototype of the zine opening.\nI'll be using a new format for the physical rewards. Beak zines take an A3 sheet of paper and fold it into an 8-page A6 booklet. This process leaves one side of the paper blank, that people sometimes use to make a poster.\nOne of the things that's always bugged me about Artefact is how much flicking around the book you need to do as you play the game. I thought\u2014why not use the blank side of a beak zine for all of the game's content; the tables, questions and prompts you\u2019ll need during play. So that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing.\nIn Bucket of Bolts, you\u2019ll be able to read through all the rules in the booklet and then unfold it into a complete reference for play. Pretty neat huh?\nAnd here it is closing!\nPaper\nExtract comes in a range of lovely colours.\nOf course, I'm still taking every opportunity to make this little zine a deluxe product. I'll be using one of my favourite paper stocks, G.F Smith Extract.\nAs well as having some seriously impressive environmental credentials (it's made from recycled coffee cups), it's also just a lovely paper that comes in some great colours. I\u2019m partial to Mustard, as you can see in the prototype, but we\u2019ll see when the print samples arrive.\n\nInk\nCopies of ARTEFACT, outside on a sunny day.\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using Risograph to print the book. That means rich, vivid shades with the aesthetic of screen printing, but viable for large-scale print runs. It\u2019s also one of the most sustainable ways to print, with soy-based inks & low energy machines. It\u2019s going to be beautiful!\n\nIllustration\nTorben is very excellent at drawing spaceships.\nSpeaking of beautiful, I'm also commissioning Torben B\u00f6kemeyer again to do some awesome illustrations for the game. Spaceships are his bread & butter, and I think his sharp, detailed style is a really good fit for this game. You\u2019ll have seen his key art at the top of the page, and he's already hard at work on the game's cover.\n\nCollector\u2019s Edition\nI'm looking forward to an excuse to get wild with paper & ink combos...\nI\u2019m also offering a Collector\u2019s Edition of the game, exclusive to the Kickstarter, packed with bonus printed matter like art prints, stickers and random tables.\nIt\u2019s all paper stuff, but I think it\u2019s gonna feel pretty special.\nAny \u2019game content\u2019 (such as random tables) will be available to all as a digital download.\n\nAccessibility\nLike Artefact and Orbital, the digital edition will also be fully-compatible with screen readers. A second version will also be provided to support a range of visual processing needs. Once again, Yubi will be handling the accessibility design of the digital files.\n\nCommunity Copies\nEvery backer of Bucket of Bolts, physical or digital, will also be contributing one digital copy of the game to be available for free for those who need it. Thanks!\n\nStretch Goals\nThis is intentionally designed as a small project, but I've still got some cool things to announce if we break past our funding goal :)\n\nDelivery.\nTimelines\nI\u2019ve got a draft of the game written, and I\u2019m happy that the core concept works as well for spaceships as it did for magical items (after making a few changes to the design). I\u2019m hoping to get a playtest version out in a month or two, with the full digital version being delivered in late spring/early summer and the physical edition following soon after.\n\nBackerKit\nAs with my previous projects, I\u2019ll be using BackerKit to manage fulfilment. This time, though, I\u2019m collecting shipping fees through Kickstarter so you shouldn\u2019t need to add funds in BackerKit unless you\u2019ve selected add-ons.\n\nOrbital \nOrbital header art\nMy previous project, Orbital, is going to print imminently which means that the bulk of the work for that Kickstarter is done. I\u2019m not shipping out the rewards myself, and the stretch goal content is coming along nicely. I\u2019ll continue to actively manage the project, but barring any catastrophes it shouldn\u2019t take up much headspace.\n\nARTEFACT: Reviews & Remarks.\nI\u2019m so happy with the way Artefact has been received. Here\u2019s hoping I can recapture some of that magic for Bucket of Bolts.\nIf you\u2019re a returning backer: hi, nice to see you again! I hope you also enjoyed Artefact :)\nPrint copies of Artefact\n\"It combines a little bit of writing and a little bit of drawing with a lot of storytelling to make a game that is one of the most relaxing and mindful experiences I have had this year.\" - Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"This is a great system agnostic supplement that could fit on any gamer\u2019s shelf\". \u2014 Pulp Culture Museum\n\"It was a wonderful game that once I started, I had a hard time putting down.

There's more details about the individual games below, but first let's talk about the broad details.\nMy goal is to take three games that bring me great joy, and send as many copies as possible out into the world. Maybe they'll get played? Maybe they'll change lives? Or maybe they'll get picked up by another trans person who will have a little chuckle about the shared understanding of it all. These are all great outcomes! \nAs a backer at the $10 level, you will get digital copies of all three zines; each is sixteen-pages, black and white, and set up for both A4 and 8.5\"x11\" paper, sent straight to your digital doorstep at the end of the campaign, along with screen-readable copies. In addition, you will get immediate access to the betas of all three zines! These are 99% done, but may be subject to final layout and word tweaking. \nAt the $20 level you get the good stuff: a physical copy of any zine! Choose whichever one makes you feel most euphoric. And hey, you still get the digital copies immediately, so you can read them all and pick your favorite at the end of the campaign when I send out the surveys. \nAnd if you pledge $40, you get the entire trilogy. That's right, if you're going to buy two, you get the third one for free, whether you want it or not! This is my real goal here, getting you wonderful folks out there get a full triple-barreled blast of my Feelings. \nThis is a strictly one-woman affair, so that means I will be printing these out on my very own home laser printer, stapling them with my very own longarm stapler, and sending them to you through the United States Postal Service, First Class Mail. \nI'm Lara! This is the fourth time I've launched a Kickstarter, but the first time I've done so as an out-and-proud transgirl (with the previous three having been run in states of \"completely in the closet,\" \"completely in denial,\" and \"completely oblivious\"). There's a fun rule-of-3 going on here, isn't there? I kickstarted 3 games as Ed, and now I'm doing 3 more as Lara, right here on ZineQuest 3! \nANYWAY. In addition to being trans, I'm a professional tabletop game developer; I've published a bunch of indies as Glaive Guisarme Games, but also worked professionally on a number of games, including Acute Paranoia for Mongoose Publishing, Eldritch Century for Draco Studios, and bunch of games for Evil Hat Productions who were the first to put my real name on a game, Fate Condensed. \nI came out six months ago. It was very dramatic. It's been a rough six months in a lot of ways, but on the whole, even when I'm miserable, I've never been happier. Highly recommended. \nOkay, okay, let's take a look at the three games that make up the Trans Rage Trilogy.\nYou have, for some time, had a bone to pick with RJ McElhenny, author of a series of extremely popular young-adult fantasy novels, but lately she's been saying extremely reductive things about who she thinks deserves to be called a wizard. So, as a bunch of magic-users who she would describe as \"it's okay for them to call themselves wizards but they're not really wizards,\" you're going to heist the hell out of her mansion. \nLet's Rob RJ McElhenny and Steal Her Golden Quill is the \"angry\" part of trans rage. Fuck politeness, let's smash some shit.\nInspired by an author whose name I currently forget, this here is a wish-fulfillment magic heist. Move through the randomly-generated rooms of McElhenny Manor and confront the obstacles she's thrown in your way with your awesome magic powers (which is to say, describe how cool you are and chuck some dice to see if it's cool enough or if you have to describe an even more awesome spell). If you start running low on magic energy, talk about how mad you are at McElhenny and you'll be ready to take on another room. \nThis game was originally released in July of 2020, because That Author was in the public sphere for some reason or another and I was full of feelings that I wasn't quite sure how to express. It would be nice if this game were to stop being relevant, but I just learned she's going to be drawing paychecks for a TV show that's gonna keep her in the public sphere and frankly it looks like \"getting mad at That Author\" is a pretty evergreen situation. Blech. Anyway. This re-release includes:\nRevised rules, including replacing \"flashbacks\" with a simpler, quicker method of regaining Action dice\nCleaned-up layout and a prettier cover \nMy actual name on it because when I first released it I wasn't out yet and didn't know whaaaaat to put on it\nThis is a handsome sixteen-page zine, black ink on off-white paper (the most maaaaagical color of paper), folded, stapled, and delivered to your door so you can perform your own magic revenge. \nGet this one if you want to feel like a real cool wizard doing some cool crimes with your wizard buddies.\nWelcome to the cyber-future, chummer. Is it everything you wanted it to be? Has all the hype really given way to a fully-realized universe with acceptable levels of optimization and a minimum of crashes? The streets are lawless, the corps own your soul, and \"hope\" has lost all meaning, but it's a sweet-ass transhumanist future so even if you don't have control of your life, you still have control of your sex and gender. Probably got a hell of a menu to choose from, right?\nPenis 2.0.77 is the \"manic\" part of trans rage. Nothing makes sense, so make it your own and giggle at the absurdity.\nInspired by a popular AAA video game that had (and let us be extremely generous here) mixed results in its depictions of trans people. This is as far as I can tell, the most complex and full-featured series of crotch-related tables ever put into a zine. There's no other \"game\" here, but there are lots of bad jokes about wobbly bits. Written in a fugue state late in 2020, I have a few regrets about the initial presentation. Most notably, I accidentally aped the last few centuries of male-dominated medical research by almost totally discounting the clitoris. This revision remedies that, and includes:\nMore genital variables, taking us up to approximately 4 trillion different configurations\nParts synergies, which will make random crotches hew slightly closer to \"expected\" without hampering custom design potential\nRe-balanced parts costs, to prevent you from accruing too much MegaCorp MegaDebt\nFor the purposes of transparency, especially with respect to \"what you can and cannot launch a Kickstarter for,\" let me be clear: there is no pornography here. There are no photos or drawings of nude people or anatomical features, nor anything that could be considered \"erotica.\" It's charts with crotch jokes, and RPG jokes, and cyberpunk jokes. You can create a character (sort of) but the real goal here is cathartic giggling about the inherent strangeness of the human underwear-zone. \nThis is a totally cyber sixteen-page zine, printed in black on light blue paper (the color of the digital cyberscape here in Byte City). Finally, you can create those aspirational genitals you've been dreaming of.\nGet this one if you want jokes on jokes on jokes, or to delight in overly-laborious random roll chargen.\nOne day, the dragon crawled out of myth and into the real world. Our real world. It seized control, and bent the people to its will... yourself included. But you have resisted, despite everything you've lost. And now it's time to fight back. This is a fast-paced storytelling game that puts you in the position of... yourself. Not a hero, not a warrior, but your own real-world self, using your own real-world skills to fight a seemingly unstoppable force. You might not win... you probably won't. But you have to try.\nTo Stand Before the Dragon's Wrath is the \"resigned\" part of trans rage. You probably can't fix anything, but you're going to have to try.\nWay back in the forgotten history of our benighted planet, almost a decade ago, a boy named Edward wrote a game which he thought was about cool dragon fights, but which was actually about being upset at a world which was wrong in an way he wished he could put a face on. He found himself living half for reasons he didn't really understand and in his heart of hearts he wished that he had the power to take on the powers that be.\nWhat a dipshit this boy named Ed was. How obvious in retrospect were his works. Let me guess, Edward, if you had a superpower, it would have been shapeshifting? Perhaps you don't think much of vanity and take a grim pride in not caring about your appearance? Oh who's your favorite character on this show, is it the fairly butch lady who cleans up nice? You fool, you transparent buffoon. \nAHEM. This revised and re-imagined version maintains the same broad structure as the one-page original, but includes:\nRevised text to simplify and clarify the main mechanics \nBonus content related to altering the game now included in the main text, rather than some separate pages\nSubtext now more obvious, especially to me, the author\nThere will be a dragon making your lives miserable and you, the players portraying lightly fictionalized versions of yourself, will talk about how it's made you miserable, and then attempt to take out that dragon with your own unique skills. In other words, you'll give the aspects of society that make you miserable a big scaly face, and then punch it. You're likely to get horribly defeated in the process, but, and this is important, you might not! \nThe storytelling system uses simple card draws and light risk-reward mechanisms to tell grandiose stories of epic battles, and the whole thing is being released for the first time as a sixteen-page zine, black ink on pink paper (the color of fierceness, flames, and blood, but without getting so dark that it would be hard to read), complete with additional information on how to adapt and modify the core engine to your own ends. \nGet this one if you want a light-but-robust storytelling engine about confronting enormous odds.\nBonus Content\nIt's like stretch goals, but I was always going to do them anyway. It's just nice to announce them at the same time as some major monetary milestone. \nEach zine comes with its own special single-sheet bonus, delivered with every physical copy. Get the three-pack, get three bonuses! \nTo Stand Before the Dragon's Wrath (Pocket Edition) - Included with the full Wrath, it's an especially tiny version of the basic game. No frills, no variants, just a small package which you can easily tuck into a pocket and take with you to conventions (when conventions exist again).\nAnthony Charterstone and the Unwelcome Intruder dust jacket - The cover of RJ McElhenny's most recent novel. If you aren't quite mad enough at her to steal her golden quill, then you can simply read through her works and allow the rage to bubble up within. \nPenis 2.0.77 Genital Customization Form - A closed envelope containing a character sheet filled out with my own personal genital information, as accurately reflected as I could make it. Importantly, you have no right to this information, but I won't stop you from opening it. Do you respect trans people enough to not give in to prurient curiosity about their genitalia? \nInterview with PlusOneExp\nIf you want to hear me talk a little bit more about this campaign, why I made it, and what I'm hoping to get out of it, check out my interview with Tony of PlusOneExp!

Their mission: win freedom by acquiring a legendary religious relic at the behest of their corporate jailors, PrayCo. \nThe Wheel's hollow internal landscape of barren fields and rusting, bombed out structures swarm with monstrous bioengineered animals and lethal corporate relic hunters. Trenches, minefields, hull punctures and a stalemated battle bar passage from the high-gravity docking bays to the blasphemous prize waiting at the funnel's tip.\nSimple farmers of the rotating colony ship Within Wheels starve as bargain InstaCrops wither on the vine. They turn to faith and ritual, concocting visions of a hell on earth from half-remembered traditions and commercialized lore. Bunker doors seal as their beacon calls upon believers to consecrate synthetic soil with holy blood.\nThe Drain takes a WWI influenced war-as-hell meat grinder and mashes it with bleak, occult survival horror themes drawn from video games like Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Darkwood. This 16-page zine is packed with everything you need to churn out a crop of battle hardened level-1 characters from level-0 rabble, including:\n Brand new rules for running carnage-filled funnels in Mothership.\n A funnel crawl map by Andrew Walter, gorgeously illuminated to chart the party's movement through the conical space.\n Vicious new items to arm your mob of funnel PCs.\n Art on every spread, including illustrations from Mothership creator Sean McCoy.\n\nThis module emulates Dungeon Crawl Classics\u2019 \"funnel\" character generation in which each player pilots multiple level-0 characters through a \"meat grinder\". Survivors, forged in blood, earn their 1st level. If embraced, a funnel becomes a contest to achieve the most spectacular PC death. Players and GMs bond in murderous collaboration, anxieties surrounding character death melting away. PCs become resources to throw at problems rather than precious things to be guarded. Campaign-spanning legends of heroic sacrifice and bitter survival begin here.\nAll backers will receive a 1-page PDF of my funnel rules for Mothership immediately after the campaign ends so you can get started running your own funnels. The rules sheet will include guidelines for creating your own funnel adventures and running existing modules as funnels.\nInterested in a writing sample from the author before you back? My first Mothership pamphlet and Gold DriveThruRPG bestseller Moonbase Blues is free for the duration of this Kickstarter. Snag it if you haven't already!\nhttps://ian-yusem.itch.io/moonbase-blues\nFunnel Survivor backers will receive a limited run double-sided A3 poster of Andrew Walter's map for The Drain. I will hand write custom, unique game content for each backer on the \"secret\" reverse side. Backers will submit a personal theme and work with me to customize Within Wheels for their home game. The content I write is up to each backer, and could vary from a gut-churning table to a terrifying new monster.\nPretty cool video, right? You could own all 3 unique, lovingly handcrafted spaceship models from the trailer to use as props in your game. Should you back at the Within Wheels pledge tier, you will receive: A 5\" x 3\" model of the ill-fated sleeve soldier dropship Genesis, a 12\" x 9\" model of the PrayCo prison transport Charity, and a 9\" x 4\" model of colony ship and adventure setting Within Wheels delivered right to your home (shipping included). The models were made with styrene foam, superglue, \"bits of junk\", blood, sweat, tears, and dreams. The proceeds for this pledge will go to Meredith, our steadfast video producer and master modeler.\nIan Yusem: Pamphlet baron and occasional RPG blogger, Ian (myself) is the author and publisher of The Drain. Mothership fans might recognize some of my 3rd party scenarios like Moonbase Blues and Dinoplex: Cataclysm. I think The Drain is my best work yet, and I'm excited to send it out into the world.\nChristian Kessler: The layout and design genius behind books like Silent Titans and Troika! Numinous Edition is putting his eminent talents behind this humble zine. Christian also illustrated the sweet, Russian constructivism-influenced cover art for The Drain. A man of many talents.\nFiona Maeve Geist: Editing powerhouse and RPG darling, Fiona has been essential to this project's development and she's done a wonderful job tightening up the manuscript. Fiona is a lead developer on Mothership and takes her pen to 99% of everything good in RPGs as part of the editing team MoonRat Conspiracy, including Ultraviolet Grasslands, Troika, Silent Titans, ad infinitum.\nAndrew Walter: Andrew made the best damn map I've ever seen in an RPG for this project. You used to know his illustrations from beloved titles like Troika, Slipgate Chokepoint and Fever Swamp\u2014now you know him from The Drain.\nSean McCoy: Last, but certainly not least, the design legend behind Mothership and co-owner of Tuesday Knight Games is contributing an absolute ton of fantastically horrifying art to this zine. Not a spread will go by without its splendor.\nThe Drain's manuscript is written, playtested, and edited. Christian is underway on final layout and the last pieces of art are rolling in from Sean. We're on track to fulfill well before our June estimate (which budgets an extra couple months for unseen complications). Here's a conservative timeline laying out our internal milestones:\nJanuary 2021 - Writing, playtesting, editing complete\nFebruary 2021 - Kickstarter campaign, PledgeManager opened to Backers\nMarch 2021 - All art submitted, layout and text finalized\nApril 2021 - Printed proofs ordered and reviewed\nMay 2021 - Print run ordered, stretch goals completed\nJune 2021 - Fulfillment begins\nThe good folks at Exalted Funeral will be fulfilling physical orders to the USA and the Rest of the World.\nThe Melsonian Arts Council is handling distribution to the United Kingdom and Europe.\nMonkey's Paw Games has Canada covered.\nShipping costs are not included in your pledge, but will be collected at the time of release via PledgeManager to ensure accurate shipping costs. Digital copies of the zine will be distributed through DriveThruRPG.\nRecent changes to tax policy due to Brexit complicates EU and UK distribution, on top of ongoing Covid shipping troubles.

That's exactly our goal, proposing this setting.\nWe developed 6 playable races, 3 new classes, dozens of character options and rules to manage Time Travel, 20+ New Monsters (together with the Time Dragon!) and Temporal Dungeons. Everything ready to be introduced in your 5th Edition campaigns. \n\nDownload the Quickstart and start your next session jumping through time!\nQuickstart available both in English and Italian.\nDownload the Quickstart (70 pages), learn the basics and play your first Temporal Dungeon!\n\n\n\n\n\nShintiara is a world that combines sci-fi and fantasy, a planet dilated by temporal paradoxes that exists on the event horizon produced by Siray, the sun, and Murya, the black star.\nOn the planet of Shintiara, the Recruits exploit Paradoxes (namely items and places from other ages) and Powers that bend time, driven by an apocalyptic vision and with the aim of favouring their Factions.\nA long time ago, the two stars Siray and Murya which the planet orbits around were in harmony. Shintiara danced in the space around them for millions of years until, about three hundred years ago, the catastrophic events of the Great Darkness changed everything. For reasons unknown, Murya collapsed, turning into a strange black hole and rupturing space-time around Shintiara.\nMurya, the black star, continuously attracts the planet and breaks the flow of time\nAt that very moment, time was ruptured and an unheard-of clash began: on one side lies Siray, that exerts its influence in order to maintain the planet in the Cosmos, on the other lies Murya, the black star, that threatens to make all time end.\nAs a Recruit in the Crusade you can shape time as you please, without magic or technology. You can navigate the flow of time either to prevent the Apocalypse or to bring it about.\nIf it happened, the Apocalypse would be permanent. No journey through time could ever go beyond it.\nRecruit! Accept the consequences of your vision: a new portal has opened already and the Crusade of Time needs a new hero!\n\nPlaying in the world of Shintiara is an exciting and kaleidoscopic succession of adventures, in which characters will literally move and think in four dimensions. Every player character is a Recruit, a scholar and expert of time and its Paradoxes who can bend time.\nExplore a planet full of magic and technology\nAccumulating too many Paradoxes or activating your temporal powers too often can also, however, lead to unpleasant consequences. For example, it is not such a good thing to be inside a temporal maelstrom. Unfortunately for you, creatures and time are fickle, and at times generate places that defy the laws of physics: temporal dungeons, areas of Shintiara that rise within the mazes of Veils. \nA temporal dungeon is a space and a place which is situated around one or more Veils (time portals). This space and moment in time bends the usual laws of physics and time. After entering the Veil one will end up in the same map, but in years or Ages away.\nTake great care during your missions!\n\n\n\n\n Shintiara exists, through time, in eight different Ages, though some documents state otherwise. \nAll Recruits can accumulate tachyon energy in the form of Paradox Points. They can spend Paradox Points to activate many different effects, also called base temporal powers, such as Accelerate, Slow, Pass through a Veil, Peek into the Future and many more. \nThe only way to journey through time is via Veils, which as stated are the thinning of boundaries between different Ages and dimensions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Shintiara there are seven sentient races who live on the main continent and are directly involved in historical and temporal events: Humans, Darqarots, Garduans, Skirths, Wyspers, Zolkanians and Zyrkuls. \nDarqarots (playable). Biped humanoids with hooves and horns, the Darqarot are a race in rapid physical and social evolution, used as slaves by humans for centuries.\nGarduans (playable). Equipped with bat or demon-like wings and lean, skinny bodies, the Garduans are renowned for their warrior culture and ability with firearms and ranged weapons. Garduans are considered harbingers of misfortune by other races.\nSkirths (playable). Peoples of Shintiara call the Skith the Opposite People. This nickname has been given to them for two typical traits: the innate ability to climb upside down and the tendency to act contrary to any expectation. From childhood, a Skirth learns to smile instead of crying and often expresses itself by stating the opposite of what it thinks.\nHumans  are divided into many different playable Cultures, each with its own peculiarities and Social Traits.\nWyspers (playable). The mysterious Wysper are a race of spirits of light from the dimension of Spirits, also called the Otherworld. During the first phase of their life, for sixty years they take on a material body with humanoid shape of noble traits and white, luminescent skin.\nZolkanians (playable). Just by looking at one, a Zolkanian betrays its true \u201cextra- dimensional\u201d or \u201cextra-terrestrial\u201d origin. Quite short and slender in build, these humanoids possess a much larger bald head if compared to a human of the same size. Their skin ranges from blue, light blue and aquamarine.\n Zyrkuls (unlockable). Short in stature but with powerful muscles, it is said that Zyrkul are linked by a hive mind that, whenever necessary, takes over and controls them from afar. The colour of their scales seems to vary according to the role they play in the Hive, their social organization.\nEach of these races, as well as all sentient creatures on the planet, interact with each other also according to the culture that their communities possess.\nNew race: the Wyspers\n\nEvery race on Shintiara possesses an additional trait called Culture which represents what one\u2019s own native community deems useful or appropriate. There are eight types of culture and each character inherits their culture from the place or civilization they grow up in. One\u2019s own Culture and Temporal Renown guarantee access to Social Traits and Cultural Feats.\nNew race: the Garduans\nMagic and technology will fuse and become one in the more advanced ages of Shintiara. This has resulted in the generation of technological spells, which have special rules:  they may, for example, have properties as items do or hack into devices which have digital components. The Recruit\u2019s Guide to Shintiara: Crusade of Time will cover these and many other rules & options.\nNew Class: the Chronoguardian\n\nThe Recruit\u2019s Guide to Shintiara: Crusade of Time will contain 3 new classes (Chronoguardian, Voidwalker and Timedancer) numerous archetypes and backgrounds, as well as skills and spells from Shintiara\u2019s history.\nAbout the Chronoguardians \nFor a Chronoguardian time is always in danger. Not all of them agree on what the danger or its source is, but they all regard the flow of time as a river infected with the very idea of the Apocalypse. The main objective of chronoguardians is to keep Paradoxes and time travel under control, as well as to spy on the actions of the Void faction in order to prevent temporal collapse. \nWould you like more info? Take a look at the Quickstart and attached character sheets!\n\n\n\n\n\nEvery adventure or campaign in Shintiara treats the Apocalypse as one of the protagonists. The Apocalypse is expected at the end of the Eighth Age and the ways in which it will happen are uncertain. Certain events, however, might manage to shift it either forwards or backwards in time.\n                                The shifting of the Apocalypse is managed by the Chronicler via the Apocalypse Clock, a circle divided into the eight Ages of Shintiara and twenty-four circles or phases.\nThe Apocalypse Clock\nAll the rules and suggestions to manage the Apocalypse Clock will be insterted in the Chronicler's Codex rulebook. \n\n\nInterview with the team:\n\nExample of gameplay (Italian):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Funding Goal of the Campaign intends to cover the production costs, including (mainly) illustrations, graphics, game design, translations, and printing.\nWe decided to use any other funds to improve your gaming experience, upgrading the contents, and creating new adventures!

Lovecraft. Through investigation, awareness, recollection and action, the players will experience a time-bending and relentless scenario!\nThe scenario is set in the Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard close to the North Pole in the year 1993. The players are resourceful soldiers sent to explore the mysteries surrounding a secret Russian mine deep below the frozen landscape. As time is running out, the players need to stop an experiment gone horribly wrong; a warp in the time-space continuum that threatens to unleash the mad will of the daemon-sultan Azathoth.\nThe main mechanism of \u2018Svalbard\u2019 is to Explore, Die, Repeat. If you have seen the movie \u201cEdge of Tomorrow\u201d, played the board game \u201cTime Stories\u201d, read the book \u201cAll you need is kill\u201d or know the concept \u2018roguelike\u2019 from video games, that\u2019s what we\u2019re talking about. If you know none of it, here\u2019s a quick explanation:\nIn this scenario, the characters will die a lot. But it is not a permadeath; they \u201crespawn\u201d and bring back into the game their accumulated knowledge prior to their death needed to progress. As they start to uncover the secrets and puzzles of the scenario, they start to learn how to avoid their deaths altogether, and the goal of the scenario is no less than a \u201cperfect run\u201d where the players complete the entire scenario without a single death!\nThe layout of this book is centred around a specific concept; Rooms. Each page (or sometimes two pages) explains a specific room in the mine. Each room has challenges that need to be overcome, and information needs to be gained. The challenges are often lethal, but as said above; the characters are respawned if killed. Thus, they\u2019ll 'learn' how to deal with each room if they\u2019re killed, and upon their return after respawning, they\u2019ll know how to progress.\nYour players have never experienced anything like this in a role-playing game before. \nWelcome to \u2018Svalbard\u2019\n\n'Lovecraftian': Whereas our first scenario, 'Pax Cthuliana', was heavily influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos, 'Svalbard' takes a lighter approach. Yes, the world is threatened by the deity Azathoth, and yes, horror plays a crucial role, but 'Svalbard' cannot be said to be a classical Cthulhu scenario. It may easily be run by players/GMs without any knowledge of Lovecraft/Mythos at all.\nAction-oriented: 'Svalbard' demands an action-oriented approach. That's why 'Svalbard' comes with a set of pre-determined characters; a team of lethal, specialized, trained soldiers.\nSystem: 'Svalbard' comes with an included, very simplified game system. It is tailored to the action-paced story and the central 'Time Unit' mechanic. If you would like more dice rolling or adaption to your own preferred system, you'll find the scenario easily adaptable, as long as you incorporate the Time Unit mechanic.\nTime Unit mechanic: Our former scenario, \u2018Pax Cthuliana\u2019, could be played without a single die roll, as all progress was connected to handouts the players needed to decipher and deduct information from.\nIn \u2018Svalbard\u2019, we\u2019ve taken kind of a similar approach, based on our Time Unit mechanic. This mechanic does not demand any die rolls, only a tiny bit of bookkeeping. \nLet\u2019s explain: The players will enter Rooms, learn stuff, die, and later return to the same Rooms, but now with the knowledge that might keep them alive and helps them progress through the scenario.\nTo keep things tense, to encourage good judgement and to make smart choices, we\u2019re introducing the concept of a finite time; that is, the scenario must be completed within a set period of time, or else Azathoth is unleashed upon the world and the players lose the scenario!\nThis finite time is called Time Units (TU). The scenario starts at 8 TU before time runs out and they lose. As they explore and learn and do things, time will go, and TU might be lost. Inevitably, the characters will die/respawn during the game, but upon their return, they might now have the knowledge of how to reduce the amount of TU spent on different tasks.\nAn example: The characters see a computer they know holds a password they desperately need. To obtain the password, 1 TU is spent to work into its files to find it. You see? There is no die roll, only the expense of TU. But the best of all? If they get the password, die sometime later and then respawn, they already know the password, and does not have to access the computer at a later run! \nThis is the spirit of \u2018Svalbard\u2019; learn the secrets of the scenario, do smart choices, and allocate your TU wisely so you may complete the scenario within the allocated time and stop Azathoth!\nTo keep track of the spent TU, the scenario includes a simple TU track. Actually, we\u2019ve included several tracks, so you may choose the one you like (or create one of your own). As the game begins, place the included TU marker (or something of your own choosing, like an old coin or a dragon bone fragment) on the \u201c8\u201d space. As TU is spent, just move the marker down accordingly. They use 1 TU to do a task? Move the marker 1 TU down. If it reaches 0 before they\u2019ve completed the scenario, they\u2019ve lost.\nIf you are interested in the full intro story of the scenario, check out our Update # 7 \n\nWith help from you, unlock FREE ITEMS and make this scenario become even greater!\n\nUNLOCKED!!!!

The second token has UniToz written in Cyrillic letters; \u2018\u0423\u043d\u0438\u0422\u043e\u0436\u2019 (short for \u2018\u0443\u043d\u0438\u0447\u0442\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435'). In \u2018Svalbard\u2019, UniToz is the name of a military research project created back in 1953 by order of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. In the game, the research project unexpectedly threatens to free the daemon god Azathoth himself upon the world.\nThe third token displays our interpretation of the Elder Sign, as created by H. P. Lovecraft himself in 1926. First mentioned in his work \u2018The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath\u2019, it\u2019s a protection against the evil forces of the Mythos.\nYou can but these Tokens individually or as a collection of all three in a special made case.

He grew up playing computers such as C64 and Amiga, role-playing games as AD&D an Call of Cthulhu and board games as Shogun and Axis & Allies. He is a senior high school teacher, the leader of the local gaming club, and still plays on computers, board games and RPGs as often as he can, at least once a week. He is proud to be a geek.\n\nEven Vinjor R\u00f8ssland is a co-author on 'Svalbard'. He is the creative mind behind the Insight Fantasy RPG and several other publications at drivethruRPG.com. He started playing RPGs back in the late 80s. Taking the GM-role some years later, he has entertained countless people through genres such as fantasy, sci-fi and horror. He has done all the layouts, bookbinding, advertising etc. for this scenario and campaign.\n\nJoseph Diaz created most of the art for our previous scenario 'Pax Cthuliana' and was rehired for 'Svalbard'. He has worked as a concept artist for productions like Game of Thrones, Warcraft, Europa Report and Sleepy Hollow. Introducing Mattias Zeballos and Megvin Gjovari, they have given life to 'Svalbard' with their powerful illustrations.\n\nTwo Starving Gnolls (TSG): When Jarle and Even sit down to talk, their heads spin with ideas. TSG was created to set those ideas into motion. As such, TSG functions as a development team to convert RPG ideas into playable material.

Halfway between the realms of life and death, a new civilisation of lost souls has sprung up under the thrall of a creature older than gods that calls itself The Wise Minister.\nIn Caverns, you play denizens of the city of Sepulchre, descendants of those plucked from their homes on the surface, trying to forge a new life in the darkness of the Underworld. If you\u2019re clever, quick, and fortunate, and you live long enough to find your niche, you might learn how you got here. Maybe you\u2019ll even set things right.\nCaverns of the Wise Minister\u2019s core funding goal is \u00a32,000 to produce PDF and physical versions of the 40,000+ word setting guide. The book includes 5 new playable races, 4 new subclasses, and 5 new backgrounds, as well as new monsters, spells, magic items, and equipment. Additionally, we have devised new, setting-appropriate mechanics for Social Standing and enhanced Darkness rules.\nWe want to go further. With your help, we\u2019ll produce a full, level 1-11 adventure path written by some of the best names in the business that explores the mysteries and dangers of the Underworld.\nOnce upon a time, there stood an elven city called Silverhome, and an aboleth and a deity vied for power over it. The god Empyrea struck down the aboleth, and in revenge it drowned her favoured city. The survivors set out for the Underworld to beg for mercy from the god of death and reclaim the souls of their beloved dead.\nThey never reached death\u2019s domain.\nInstead, they fell under the influence of the being called the Wise Minister, the same vengeful aboleth who had destroyed their home. They built a city in its domain, and it delights in keeping them deep below the earth, tormenting the god they have long forgotten. But that isn\u2019t true vengeance. That can only come when Empyrea is dead. She stole the Wise Minister\u2019s city, and it has nursed that grudge for millennia.\nTrapped between life and death, pawns in the games of gods and monsters, thousands of creatures eke out a living in the dark. Those in power know it was not always thus, but it serves their interests to have it remain so.\nSepulchre is a city based on grudges and lies. Stories set here deal with cycles, especially cycles of vengeance, and memory. The aboleth known as the Wise Minister remembers every offence committed against it and plans to avenge them. The cave elves believe its lies \u2014 and create a false narrative about their place in the city. Newcomers resent power structures they had no say in, and outsiders try to leave before they can get tangled in the city\u2019s web of traded favours and obligations.\nAdventures here feel stifling: there are always constraints, be they physical and environmental \u2014 no sky or sun, or dangerous monsters that limit how far it\u2019s safe to range outside the city. Specific themes include:\nPower corrupts. This is morally, spiritually, and physically true. The cave elves gained power from the Wise Minister, and independence through the transgressions of their first leader. The elves bear their own curse, their elders transforming into batlike monstrosities, and the Wise Minister\u2019s borrowed power comes with the requirement of complete obedience.\nWe are all connected. The Wise Minister\u2019s telepathy. The cave elves\u2019 reverie. The nix\u2019s psychic records encoded in coral and the collective wisdom of the uizet. Connections and the community of a shared psychic space are a solace in a dark place. Those connections create in-groups and out-groups, and suspicion between different factions.\nThe lies we tell ourselves. Our leaders are not monsters. Our homeland is gone. This is our home now. We are happy here. None of these things are true, but life would be unbearable if any of these illusions were pierced. Storytelling in Sepulchre should play heavily on confronting, or finding ways to avoid, uncomfortable truths that could shake the whole realm.\nCaught between life and death. Sepulchre and its surrounds are literally, physically, close to the realm of the God of Death. Death is close at hand, and final. For newcomers from the realms above, coming to Sepulchre feels like dying: they are ripped, suddenly and without warning, away from their loved ones and the world they knew. Grief and sorrow are everyday.\nOlefsian, ruler of Sepulchre. Art credit: Liz Gist\nThis book is going to be beautiful. We\u2019ve got some samples of just how it\u2019s going to look when it\u2019s done. None of this is final, but it\u2019s the direction we\u2019re heading in.\nENNIE-nominated designer Jessica Marcrum (Book of Seasons, Uncaged, Age of Sigmar: Soulbound) has written a level zero adventure designed to introduce Caverns of the Wise Minister.

Music is by Chris Bissette (The Wretched, amongst other outstanding projects), and you can hear a 2-minute taster in the campaign video on this age. \nFor this campaign, we are trialing Kickstarter's new add-ons feature!

Set in a world overrun by greenery, Wildsea uses a narrative, fiction-first d6 dicepool system that draws inspiration from games like Belly of the Beast, Blades in the Dark, and 13th Age. \nClickthrough to access the Quick Start Rules!\nThis campaign's goal is to raise funds to produce and print a 1st edition of the Wildsea RPG. This is a production Kickstarter: after the campaign closes, we'll be using the funds raised to create a fully realized beautiful rulebook. The budget goal of $15,000 represents the minimum amount needed to bring the book to life with the resources we currently have available. \nAny additional funds will be funneled back directly into the production of the RPG, adding more content, art, professional layouts, and an offset print run to deliver a premium tabletop roleplaying book that will be a showcase for any collection. \n Some three hundred years ago the empires of the world were toppled by a wave of fast growing greenery, a tide of rampant growth spilling from the West known as the Verdancy. \nNow chainsaw-driven ships cut their way across dense treetop waves, their engines powered by oilfruit, rope-golems, honey and pride.\nYou play a wildsailor, part of a motley crew consisting of humanity's weathered descendants, cactoid gunslingers, centipedal fungi, silk-clothed spiderfolk, and other, stranger things. \nWith your fellow crewmembers, you'll journey across the lingin' tide discovering charts, pursuing drives, and avoiding mires of the deep. \nThe Wildsea hungers and grows, roots sinking deep into the forest floor as the waves above ripple with life.  What will you discover in its depths? \n\n\n\nCheck out our Actual Play on the Don't Forget Your Towel Podcast!\nThe Wildsea is a fiction-first roleplaying game with narrative and character decisions driving your interaction with the mechanics of the Wild Words engine. The game uses a d6 narrative dicepool system that constantly pushes the story forward.\nAt character creation, players select a Bloodline, Origin and Post, each with a variety of options to inform and customize a character's background and playstyle:\nThe four core bloodlines of the Wildsea: the cactuslike Ektus, Ardent survivors, hive spider Tzelicrae, and fungi Gau.\n Your Edges represent the way in which your character is most used to solving problems. Your Grace, Iron, Instinct, Sharps, Teeth, Tides, or Veils. \nYour Skills are more specific areas in which your character has training or a natural advantage. Things like Climbing, Charming, Cooking, Breaking, or Scavenging. \nYou also have Aspects - gear, traits, or companions - that can be used, expended, or damaged throughout the course of play. \n Resources are useful oddities, short term expendables used for things like whispers, scavenge, and specimens.\nYour known Languages allow you to engage with different people and cultures in the diverse world of the Wildsea.  \nFinally, your Drives and Mires define your personality, motivation, and long term goals. \nEach crew will also have their own ship, a vessel capable of braving the unique challenges of the lingin tide. You might cut a path with a chainsaw-ridged prow, drag yourself with hooks and grapples or scuttle from branch to branch on insectile limbs.\nCustomize and upgrade  your ship by designing its Size, Frame, Hull, Bite, and Engine, and outfitting  it with different Fittings. Make it your home on the waves! \nStories and Characters develop as the crew pursues milestones, while time in the game is abstracted through three distinct phases: scenes, montages, and journeys. \nThe Wildsea will initially be presented in landscape, 11.5 x 8.5'' inch (~29 x 22 cm) hardcover book with around 200 pages of mostly black and white interiors punctuated by full color spread chapter headings.  \nMockup. Artwork and Design of Physical Book not final. Design shown is a hardcover perfect bound edition that would only be unlocked should we reach certain stretch goal milestones.\nAs the campaign grows, so will the quality and contents of the book. Should we reach certain stretch goals, we will upgrade the physical book to a 3-piece clothbound, full colour, sewn book sure to be a centerpiece of any collection. For more information, see the Stretch Goals section below.\nThe initial funding goal of $15,000 represents the bare minimum for the creators to produce and print physical copies of the book and recoup the funds already expended by the creator to the artists. \n\nCommunity Copies: At Collector's Edition and above tiers, we'll include additional digital Community Copies to be claimed by the public. Community Copies provide a way for those with less means to enjoy content and are a feature of Itch.io. When our page on the platform goes live, we'll add Community Copies commensurate with the amount of backers we have at higher tiers.\n\nShipping is not included in the pledge levels for this campaign and will be calculated and added on when we are ready to ship via Backerkit. This is a production Kickstarter and it may be up to a year before we start shipping out physical copies. It would therefore be inaccurate  to include the shipping rates as part of the funds raised for this campaign. \nAs in: you will not be charged additional VAT or Customs Taxes on your shipped goods.\nMythopoeia is currently in the process of partnering with fulfillment centers based all over the world to deliver customs-friendly shipping, including to Europe and Oceania.  According to our most recent quotes, packages for a <1kg (~2 lbs) package average around $7.50 to the USA, UK, Germany, and Netherlands and around $20 to Oceania and Canada. \n\nShipping has been quite tumultuous in recent months due to the ongoing pandemic and politics. Canadian postage from the USA seems to have taken a dramatic spike over the past four years. This is a problem we are actively working on. If you know any local Canadian or Australian distributors for USA goods, we would love to hear from you! \nClick through to Felix's Twitter.\nClick through to Pierre's Instagram.\nClick through to Omercan's Instgram.\nClick through to Katy's Instagram.\nClick through to Kyllian's Instagram.\nClick through to Alexis' Instagram.\nClick through to Liam's Soundcloud.\nClick through to say hello to Ric [@Cerebric] on the Discord!\nClick through to Ryan's Twitter.\nClick through to Mythopoeia.\nClick through to Mythopoeia's Itch.io\nIf we reach our initial goal of $15,000, we'll include new Origins for character creation not seen in the Quickstart Rules! We'll also throw in a set of digital wallpapers and other high resolution Wildsea Artwork as part of the Kickstarter exclusive digital bonuses. \nAt $17,000 we will be able to commission a full Wildsea Soundtrack from the amazing Liam P. Vaughan, composer of Thrash, Tangle, Sink, the song used in our Kickstarter video!  \nAt $20,000 we'll be able to afford to turn the book from mostly black and white to full colour! To do so will require us to go back and recolour about two thirds of our total art assets - a significant endeavor! \n\nAt $25,000 we'll bring on board a Professional Layout Artist to help design the final look of the book!  We'll also produce and release Virtual Play Surfaces to facilitate online play on your favorite platforms of choice.\n\nAt $30,000 we'll be able to raise the rates of our artists as well as commission an expanded bestiary from bestiary artist Katy Shmeckerel (@schmeckerel)! \nAt $32,000 we'll release the SRD for the Wild Words Engine, allowing you to hack and release your own games! To celebrate this milestone, we'll also be commissioning Creators to create new content for the Wildsea including new factions, beasts, and  ships, and perhaps even additional Reaches...\nAt $35,000 we'll be able to upgrade the specs of both the Standard and Collector's Edition of The Wildsea! This may include things like an offset print run, three piece clothbound hardcover, and embossed finish. \nAt $37,000 we'll include a chapter on Arconautics - the study of the weird and strange. Arconautics presents an array of additional options for both players and Fireflies that want to embrace the extraordinary - alchemists, augurs, ironbound automatons, manipulators of metal and plantlife. Includes new bloodlines, origins, posts, skills, and hazards! \nAt $40,000 we'll be able to spare no expense when it comes to printing the book, including being able to lower our carbon footprint by printing locally. We will also will look into more printing bells and whistles like foil stamping, endsheets, booksmarks, et. all.\nAt $42,000 we'll be able to bring on even more Creators to create content for the Wildsea! We'll announce if we get here, but preliminary discussions have included an appendix on gardening, and ventures deep into the undiscovered waves...\nAt $45,000 we'll be able to raise the rates of our artists yet again and commission more artwork for the final book. Perhaps we might even be able to include an illustrated Chart or three...\n At $50,000 we'll be able to produce a fully realized actual play of the Wildsea for your viewing enjoyment! This may include partnering with an existing show or perhaps striking out on our own. Details to come if we get here! \nAt $55,000 we'll be able to add a set of ship creation options, unique hazards and Firefly guidance based around the ideas of exploring the upper skies and lower branches. Now we just have to work out what to call a submarine... \nAt $60,000 we'll set aside a portion of the funds to subsidize the shipping fees for the project. This will hopefully enable us to lower shipping rates by $1-2 dollars per package, depending on a number of factors. Internally, what this means is that no matter what we will allocate a portion of our funds raised to shipping costs, which we'll then pass the savings unto you when it comes time to charge and fulfill via Backerkit.\nAt $65,000 we're going to pay Wildsea creator and designer Felix Isaacs more! The majority of funds raised from  the last stretch goal to this one will go directly to Felix in addition to his overall cut of the campaign and future sales.\nAt $70,000 we'll be able to raise the per word rate of the various designers and writers we are bringing on board to the Wildsea (which I promise we'll announce soon in a future update). Freelance game design is not exactly a lucrative profession but we're committed to building a bigger tent and providing opportunities to others when and where  we can.\nAt $75,000 we'll be able to design and manufacture a set of custom  wooden Wildsea Dice which will be available to purchase as an Add-On via BackerKit. This is something we wanted to have ready for the start of the campaign but alas simply ran out of time. Nonetheless, reaching this tier will give us the resources to begin the process of making these dice in earnest.\nHandcrafted dice from Might Dog Games. Now available as add-ons.\nAt $85,000 we'll include the last content update for the core book: The Farthest Reaches. Consider this an expansion of the Arconautics chapter already unlocked detailing the furthest corners of the Wildsea. More obscure content, to be announced if we get here!\n\nFinally, our ultimate goal at $100,000 will allow us to lower shipping rates yet again, reducing the rates by another $1-2 per package. In the interim, the funds raised to get this tier will allow us to pay the principles of the project just that little bit more :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a production Kickstarter, the primary risk is that the book still needs to be created in full before printing and distribution can begin. For that reason we typically like to run print Kickstarters where the product is already completed instead, but sometimes that's not possible when launching a new and amazing project like the Wildsea! \n\nRay and Vince bring over six years and 13 projects worth of crowdfunding experience into this campaign. We know how to produce beautiful books and communicate with our backers and fans on every step of the process. We strive to have 100% satisfaction guaranteed when it comes our projects - ask our past backers about their experience! \n\nWe gave ourselves a wide breadth for the campaign - almost a full year - but should we meet and exceed our goals, we will use that time to build a better world filled with gorgeous art and a handsome book you'll be proud to have on your shelves. There is always the possibility that things may be delayed further. We will do our best to deliver in a timely matter while maintaining transparency and striving always for the highest quality work possible.\n\nShipping is another major uncertainty heading into the year 2021. The state of global politics means that things like postal rates and customs and tariffs are in a constant state of flux. Brexit and the USA/China trade war may impact the printing and manufacturing of the Wildsea in ways we cannot foresee. Nonetheless, we will do our best to navigate these uncharted waters, just as we have done for the past four years. \n\nBacking this project means you're not only buying the book, but helping produce the work to make it real. For that we can't thank you enough. Together, we'll build something amazing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "HARDSHIP TIER", "descp": "A single copy of the Wildsea: RPG Digital PDF at a reduced price for those experiencing financial hardship.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Wildsea RPG [Digital PDF]\nStretch Goal Bonuses [Book Upgrades]", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}], "stat": ["458 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "DIGITAL COLLECTION", "descp": "A single copy of the Wildsea: RPG Digital PDF.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Wildsea RPG [Digital PDF]\nStretch Goal Bonuses [Book Upgrades]", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["509 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "PRINT EDITION", "descp": "A single copy of the physical edition of the Wildsea: RPG.

For years, fans have praised both the game\u2019s effortless explanation of the Powered by the Apocalypse engine and the groundbreaking content on race and urban communities, leading Urban Shadows to be a favorite of urban fantasy gamers, podcasters, and streamers alike.\nNow\u2014more than six years later\u2014we are returning to the dark streets of the city for Urban Shadows: Second Edition, updating the game\u2019s rules, look, and tools to better support moving stories of political urban fantasy. Featuring new playbooks, new faction mechanics, and completely revised materials from first edition, Urban Shadows 2E will thrust you into the danger and drama of the city like never before!\nUrban Shadows is a political urban fantasy tabletop roleplaying game in which mortals and supernaturals alike vie for power in a modern-day city. Vampires, faeries, hunters, wizards, and more clash in the shadows...or make backroom deals for their piece of the streets and skyscrapers. No one is ever safe, and everything is always at stake.\nIn Urban Shadows, you play unique and powerful archetypes, protagonists who are attuned to the supernatural world. While the mortal world remains ignorant of the struggles of the city\u2019s supernatural denizens, you are caught in the middle of the physical conflicts and political drama of the city\u2019s past, present, and future.\nYou might be a spectre bound to an artifact, unable to move on until you\u2019ve resolved your trauma. Or you might be a clever vampire who controls the best blood supply in the city, caught up in a war between your kind and those who hunt you. Or you might be a veteran of your city\u2019s ancient conflicts, someone who got out of the game but keeps getting drawn back in by friends and allies.\nNo matter who you are, you contain within you the power to shape the city\u2019s destiny. What future will you choose? And what will your victories cost you?\nUrban Shadows is based on the Powered by the Apocalypse system used by tabletop RPGs like Apocalypse World, Dungeon World, and many of Magpie Games\u2019s own titles such as Masks: A New Generation, Root: The RPG, and Zombie World. The game uses the core framework of that system to provide a strong, simple way to create your own stories of political urban fantasy. You\u2019ll create a character using one of several archetypes, and then you\u2019ll take action, rolling two six-sided dice to resolve the outcomes of dangerous and difficult situations.\nUrban Shadows creates stories like those you\u2019d find in Constantine, Diableros, The Dresden Files, The John Wick franchise, The Last Witchhunter, Lost Girl, and The Wire. \nIn Urban Shadows, the city is a living, breathing character all its own. It hides dark desires, wicked deeds, and devious schemes, its shadowy tendrils a danger to mortals and supernaturals alike. Some residents have sacred sanctums or secure workshops\u2014places to weather the storms of the city\u2014but a sprawling metropolis lies just outside those little nooks, caring little if you prosper\u2026or bleed out in the gutters.\nBut nobody faces the city alone. Even the humblest of imps has a small community, a circle of those who can offer solace in the face of problems and danger. But community is a double-edged sword\u2014demanding as much as it gives\u2014and the needs and desires of those same circles constantly shape and reshape the vibrant urban landscape of the city. Nothing lasts forever, but the city turns over nearly every night, different forces laying different claims to you and yours.\nThe city hungers. Will you sate its gnawing desires? Or will your enemies make you the feast?\nThe schemes and plots of supernatural beings have been a part of the city for as long as anyone can remember. The faces at the top may shift and change with the tides of fortune, but rarely does something occur in the mortal world without some push from those who lurk in the shadows. A new subway system? A contested election? A bank robbery? Nothing is what it seems.\nBut what is mere money or prestige to wizards, ghosts, and faeries? Who cares about cash or elections when trafficking in human souls or exploring other dimensions? The supernatural forces of the city\u2014and the mortals who deal with them\u2014know only one real currency: debt.\nDebt is the power to influence those who owe you, the chits you call in to get things done, the ties that bind you to the rest of the city, and the proof that your word is strong and your bonds unbreakable. There are few true friends in the city, but your debtors always want to see you survive\u2014you can\u2019t pay up if you\u2019re dead.\nBut there are other ways to triumph in the city beyond the economy of favors and patronage. Cruel rituals. Dark secrets. The temptations of the monster within you. Those who seek power at any cost will find no end to the magics and mysteries available for the merest price of a soul.\nThe streets bleed shadows\u2014your debtors always around the corner\u2014as the city threatens to swallow you whole. Will you die a hero\u2026 or live long enough to become the villain? Will you fight the darkness\u2026or beg for power? The choice is yours.\nOver the past five years, Magpie Games has developed and created multiple games that broke boundaries and redefined what PbtA can do. Now, we think it\u2019s time to apply the lessons we\u2019ve learned to Urban Shadows, making a game that\u2019s tighter and easier to run, but also filled with new ideas and improvements, including new tools for players and GMs. We\u2019re also excited to create a beautiful new book with visionary art and fantastic graphic design. In short\u2026 we\u2019re making Urban Shadows 2E because we\u2019re thrilled to revisit and refine our work!\nHere\u2019s a quick list of the major changes, many of which are already available in the quickstart:\nrevised basic moves, including new versions of turn to violence and let it out \nrevised playbooks, including rebuilt versions of The Hunter and The Oracle \ntwo brand new playbooks: The Sworn (Power) and The Imp (Wild) \nchanging Factions to Circles\u2014see below\u2014and adding Circle Status to represent standing\na new downtime phase of the game focused on player-facing city moves and rumors\nreplacing Storms with a new MC-facing faction turn, including new faction moves\nexpanded MC tools for generating your city and Circles at the start of play\nWe\u2019re also adding a new mechanic to bring PCs into contact more often with each other: City Hubs. Cities are enormous spaces, and we found (in US1E) player characters could sometimes retreat to their different corners of the cityscape, interacting only with their own worlds and not with each other. With City Hubs, we want to create smaller, expandable environments to focus play and create drama. These Hubs\u2014described below\u2014position characters in neighborhoods, institutions, and community spaces in which they interact more frequently and avoid sessions in which PCs rarely come into contact and conflict.\nDownload the quickstart for a chance to test out some of these new features! We\u2019ll be previewing more of them during the campaign, and we\u2019re excited to get your feedback and refine Urban Shadows even more. Thank you to everyone who has given us feedback on 1st Edition since 2015!\n In Urban Shadows, your characters juggle relationships and obligations, seeking allies and opportunities, cashing in debts along the way to get things done. When you seize the day, you reshape the city in your image and unleash your powers on those who stand against you; when your enemies move and hunt, you do your best to stay ahead of the oncoming storm.\nUrban Shadows uses the Powered by the Apocalypse framework to resolve interesting moments of uncertainty through moves, bits of mechanics that say: \u201cWhen you do [x], [y] happens.\u201d Each move trigger\u2014the \u201cWhen you do [x]\u201d part\u2014is designed to help point at moments of uncertainty, when neither the players nor the GM know exactly what happens next. Some examples of such moments include:\nWhen you throw a punch at a loudmouthed werewolf in a demonic club\nWhen you plead with the wizard\u2019s council to return a tome of magic stolen from you\nWhen you try to escape the evil ritual you stumbled onto in the city\u2019s sewers\nWhen you ask one of your companions to forgive the debt your fae lover owes them\nWhen you trigger a move\u2014when you perform the action described in the move\u2019s trigger\u2014then the rest of the move kicks into effect, often requiring a die roll. You roll 2d6 (two six-sided dice) and add in one of your stats to find out what happens.\nEvery playbook has four stats: \n Blood is the measure of your fight or flight instincts. It tells us how tough, dangerous, coiled, and quick to act your character is in a perilous situation.\n Heart is the sum of your passion, charm, and charisma. It tells us how proficient your character is at getting what they want through negotiation and persuasion.\n Mind is a reflection of your critical thinking and analysis. It tells us how perceptive your character can be and how good they are at manipulating others through deceit.\n Spirit is a gauge of your connection to the \u201cother\u201d and your force of will. It tells us how focused your character is under pressure and what kind of power they can unleash.\nEach stat is ranked from -3 to +3. You add your stat to some rolls when you trigger certain moves. For example, when you turn to violence, you roll 2d6 + Blood.\nOn most moves, if you get a 10 or higher (10+), things go your way! If you get a 7-9, you get what you were after, but usually with some cost or complication. If you get a 6 or lower, that\u2019s called a miss, and the GM gets to tell you what happens next as things spiral out of control. \nUrban Shadows has basic moves for all the usual conflicts in urban fantasy\u2014fighting, lying, escaping, magic, and more\u2014along with special moves for managing debts and your relationships with communities at large.  \nThe city is a fierce cesspool of politics and corruption, but there are clear connections and boundaries between like-minded residents, spheres of influence that make up the scope of politics within the city. Most call these divisions Circles, loose political groupings that illustrate the differing affiliations and loyalties in the world, each one a community with its own internal politics and dramas. The Circles are:\nIn addition to the main stats, each character also has ratings (from -3 to +3) for their Circles, measures of how well the character understands each specific community. A character with a high rating in a Circle has contacts and connections within it, and can easily interpret its political information; a character with a low rating in a Circle doesn\u2019t understand how that Circle works or who the power players are within that community.\nCircles aren\u2019t organizations or formal alliances; they are more like broad communities or subcultures. The disagreement between two members of the same Circle may be as\u2014or more\u2014intense than any conflict between two differing spheres. A werewolf and a vampire both hail from Night, but that doesn\u2019t mean they get along. It only means they understand each other...and the violence inherent in the language of their streets.\nYet there are factions within each Circle capable of acting in unison, alliances who can shape the city\u2019s future\u2014werewolf packs, witch covens, faerie courts, and more. In Urban Shadows: Second Edition, we\u2019re giving GMs new tools to support those factions in a \u201cfaction turn\u201d between sessions. We\u2019re also giving players new tools to get stuff done in downtime, acting on the rumors they heard about what the factions have done in the past week or two of offscreen activity, all fueling the drama of the city and the power players have to shape the setting.\nUrban Shadows uses archetypes (The Wolf, The Wizard, The Oracle, etc.) to help players create characters quickly and easily. These archetypes are only ever a starting point; you can always bring in different myths, legends, and ideas to make your character entirely your own.\nCharacters often acquire abilities and powers from other archetypes and may even change archetypes over the course of play. As your character advances, you may also find reasons to retire to safety, securing that character\u2019s place in the city as you create a new character to continue your group's story.  \nAbsolute power...corrupts absolutely. Urban Shadows features a dynamic corruption mechanic, tracking your character's descent into darkness. When you take a life, give in to your monstrous nature, or cross a line you shouldn't cross, you mark corruption. As you gain corruption, you unlock new and potent powers, allowing your character to get what they want\u2014at the cost of further corruption. The dark side of your nature bears productive fruit.\nPower is never free, though. Cross the line too often and you lose your character to the darkness, handing them over to the GM for them to play as a threat. Corruption is a downward spiral threatening to push you over the edge, and not everyone is cut out to make it back from the brink. As your character gains new abilities fueled by the growing darkness within, you face a difficult choice: will you give up what you've gained to save yourself? \nCorruption also encourages you to play to your archetype. Each archetype contains unique boundaries and taboos that define when you mark corruption. Life is always sacred, but werewolves, mages, and faeries all face unique temptations while stalking the city's streets.\nCities are giant, complex networks of interconnected communities caught in an almost constant state of change. In order to focus your characters\u2019 conflicts and provide reasons for the players to consistently play together across those spaces, Urban Shadows 2E uses City Hubs\u2014dynamic sections of urban life that frame the story you\u2019re telling together without cutting you off from the rest of the city\u2019s potential.\nA City Hub isn\u2019t just a physical district or area of your city. Instead, each Hub is a collection of institutions, relationships, and anchors\u2014important NPCs\u2014that create a background for the action in your story. Even better, Hubs can be added over the length of a campaign, expanding the city with new locations, conflicts, and NPCs as your story progresses. \nUrban Shadows 2E features four City Hubs, each dominated by one of the four Circles:\nCity Hall (Mortalis)\nDowntown (Night)\nThe University (Power)\nThe Arts District (Wild)\nPerhaps your Tainted is a student at the local university, the same campus that lies within the Wolf\u2019s territory...and the same institution at which the Wizard recently started working as a professor. Or maybe your Oracle has an occult bookstore downtown in the same office building in which the Sworn is regularly summoned to meet with the wizard\u2019s council, just down the street from the family restaurant in which the Aware still waits tables.\nHubs are also a flexible tool for structuring your campaign as a whole. You can use two different Hubs set in the same city for different campaigns, you can grab elements from any Hub to use as inspiration for your campaign, or you can expand your campaign to include new Hubs as your city grows. We\u2019ll release new Hubs through this campaign as stretch goals and as digital supplements after the Kickstarter.\nPeople have been playing Urban Shadows since 2013, and we love the stories they\u2019ve told during that time.

After the Kickstarter is over, we will use Backerkit to collect address information, handle add-ons and pre-orders, and charge you for shipping. The pledge manager will also allow backers to upgrade their pledge after the campaign is closed.\nWe expect basic shipping for the US2E Corebook to be roughly $10 US Domestic / $15 International Reshippers (CA/EU/UK/AU) / $20 Rest of World. Shipping for add-ons and physical stretch goals will raise the price for shipping an additional $5-$10, depending on the number and weight of the additional items. Our current plan is to ship everything\u2014the core game, all add-ons, all stretch goals\u2014in a single shipment.\nAll basic shipping is US/EU/CA/UK/AU-friendly. We will cover the cost of customs and VAT for those regions, and our reshippers will ensure that you receive the book from a local address within the region. Basic international shipping will not include tracking numbers, but our reshippers are quite fast at delivery!\nIf you are interested in upgrading to faster shipping or shipping that includes international tracking information through FedEx or DHL, you can indicate that you would like \"Advanced Shipping\" in our pledge manager. Upgraded shipping is likely to incur customs and VAT charges.\nRetail shipping for this campaign is free. You will not be charged for shipping if you pledge at a retail tier, even if you are an international backer. Instead, we\u2019ll cover the shipping as a thank you for supporting our work. We know operating a retail store is hard work even in the best of times, and we appreciate you all a ton!\nAll PDF products will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG. We will deliver coupon codes for you to add Urban Shadows 2E to your library via Backerkit digital downloads.

Pursuing power, prestige, and enlightenment - humanity is struggling to find a new place and purpose in a vast and unfamiliar cosmos. Players can focus on the personal struggles and stories of their characters or expand their scope putting emphasis on the fate of humanity as a species and the part they play in this.\nThe princely envoy leans over the gently swaying railing of the massive vessel, his gaze taking in the bustling Dhaarese docks hazily bathed in the dwindling light of the setting second sun of Llyhn.\nA faint sense of contempt and annoyance emanates from his posture as his eyes swerve towards the opposite shore and distant Khameeliyah district. The ruined tower, barely visible among the palaces and villas, is a stark reminder of the envoy\u2019s last visit to the city of the Unseen Rulers.\nSuddenly distracted from its musings by a putrid stink oozing from the nearby island district - known locally as Kimah - the majestic figure lifts an intricately woven and embroidered shawl to cover its delicate features as it turns toward the waiting Je\u2019ehl posse. \u201cFind them or risk your master\u2019s ire!\u201d\nThe envoy\u2019s gaze turns back to Dhaarese as the Je\u2019ehl leap into the waiting dinghies. \u201cIt\u2019s time to hunt humans again\u201d shouts the leader, securing her three-bladed dagger to her hip, \u201c\u2026and remember, we need them alive!\u201d\n\"Black Void: Under Nebulous Skies\" is the eagerly-anticipated sourcebook and campaign for the Black Void role-playing game. \nPacked with new setting material, new character options including playable halfblood selections, and the first part of the grand campaign trilogy; this book is a must-have for Black Void fans.\nThe book's 250+ pages will have abundant beautiful art, detailing new creatures, sentient species, maps, a deep-dive into the Kimah and Dhaarese districts, intriguing NPC's and much, much more.\nDivided into three main sections, this book has something for everyone! An exciting player's options section, a comprehensive travelogue and the first part of the Grand Campaign Trilogy, that will be continued in future volumes.\n\nCrammed with new options for character creation, the Players option is a treasure trove for players and Arbiters alike.\nSeveral new Talents, Skills and Attributes give players a wider selection for character individualisation than ever before. While new halfblood background options such as Talath-kin and Je'ehl-kin now enable players to access and connect with some of the predominant species of the Eternal City.\n\nThe new Attributes allow players to make their characters even more otherworldly and exotic than before, with such options as Symbiotic bond or detachable limbs.\nVarious novel Esoteric Attributes such as translucence allow players and Arbiters to create truly alien characters and NPC's to populate their adventures.\nTen new exotic weapons, such as the Suwayyah dagger, make combat even more interesting (and deadly) than ever before.\nNew Combat specialisations give battle-oriented characters a more comprehensive range of possibilities to employ than ever before.\nA deeper look into travelling the Void, as well as the vessels and crews, give Arbiters and players further possibilities for exploring the worlds beyond Llyhn. \nA comprehensive list of Void vessels, crew options, and vessel upgrades enables players and Arbiters to build their own Void vessels for expeditions into the oblivious depths.\nThis section is an in-depth guide, detailing two of the most exhilarating districts of Llyhn the Eternal: Kimah and Dhaarese.\nImmerse yourself in the perilous underworld of the Kimah district, where thugs and goons hang on every corner, doom-spouting prophets vie for your soul and beggars grasp for your purse. Visit a multitude of enticing and unnerving hidden dives, where shady patrons know secrets best kept in the dark. And peruse the plazas and obscure shops peddling junk, contraband, and filched goods, with the occasional hidden treasure amongst the rubbish.\nThe Dhaarese district is \u2013 in the eyes of some \u2013 the life-nerve of the Eternal City. It is here that the bulk of the massive Red Galleys and other prominent Void vessels put into port. Ships from across the known Cosmos unload their cargoes of rare and exotic substances, objects, and artefacts from faraway worlds while the otherworldly crew bring tales of distant lands, wonders and horrors.\nThe chapter provides a comprehensive look into locations such as the Feeradani enclave, The midnight market, Beggars Court, the Wharves, and many other places. While notable personages, prevalent factions, maps, building layouts provide everything you need to bring the meanest districts of Llyhn to life.\n\u201cThe distant thunder is barely audible over the pouring rain as you move to stand solemnly amongst the gathered mourners. A simple litter holding the shrouded body rests nearby next to a shallow hole and a heap of piled mud and clay. The downpour has soaked the linen covering the body, showing her sunken features, and smearing the funerary cosmetics unto the cloth, giving it the eerie semblance of a skull.\u201d\n- Introduction to \"Under Nebulous Skies: Scene 1\".\n\"Under Nebulous Skies\" is the first part of a Grand campaign trilogy, continued in future releases. The campaign is intended for newly created characters with an engaging storyline taking the protagonists on a harrowing and wondrous journey into the depths of Llyhn, and beyond the Eternal City. \nTrue to form, this Black Void adventure allows players to employ their diplomacy, stealth, combat skills, social proclivities, powers, and any other desperate means as they seek to unravel the mystery thrust upon them and confront the horrors and cruelty lurking under the surface of Llyhn and in the Cosmos at large.\nThe characters can explore multiple locations in Kimah and Dhaarese, interacting with a vast and colourful NPC gallery as the story takes them deep into Llyhn, and later to a Ka\u2019Alum federation world and beyond as they seek to uncover the ominous aspirations of a shadowy perpetrator with its gaze set firmly on the descendants of Earth.\nThe global logistics and trade situation is fluctuating and it is difficult to predict shipping costs for when we begin fulfilment in 2021. However, we are committed to getting the physical books as cheaply and efficiently into your hands as possible and are partnering with a trusted logistical company to do so.\nShipping will be charged in the Pledge Manager after the campaign is over based on your pledge and selected physical add-ons (if any).\nThe below are estimated regional shipping costs based on current rates for a single Black Void: Under Nebulous Skies (hardback) copy.\nEU \u2248 $16  |  UK \u2248 $13  |  US \u2248 $20  |  RoW \u2248 $20+\nIf you are intrigued but want to know more before diving in, you can download the FREE Quickstart and accompanying adventure.\nIf you want to grab the Core Rulebook or another Black Void product while you are at it, there is a 15% DISCOUNT on all Black Void adventures, screens, dice, and so on for the entirety of the Kickstarter campaign on the MODIPHIUS WEB SHOP and DRIVETHRURPG.COM", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBlack Void: Under Nebulous Skies is currently 60% written and edited, with significant amounts of artwork either done or WIP.

As they get closer and closer to the location's heart, it does everything it can to tear them apart, drive them mad, and\u2014if they\u2019re lucky\u2014kill them. It's a fantastic one-shot game which has seen great success through its recent Kickstarter and vibrant community of players and writers. Trophy Dark  creates a deeply atmospheric story through its narrative, theme-oriented structure and collaborative format.\nWhat is Alchemy? \nAlchemy will be an offset-printed, smythe-sewn, casebound book containing 9 brand-new incursions for Trophy Dark. Each never-before-seen scenario will allow you and your friends to take on the roles of desperate adventurers, pressing their luck in search of treasure and ultimately meeting their doom! The rules for Trophy Dark  will be included in Alchemy, so you do not need any other materials to play.\nCover concept (design not final)\nThe Incursions\nAL-IKSIR by Nicholas Masyk - Every 1,001 nights, the decaying lich-lords of the blighted city of Shi'Hadith descend from their hideous ziggurats to claim the AL-IKSIR, a bubbling cauldron of distilled souls brewed by faceless servitors in the festering heart of the ancient city. Only through the AL-IKSIR can they maintain their un-life for a further 1,001 nights. Only through grudging cooperation can they slither beneath the watchful eyes of those citizen-sorcerers who seek to claim lichdom for themselves. But there is scarcely enough AL-IKSIR to sustain even a single lich, and so only the most cunning might attain the ultimate goal of immortal life...\nBLACK STAR BOLT by Speak the Sky - DEATH RACE ON A DEAD PLANET UNDER FURIOUS STAR SPEWING DARKNESS. ORGY OF VEHICULAR VIOLENCE. WHAT GORGEOUS ALCHEMY MAKES FIRE AND LIGHTNING OF CRUDE & SAINTS AND HEROES OF KILLERS? DON'T ANSWER THAT LET'S DIE NOW! TOTAL CATASTROPHONY!\nCity of Gold by Amalie McKee - People you thought lost to the desert have been returning to your town of ne'er-do-wells with ears of gold and stories of angels. If you can retrace their steps and meet these angels yourself, you could return to society a wealthy hero, though you might sacrifice your humanity along the way.\nDIE, GRAVE ROBBER, DIE! by Michael Van Vleet - Resurrectionists have wrenched a corpse from out of the sacred soil where it was to find eternal rest. Crawl through rat-filled tunnels, wander among horrifying medical exhibits and storm the Flayed House of Dr. Galfani to get a mourning family their beloved relation back!\nLovelorn Lamentations by Pam Punzalan - The misery, rage, and mourning over love unrequited transformed a once cursed Princess into a feathered Lady of Tears. They say she was killed by the other gods already, and that the empty halls of her palatial home hold wonders that surpass human comprehension. Yet, all who have entered the place don't emerge the same, if they even emerge at all.\nillustration by RAPIDPUNCHES\nSusurrae by Madeleine Ember - Peel back the layers of self along this strange journey into the ruined St. Rheis Monastery, below it to the crypt-rot catacombs, and finally to the caverns of sight beyond seeing. What the treasure-hunters seek is truth - answers to the questions that will otherwise destroy them. Learning the truth can be dangerous.\nThe Dark Ascent by Natalie Ash - One day a year, the entrance to Mount Rames and the Path of Ascent is open. Within its halls, you and your fellow aspirants can gain ultimate power! But at what price?\nIncursions will feature fantastic illustrations (like this one from RAPIDPUNCHES)\nThe Queen of Swords, A Crown of Blades by Jamila R.

Why? Well, because we wanted a simple name that expressed the idea of a container for possibility. There are all kinds of ariums in our daily lives: aquariums, solariums, planetariums-- we looked up the Latin root, and it felt perfect!\nWe like to think of it like this: an Arium is an overarching world, universe, setting, and story/adventure seeds. It contains a collection of fascinating landmarks, people, and items too!\nArium is our answer to a simple question: why play in someone else's sandbox when the whole group can have a blast creating their own?\nThe Arium roleplaying game system is delivered in two full-color books (PDF or print + PDF). \nBoth Arium books will be available in print and PDF formats (mockup). Cover art by Andreas Rocha.\nArium: Create contains our refreshing and intuitive system for creating your own Arium, and you'll do it in one or two hours! The Arium you create will be unique to your group, and we promise everyone will be in love with it.  Create encourages folks to err on the side of awesome when collaborating to build their Arium, and the result is often surprising, but never disappointing! With a little work, you can take your resulting Arium and use it with any game system, or we've built in a seamless transition to our roleplaying rules found in Arium: Discover. \nInterior Arium: Create Art by Tithi Luadthong\nArium: Discover will work with any world. Take your favorite TV series,  your homebrew setting, or a movie/novel and quickly adapt to run it with Discover. Even better, build an Arium together using Arium: Create as a basis for your game. Arium: Discover builds on your universe by letting players take ownership of characters, items, and locations. Then, it's off to tell the story! Adventure, horror, and comedy are all on the table. Sci-fi, fantasy, and intrigue also possibilities! The streamlined d6-based system will feel familiar yet flexible. Additionally, the system of Boons and Banes encourages play that explores the important and meaningful by focusing on the relevant thematic elements of your Arium.  \nInterior Arium: Discover Art by Tithi Luadthong\nThe funds generated by this campaign will fund the printing of both Arium books. Any additional raised funds will allow us to create further products via stretch goals to enhance the Arium experience.\nArium: Create is complete and set for printing and digital distribution. Backers will receive their PDF copy the day we receive funds from Kickstarter. Discover is ready for editing and layout. Based on the length of the process preparing Create for printing and distribution, we suspect this will take a couple of months. As soon as both books are ready, we will submit the files to the printer and order shipping materials.\nThe physical books are digest-size saddle-stitched zines (5.5\" x 8.5\"). Arium: Create is 48 full-color pages, and Arium: Discover is approximately full-color 48 pages. We're printing them through Mixam using high-quality materials and finishes. Backers get all of this content, assuming we fund, and we have stretch goals in place that will add even more helpful tools to Arium.\nEither way, backers will receive both Create and Discover in PDF only for $8 or in print + PDF for $20!  \nInterior Arium: Discover Art by Tithi Luadthong\nThe Digital Arium\nFor those who prefer all digital, we've got you! Our digital tier includes both Arium: Create and Arium: Discover, so your group has everything they need to create your Arium and play in it. Backers will receive PDF copies of both books, as well as Arium reference materials and character/Arium sheets you can print out for the table or use on a laptop or tablet. Includes:\nArium: Create PDF\nArium: Create Quick Reference PDF\nArium: Create Results Sheet PDF\nArium: Discover PDF\nArium: Discover Quick Reference PDF\nArium: Discover Character Sheet PDF\nThe Physical Arium\nIf you collect paper rectangles or prefer to have a physical copy at your table while playing, we have a treat for you! We're printing Arium: Create and Arium: Discover in two high-quality saddle-stitched zines using Mixam (a US-based printer who uses all reusable materials and recycles everything they don't use). We're printing in full color on satin-finished paper with a soft-touch cover on high-density paper. These books will shine in your collection! Includes:\nPrinted Arium: Create 5.5\" x 8.5\" Saddle-Stitched Book\nPrinted Arium: Discover 5.5\" x 8.5\" Saddle Stitched Book\nArium: Create PDF\nArium: Create Quick Reference PDF\nArium: Create Results Sheet PDF\nArium: Discover PDF\nArium: Discover Quick Reference PDF\nArium: Discover Character Sheet PDF\n\"Arium: Create is a system where everyone at the gaming table has a vested interest in the setting they are creating. I found it easy to learn and use [and] I'm excited to put Arium: Create into greater use as I introduce the complete process to my gaming group.\" -Daniel Yocom Guild Master Gaming\n\"Arium: Create strikes me as a very good tool [...] I\u2019d say that even if I were to run a game in an established setting there are elements here that could be used in a session zero to establish some baselines and really explore what my group of players 'want\u2019 from a game. Indeed, I even think that some groups may find enjoyment from simply taking a session to use Arium: Create for nothing other than to let their imagination take hold.\" -Adam Brown Big Comic Page\nArium: Create is all about creating a world your entire group will love using a series of seven steps: Lacunae, Universal, Big Picture, Culture & Organizations, Landmarks, People, and Goodies. These are the essential elements of your Arium.\nDuring each step, the group works through three phases:\n1. First, they generate ideas. Fast! With a timer. Timing the ideating ensures the ideas aren't TOO perfect, and it keeps the session flowing along.\n2. During the second phase, the group reviews the ideas and combines them for one of two reasons. The first is when the concepts are samey, and the second, when a combination is fantastic and the creators agree their ideas should live or die together in the name of awesome.\n3. In the third and final phase, the group brings democracy to bear and votes for their favorite ideas. In this way, the best ideas remain a part of the Arium, AND they live on to be guiding concepts for the following steps! \nWhat happens if your favorite idea didn't make the cut? No problem! Each player receives three creation tokens they can use to make sure their chosen concept becomes part of the final Arium.\nFinally, we have rules for resolving player selection of People, Goodies, and even Locations to be theirs when the group moves on to roleplay in their fresh new Arium!\n\"I first played the RPG gem Arium: Create in its early stages, prior to its current state of elegance, and I've never laughed so hard nor felt so deeply for a new game. I had goosebumps - and that was before we went on to play the brilliant Discover. This is world-building and world-roaming genius.\"  -R. Jon Rock, tabletop gamer, author, RPG & short fiction editor, mental health nurse, professor, pretty good dude.\nArium: Create is complete and ready for digital delivery and printing.\nSee Arium: Create in action:\nArium: Discover is our D6-based roleplay rules that will feel familiar and play fast for streamlined gaming while enabling your group to explore the unique Arium they've created. In our skillless system, characters have four primary attributes: Mind, Body, Spirit, and Heart. The six secondary attributes are all derived from the primaries. They are Offense, Defense, Social, Willpower, Awareness, and Stamina.\nThe final and most crucial part of character creation is the process of assigning powerful Boons and Banes that bring your character to life and give them depth.\nLast, it wouldn't be Arium if we didn't have a little something up our sleeves to help players progress and effect the Arium around them. Everyone receives Discovery Tokens that enable them to add to the Arium and help the group along the way.\nArium: Discover is in final revisions before heading off to editing and layout. We expect to be ready to print by the end of 2020.\nSee Arium: Discover in action:\nSession 2: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQ_Hc3dzDUs\nSession 3: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHhJtw8PRhk\nSession 4: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jpHUzh4lyE\nWe do have stretch goals planned if we fund! Here's the great news about them: All backers at The Digital Arium pledge level and above get every stretch goal we reach. So please help us spread the word about Arium, and everyone wins! \n Arium: Flash, will be a guide to adapting an Arium to different types of plots for quick game sessions. Our talented stretch goal authors will each provide five story seeds within a theme or genre that you can use to jumpstart your story. At this level, we will add two new special guest authors: Jessica Marcrum and Jason H. Abbott. They will be contributing story seeds that evoke cute fantasy/horror and gonzo themes (respectively)!\nArium: Flash will be a free digital reward for all Digital Arium and higher backers.\nArium: Flash, will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Emmett Nahil and Kristen Devine. Emmett's themes will be post-apocalyptic, and Kristen's will be a mix of fantasy/sci-fi!\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Marlon Moss and Steffie de Vaan. Marlon is going to help us with modular plots for hard-boiled neo-noir Ariums, and Steffie will help groups who want to creep into gothic horror!\nArium: Bridge will be a guide to adapting an Arium to use with other RPG systems. Alan Bahr will create Bridges to 5e, Fate, and TinyD6.\nArium: Bridge will be a free digital reward for all Digital Arium and higher backers.\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Cat Evans and Mario Orteg\u00f3n. Cat will bring us high fantasy plots, and Mario is going to deliver sci-fi with a neat twist!\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from THREE new special guest authors: Chris Bissette, Lynne M. Meyer, and Katie Young. Chris comes to us with inspiration for stories of fae-folklore, Lynne is tackling swashbuckling themes, and Katie will work the western angle!\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Doug Levandowski and Arietta. Doug is going to give us an absurdist bent on victorian gothic, and Arietta is going to deliver a key element for some games, romance! \nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Pam Punzalan and Mitchell Wallace. We're hoping Pam will sneak in some spy/ops themes, and Mitchell will apply his wit to dark humor with a touch of horror!\nWe can't stress enough how much we love our gorgeous cover art! We hope you agree that this art is worth every penny.\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Ezzy Languzzi and R. Jon Rock. Ezzy will be bringing us the darker take on fantasy themes, while Rock is giving us his take on psychological thriller/crime stories. \nNo one likes errors and poorly worded sentences and insensitive writing. Adept Icarus is committed to doing the right thing by all of our players. Editing and sensitivity reads are an important part of that!\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Dan Wells and Emily Earhart. Dan's going to be taking on one of our favorites: cyberpunk! Meanwhile, Emily is going to bring us medieval/Arthurian story seeds... another Adept Icarus favorite. We're sure you won't be disappointed!\nThese are the folks who make it pretty. Otherwise, y'all would just be looking at a bunch of words. Ew. We appreciate them more than we can say!\nArium: Flash will now include story seeds from two new special guest authors: Sharang Biswas will join the team and write story seeds around the theme of heists! Second is Yvonne Hsiao (Sen H.H.S.) writing on the theme of Chinese Mythology!\nThat's right, we're doing it again! Arium: Flash will now include story seeds from THREE new guest authors: Mikhail Rekun will join the team and write story seeds around the theme of Eastern European Folklore!  Drew Gerken, one of the core Arium writers, is writing Supers/Mutants, and Horror author Caryn Larrinaga is contributing Modern Horror!\nThe one and only Diogo Nogueira will apply his skill for rules and toolkit design to one of the stickier parts of Arium character creation: creating your Boons and Banes.\nBeen following along with #OurAriumOurWay, and want to see even more from it? The splendid Elizabeth Chaipraditkul will write a complete adventure in this community-created Arium!\nArium: Evolve is the third major chapter of Arium that our team has been dreaming about since the beginning. It will include modular downtime rules for evolving and shaping your Arium between sessions. Evolve will help you keep your Arium fresh and exciting. This planned third core book will have a beautiful cover by Andreas Rocha. We don't plan to release Evolve until well into 2021 but thought we'd give our backers should we meet this lofty goal.\nArium: Evolve will be a free digital reward for all Digital Arium and higher backers.\n\n\n\nWill Munn - Lead Designer/Publisher - @WLMunn - Will is the owner of Adept Icarus.

Adrift between stars after an engine failure, your ship was attacked by a hostile alien lifeform. The crew are dead.\nYou thought you had won. You launched the creature out of an airlock, and that should have meant safety.\nIt didn\u2019t.\nThe Wretched\nThe Wretched is a solo journaling/roleplaying game played with a deck of cards, a tumbling block tower, and a microphone.\nThe Wretched is a game about human resilience in the face of overwhelming odds and almost certain death. It is a game about isolation, fear, and perseverance.\nYou play a lone survivor of an horrific attack. You have seen and done terrible things, you have seen your friends - your found family - brutally butchered by something you can\u2019t even begin to comprehend, something that you were sure didn\u2019t exist until it manifested itself aboard your ship.\nYou are existing on the edges of your endurance, high on adrenaline and fear and desperation. You are sure you won\u2019t survive this, but all you know to do is to keep fighting.\nThe Wretched is inspired by the music of John Carpenter and Nine Inch Nails, as well as You Are Not Alone In This Life and you will die alone out here in the black by Auden Roswell.\nThe Zine\nThe game was originally released in April 2020 with an initial print run of 25 that sold out almost immediately. Since then I've received multiple requests to reprint it, and now I'm turning to Kickstarter to make that happen.\nThe Wretched will be printed on 130 gsm silk paper with a sturdy 250 gsm recycled paper cover. This new print run has a new wraparound cover, an updated layout, and some quality-of-life updates to the text (including a new section covering safety tools). Printing will be handled by Mixam UK.\nMockup of the new zine. The new layout and cover are finalised.\nMockup of the zine showing the new layout.\nThese are mockups of the new zine. The new layout and cover are finalised - all this campaign will be funding is the print run! \nStretch Goals\nYou want stretch goals? We've got stretch goals!\nGoal number 1 is unlocked and I'll be writing more music for the soundtrack - including an exclusive track just for Kickstarter backers.\nGoal number 2 is unlocked and you can now order the Wretched logo on t-shirts!\nGoal number 3 is unlocked and I'll be writing even more music and pressing it on vinyl. These extra tracks will be exclusive to backers.\nGoal number 4 gets a foil stamped cover. Mixam requires a minimum order of 1000 copies for this, so I'm setting a stretch goal of 800 backers at a physical zine level to make this happen!\nI'm using Monster Press in the UK to print the t-shirts. I've worked with them several times in the past to produce my band's merch and know their quality and processes. Shirts will be a single colour print on Gildan Heavy.\nDigital mock-up of the soundtrack vinyl. Final appearance subject to change.\n The Kickstarter-exclusive soundtrack will be pressed on a 110g 10\" disc with printed labels and a 10\" 300gsm printed outer sleeve. Manufacturing will be handled by DMS, a UK-based manufacturer and supplier of vinyl records with an excellent track record of producing quality work.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll the writing is already done (the game was released in April along with the soundtrack). The new layout and cover have been finished already, and I've priced everything up with Mixam. Since ZineQuest in February I've printed 6 games with Mixam and fulfilled them all myself, so my process with both the printer and shipping out zines is fairly well-oiled at this point.\n\nObviously unforeseen events could still occur. Last time I ran a Kickstarter, COVID happened right as the campaign ended. But most risk should be minimised here - all I need to do once Kickstarter deposits the money is send out the digital files, upload the zine to Mixam, and get them shipped out to you! Even though this should be very quick, I've given an estimate of December for fulfillment.

Then imagine a lone space station, floating in the cosmos, that is somehow set apart from this conflict.\nThrough significant effort and fortuitous circumstance this place has remained unaffiliated and relatively peaceful, providing a sanctuary for the lovers and thinkers who refuse to side with the two warring powers.\nBut this hard-won neutrality is not secure, not even slightly. There\u2019s always someone offering vital resources in exchange for a little influence, or plotting to displace our leaders, or smuggling military equipment into forgotten corners of the station.\nHolding off these myriad threats is an informal network of dependable sorts, each with a stake in the continuing vitality of the station. These characters; politicos, artisans, brokers and so on, may not be officially recognised leaders\u2014but their influence is felt strongly across the community.\nThey might not get along \u2014 they might not even like each other. But they are united by their belief that the station is a cherished place that must be protected. The question is: when the pressure is rising, can they put their differences & personal motivations aside for the good of the community?\nOrbital\nSo, how does ORBITAL actually play?\nORBITAL employs the No Dice, No Masters system, utilising the core structure & mechanics from the wonderful Dream Askew by Avery Alder. This means two main things:\n There are no dice \u2014players use tokens when they want their characters to take action, making 'moves'. Strong moves, which show the character at their best, require a token to be spent. Weak moves, which show the character's flaws or worst impulses, earn you a token. These tokens help you to weave dramatic arcs for your characters with far more control and simplicity than capricious dice, and make it easy for just about anyone to jump in and start playing.\n There are no masters\u2014each player controls both a character and a share of the role of game master, taking responsibility for all of the NPCs and narrative pressures within one aspect of the setting (for example, THE INTERSTELLAR WAR or THE SCUM & VILLAINY). It's more like you're all taking turns playing the antagonists & introducing complications, rather than playing a game entirely without a GM.\nAlso drawing from Dream Askew, ORBITAL is a game of Belonging Outside Belonging. This means it focuses on stories on marginalised, precarious communities working to live independently from a dominant culture.\nA sneak peek of some of the game's interior art, by turbo.torbo\nLike many of our favourite role-playing games, ORBITAL begins with everyone sitting down to make their characters. You\u2019ll each choose from six CHARACTER ROLES\u2014archetypes that help you create a distinctive main character. You\u2019ll each also choose & personalise one of six SETTING ELEMENTS\u2014aspects of the game world that can introduce challenges and complicate your character\u2019s lives. Filling the two sheets out is quick, fun, and will generate a messy web of story threads to start mulling over.\nFinally, you'll work together to create your STATION. This place, unique to your table, will be a hopeful space that is struggling against pressures both within and without. You'll think about what it looks like, how it's structured, and choose a few things that are frequent sources of strife within the community. You'll also choose one pressing threat \u2014 a perilous event that threatens to light a spark to all the powder built up within your ragtag, turbulent space station.\nAs you start to explore these threats, you\u2019ll ask questions which will lead to scenes between characters, using your various moves to shape the narrative in material, concrete directions. You\u2019ll bargain and gossip, analyse and manage, love and celebrate, struggle and fight, and all the rest.\nUltimately, through play, you\u2019ll decide the fate of your community and the station as equal storytellers in your own unique tale.\nYou can play a satisfying one-shot in 3-4 hours, or play through a series of sessions to explore your station further and further complicate your character's relationships. It can be played with up to 6 players, and also includes rules for playing with a GM and 1-4 players.\nKickstarter\nSo why Kickstarter?\nORBITAL is already mostly written, and I\u2019m deep into playtesting & tweaking all the content within the book. My motivations for bringing the game to Kickstarter are mostly the same as for my previous project, Artefact; so that I can fill it with beautiful art!\nA previous piece by turbo.torbo that inspired me to reach out\nMy collaborator on this project is the wonderful Torben B\u00f6kemeyer, better known as turbo.torbo on socials. He\u2019s got a real knack for sci-fi art - especially spaceships - filling them with life through all these little stories unfolding across the illustrations.\nA sneak peek of some of the game's interior art, by turbo.torbo\n\nAlso like Artefact, I want to fund another high-quality Risograph print run of the zine on premium papers \u2014 which has some minimum quantities required to make it viable. Several of the stretch goals from my last project - namely a larger format, metallic inks and stitched binding - will be part of the funding goal for this project. I can't imagine making the book without them!\nSome RISO print samples from Artefact's production\nFinally, Kickstarter offers a model for my designs that doesn\u2019t threaten to turn a passion into a business. I started going down the road of distribution & managing inventory with Artefact, but I noticed (with some help from my family!) that it was quickly filling my precious spare time with the parts of this endeavour which aren\u2019t much fun for me (emails, contracts, packing, logistics) and leaving no time for design. Also, the economies of Riso encourage you to go in hard on numbers, which would again turn my house into something resembling the big warehouse at the end of Raiders...\nThis all means I have no plans to make physical copies of ORBITAL available through general retail after this campaign. Other than the handful of spares & seconds that I end up with after the campaign, this will be your only chance to get the zine.\nRewards\nFor every backer of this campaign, I\u2019ll make one digital community copy available on itch.io once the game is released. These free copies can be claimed by those who are marginalised / in need. This has been a really successful way of getting Artefact into the hands of those who otherwise wouldn't be able to play it, especially during these volatile times, and I'm keen to replicate that model for ORBITAL.\nSo, with that in mind, here are the rewards you can choose from: \nDigital Edition\nThe digital edition contains a PDF copy of ORBITAL & the sheets you\u2019ll need to run the game, delivered through itch.io. To ensure the best reading experience, three formats of the book will be provided;\nOne formatted for home printing, with economical ink & paper usage in mind.\nOne formatted for screens, with a layout designed for phones & tablets. This version will be screen reader compatible.\nOne formatted for accessibility, with a design optimised for those with dyslexia / low vision / visual processing needs. This version will also be screen reader compatible.\nPhysical Edition\nThe physical edition includes everything from the Digital Edition tier, plus a printed copy of ORBITAL. The printed book will contain all the rules for the game, and an overview of each of the character & setting playbooks. You'll need to print the playkit sheets yourself if you're playing in-person \u2014 these contain the full playbooks that you can circle, write & sketch all over to create your setting.\nThe physical book will be produced with a similar specification to my previous project, Artefact. While the spec is subject to change based on proofs, I expect it to be:\n32 pages, plus cover.\nReduced A5 size (194x135mm)\n GF Smith Colorplan paper cover stock, Imperial Blue\n Paperback Context recycled paper interior stock, Birch.\nRisograph printed inks; metallic gold & white on the cover, risofederal blue & flat gold on the interior.\nSinger-stitched binding, using white thread.\nMy goal with the print specification, as it was for Artefact, is to evoke a \u2019DIY\u2019 zine feel, with uncoated stock and a print process reminiscent of screen-printing. However, unlike most homemade zines, I'm using luxurious papers and rich inks that make the thing feel like a premium object. I was really satisfied with the way the Artefact books turned out, and from the feedback it seems my backers were too. Here\u2019s hoping we can capture that magic a second time!\nFacilitated Session\nIn what might turn out to be the very height of hubris, I'm tentatively offering a few designer-facilitated online sessions of ORBITAL. These would be conducted over video chat with you and your friends, and over 3-4 hours we'd go through character & setting creation and then move into actual play. I'd act as the facilitator, tasked with knowing the rules inside-out (ha!) & helping the group get the most out of the game. I could also, alternatively, take the role of a more traditional GM if that's preferable.\n(I can't promise we won't be interrupted by my toddler, cats, chickens etc, but otherwise I'll do my best to keep things mostly professional...)\nThis tier also includes everything from the Physical Edition tier, with free shipping as a little thank you for indulging me.\n\nShipping\nI'm coordinating with both UK and US-based distributors this time around, as I've got no desire to try and ship out zines with a toddler and a newborn in the house! I talk a little in 'Risks & Challenges' about the challenges of shipping, especially within the US at the moment, but at the moment I expect the cost of shipping to be between \u00a33 and \u00a35 within the UK, and between $9 and $12 internationally. This is a little more than last time, because I don't feel confident sending untracked mail at this time. Hopefully it means you'll get your rewards reliably & swiftly!\nA sneak peek of some of the game's interior art, by turbo.torbo\nDeluxe Editions?\nUnlike Artefact, I won't be offering Deluxe Editions for this project. \nI really wanted to! I had all the stationery picked out & everything. But we're expecting a second baby in just a couple of months, and I know that it's not sensible to commit to such a time-consuming, perfectionist-inducing offering when I\u2019m gonna be trapped underneath a demanding newborn for the forseeable. \nI can\u2019t wait to put together another boxed edition in the future, but I didn\u2019t want to wait for things to settle (an interminable, unknowable concept for any parent!) to launch this project. \nTeam\nEven as a relatively small-scale project, ORBITAL is very much a group effort. Here's who's involved:\n Jack Harrison \u2014 part-time game designer, exhausted parent.\n Torben B\u00f6kemeyer \u2014 a freelance Game Artist, Graphic Designer and Game Dev Generalist from Berlin, Torben is our principal illustrator on the project. He's doing the illustrations for the cover and the interior chapter pages.\n Dizzy Ink \u2014 a print, design and creative workshop studio based in the heart of Nottingham, UK. They specialise in using stencil-based printing processes such as Risograph, mimeograph and screen printing. I worked with their team for the printing of Artefact, and have nothing but good things to say!\n Fiona Maeve Geist & Jarrett Crader \u2014 our diligent, eagle-eyed editors, here to stop me overusing commas, misusing dashes and creating monstrous run-on sentences that should really have stopped quite a long time ago.\n Yubi \u2014 Yubi is a nonbinary TTRPG creator and accessibility consultant who believes in an accessible future for all in tabletop gaming. They will be ensuring the Digital Edition is fully screen reader optimised, as well as creating a second version of designed with a variety of visual needs in mind.\nI'm hopeful this team will grow even bigger if the project goes beyond its initial funding goal!\nSo there we have it \u2014 a fairly simple project for these very complicated times.\nThanks for reading!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe major risks to this project I\u2019ve identified are the resurgence of COVID-19 within the UK (a second wave), and the deteriorating US postage situation (USPS).\n\nThe first, while horrifying, will hopefully not be anything too surprising. Provided my family avoids contracting the illness, lockdown will not be a new experience anymore. The closure of facilities (such as the printer or binding) and delays to domestic post might mean that the project suffers some delays, but it shouldn\u2019t prevent delivery. I\u2019ve included quite a bit of extra time in the delivery estimates to account for this.\n\nThe second is a bit more complicated, as it relies somewhat on predicting the actions of a maniacal autocrat. Royal Mail, who partner with the USPS to deliver mail within the United States, are the only cost-effective option for shipping rewards out to backers. But, as I\u2019m sure many of you are acutely aware of, the USPS are under political attack and are experiencing significant delays processing mail. I don\u2019t know how this situation will wash out, but the worst case scenario is that I won\u2019t be able to use USPS. The main way I\u2019m hoping to mitigate this risk is by working with a US fulfilment provider, rather than shipping individual zines internationally from here. This gives us a lot more flexibility in getting rewards delivered as we can choose the most appropriate services / providers when the time comes. It also, hopefully, means that shipping won\u2019t be too expensive even if we have to go with a private company.\n\nThe other challenge worth mentioning is that we\u2019re expecting a second baby in late October. The plan is to have all the work done before baby arrives, and most of that work is already well underway. However, things don\u2019t always go to plan with new arrivals, so I\u2019d ask for your patience if required. Provided all goes relatively smoothly, though, we\u2019ll have no problems \u2014 most of my games have been written at odd times in the night, or with a napping baby strapped to my front, so this will be nothing new!\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis is my second project, having successfully delivered my first project - Artefact - over the first half of this year. While I had hoped to beat my estimates, I\u2019m quite proud that despite a global pandemic I managed to deliver almost all of the rewards within my original June estimate. We suffered delays throughout the project due to closures and pressure on international shipping, but my backers were always supportive so long as I kept them informed. Regular updates & a live project tracker on Trello were essential communication tools, and I intend to repeat them this time around. I\u2019ve also made changes (fulfilment partner, no deluxe editions) to ensure I\u2019m not overstretched.

If a lot of people back physical and then switch to digital in the backerkit, how does the cumulative loss of that $4 shipping credit affect the overall net shipping cost for the author?

Use one of the hidden pockets on the back to secure important items such as passports and travel documents.\nAnd it still fits a little extra if you need it!\nDid we mention there\u2019s also a trolley bag?!\nHello dear backers,\nThis is Elizabeth again, back with a new project. I was shocked after my initial launch of the Magellan Vacuum Bags Project here on Kickstarter that amassed over 2000 backers and raised over $70000!\nI just want to tell you all again how thankful I am!\nAfter the Kickstarter campaign was ready, I had a lot of short travels with just my backpack, and I started to wonder if there was a more effective way to travel with just a backpack \u2013 a way to easily organize everything I needed, quickly and conveniently.\nAfter some research on what people often take with them during small flights, I started to experiment with different forms of the backpack that would allow me to pack everything fast enough and organize properly. I wanted to go further than just Vacuum Bags - I wanted to give a solution that would use the backpack space to its\u2019 maximum.\nThat\u2019s what led me to my latest invention in partnership with BrandCharger Ltd. A better solution for short-trip travelers - The Magellan Archiver Backpack.\nI think you\u2019ll find it a huge help on your short trip travels, and I would really appreciate your support to launch my second project and make it a success once again.\nWith your support, you\u2019ll be getting the Magellan's Archiver Backpack fresh off its first batch of mass production. Thank you so much!  \nThis project is promoted by Jellop, the ad tech power behind the best Kickstarters with 1,100+ successful Kickstarter projects with over $460M raised between them.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMy team and I have come a long way, and have done a thorough research on every step of production and material quality.

It features simple, freeform mechanics which are easy to internalize, allowing a greater focus on the story, world and experience and less fiddling with complex rules or remembering intricate systems. It also requires no materials to play: no dice, no character sheets, no cards, nothing! This allows a game of Runt to be portable and be played whenever you're in the mood for a game. \nIt's designed for one shots and short campaigns, but there's no reason it can't be used to host long term experiences with either. Additionally it's a genre and setting agnostic system, so you can play whatever experience you want to explore wherever you want it to happen!\n1) Genre Agnostic!\nRunt is designed to enable the Host (the player running the game) to run a game in any setting or genre. Science fiction, fantasy, true crime, romance and anything else you can think of!It aims not to lock the player to a certain style, tone or theme, but rather lay out simple mechanics and mindset which you can utilize to play whatever style of story you want to experience.\n2) Simple Mechanics!\nRunt's conflict resolution mechanics are designed to be simple and intuitive. They can be internalized and executed on quickly, even for new players. It achieves this with a resolution mechanic called \"Challenges\" which allow conflict to occur but doesn't require players to overthink the situation - just resolve the Challenge quickly and flavourfully and move on!\nThis helps everyone not only get into the game quicker, but to avoid the barriers which may come with learning new systems for new worlds to play in. No need to remember rules around firearm ranges, learning the conditions of a spell, figure out who makes a move and when, or other intimidating mechanics required by some roleplaying games.\n3) Material Free Experience!\nThe basic Runt rules requires no additional peripherals to play the game. This means no writing utensils, no character sheets, and no dice. So long as you have one person Hosting a game and a least one other person to to play it, you can play a game of Runt. \nWhile some sort of tracking tool (paper, notes app, etc.) is usually a good idea for keeping track of details over longer campaigns, in many cases it isn't even required!\nThe Runt Guidebook is a 10 page black and white, printable .pdf that contains all the rules players need to know for running a game in the Runt system, such as:\n Consent Systems - an introduction on how to keep Runt fun for everyone\n Character Creation - including rules for equipment and Unique Abilities your character may have\n Rules on \"Challenges\" - a step-by-step walkthrough of Runt's simple resolution mechanic\n \"How To Host\" - a quick primer on how to get in the mindset of Hosting a game in the Runt system\nRunt is already design-complete and tested! It only requires art and a bit of final proofing before it can be sent to you. \nTo that end, I'm partnering with Toronto-based artist Brennan McNamara who is already creating the art to make Runt's pages even more beautiful!\nThe funding from this campaign will primarily be going towards paying for him to create art for the guidebook, as well as reimbursing me for the labour involved in creating Runt!\n NOTE: ALL STRETCH GOALS WILL BE INCLUDED WITH EVERY TIER OF RUNT!\n$400 [GOAL REACHED]- Printable One-Page .pdf with all the rules on one handy sheet!\n$600 [GOAL REACHED]- Character Sheets templates; templates to track your character details and keep tabs on your wonderful companions!\nWe've hit all the stretch goals and won't be adding any more to keep the project simple.

The book includes 10 technological levels and 20 thematic modules that can be combined in many unique ways, with each combination creating a different ruleset. This allows the rules to be tailored to the world in which the players want to immerse themselves.\nFrom cowboys to spies, Roman gladiators to mecha pilots, elven knights to vampires, private investigators to galactic rulers, the book provides everything needed for your game. It allows you to play in any historical era or the worlds of your favorite books, movies, series, or video games. It can also easily be customized for use with any \"system-agnostic\" settings you own.\nPLAY\n\nThe BYTE Roleplaying Game is a passion project that has been in the making for the past 8 years, with many tweaks and revisions during that time. It is a wide-ranging book that takes inspiration from all sorts of entertainment media to offer a comprehensive resource to players. It has been playtested extensively by veteran players with over 25 years in the hobby.\nYeraksys: Dying World\u2014one of the original BYTE RPG settings\nBesides the ruleset itself, the BYTE Roleplaying Game also involves the development of 7 original settings. One of these\u2014No Coin for Charon, an open world, \"hex crawl\", sandbox style, modern zombie apocalypse mini-setting\u2014will be included as an appendix in the rulebook. The other 6 settings are planned for release in the coming years.\nNo Coin for Charon\u2014a mini-setting included with the BYTE RPG Rulebook\nEach rule and item within the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook was designed and written in such a way to allow players to assess instantly which technological level, and which of the 7 original settings, it is applicable to. Each section of the book will be color-coded, and icons will be assigned to each chapter and element which link them to the pertinent worlds and eras.\nAs all the necessary rules will be compiled in the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook, the setting books will focus solely on the lore (history, geography, cultures, factions, people, artifacts, etc.) and practical tables to generate thematic events and elements on the fly, assisting players to tell unique and evolving stories customized to each world.\nAshes of the Heavens\u2014one of the two settings that may be unlocked as Stretch Goal rewards\nTo tie it all together, the BYTE Roleplaying Game uses an easy to grasp action resolution mechanism. Each character has attributes (such as Dexterity or Presence, with values ranging from 1 to 5) and skills (such as Piloting or Leadership, with values from 0 to 5). When a test is required, the player rolls a number of eight-sided dice equal to the relevant attribute and compares the number on each die to the pertinent skill, aiming to roll lower than or equal to that skill's value. Rolled eights count as zeros and thus are always considered successes, but each seven cancels out a success. If at least one roll remains successful, the character achieves a favorable outcome for the attempted action. \nNo other kind of dice besides eight-sided ones are used in the game and there are many design decisions in place to make the game fast and exciting, from trying to pilot a starfighter to ruling a kingdom.\nDo you want to know a bit more about the campaign settings with the BYTE Roleplaying Game?

Any unlocked Stretch Goals which are available after the campaign will be sold separately and not included in this price.\nMoreover, once the funds are made available to the creators, backers will gain exclusive access to the full \"Beta Version\" rules document immediately\u2014four months before the book's launch\u2014allowing them to start playing right away.

They will host the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook PDF, as well as printing and shipping the Hardcover and Limited Edition versions.\nPlease note that the vouchers represent a 100% discount on the publisher's margin only, and backers that use them will have to pay for DriveThruRPG's base printing and shipping costs. As of June 14th, 2020, printing costs for the Hardcover version are estimated around US$ 30 (450 pages, standard color, 8.5 by 11 inches, hardcover, case bound) and, for the Limited Edition version, around US$ 48 (450 pages, premium color, 8.5 by 11 inches, hardcover, case bound).

Note that printing costs can fluctuate depending on the book's exact final page count or price adjustments by DriveThruRPG.\n Terms and Conditions for the Special Rewards \n Design a non-player character for No Coin for Charon: \nYou will get to name the character, assign all of their stats according to the normal rules and give a short description of their personal history, appearance and personality (100 words at most). The text should not be discriminatory or offensive in any way, contain unsuitable mature references, or violate copyright. The author will assist you in the process if required, but will have final word relating to anything regarded as unsuitable. The created non-player character will be included in the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook if it is completed and received by the backer no later than August 31st, 2020.\n Design a faction for No Coin for Charon: \nYou will get to name the faction, assign all of their stats according to the normal rules and give a short description of its history, location, ideology, goals, leader, members, assets and weaknesses (500 words at most). The text should not be discriminatory or offensive in any way, contain unsuitable mature references, or violate copyright. The author will assist you in the process if required, but will have final word relating to anything regarded as unsuitable.

The concept for the portrait should not be offensive in any way, contain unsuitable mature references, or violate copyright.

The portrait will be done by one of the book's artists. The author will assist you in the process, but will have final word relating to anything regarded as unsuitable. When the illustration is close to its final form, it will be sent to you so that you may suggest adjustments. Once it is finished, it will be sent to you in a JPG format. If the whole process is concluded no later than August 31st, 2020, you may ask for it to be included in the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook.\n Design a mini-setting for the BYTE Roleplaying Game: \nYou will create a mini-setting by writing about its history, cultures, locations and important people (4000 words at most). It may be a book of mostly lore about the setting or one with a more open world, sandbox style, with tables for randomly generating events, items, characters etc. You are free to do it as you want to, as long as the text and any images provided are not discriminatory or offensive in any way, contain unsuitable mature references, or violate copyright. The author will assist you in the process if required, especially regarding mapping out the rules pertinent to the setting, but he will have final word relating to anything regarded as unsuitable. The author and his team will provide a suitable licensed illustration to be used as the cover art for the mini-setting, as well as do its graphic layout following the BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook's templates. The final draft of the mini-setting should be submitted by you no later than December 31st, 2020. The estimated delivery date for the final document is March 31st, 2021. You will be credited as the setting's designer in the document and it will be delivered for free to all backers in PDF format. Both you and the author are allowed to distribute the PDF to anyone, anytime, as long as it is done free of charge and without any modifications to its contents.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe BYTE Roleplaying Game Rulebook has been in development for more than 8 years. Nevertheless, as first-time creators, we took great care in choosing to launch the campaign only when we were absolutely sure we could deliver it. We are very close to the finishing line. The text is already in place, fully written and edited. Layout is already paid for, and most of the art is already done. Funds are needed only for a final proofreading pass and additional art. Physical copies of the book will be printed and delivered directly to backers by DriveThruRPG, a leading company in the market with more than 15 years of experience. As we, the creators, won't have to deal with printers, warehouses and shipping partners, and considering that the book is practically done, risks of this project are minimal. The main challenge is having the remaining art, layout and proofreading done in time. For that, we are giving ourselves plenty of time to have the required printing test so that vouchers for the physical copies may be delivered to backers in time with the PDF version in December.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac19 or more", "title": "Digital Copy", "descp": "You get the full-color PDF of

DELIVERED AUGUST 2020.\nAdventure Presents is a new RPG series from 2000 AD and Judge Dredd publishers Rebellion. Each issue is a stand-alone magazine with a unique story and characters, from some of the most exciting RPG designers and artists in the industry. For our grand opener Adventure is proud to present Tartarus Gate, a game of sci-fi horror written by Grant Howitt & Chris Taylor, and illustrated by Pye Parr.\nIt\u2019s the year 2130. You are an unpaid intern aboard the transport ship Charon, entrusted with shepherding cargo from Earth to the Tartarus Gate Waystation. You spend most of your time in suspended animation and are occasionally awoken by Assisti, the ship\u2019s AI, to solve problems \u2013 replacing fuses, mopping up spills, unplugging things and plugging them in again, the usual. Things could be worse. Things could be much worse.\nSet on an isolated ship in deep space, Tartarus Gate is The Office meets cosmic horror, from the designers of Spire and Honey Heist. Visual feeds with the lower decks have gone down. Something is moving. You\u2019re six months\u2019 travel from the nearest help. And you really need to impress your employer if you want to be made permanent.\nWe don\u2019t want to spoil the story, but those who want to take a closer look will find sample pages in our first project update.\nWHAT YOU'LL GET\nAdventure Presents is a complete RPG in a single magazine. Just add three six-sided dice and some pens. The story is designed to last three to four sessions, with the possibility to extend beyond into the world you\u2019ve created. You\u2019ll get a fifty-six page saddle-stitched book containing everything you\u2019ll need to play:\nA twenty-four page adventure booklet, fully illustrated in colour.\nA separate pull-out section of supporting characters and antagonists for the GM.\nSix pull-out character sheets with pre-generated characters and relevant handouts.\nA four-page pull-out rules sheet containing the complete rules to the game.\nPlus a digital asset pack with everything you need to play remotely.\nHOW TO PLAY\nThe rules and format are designed around accessibility and ease of play for beginner and established players alike. First time role players can read the four-page rule sheet, choose the most fun sounding character, and get straight to playing. \nOne player is the Games Master, while the others control up to six Protagonists who will lead the story. The magazine has been carefully laid out for ease of GMing, keeping all of the important information at a glance. The rules are designed to keep the action flowing, while giving the GM clear structure to work with.\nEvery roll is contested, so attacks and damage are decided in a single moment. All rolls are on three six-sided dice, so even with the odds against you, you\u2019ll always have a fighting chance. Each Protagonist has three core elements \u2013 their Abilities, their Drives, and their Gear.\nAbilities: an indication of what you\u2019re capable of. There are four Abilities, each with a level from 1 to 4. With every action you\u2019ll roll three dice, and remove one result according to your level, then add the others. Spend Resolve to increase your level for a roll, pushing yourself harder when you need it most. But be careful - run out of Health or Resolve and you\u2019ll collapse. Run out of both, and you\u2019re dead.\nDrives: three unique goals, needs or habits that drive your decisions and restore your Resolve.\nGear: each character starts with unique Gear which they can add to or replace during the adventure. Whatever it takes to get the job done.\nBack now for instant access to the draft rulebook.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nIn order to meet our narrow fulfilment window we need to keep the complexity of production as low as possible. That doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t have some fun though!\n\u00a37,000: Fancy Character Sheets. Form-fillable PDF versions of the character sheets for all backers.\n\u00a310,000: Upgraded Paper. Thicker paper stock to give the magazine a nicer feel.\n\u00a315,000: GM Screen. A card GM screen will be included with all physical copies, printed with a copy of the rules for ease of reference.\nHOW IT WORKS\nJust pull! At the centre of the magazine is a pull-out booklet with reference material for the GM \u2013 from important characters to maps and monsters. Next you pull out the four page rule sheet, then the character sheets one at a time. You\u2019re left with character sheets to hand to the other players, a rule sheet to pass around, and two booklets to run your adventure.\nWe\u2019ve been developing Adventure Presents behind closed doors for over a year. Since the UK came under lockdown, we\u2019ve been looking at it as the perfect game to support remote play. \nWhichever level you back at, we\u2019ll supply digital character sheets, and copies of all the handouts and illustrations you need to play via the platform of choice, be it Zoom, Discord or your kitchen table.\nFULFILMENT\nDuring lockdown Rebellion have continued publishing 2000 AD delivering it directly to subscribers every single week. We plan to use the same printing processes to ship the RPG directly to worldwide backers from our base in the UK.\nOnce we\u2019ve got feedback and backer numbers we can make final edits, then get the issue shipped directly to backers from the printers in the UK.\nTHE TEAM\nGrant Howitt & Chris Taylor are the creative minds behind Spire, Heart, One Last Job and Honey Heist as well as entirely too many other roleplaying games.

Designed as an engine for creating new and interesting stories, every game included in Storybox! puts the narrative in the spotlight. All of the games are specifically tailored to be low-prep one-shots, and the rules are presented in an easy to read format that even someone who has never played a TTRPG before can understand.\nThe games included with Storybox! each tell a different kind of story in a different way - they're focused on being as playable as possible for anyone and the rules reflect that. As such you won't find arm-long skill lists with three different checks for 'look around' in any of these games. They're exactly as long as they need to be to help you and your friends create exciting new stories together.\nThe Games\nA Beginning: This is character creation - the game. Discover your character's strengths, weaknesses and mysterious past through play.\nAgents: A high stakes, high speed game of randomly generated skill lists and chaotic encounters. Minimum preparation, maximum carnage.\nQuest: Play as Arthurian knights of legend, stranded in the 21st century. Try and complete your final and most important mission whilst struggling to understand what all this \u2018electric\u2019 and \u2018disturbing the peace\u2019 talk is about.\nIn the Town in the Valley in the Day and the Night: A two person GM-less game about the exploration of cause and effect. One player is the day, the other is the night, and together they discover the stories that take place over 72 hours in the town in the valley.\nChromatix: What if having pretty dice actually meant something? Play as impossibly powerful wizards, each with command of a different and specific group of arcane abilities determined not by your rolls but by your physical dice themselves.\nRamble: A thinly veiled excuse to talk about cute animals doing cute things for two hours, in Ramble players take on the role of helpful local critters doing their best to make someone\u2019s day with a remarkable lack of efficiency.\nGoblins?: A game of cultural exchange. Play as a squad of goblins in deep cover as they go on a trip to learn about the elves, humans, gnomes and dwarves around them - all without getting caught.\nAn Ending: Play through the finale of a campaign that never existed, and learn along the way how it all came to be. An Ending is a sad game, and it is a game which you cannot win - only try to lose well.\nThe Art\nIn the Town in the Valley in the Day and the Night - Megan Dobbyn\nI\u2019m so excited to finally be showing Storybox! to the world. The final package will feature art by the incredibly talented Megan Dobbyn with full rules documents, GM and player notes, and examples of play. You can check out Megan's art at  www.MeganDobbyn.co.uk or on her Instagram megdobbyn_illustration.\nStretch goal\nIf we reach 400% funded (\u00a32000) each backer at the physical tier or higher will also receive 3 badges based on the art from Storybox! - a small bonus as our thanks to you.\nBacker tiers and rewards\nI believe in keeping my games simple and easy to read, and so I'm doing the same thing with backer tiers. Everyone who backs this project for at least \u00a31 has the option of having their name appear in the final book.\nDepending on your preferred way to play and how much you're looking to spend to support Storybox!, you can choose to back at the Digital, Physical, or Digital + Physical tier. As simple as it sounds, these tiers will get you either a digital copy of Storybox!, a physical copy, or both.\n'Agents' Gameplay Session: Backers at this tier will receive a digital and physical copy of Storybox!. In addition, at a mutually agreeable time within 2 months of funding closing, I will run a game of Agents for you and up to 4 of your friends online. Anyone can learn to play Agents in minutes and the random skills generation makes for a consistently chaotic and funny session.\nCustom TTRPG: As well as receiving a physical and digital copy of Storybox!, backers at this tier can get a custom made one-shot style short TTRPG based on a topic of their choice. Obvious restrictions on appropriate topics apply and I do reserve the right to veto any topic, but if that is the case I'll be happy to work with you to find something suitable. Games created as rewards for this tier will be digital only, and not included in Storybox!.\nIf you have questions about any of these tiers or rewards you can reach me at JFFreeney@gmail.com\nWhere your money goes\nEvery game in Storybox! has been written, rewritten, and tested - most of the remaining work is layout and formatting. The funds being raised here are to pay for the rest of the art and the costs of printing. \nPlaytesting these games has been some of the most fun I\u2019ve had in the world of tabletop gaming, and I can\u2019t wait to hear what adventures you create with Storybox!.\nThanks for your time.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDue to current global issues shipping is frequently being disrupted across the world.

Whether you\u2019re an avid tabletop RPG player, creator, streamer, or curious newcomer \u2013 we want to share in your passion and help it grow.\nWe believe in the power of authentic narrative play. With Role, we're bringing that power to a new generation of online creators & communities. With all the world\u2019s advances in technology & entertainment, there is still nothing quite like a great RPG. So we set out to build the ultimate collection of high-quality social, marketplace, and online play tools for veteran players and newcomers alike.\nCheck out our live gameplay demos!\nPLAY\n\nCharacter Sheets, Dice, Assets, & Video!\nPLAY\n\nTokens & Whiteboarding!\nToday\u2019s role playing community is larger and more vibrant than ever. Diverse voices from around the globe are creating new games every day. We want to be the place where everyone can play, meet new people, and get their games into more players\u2019 hands. In simplest terms, we really just want to answer one question for every person in our community: What\u2019s missing from your table today?\nWe try to answer that question in 3 major ways: intuitive & seamless online video play, a creator-driven marketplace, and robust player matching services.\nOur online play interface is called \"The Table\", and is meant to recreate that intimate feeling of playing face-to-face with a tight group of players. \nCrisp high quality video chat puts the best part of the game front-and-center: the people. Show critical information through screen sharing. Upload visual aids to enhance your game via your Asset Tray. Text chat as a group or privately, allowing you to communicate however is most effective for your game.\nRoll any combination of dice by selecting them quickly from your Dice Tray. Add stat modifiers from your character sheet, track critical successes & failures, and add up your totals automatically. Draw cards from any deck of your choosing, including standard 52 card decks, tarot, and custom decks from your favorite games. Show your results live to the entire Table, or set them to Private for discreet gameplay.\nFully modular character sheet tools ensure you have what you need to play any game, even homebrew content or custom systems. We've designed our character sheet system from a standardized set of form fields, stat trackers, pools, tokens, note sections, and more - everything you need to play any RPG system. Character sheets are automatically indexed, with a Table of Contents generated for easy navigation. Everything is drag-and-drop - no code required! \nMatch with players who share your interests, based on information listed in your Profile. Use advanced filters to find exactly who you need based on desired complexity level, specific game experience, and location. You can even use Role to find experienced Game Masters to run your Table! \nRole is a people-first role playing community, and that means you\u2019ll always have tools to meet new players that align with your interests. Browse until you find someone you want to match with. If they match back, you\u2019ll be able to chat and set up your next game together!\nReal names & location data are always optional \u2013 you only have to share what you\u2019re comfortable sharing.\nWe\u2019re designing a premium marketplace that puts creators first, making it easier for players to discover, learn, and purchase new games from diverse voices in the role playing community. Basic game info such as complexity, player count, and time commitment is always easy to find & search by. Creators can upload a free teaser of their game to help players quickly understand the basics, sample the world, and get excited to play more.\nSay goodbye to review bombs & trolling. Instead of a traditional review score system, Role uses a recommendation engine. Players recommend what they love, not trash what they hate.\nPlayers never have to worry about buying new games without people to enjoy them with. Every game is directly linked to our Player Matching tools, ensuring that every new player can find people and play together.\nBackers of this campaign will be the first to join the Role private Early Access program, where they can play with each other and help shape our tools before we launch to the rest of the world! In addition, we're offering a slate of rewards that include premium features, game supplements, and exclusive items only available via this campaign.\nAll of our backers will be able to play in our Early Access program, and will receive a shout-out on our \"Thank You\" page! Additional rewards are available as follows:\nWe're FUNDED! Every dollar raised from here goes towards unlocking our STRETCH GOALS:\nOur first Stretch Goal has been unlocked! \nRole will launch as a free platform for everyone, with an open marketplace & play tools to support any game. For those that want to take their adventures further, we're offering a subscription tier called Role Master Edition. This subscription includes everything from the basic tier, plus extras that ensure players, creators, and game masters alike have all the tools they need to run the very best game sessions.\nBeyond our default look & feel, the Table interface will support a growing library of custom skins inspired by various popular fiction genres. Maximize your group's immersion in the story by wrapping your experience in a skin that's right for you. \nBackers of this campaign will receive 3 Kickstarter-exclusive skins that will never be available again: our first Fantasy skin, a retro Arcade skin, and our Cyberpunk skin. \nOf course, the heart of the Role platform is great games. Backers of this campaign will be able to receive one or more of our 6 Creators Program supplements as they release over the course of our first year.\nPLAY\n\nWe believe in supporting the RPG creator community on Day 1, and that's why we've launched the Role Creators Program - a funding initiative to help independent designers and publishers get more of their work out into the world. As part of this Kickstarter campaign, we're funding a fresh batch of RPG game supplements from 6 different creators. These digital supplements will be exclusive to the Role platform, and available first to backers of this campaign!\nFirst, we're extremely excited to reveal Lancer: Battlegroup, the official expansion from Massif Press!\nLancer: Battlegroup is a new, standalone rules system for the Lancer setting, designed for use at your tabletop and in digital, grid-free play. Blending Lancer\u2019s deep unit customization and imbued story with tactical-narrative action, Battlegroup casts the players as pilots and officers in a battlegroup deployed to the front line; as the first tremors of interstellar war test Union\u2019s integrity, you and your party members will face the enemy with new weapons and old tactics, thrown into combat with only one goal: survive, and return home.\nAs big OSR fans, we're very pleased to bring everyone Isle of Ixx from Swedish designer, Skullfungus!\nThe Isle of Ixx is both a light OSR-style ruleset and a sandbox adventure in one. The rules are based on \"Into the Odd\" by Chris McDowall, and have been chosen for their simplicity and ease of use, so that the focus can lie on adventuring and discovering the island. The system itself is also easy to adapt to any style of OSR-ruleset you might have in mind, should you prefer that instead!\nThe setting text will be written in an open-ended way, often asking the players questions about their characters and surroundings. This way, they'll be a big part of the setting and will get to influence much of what goes on in the story!\nThere will be roughly 16 key locations on the map for players to explore, ranging from cities, villages, lairs, and dungeons. There will also be tools for the game master to create their own content, in the form of generators and sample maps they can use for their own dungeon adventures!\n We're also proud to be partnering with Swordsfall to launch The Fifth Ebon Expedition, the newest expansion to this massive Afropunk universe!\nThe Fifth Ebon Expedition is a 4+ player campaign set in a unique Mission style. Your group will be part of the larger expedition, fighting to establish forward camps, and with it a railway for a future supply line. If your expedition is successful, then the question is... can you defend it?\nFrom popular Filipino creator, Sword Queen Games, we're bringing Voidwalkers - a tarot-powered game that combines mysticism with deep space exploration for an experience unlike any other!\nVoidwalkers will be a complete stand-alone science fiction TTRPG where mysticism and space-magic guide creative and intuitive stories. In this Powered by the Apocalypse game, characters must learn how to harness and balance the wild space-magic, the VOID, within themselves, while navigating and staying clear of its wild manifestations in the physical world. You must rely on creativity, luck, and relationships in order to succeed and thrive out in the Void. Players will use a tarot deck as a way to generate intuitive stories and resolve challenges. A unique tarot deck will be created for this game, but any tarot deck may be used!\nIndie designer Steven Medeiros, in collaboration with the Role team, is developing Astra - a unique blend of classic OSR and cooperative action where players pool their dice rolls and act together as a group.\nAstra is a rules light 3-6 player OSR-style tabletop role playing game with a focus on cooperative group dice pool mechanics that allow players to work together and overcome obstacles. It explores heavy themes of interpersonal connections, self exploration, and building community. Suitable for one-shot or campaign-style play, it features quick & easy character creation and narrative driven gameplay.\nLast - but certainly not least - we're working with Magpie Games to bring players a brand-new supplement for Masks! Cataclysm at the Metajunction will bring new levels of superhero action to this popular superhero RPG.\nCataclysm at the Metajunction is a playset for Masks: A New Generation, a Powered by the Apocalypse game of teen superheroics. This playset will give you everything you need to play through superheroic tales in the endangered Metajunction, along with two new costumes, or playbook variants, for you to use with existing Masks characters. Ever wanted to play a version of your character from another reality? Cataclysm at the Metajunction provides the support for doing just that!\nThis playset includes: a 32 page full-color, illustrated playset, including custom moves and villains. And 2 new playbook supplements (costumes) that expand existing Masks playbooks.\nAll 6 of these awesome supplements will release exclusively on Role, as part of Year 1 of our platform launch!\n From all of us here at Role, thank you so much for joining us on this adventure.

Its cramped corridors and dark chambers are populated with androids designed by ASAMM to be so advanced that they are often indistinguishable from humans. Because of this, the factory has been blockaded by a fleet of volunteer corporate vessels who have instructions to kill anything that enters or leaves Cloudbank, otherwise known as: The Deep.\nEvery NPC you encounter is a potential friend or foe and smart players will survive by relying on their wits over their weapons. You can't shoot your way out of The Deep.\nThe Cloudbank was coined The Deep by a community of scavengers who camp on the outskirts of the blockade. They call themselves Divers, and their fascination with the strange androids and creations found inside The Deep keeps them coming back. Sometimes to their own detriment. More than one diver has fallen prey to the Bends, a terrible condition where due to the continuous exposure to The Deep's mysteries the Diver forgets whether they are human or not and abandons their friends and loved ones to live in The Deep for the rest of their lives as the android they truly believe they are. That's why the Divers have a saying, \"No matter what they say, you never leave anyone behind in The Deep.\" \nNo matter what it looks like, everything in The Deep thinks it's human.\nIn a lot of ways, Gradient Descent is a love letter to the classic megadungeon from fantasy rpgs, movies like Blade Runner, and comics like Blame!. We've done everything we can to make this massive, sprawling facility with all its nooks and crannies a fun place to explore for players, and an easy game to run for Wardens.\nGradient Descent packs a ton of content into its humble zine-sized pages, including: \n Hundreds of rooms to explore: Gradient Descent is built from the ground up to be a megadungeon zone that players can return to over many sessions or an entire campaign. They can make quick dives in to scavenge for artifacts, or they can setup camp with the Divers and try and figure out just exactly what's going on down there.\n Hordes of Ghosts: The Deep is ultimately a machine. A very complex, godlike machine, but a machine none the less. And inside this machine are ghosts, echoes and reverberations of brainscans taken by the AI in order to build its sentient androids. Players can't kill them, they'll need to be more thoughtful when they approach these beings.\n Dozens of unique artifacts: You can make it rich in The Deep if you're a little smart, a little crazy, and very lucky. Gradient Descent comes with dozens of unique artifacts to serve as rewards or objectives for Wardens to place all around The Deep.\n A host of factions: The Deep is crammed with different interests. From the Divers, obsessed humans (?) who plumb the depths of The Deep searching for rare android crafted artifacts, to the various communities of androids all living in fear of their AI overlord, or else, the kill teams and Divers who regularly invade their besieged home.\nAnd much, much more!\nWe've spent a ton of time working this module to be the most usable, well written, edited, illustrated, and designed module it possibly can be, and we can't wait to show you the finished product.\nWork in progress. Not final.\nEvery spread is bullet pointed out so that Wardens don't have to read huge blocks of text to know what's in a given area. They can simply read the bullet points and bolded entries, and if players want more information, further details are in nested lists beneath each bullet point. \nWork in progress. The room starts with a quick, one sentence description of what's going on and is then followed by bullet points. Wardens can quickly scan the bullet points to give players the most relevant information, only reading further down when they have to.\nDangers (like traps or enemies) are highlighted in red and with a unique icon (!) so that you're not five minutes into exploring a room before you find out there was a gun-toting maniac in there the whole time. Additionally, the bottom of the page has icons for whether there's artificial gravity on the page, Oxygen, or light -- with icons then used on individual rooms when they differ from the area at large. \nMothership is an ENnie award-winning (Best Game, Gen Con 2019) sci-fi horror roleplaying game that places a huge emphasis on being easy to run but difficult to beat. It uses a simple d100 roll-under system similar to Call of Cthulhu, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and the Basic Role Playing system. It's incredibly easy to hack, so you can meet your table's needs (increasing or decreasing the difficulty as necessary to create a fun and challenging time) without a lot of effort.\nYou play as one of four classes: Teamster, Android, Scientist, or Marine, and then customize that class to your liking with a branching skill tree. \nClick the image to download the character sheet!\nWe wanted building characters to be easy so we put all the rules for character creation right there on the character sheet. With a game this deadly it's important that players are able to get right back into the action if their character dies. And why is it so deadly? Well, aside from just taking damage (from, you know, like, a scalpel wielding void raider) your characters also accumulate Stress which builds up until something terrible happens (like oh, you know, seeing your crew mate get ripped in half by the thing that just crawled its way out of the airlock), after which you'll make a Panic Check. If you roll poorly your character could be inflicted with awful conditions ranging from chronic night terrors to permanent phobias to full on psychopathic rampages!\nTrust us, it's fun.\nIf you want to check out the system the PDF of the Player's Survival Guide is Pay What You Want on itch.io or DriveThruRPG. Take a look and let us know what you think. We've also got a great Discord server with an awesome community full of people ready to answer questions and help out with anything you need.\n Gradient Descent is written, edited, and produced by an incredible award winning team:\nWritten by Luke Gearing (Fever Swamp, Broken System)\nArt by Nick Tofani (Instagram, Patreon)\nEdited by Jarrett Crader (Troika!, Mothership, Ultraviolet Grasslands)\nLayout by Sean McCoy (Mothership, Two Rooms and a Boom)\n\n\n\nWork in progress. Not final.\n\n\n\n\n We've got some awesome stretch goals coming up -- so keep an eye out! \n\"...A master class in presenting RPG rules and settings in a very graphical, readable, and gameable way. And it just looks gorgeous.\" -- Gareth Branwyn, Boing Boing\n\"This might be my favorite role playing game other than D&D\u201d -- The Secret Cabal Podcast\n\"This thing walks to the line of usability/performance art, looks down at it, and does a jig on it with its tongue hanging out waggling, while flipping the world off with both hands. It gets about as close as you can to the usability/art line.\" -- Bryce Lynch, Ten Foot Pole \n\"Such a great example of design in RPGs... If I was gonna run a sci-fi horror game this is the only game I'd use... Strongly recommended.\" -- Ben Milton, Questing Beast\n\"It was thematically so tight and so fun. ...Really cool system. ...Definitely worth checking out!\" -- Shut Up & Sit Down\n\"Mothership is a supremely cool sci-fi DIY zine game whose supplements really know how to create a fun module without railroading players. Designers and players alike should check it out!\" -- Adam Koebel, Dungeon World\n\"What a great game. What an impressive achievement... I cannot say enough great things about Mothership. I want you to go buy it right now.\" -- Dungeons & Possums \nThis project is EU, CA, and AU customs friendly shipping.

Equipped for a twenty-year voyage, she will carry the Travellers on an epic journey from Charted Space to the edge of the Orion Arm. Deepnight Revelation must forge a path through uncharted systems and the territory of unknown alien races. Everything she finds will be new, and if she meets with disaster there will be no rescue.\nDeepnight Revelation\u2019s destination is a mysterious radio source at the mouth of the Great Rift. Described in the ravings of a madwoman as the place beyond everything, Terminus Point holds a terrible secret. Reaching it is only part of the mission; at Terminus Point the Travellers will face a desperate battle to prevent mass extinction on a galactic scale, and literally go further than any Traveller has gone before.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Deepnight Revelation box set will initially contain four books, a card deck and a huge poster map, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks to expand the campaign, covering new adventures and regions of space that the Deepnight Revelation will travel through.\nDeepnight Legacy - a 32 page adventure that introduces the Travellers to their mammoth task.\nCampaign Guide - a 104 page book that lays out the immense scope of the campaign.\nReferee's Handbook - a 96 page book that guides the referee gently through the herculean task of running the campaign.\nTerminus Point - a 72 page adventure into the most distant and fantastical realms that forms the great finale of the Deepnight Revelation campaign!\nA giant poster map featuring deck plans of the Deepnight Endeavour, along with crew departments, while the reverse has a huge scale map depicting the expected route of the journey along the Great Rift and known points of interest.\nA deck of cards, covering Mission Briefings, Standing Orders, and Mission Roles.\nMost of the writing for the Deepnight Revelation box set is complete and you can download the first adventure included in the set (a work in progress, but fully playable), Deepnight Legacy, right HERE.\nDeepnight Legacy: The deep-rift outpost at Point XF-1402 has gone silent. Sent to investigate, the Travellers come under attack from the shambling remains of the crew. As the nature of the threat becomes apparent the Travellers face a terrible choice. They must ensure an alien entity never reaches an inhabited planet\u2026 even if it means they can never leave.\nCampaign Guide: A complete guide to the exploration cruiser Deepnight Revelation and her mission. The Campaign Guide details the Deepnight Entity and the ten year voyage to its hiding place at Terminus Point, the route of Deepnight Revelation and the regions of space she will pass through, along with incidents and adventures that will befall the intrepid crew.\nReferee's Handbook: The Referee\u2019s Handbook contains all the rules and information the referee needs to run an epic campaign of exploration at this magnitude. Using a resolution cycle developed specifically for this campaign, along with advanced rules for whole-crew endeavours, the Referee\u2019s Handbook makes resolving large scale tasks quick and simple. Whether the Travellers are decoding alien hieroglyphs, putting down a mutiny aboard their ship, or trying to prevent a critical system breakdown, the Referee\u2019s Handbook covers every eventuality.\nTerminus Point: At the mouth of the Great Rift lies Terminus Point. There, on the very edge of the spiral arm, the Travellers confront something that will consume all life in the galaxy. They have only the resources of their battered ship and weary crew; backup is a decade away even if the Travellers could call for help. They will fight with what they have, treading a thin line between extinction and revelation.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nTraveller veterans will be familiar with the massive Pirates of Drinax campaign. When we came up with the idea for Deepnight Revelation, we knew it had vast potential that could be developed into a truly epic gaming experience with multiple side plots and new areas of space - making it perfect for a Kickstarter project.\nThe box set will contain the beginning and ends of the campaign, along with guidance for the referee to run exploration campaigns as the Travellers make their way along the Great Rift. However, Kickstarter gives us a chance to expand this greatly with specific adventures and regions of space to be encountered along the way, turning this into the greatest voyage made outside of Charted Space!\nThe 'Feels'\nWhen we embarked on this project, we knew we wanted to create something truly special. Your Travellers will be going far, far beyond Charted Space and we wanted to get across to them the true, terrible majesty of the universe. They will encounter and interact with black holes, neutron stars, and nebulae, while visiting hellworlds and planets lit dimly by a brown dwarf. This will be a trip like no other, and we wanted to make sure Travellers remembered it for the rest of their gaming lives, something that is far more than a simple episodic 'five year mission' style of game.\nTo that end, we have drawn upon many sources for inspiration, and recommend referees immerse themselves in the likes of the Cosmos TV series (both new and original), and films such as Sunshine and Interstellar. On a big 4k screen with full surround sound.\nThis is what we want your Travellers to experience during this campaign.\nYou can hear writer Martin Dougherty's thoughts on the campaign and contents of the box right here:\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Deepnight Revelation in your hands.\nThe Deepnight Revelation Commemorative Pack\nCitizens of the Third Imperium will be able to purchase a special commemorative pack to support the Deepnight Revelation mission - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Deepnight Revelation Officer level!\nIn the commemorative pack, you will find:\nThe unique Deepnight Revelation cloth mission patch\nA pad of blank Subsector Maps, ready for your exploration\nSix Deepnight Endeavour pencils, perfect for your players\nOne Deepnight Endeavour pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Deep Space Phenomena Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the mysteries of the universe\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Deepnight Endeavour dice\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (seriously, if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\nStretch Goals\nWe have a multitude of star systems and strange phenomena to explore, and we will be bringing you the deep mysteries of the galaxy via hardback books that explore specific regions of deep space and add additional adventures to the campaign.\n The Riftsedge Transit: We have added a new hardback book detailing the first leg of the mission! The Riftsedge Transit is exploration writ large, in which the Travellers will encounter new alien races and discover wonders never seen before. They will stand amid the ruins of a vanished civilisation and perhaps learn its fate, follow clues to the home of a starfaring species and launch a daring rescue to save new friends, then face a mature Deepnight Entity controlling a whole world, and learn the true power of their enemy.\nThe Near Side of Yonder: A hardback covering a region of 15 sectors directly spinward of Terra has been unlocked, in which the Travellers encounter three starfaring races which stand on the brink of war. The way forward is through their territory and helping one race will antagonise the others, perhaps triggering a devastating conflict, but the Travellers need allies and information. They could tread a careful path through local politics or turn the weapons of Deepnight Revelation upon any who oppose them.  Finally, the Travellers learn of a fleet assembling to tackle an enemy super-warship... and that they are the target. The Travellers' actions will determine if they face overwhelming odds or merely a tough fight.\nThe Crossing: A new hardback book that will see the Travellers searching for a way across the bulge where the Great Rift starts to curve rimward has been unlocked! However, the route is dangerous and a single mistake will doom the crew to a slow death in deep space. They must brave the greatest hazards of deep space; flaring stars, gravitational anomalies, and a deathtrap planet. The Travellers find evidence of those who trod this path before and learn more about the mysterious Leviathan, before reaching the distant shore. What appears to be a safe haven turns out to be even more deadly than the crossing, but there can be no turning back now.\nThe Far Side of Nowhere: The fourth expansion for the Deepnight Revelation campaign has been unlocked now we have reached the heady heights of \u00a365,000. By this time Deepnight Revelation is in poor condition and her crew weary. No sign has been seen of starfaring aliens for months, until a small outpost is discovered. The alien operators seem to find the Travellers familiar. Whilst they are puzzling over this, a trade ship arrives at the outpost. The crew are human. The Far Side of Nowhere represents a change of pace in the Deepnight Revelation campaign; a chance to return to some old-fashioned Traveller adventures. However, the stakes are higher than usual \u2013 a mis-step could terminate the expedition or force its abandonment.\nVoidshore: Voidshore has been unlocked! This book begins with a transit from the Far Side of Nowhere but focuses on exploration of the very fringe of the spiral arm. As the Travellers explore the region they become aware of another expedition in the area, leading to a tense encounter with other explorers. Whether these rivals become allies or enemies depends very much on the Travellers\u2019 attitude to them.\nThe overall theme in Voidshore returns to one of exploration and discovery, with the Travellers piecing together clues to find the route of a Droyne expedition. Finally, all preparations made, the Travellers stand on the edge of the spiral arm and plot a jump out into the unknown. Ahead lies Terminus Point and the final destination of their mission.\nExpeditions: If we reach the appropriately astronomical heights of \u00a3100,000, we will add Expeditions, the sixth Deepnight Endeavour hardback expansion. Expeditions (a working title!) is a set of adventures designed to be slotted into any portion of the mission, where the crew of the Deepnight Endeavour meet new civilisations, explore fascinating stellar phenomenon and, maybe, gain a few things that will aid them in their epic voyage.\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Deepnight Revelation to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs!

Traveller veterans will know the reputation of Mr Dougherty well, as he is a true professional and one of the most reliable writers Mongoose has ever worked with in our near 19 years of business - backers of the Great Rift and Element Cruisers Kickstarter projects saw that he delivered manuscripts on time, and they were most excellent!\n\nWe will be showcasing previews of Deepnight Revelation throughout this Kickstarter to demonstrate just what we are working on, how we are progressing, and to gauge your opinion on the articles.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Traveller", "descp": "You get the heartfelt thanks of the crew of the Deepnight Revelation, and a warm welcome in every Imperial Navy and Scout Service base you visit!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a345 or more", "title": "Virtual Deepnight Revelation Crewmember", "descp": "You will receive the PDF edition of the Deepnight Revelation box set, with all stretch goals that are unlocked in PDF format!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}], "stat": ["138 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a370 or more", "title": "Deepnight Revelation Crewmember", "descp": "You will receive the Deepnight Revelation box set, with all stretch goals that are unlocked, along with the PDF editions as soon as they are complete.

Behind the busyness of modern life (entertainment, fast-food, social media) lies a wider, deeper and frightening truth. Our materialistic way of life, carried on the shoulders of the Industrial Revolution, brought humanity an existence devoid of meaning and essence, teaching us to live in the moment and worry about tomorrow when (if) it comes - you know better. Something (or someone) showed you otherwise and there is no turning back. You have seen life through the eye of giants, realizing humans are no more than ants on the play-field of vast spiritual forces pitting us against each other, using us as pawns and currency in their eternal wars. You are not alone in this momentous realization. Others work against you, actively and passively. Other forces, human and non-human alike, conspire against you.\nA Peek Behind The Curtain\nSeekers Beyond the Shroud is a singleplayer tabletop RPG immersing the player into a world of occult societies battling for power and magicians performing arcane rituals and sealing pacts with spiritual entities exploring a hidden reality from their underground base in modern day London, UK. They align themselves with different occult orders and secret societies, learn the mysteries of Alchemy and Ritual magic, master spells and astral traveling, and ultimately command a host of spirits to take over both the physical and the spiritual worlds.\nUsing a free-form, skill-based character creation system, you create your adept and explore countless locations: from the astral planes to abandoned complex, ruins and even secret sanctums\u2014all filled with randomly generated events, enemies and discoveries. With dozens of tables generating your expeditions and missions, you never have the same gameplay experience twice!\nFrom your headquarters at the Omphalos, you may pact with different entities, gain their power, learn powerful magic and defeat enemies of the orders within the Omphalos ensuring the stability of the magical underground. All this comes at a cost and if you are not careful, dealing with forces beyond human comprehension will drive you to insanity, death or, even worse, the loss of your very soul.\nSeekers Beyond the Shroud:\n\u2219 A rich lore that takes you to modern day London and other real-world locations, peeling away the layers of occult history and events that have shaped humanity.\n\u2219 A detailed character creation system with detailed backgrounds explaining how you became an aspiring adept of the occult and dozens of active and passive skills to choose from.\n\u2219 A complex and rich magical system, where the when you perform a ritual is as important as the how. Dozens of entities await you but gaining their trust (or simply dominating them) will not be easy!\n\u2219 A randomly generated mission system that takes you to different locations to explore, facing a fearful array of enemies that stand in your way.\n\u2219 An MMO-style central hub (the Omphalos) that you visit between missions to learn new skills and spells, dabble in the secret science of Alchemy, hunt for rumors, and more.\n\u2219 All this\u2014and more\u2014in an 80,000 word sleekly designed tome with dozens of illustrations.\nDetails and Concerns\nMany may wonder why we are doing a Kickstarter so soon after our last (unfulfilled) one. These are two separate projects with very different needs from different creators. UVG is a massive undertaking that requires a much more nuanced and deliberate KS requiring vast amounts of time and energy. Seekers is a far more simple and complete project\u2014around 95% done.\nThis KS is to let you, the fans, decide how polished the end product is. Hence the simple stretch goals that improve the title\u2014no difficult  production burdening delivery. \nYou mostly likely know us: we are experienced not only in KS execution but in shipping and delivery. All production and delivery is handled by us at Exalted Funeral, all actual fun created by Blackoath Entertainment, the creators of Disciples of Bone & Shadow.\n\nStretch Goals Made Easy\nNew art from lead artist David Levi\nImproved Layout and Professionally Edited by Levi Huntsman\n\nBetter creation to fuel the nightmare\n\nAn additional player Aid. Print pledges will get a physical version and digital will get a PDF version.\nAdam Vass from World Champ Games will do layout for the Players Aid\nFiona Geist & Jarrett Crader will do developmental editing to enrich the game.\nAnother Faction and New Rules will be added.\nIn Seekers you will find: \nEarly Reviews from the Discord Playtesters: \n\"seekers is a deeply engaging solo rpg experience with truly occult and mysterious gameplay.

In order to fix it and leave the game in a place we can all be happy with, I spent a lot of time going back and forth with it, trying several things. As those of you in the Blackoath Games Discord server know, I've even released a few alternate combat rules and other things to make it easier. The root of the problem though laid a bit deeper: everything had simply too many Health Points. This made combat last way too long, and each fight ended up being to the death way too often. So the solution became clear: I had to reduce the HP of across the board. This, of course, meant I had to reduce the damage values as well. It's been tricky rebalancing everything, but I feel we've reached a sweet point between danger (I still want the game to be tough) and speed.

Possibly allowing one to bind a vestige or minor spirit into one and some sort of effects in other planes of existence from one's familiar. I feel the shadow plane is under utilized and more could be done with it including missions, people hiding there, attacks from the shadow plane (the mist like things snatching people), ratting hidden mage groups in the shadow. Movies like Nightwatch, Daywatch, and the silent hill movies give wonderful ideas for it as does the fantasy novel villains by necessity. The dream plane could be greatly expanded with spirits, gods, and vestiges local to it & the shadow. Movies like what dreams may come, re-cycle (2006), Nightmare on elm street, masters of horror stuart gordon dreams in the witch house (a witch, her familiar, and her grimoire hidden in the dream realm causing people to sleepwalk and commit ritual sacrifices for her) give great ideas for possibilities in the dream realm. Ghosts and other things stepping from one realm into another to assault the character or drag them from their mission to be lost in another realm (with possibility of finding a way back to their mission). Events for each realm. New groups that are neither order nor chaos but neutral and seek to stay somewhat close on both. Groups that to compete with the omphalos have their base in the dream or shadow realms. A city hidden in the astral for higher (possibly master level) characters that offers new things beyond what the omphalos can. Novels like weaveworld give great ideas for hidden astral planes that are connected to powerful artifacts. Events that interrupt missions and involve your faction trying to betray/get rid of you. Some weather based environmental events for outdoor missions that may also enhance or hinder certain elemental based spirits and magics. Greater rituals for equinox and other rare times like comets and eclipses. A random being generator for things that defy definition and may be encountered in the shadow, astral, dream, or areas where summoning's have gone wrong. Even a reaction table for these beings. A table to roll for events when your character sleeps... do they experience sleep paralysis, sleepwalk, get haunted, have an epiphany that grants a bonus, enter the dream realm, have nightmares, get good sleep and recover more, or lose sleep and recover less? Characters already do dirty work for the omphalos factions, what about stumbling on secrets and a stat that tracks when they might know about one too many of the skeletons in a factions closet... some sewer events and denizens like the creature in the sewers of big trouble in little china could be fun. Some nature based rituals, events, missions might help to expand options, a cabin deep in the forest or calling a spirit by moonlight in a fog choke wood. More chaos factions are a must, also perhaps some angels and demons that cross over from the usual angels are order demons are chaos to the opposite in interesting new ways to show some of the strange divisions amongst the spirit beings.

We\u2019re reading books, playing video games, watching films, going to theatres, listening to podcasts, playing tabletop role playing games and moreover writing in order to experience fictional worlds again and again.\nWe know that creating such experiences for readers and gamers can be difficult, sometimes we just feel an invisible wall in front of us. \nAs Dream Realm Storytellers, we are creating a solution! Presenting \u201cJourney Guide\u201d for you to smash that wall and continue writing your journeys, practicing your writing skills and designing a tabletop role playing game scenario for your new campaign.\nFor now, we are presenting Journey Guide: Horror\nYou can try the deck in many occasions relevant to storytelling, script writing, or games. We found out four different usage of the cards;\n1. TABLETOP RPG SCENARIOS\nYou can create the lore and fiction of a whole adventure or campaign when playing a tabletop role playing game with your players. Details in the cards alone is enough for creating complex and breathtaking horror games. \nContent of the cards are designed to suit nearly all settings and systems. Monsters and villains even have simple stats in terms of combat, sociality and intellect. You just need to use encounter templates suitable for them.\n2. COMPLETING UNFINISHED PROJECTS\nJourney Guide: Horror can help to complete the pile of the unfinished project of yours. The deck can inspire you to get on the road again towards your final destination in the project! Use the Journey Guide to spice your story up, provide a meaningful conclusion you longed for a long time, add interesting new characters, and create unexpected twists. \n3. STORYTELLING\nWhile gathering with your friends on a small vacation or camping trip, you can tell spooky stories near the campfire with your cards.\n4. JOURNEY GUIDE CARD GAME!\nYou can challenge your friends, family and colleagues to a card game by you as players creating different stories with the same cards or by picking a complex variety of cards for a real challenge. \nEach player picks 5 cards from the deck and tries to come up with a good, spooky story. Player with the most liked story wins. Moreover, you can challenge your friends with the same five cards.\n\n Also, you can listen to one of our stories created by Journey Guide: Horror\nFor better quality sound click here to download\nNarration plays an important role in our daily lives, but it is not limited to it. Narration also attracts the attention of academicians. They analyze the narratives, define similarities, and create schemas. \nIn this project, we are using Joseph Campbell\u2019s famous work, \u201cHero\u2019s Journey\u201d. Campbell was a mythologist that was looking for the similarities of cultural myths and religious stories. Campbell found out that all stories, fairy tales, movies, books, myths, and legends share similar structural elements. \nEven if his main focus was myths, other scholars followed his path and reveal some certain elements in fiction writing. Many fictional works use these same elements, the same blueprint from history of literature\u2019s first fairytales and myths from the New York Times Bestsellers to superhero movies.\nAnd we think that these elements might be extremely useful for all types of creators. \nCampbell found out 12 different stages in narration, however, we thought that using all of them might be strict for creative minds. Since we want to ignite the light for creators, we decided to establish more space for them and create three main acts and diversify these three. \nLet the journey begin! \nHere are what people from the media have said regarding Journey Guide: Horror! We thank them for their enthusiasm for our deck and campaign. \nAn article by Egg Embry in Tessera Guild\nInterview with a Turkish Youtube channel\nWe have been working on the Journey Guide: Horror for three months, and now it is almost ready. However, funds we get from Kickstarter will be spent on editing, content narration, marketing, layout, all the beautiful artwork, as well as printing the decks.\nWe are currently a small firm with limited cash flows and investment budget. This makes us dependent to Kickstarter for funding the launch of our projects. Yet, more importantly, we know that backers love being part of the beautiful campaigns that emerge from Kickstarter. \nWe are both honored and grateful to give you the opportunity to be a part of our project. We love making friends in the vast, global community of tabletop role playing game enthusiasts and fiction writers. It makes us see how big the world is and beautiful people are, when we look from our small and humble country of Turkey.\nDream Realm Storytellers is the name behind the setting, we are a tabletop role playing game studio from Turkey who came together in 2015. Our most recent project is Svilland Campaign Setting for 5E, which was successfully funded on Kickstarter in a week. We are currently working on our Patreon page and several other projects including Journey Guide. \nBefore we were professionals, we were a club of tabletop role playing games, fantasy and science fiction enthusiasts. We previously have made a fiction horror podcast, many LARPs, mini-conventions, RPG-themed summer camps and more. Feel free to check out our website for details. \nPRINTING BY PRINTNINJA\nOur decks will be printed and boxed by PrintNinja. They are an experienced custom printing company that is one of the best for printing cards. You can find more information on them https://www.printninja.com/about.\nLOGISTICS AND SHIPMENT BY GAMERATI\nGamerati is the marketing and logistics company for tabletop role playing games sector. They excel at their marketing services as well as their logistics and warehousing systems. You can find more information on them http://gamerati.biz/.\nWe will deliver our decks in bulk to Gamerati warehouses in the United States, Europe, and Australia. Your decks will then be delivered from their warehouses to your door.\nESTIMATED DELIVERY\nWe will be working on reaching more people for our project, and will be heavily communicating with our backers within the campaign time. Once our Kickstarter campaign is done, we will turn back to production with full speed.\nWe are estimating our time of completion to be in 6 months (i.e. January 2020). When we are done, PrintNinja and Gamerati will begin shipping the decks to our backers. Please note that time of delivery to your front door may differ according to your address and proximity to the warehouses we use. Please provide shipping an additional time from our delivery estimate.\nESTIMATED SHIPPING COSTS\nYou can see the calculated individual shipping costs that are currently up-to-date here:\nUnited States - $9\nEurope - between $16 (e.g. Germany) and $22 (e.g. Greece)\nAustralia - between $15 and $18\nRest of the World - $35\nThe difference between US shipping and shipping in other regions are due to the VAT paid when the shipments are passing through customs. In the US, we do not pay VAT in our shipments because the printing company is located there.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nApart from a disaster or completely unexpected external major crisis, there is no way this project will be cancelled once it is funded. We take our calculations and projections seriously and create spreadsheets, procedures and plans for any financial situation a Kickstarter campaign can have.\n\nWe do not have shipping cost risk as we will obtain our shipping budget towards the end of the project. A shift in printing cost will be financially managed by allocating a buffer budget driven from calculations of historical shifts in company prices.\n\nAdditionally, our previous Kickstarter campaign is done and good to go on sale. We are able to manage any kind of small budget issues this project would bring, with the cash flows we have from our other operations.\n \nOur designers, content creators and artists are experienced in working together for many years as a club of hobby enthusiasts, and presently as a team of professionals as we finished our first Kickstarter campaign: Svilland Campaign Setting. We all are working fast and most of the content is finished. This means that it is an unlikely chance that we will experience shortages or problems with our project team.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Dream Realm Storytellers\n4 created \u00b7 8 backed\nDream Realm Storytellers is a tabletop RPG creator and event organizer that consist of 6 enthusiasts.

Since Rose joined us full time in 2018 as a developer, we've been steaming ahead turning these ideas into a tightly woven narrative puzzle experience. \nRose has done an incredible job of tieing together a fantastic, dramatic narrative threaded through over 50 carefully engineered puzzles inspired by dozens of escape games, escape rooms and puzzle books, as well as an unreasonably large pile of reference books.\nRecruiting the help of Oxford University Egyptology researcher Dr Edward Love who inspired us with loads of historical examples of Egyptian codes, ciphers and language quirks, we've attempted to make not only a satisfying game, but an informative and accurate one too!

While between us, we've played dozens of puzzle games, gone through dozens of puzzle books, and completed half of London's escape rooms, we knew that for a game this ambitious, we needed something more. We recruited over 100 playtesters from around the world and got their feedback over multiple rounds of testing to ensure that the puzzles work exactly as we designed them to. Even after that, we need to make sure it all ticks like clockwork - and will be doing additional rounds of testing after the campaign before we get to print. The challenge for us is if there are lots of small edits to make, and ensuring that we get through those properly in good time. As Rose has done a spectacular job so far in this regard, we're confident that this will not affect the overall timeline projection. \n\nILLUSTRATION & GRAPHIC DESIGN \nAnyone who's backed our projects before knows that we spend a huge amount of time working on our artwork and graphic design. Johanna has completed the artwork for 90% of the puzzles, the journal and all other assets needed to wrap up the project for print. You can see many of her illustrations throughout the campaign. That said, there's a few more to be done and there may be tweaks needed in the final proofing stage. We've put a formal timeline in place to account for this, and have allowed several 'check points' to ensure that the artwork is up to scratch and consistent with the puzzle refinements we might make. All the packaging and box design is already complete and print-ready.\n\nMASS MANUFACTURE \nA year ago, as part of the Sub Terra Documentary promised from our \u00a3300,000 stretch goal, we visited the factory in Shanghai. We inspected all the pieces of equipment and production lines, met with staff and talked through our production objectives with their team, to ensure that we know exactly how your games are made. This means we've already avoided many of the costly mistakes that can catch projects off guard, and optimised the product design to take into account the way the machines and team produce the games - meaning they'll produce them better, faster! Nevertheless, we're working closely with the manufacturer for this project, Longpack, to ensure that every tiny detail is produced according to our high standards, and so that it delivers the excellent experience you expect. We'll be keeping close communication with them until we've confirmed everything is 100% and has been checked in the fulfillment warehouses.\nAs an additional assurance, we're spending two weeks with the Longpack team in Shanghai and around China inspecting the factory and their suppliers in November this year.\n\nFREIGHT & FULLFILMENT \nShipping hundreds or even thousands of games around the world is a complex project, and we've learned an enormous amount from our previous four successful campaigns. We've already calculated the plans for shipping games to 4 regional warehouses and fulfilling locally from there, as well as factoring in a realistic amount of contingency time for the not uncommon delays associated with sea freight of the games from the factory in China to the warehouses around the world. Additionally, we've optimised the product design of the game to account for shipping charge thresholds on dimensions and weight - ultimately saving you money.\n\nUNFORESEEN EVENTS \nDelivering a complex tabletop game Kickstarter project successfully is a challenge in itself, with a huge number of variables in play at any given time, and a large variety of places where things can go wrong. Due to the nature of this process, some things may change, but we are dedicated to making sure everyone is fully informed of any planned changes to content, the timeline or any other relevant information. We're dedicated to proving to all our backers that we are committed to excellent service.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Summer School", "descp": "We'll send you a postcard from our travels digging up graves around the world...\nINCLUDES:\nAdventurer's Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Oct 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["9 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a321 or more", "title": "Undergraduate", "descp": "As well as a postcard from our travels digging up crypt x across the world, we'll also send you a copy of the professor's notebook.\nINCLUDES:\nCrypt X\nAdventurer's Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["876 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a327 or more", "title": "Postgraduate", "descp": "Every adventurer needs the right tools, in addition to the postcard and professor's notes, you'll get a supply kit of essential tools for your cryptic adventures.\nINCLUDES:\nCrypt X\nArchaeologist's Notebook\nAdventurer's Postcard", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["220 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a337 or more", "title": "Doctor of Archaeology", "descp": "The most accomplished academics use the best materials to discover their next breakthroughs.

Now, I\u2019m compiling them into a glorious hardcover compendium.\nThis limited edition hardcover book contains:\n55 illustrated adventure locations, settlements and wilderness regions\nAdventure summaries and a giant table of hooks & rumors \nA full-color campaign map that puts the adventures in context\nAn illustrated bestiary with more than 90 monsters\nA detailed index of people, places, creatures and things\nCompanion Bestiary PDFs add stats for 5e, B/X and Dungeon World \nEach adventure is lovingly illustrated, and fits on a single page or spread, making it easy use as a one-shot, a drop-in location in your home-grown campaign setting, or a source of ideas for your own creations.\n\"Stop writing adventures and use these\"\u2014Ryan Chaddock, Geek and Sundry\nThe adventures in the book are dungeons, ruined towers, underworld mega-caverns, creepy cult hideouts, treacherous cities, and deadly wilderness regions, all in the same easy-to-reference format. \nMy adventures are inspired by the weather-stained heroism of Middle Earth, the grounded, emotional honesty of Earthsea, and the fantastic whimsey of stories like Rupert Bear.\nThere are classic underground loot grabs, encounters wondrous and weird, terrors from ages past, and apocalyptic showdowns\u201442 adventure sites, 5 danger-filled settlements, and 8 wilderness regions in all. \nEverything is written as tightly as possible, distilled to get the maximum idea density on the page. I don't put in stats, so they're best for games where you can stat on the fly: early editions of D&D, Dungeon World, Torchbearer, Into the Odd, Maze Rats, or World of Dungeons (to name but a few).\n(Update: we have unlocked all four bestiary stretch goals, so backers will now get companion bestiary PDFs with stats for Dungeon World, Basic D&D, and fifth edition D&D!)\nFrom One-Shots to Sandboxes\nEach adventure location is designed for ease of use at your table. They're not stories but scenarios spring-loaded with potential. Whether your players arrive as marauders, explorers, diplomats, or thieves, interesting things will happen.\nMy hope is this book becomes an obvious addition to your emergency GMing kit. When it's an hour before game night and you need a one-shot scenario, pull it the book and send your players into your favorite underground hellhole.\nIf you're planning a mini-campaign, it's easy to snap together several adventures into a short series, by location type or theme using the two-page Adventure Summaries. Descend from the Unmended Way to save Tealwood from the poisons of the Martoi, or stitch together a desert arc out of the Oracle's Decree, the Roots of Ambition, and Lair of the Lantern Worm.\nThere's enough material in the book to pack a sandbox knee deep. I've kept them deliberately light on backstory to make them easy to reskin for your own setting. Even so, there are connecting themes and hidden links between the adventures. If we reach the realm map and gazetteer stretch goals, the adventures come together into a premade sandbox you can play directly from the compendium.\n \"The guy has thought the whole thing out really, really nicely\"\u2014Dean Putney, Boing Boing \n\nDue to overwhelming success of this campaign, the physical compendium will be a high-quality offset print run. It will NOT be a print-on demand book, despite what the reward tier says. (I can't change that, unfortunately!) I have queried the backers, and the response was almost unanimous: offset printing is worth the additional wait.\nEach adventure has been laid out in magnificent landscape, and the whole book is packed with illustrations, start to finish.  \n(An early POD test print; not the final cover nor the final print process.)\nThe book is 112 pages, without stretch goals, and includes:\n 48 adventures, reformatted, revised for clarity, and re-edited\n Ten of the adventures have been expanded to an extra page \ntwo pages of adventure summaries so you can quickly find the perfect adventure\na detailed index of people, places, demigods and monsters that reveals the hidden links between the adventures\nup to 46 pages of stretch goals are planned, which would bring the book to 160 pages \nArmed with this material, you'll be able to quickly prep for one-shots on a moment's notice, drop fantastic encounter sites into your hex map, or dig into the world behind the words.\nAs well as compiling previously published adventures, the book includes a special scenario, A Clutch of Shadows, in which a Grinvolt garrison desperately holds a captured Dradkin sun temple against counter-attack from below.\nUnfortunately, the garrison is running out of funds\u2014and allies\u2014and treachery is everywhere. Smugglers move underworld contraband past the noses of the Grinvolt axewives, dradkin infiltrators from below move among the camps. Worst of all, Flametender Gathana's foolhardy dabbling will bring ruin to everyone.\nEveryone who backs this campaign will immediately receive the two-page Clutch of Shadows PDF. so they know what they're getting into. See the backer-only update.\nThis campaign has three tiers. If you just want to dip your toe in, pledge $1 CAD and follow along the campaign. You'll get immediate access to the Clutch of Shadows adventure location PDF, and you'll get all the updates as the campaign plunges down into the dradkin fortress (see below).\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter \nThis is the all digital rewards pledge tier. For $12 CAD (about $9 USD), you'll get:\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter\nA copy of the full Compendium PDF via DriveThruRPG when it's done\nAccess to all unlocked stretch goals (see below) in PDF form\nThis is the limited edition hardcover compendium tier. By pledging $66 CAD (about $49 USD) plus shipping, you'll get:\nImmediate access to the Clutch of Shadows PDF \nYour name in the compilation as a supporter\nA copy of the full Compendium PDF via DriveThruRPG when it's done\nA copy of the hardcover Compendium \nAll of the stretch goals that we unlock throughout the campaign (see below)\nIf you back at this tier, the hardcover book will be shipped to your address in Canada, the USA, UK, EU countries, Mexico, Brazil, Norway, Malaysia, Australia or New Zealand. \nMy plan is to run this campaign lean and mean, with sensible stretch goals that don't add a lot of risk to the project. I'd much rather you get your book quickly, so I can be back at this in a few years with more amazing material for you.\nMy main goal is paying everyone more. I've worked out a roughly proportional system with my contributors, based on the time and effort we've each put into the content. As the campaign clears its costs, the extra money will be divided up among us venal goblins to be used for good or ill.\nEven so, there are some very fun things waiting to be unlocked, my dear backers!\nStretch Goals (EVERYTHING HAS BEEN UNLOCKED!)\n UNLOCKED: An entirely new adventure, set in the aftermath of the Kickstarter campaign\n UNLOCKED: A campaign map that welds the adventures into a ready-made setting\n UNLOCKED x6!!: Two-page regional gazetteers, detailing the world section-by-section\n UNLOCKED: A short history of the lands, the underworld, and magic\n UNLOCKED: A complete bestiary of the 90+ monsters described in the adventures\n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with Dungeon World stats \n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with OSR stats \n UNLOCKED: A giant table of hooks and rumors for one-shots and campaign clues\n UNLOCKED: A separate bestiary PDF with 5e stats! \n UNLOCKED: A map pack PDF, all the maps so you can show them to your players!\nFor details, read on! \nI did my stretch goals a little differently than some campaigns. Every time a campaign milestone was hit, it unlocked a random stretch goal. That's right, it's random. Every time a milestone is reached, I'll grab my dice and figure out which stretch goal unlocks!\nThing is, we blasted through them all. Only two formerly-random goals remain, two more two-page gazetteer entries. After that, there is one final goal. \nAll dollar amounts CAD\nThe funding milestones are hit based on the overall Kickstarter funding level. Each one unlocks a random stretch goal.\nThere are also two social media milestones, each of which revealed a dread turn of events in the 'Axewives Assemble' scenario (see below) in addition to unlocking random stretch goals. \nAs the Kickstarter campaign hits its milestones, I will reveal a new adventure map, unique to this Kickstarter campaign. Not only will it be a location, but we'll actually play it out during the campaign.\nThe dour warriors of Grinvolt have realized their position in the captured dradkin Sun Temple is untenable. The dradkin are preparing for counter-attack, and if they succeed, every life lost in taking the temple will have been for nothing. Using the last of his clout, Quarter-Lord Counobel sends word for every axewife still loyal to Grinvolt to come forth and join the battle. \"We descend!\"\nEvery backer of this campaign represents a soldier in the assault. Once the Kickstarter campaign is underway, I will reveal an illustration of the long stair down to the dradkin fortress, and the first of deadly preparations that await the forces of Grinvolt.\nWe will play out the battle that follows in the comments and updates! \nSocial Media Milestones\nAs mentioned above, two of the milestones are social media milestones. As well as unlocking stretch goals, they also have terrible effects on the battle. \nAfter the campaign, I'm taking the fully revealed map and turning it into one last adventure location for the book, representing the aftermath of the battle. Those of you who fought will have been there during the battle, but what remains afterwards?\nWill it be held proudly by Grinvolt, a beacon against the darkness of the underworld and a staging area into the Ur-Menig and beyond? Or will it be a warren of night-dark tunnels, slippery with the blood of fallen warriors? That all depends on the campaign!\nFor centuries, the Seree were the undisputed masters of the lands. But where did they come from? What did they learn, and where did they go? The Dradkin remember.\nA trove of learning has fallen into the hands of the Grinvolt force. The compendium now includes a six-page appendix describing the lands, the rise and fall of the Martoi, the Seree, and their war with the gods. The nature of the heavens and the earth themselves is revealed!\n\nI will be adding a giant table of hooks and rumors to the compendium. There will be six hooks for each adventure in the book, 294 hooks in all!\nPlanning a one-shot of Stellarium of the Vinteralf, but not sure what to tell your players about why they're there? Roll d6 or just choose among that adventure's hooks.\nDid your PCs just find a dusty old map, dusty old tome, or a dusty old tinker with a loose tongue and you need an adventure lead to spill? Roll on the full table and\u2014presto\u2014you have an instant connection to more adventure! \nEven though each adventure in the compendium is independent from the others, and meant for reskinning to homegrown settings, an implied setting has taken shape over the years. I've slowly been adding the adventures to a 'big map' that situates the adventures.\nThis map welds the adventures into a pre-built, open-world sandbox setting you can play directly from the compendium.\nIf I roll this stretch goal, the big map goes into the compendium as a full-color, full-page illustration. I'll add two versions to the book\u2014one with the adventure locations called out, and a player-safe version with only the place names, so you can share it with your adventurers.\n\n\nEach time this goal is rolled it unlocks a gazetteer entry of one of the regions of the land where the adventures are nominally set\u2014places like Strielund, the Border Lands, Claimsun of dead gods, the far blightlands from Curselake to Firevault, and cavernous Ur-Menig below them all.\nThe gazetteers build on the connecting themes between the adventures: the fractured political landscape of the north coast; lost Tealwood that slumbers under the poisons of the Martoi; the ecological warfare along the Pelaago plateau.\nEach regional gazetteer will be done up as a two-page spread, digging into the people, settlements and politics, food, wildlife, and wilderness of the area. Random tables will make it easy to use in play, with just enough text to put the results in context.\nIf your players just want to know where they can get a hot bowl of river-cabbage soup for their troubles, you'll be ready!\nWith the Dradkin laboratory breached, the Grinvolt force has won their accumulated lore. There are more than 90 new stocks, beasts, demons, animals, and aliens from the adventures, and the Dradkin Chimeromancers know them all. The compendium now includes a 20-page bestiary appendix that describes each and every one of them.\nWith this goal unlocked, the inestimable Johnstone Metzger is writing Dungeon World stats for the monsters in the bestiary! These will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG. (If this goal is rolled randomly before the bestiary, the bestiary will be revealed instead.)\nBrave warriors have allowed Johnstone Metzger to produce B/X-style stats for the bestiary! This bestiary will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG. (If this goal is rolled randomly before the bestiary, the bestiary will be revealed instead.)\nNow that we've hit $65,000 in funding, Jen Adcock is busy at work producing 5e stats for the monsters in the bestiary! The 5e-compatible bestiary will be issued to backers as a PDF through DriveThruRPG!  \n\nSince we've hit $80,000 CAD, all PDF and Hardcover tier backers will get a separate PDF with all the adventure location maps!\nI'll give them a once-over in Photoshop so there are no secret doors, people or monsters. This is a PDF of clean, full-size map illustrations that you can print for player hand-outs, share them on your virtual table top, or restock yourself with crazed margin notes!\nThis book would be much smaller were it not for the timely efforts of a creative bunch of collaborators and co-conspirators!\nMichael Prescott (writing, layout, illustration)\nI've been publishing Trilemma Adventures for five years, and was fortunate enough to be a winner in the One Page Dungeon Contest in 2015, 2016, and 2017.

I've had many people helping me, but at the moment I'm holding all the strings to get this thing shipped. I'm in good health, but if I'm eaten by meebs, that will be hard to overcome.\n\nI've done my best to reduce project risk to a minimum. With the exception of the 'Aftermath' adventure, all of the adventures are written, laid out and assembled, ready for final proof-reading.\n\nThe most likely risk is schedule delays arising from hitting all of the stretch goal milestones. To reduce this risk, three of the stretch goals already exist the first draft stage, and are about to go to editing. (You know, optimism.)\n\nThere are three remaining contributions required from outside parties: editing (which is required to ship the book), a dozen pieces of layout-supporting art (same), and the system stats stretch goals (which are shipped later as PDFs).\n\nDTRPG shipping can be lengthy, so if print-related errors (bleed, weird colors, etc.) are found in the test print, this could add several weeks to delivery of books to backers.\n\nMy editor (Andrew Young) has worked with me for several years; I'm able to produce the necessary art myself, and stretch goal PDF production has already begun. All other contributions are already squared away in the book.\n\nA risk to backers is complications in printing. I've selected the highest-quality option that DTRPG can produce, and I'm completely satisfied with the test prints I've received so far, but since DTRPG fulfills directly to backers, I won't see the actual books as they go out.\n\nAdditionally, as DTRPG produces each book at the closest print center to the shipping address, books for some backers will be manufactured at sites whose output I can't directly observe.\n\nA final risk to backers comes from shipping, either from damage in transit, goods never delivered, import duties if DTRRPG prints from somewhere other than where you live, or the wild card complications arising from Brexit.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Axe Friend", "descp": "Join the Axewives of Grinvolt in the assault into the Dradkin fortress below the Sun Temple.

It\u2019s a combination of thematic Nordic Noir such as The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Broadchurch and The Killing, with isolated small-town horror similar to Thirty Days of Night, The Thing and Fortitude. Twin Peaks by David Lynch is a heavy influence, in its portrayal of small town secrets and underlying darkness that pervades every step the characters take.\n Check us out on our website, Facebook, and Twitter for updates and information! \n\nWe will be charging shipping as we fulfill each item, using Backerkit to collect shipping information and take any additional pre-orders. As both gamers and backers ourselves, we will do our best to keep the cost of shipping down.\nEstimated Shipping Costs\n Domestic Shipping: For shipping within the US, expect around $5-10 (USD). \n EU/AU/CA Shipping: The majority of associated countries are easy to ship to, such as EU, AU, and CA. Expect each package to cost roughly $5-15 (USD). \n Everywhere Else: Shipping everywhere else will be around $10-30 (USD). \nAs part of our Stretch Goals, we will be making shipping more affordable in the following levels:\n**FUNDED!** With the $10,000 level, we are including shipping to everyone who have pledged $50 and above.\n At the $15,000 level, we will include shipping to everyone in the United States. \n At the $20,000 level, we will also include shipping to everyone in the European Union. \nA typical game of Malice, where danger lurks in every corner\n\nA Town Called Malice is based on the Story Pillar System, created by Protagonist Industries in their work, Home by Dark by Jason Olsan. This system utilizes story game elements popularized in games such as Fiasco, where players develop the narrative and create complex character relationships as they struggle to keep the town together.\n(pencil sketch of artwork)\n\n\nIn the Story Pillar System, players are faced with three major story points (Pillars) to address.\nIn A Town Called Malice the three Pillars are:\n The Body - Found in the Town (or its surrounding area), its initial discovery and the victim's connections to the people of Malice throw the quiet Town into chaos.\n The Event - Vital to the Town's livelihood, the discovery of the Body threatens its success and the Town's survival.\n The Darkness - The lurking horror responsible for the terrible things happening to the Town, it is a growing threat soon to affect everyone unless it is averted, stopped, or destroyed.\n\nAn Actual Play on Happy Jacks RPG Podcast\n\nA Town Called Malice involves the isolation of small towns tucked away from busy highways and large cities. Although the default setting envisions an isolated snowbound Nordic island or outpost near the Arctic Circle, a game of Malice can be set in other locations such as the rainy Pacific Northwest, a sun-drenched tourist stop that vacates when summer ends or even a cold, distant way-station in outer space. Malice is truly everywhere.\n\n(pencil sketch of artwork)\nIn the event of reaching our initial goal, we will be providing additional playsets  that can be used as new settings for Malice. These will be available in PDF format. We will also be providing new shipping options:\n$10,000 **UNLOCKED** \u2014 Two additional playsets will be added:\n\n\"Station to Station\" - In the cold depths of space, the residents of a lonely mining way-station orbiting the moons of Jupiter are terrorized by an unknown predator. Far from Earth, the locals are on their own. In space, no one can hear you scream.\n\n\"Season of the Witch\" - Everyone in town knows of the legend of the Witch of Malice, the spooky story told at bedtime to children, until three teenagers are found dead in the woods, and the bedtime story becomes frighteningly real.\nAt the $10,000 level, we will also include shipping to everyone who have pledged $50 and above.\n$15,000 \u2014 Two additional playsets will become available:\n\n\"And Also the Trees\" - \"Diane, I'm continuing down Highway 61 to the town of Malice, where a local girl was found wrapped in a plastic sheet in the woods...\" \n\nOut of My Head\" - The year is 1799 in upper state New York. A recent murder has thrown the simple farmers into a fearful uproar. The found body was missing its head. \nAt the $15,000 level, we will also include shipping to everyone in the United States.\n$20,000 \u2014 Two additional playsets will become available:\n At the $20,000 level, we will also include shipping to everyone in the European Union.\n(pencil sketch of artwork)\nWe are pleased to offer the following special rewards as part of the Malice Kickstarter:\nWith the Nafn pledge level, backers may submit either their name or a loved one to be used within the Malice text.\nWith the Teikning pledge level, backers may submit a photograph of themselves or loved one to be transformed into a citizen of Malice, immortalized in our artwork.

Most evident is our new, easier-to-use format. The original Traveller, many years ago, was three Little Black Books (LBBs) - 48-page black-covered booklets with the titles Characters and Combat, Starships, and Worlds and Adventures. We're formatting this edition as three Big Black Books (BBBs) with the same titles, but 280 pages (Book 1) or more (304 pages for Book 2 and Book 3), and all in a slip case.  \nThe T5 Core Rules Set\nWe have been working on this project constantly since 2015. Oh, there were breaks along the way. After the last printing, I was inspired to write the Traveller novel: Agent of the Imperium; somewhere in there, I had a quadruple bypass (I'm recovered, thank you). But we've been playing Traveller5 and working through its rules and concepts.\nThe Three Core Rules Books\nNow is the time for a reprint. \nAdventuring In The Traveller5 Universe. The Traveller5 Core Rules are a foundation, and  they support all sorts of adventuring within the rich Traveller universe. To help get everyone started, we have created a set of five Traveller EPIC Adventures: \"The Voyages of the Free Trader Insert-Name-Here.\" This 32-page PDF follows the exploits of any Free Trader as it wanders through Regina subsector in the Spinward Marches. We'll release it at the same time the physical books ship (that is, in August). \nAdventuring In Regina Subsector: our introductory EPIC adventures\nCards. If you have ordered anything from us in the past few years, you have probably gotten a few cards stuck in your order. We find these are great pieces to use in adventuring. So we have created the Traveller5 Benefits Deck - 54 Poker Cards in a box (subject to some last minute changes): \n12 ships (Beowulf, Scout, Yacht, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, as encounters, or as goals for adventure.\n12 worlds (Regina, Capital, Rhylanor, and more) for use as homeworlds, interesting places, or as destinations.\n12 weapons (StapleGun, Magnum, Advanced Combat Rifle, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, or available in the local weapons shop.\n 6 arcane tasks (Drive Tuning, Knack for Astrogation, and more) for acquisition in the course of adventures.\n 6 medals (Starburst for Extreme Heroism, Exemplary Service, and more) for use as mustering out benefits, or as adventure hooks.\n 6 random items for use in adventures. \nJust a sampling; subject to change.\nThe Captain's Supplement (with the Ship captain Level) provides still more items.\nAdd-Ons.We also have three add-ons (they are included at the Owner-Aboard level) that enhance the Traveller system: Deck Plans, the Traveller Novel, and the Traveller Audiobook.\nThe Deck Plans were originally issued with the Big Black Book. This edition describes them in detail based on the Ship Design System, and we find they are a great resource for adventures. \nAdd the Deck Plans to your Pledge for $20.\nThe Traveller Novel - Agent of the Imperiumgives insights into the history of the Imperium. If you missed it, this is your chance to get reading copy, and the Audiobook (on two CDs; about 10 hours of audio). By the way, the Audiobook disks include the novel eBook, AND a footnoted PDF: 300 footnotes explaining and detailing what's going on in the story. \nAdd the Paperback to your pledge for $14.\nAdd the Audiobook to your pledge for $14.\nOr, add both to your pledge for $22.\nAdd Ons\nFinally, each level has one or more Crew ID Cards: Traders' Guild Member Cards with a pre-generated, named character corresponding to the Backer Level (and all the lower level cards as well). At the First Officer (and above) Level, we'll edit the name of the character to a name you specify (within reason).\nAside. This is intended to make you support at a higher level: to bump your pledge up so you'll get more of the cards. But I just can't do it. So everyone backing at a physical shipment level will get a set of at least five Crew ID cards taken from my pre-generated set of 40 or so ship crews. We'll do customizing at the First Officer (and above) level.\nExample Crew Cards (from Free Trader Aesir)\nUSB Flash Drive Option. For some of you, the CDROM format does not work. When you choose this option, we put the files on a USB Flash Drive instead of the CDROM. Add $5 for this option. \nAnd By The Way. Some of you may ask about the fabled Traveller5 Player's Manual. As we worked on this edition, we (that is, I, Marc, the designer) felt that we wanted to work out the bugs and details of the Core Rules before we then abridge them into a Player's Manual. It's still coming, and the PDF will go out to everyone who supported the original T5 and/or who supports this T5.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always risks, but we are well on the way to completion.

Do you get an adrenaline rush when you get to say \"edgy\" things you wouldn't otherwise say in public?\nIf so, then you're going to love Offensive Adult Party Game by The Dragon's Tomb.\nOffensive Adult Party Game is a party game for 3+ players that takes under 1 minute to play and is exclusively for people who love offensive party games.\nI've always loved \"edgy\" games because they let regular old boring people feel like they're funny and creative. Instead of having to be original, you get to take jokes that have been crafted by a business and pretend they're your own. It's all the benefits of being humorous, with none of the work!\nThese games create safe zones where you can say offensive things and take none of the responsibility for saying them. However, I felt the overall gaming experience could be improved. \nWith Offensive Adult Party Game, there are no more difficult choices, and there's no more wasted time. It gets right to the point and finally lets people who love offensive party games express themselves honestly.  \n\nTo begin the game, each player draws one white card. All white cards are identical and say \"I lack creativity and enjoy the illusion of being funny.\"\nThe tallest player begins and plays the black card.\nThey read the fill-in-the-blank statement on the black card out loud for all to hear.  There is only one black card, and it reads \"I like playing offensive adult party games because ______.\"\nThe other players fill in the blank by playing their white card, face up, on the table.\nThe players then take turns sharing their card combos with the party, re-reading the black card before saying their answer.\nThe player who played the black card then chooses the funniest person, who will play the black card on the next round. \nPlay as many rounds as you'd like. In the end, the funniest person wins! \nOur friends over at Board Game Closet were kind enough to film a preview video for Offensive Adult Party Game! Check it out to see the game in action and hear their thoughts!\n$6000: UNLOCKED!\nI'll include one additional white card that says \"I lack creativity and enjoy the illusion of being funny.\" in every copy of the game (18 white cards total!)\nIf we hit $8000:\nI'll include ANOTHER additional white card that says \"I lack creativity and enjoy the illusion of being funny.\" in every copy of the game (19 white cards total!)\nI'm Jeff Kornberg from The Dragon's Tomb, the internet's #1 resource for learning how to play card and board games.

We will be trawling through the Journals of yesteryear, selecting the best articles, revising/re-writing them for the latest edition of the game, and adding a whole host of never-before-seen material. This will (initially) be compiled into three volumes which, for Kickstarter backers only, will arrive within their own deluxe slipcase.\nWe will also be drawing from the better fanzines of the era (having tracked down the original authors) to create the essential resource for exploring Charted Space!\nThe Journal of the Travellers' Aid Society (JTAS) will be starting at three 128 page volumes, but stretch goals will unlock additional volumes at no extra cost to backers - we will simply extend the slipcase in size and add the additional books!\n\nWhat is Inside?\nMuch of the work on the first three volumes has already been completed, and you can download part of Volume One right HERE, so you can see the style we are going for with these books. This is a work in progress, and you will see it updated to completion over the course of the Kickstarter project.\nEach is a treasure trove of information and game additions, including adventures, new ships, animals from across Charted Space, philosophical musings on the big empires, histories, different takes on familiar equipment and vehicles, brand new vehicles, characters to be met in starports, playable alien races, and much, much more...\nThis is what we currently have planned for Volume One (subject to tweaks and ever better ideas as we continue to work on the Journals):\n The Ship in the Lake: Uncover a sunken vessel lying in a potential hotspot to uncover a small fortune\n Bestiary: Poke and provoke the Bush Runner, Tree Kraken, Lozin, Luugiir, Tree Lion, Seedspitter and Miniphant\n SOHO Light Freighter: A heavily armed trader suitable for the worst areas of the Reach - with High Guard rules for Laser Barbettes\n SuSAG: The run down on one of the largest megacorporations in Charted Space\n The ATV: A look at the familiar ATV, with variants both large and small, grav-assisted and aquatic\n A Concise History of the Vilani: Explore how the Vilani rose to prominence\n Burst Lasers: For when you just cannot decide between pulse and beam\n The Dynchia & Girug'kagh: Two fully playable minor alien races\n Remote Piloted Reconnaissance Unit: A perfect device for Travellers who want to see what they will be facing before leaping in with both feet\n Embassy in Arms: Stage an evacuation of an embassy under fire in this adventure\n Within the Two Thousand Worlds: Understand the K'kree before they appear in your campaigns later this year\n Piracy on the Spinward Main: How best to make Credits from 'freelance' trade?\n Vargr Corsairs: And then see how the masters do it\n Assault Rocket Launcher: A brand new weapon with ammunition to resolve any situation\n Simone Garibaldi: A scholar to be met at any starport - but is her latest discovery real?\n Emperors of the Third Imperium: Just who is in charge, and how did they get there?\n Light Patrol Vehicle & APC: Found at many starports, these light vehicles are suitable for policing and light military use alike\nVolumes Two and Three have oodles more articles, including more aliens and animals, more adventures and characters, explorations of Imperial and Zhodani military forces, a revision of the original Exotic Atmospheres Special Supplement, vehicles of the IISS, and much, much more - we will be showcasing the contents of each volume during the Kickstarter process and courting your opinion on the articles!\nThe new Journals of the Travellers' Aid Society come in a 8.5\" x 5.5\" format (a bit bigger than the old 'little black books'), making them easy to have at hand at the gaming table to flip to the articles you are after.\n\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWell, we enjoy talking about Traveller to Traveller fans which, for us, is enough to get everyone involved in the first place.\nHowever, the greater truth is that we are sitting on tons and tons of Traveller source material... and these Journals are the perfect vehicle to get it to you. \nDoing this project via Kickstarter will not only allow us to gauge your opinions and reactions as to the actual contents of the Journals and which articles should be selected for inclusion, but we can link your backing directly to the amount of content - in effect, the more popular this project becomes, the more volumes we will be able to put into the slipcase.\nWe will be starting with three volumes and have already started compiling articles for a fourth. How many more will follow will be up to all of you!\n\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you the most and we will soon have the Journals in your hands.\nA huge (28\"x 40\") full colour poster map showcasing the major powers of Charted Space and their position in the galaxy\nSix Traveller pencils, perfect for your players\nOne Traveller pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Ship Recognition Pack, 25 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the most common ships of Charted Space\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Traveller dice\nA Character Sheet pad, ready for your Travellers to record their most personal details...\n\nStretch Goals\nThere is a Tigress Dreadnought's worth of Traveller material we could fill many JTAS volumes with - and that is exactly what we will be doing through stretch goals!\nIf we reach these intergalactic heights, we will add to the TAS Welcome Pack - High Passage backers will gain a paperback 'novel' containing a set of Traveller short stories. These will also be received as ebooks (PDF, ebook, and mobi formats), and High Passage backers will be the very first to read the first instalments of a new range of Traveller fiction coming later this year...\n\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill in the gaps of their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for the Journals to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level.

Massive and sincere thanks to everyone for the massive support and enthusiasm that's been shown so far. Not only has the campaign been fully funded, but every stretch goal has been met, assuring that Grey Cells will support not only modern mysteries, but also Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Lovecraftian mysteries! If you'd like to learn more about the game, here are some additional places to look!\nYou can find the Google Drive folder containing the case files and all profile cards related to the case by following this link.\nIf you'd like to see Grey Cells in action, you can see me playing Death of a Survivor with backers in this video.\nI was also a guest on Professor Jimbles' Dicebag Podcast and Professional Goblins to talk about Grey Cells, including its past, its design principles and its future!\nGrey Cells is a game of unravelling mysteries. It\u2019s about stepping into a dark morass of crime and deceit, and piecing together nuggets of truth into a full picture of what really happened. Players take the roles of investigators of all stripes - policemen and detectives, reporters, scientists, socialites and criminals (reformed or otherwise).\nEvery character wields powerful tools to shake loose information from the world. When making deductions, some character abilities can build on the information you\u2019ve gathered to help you connect the pieces more clearly. This makes it much less likely that players become stuck without recourse.\nAnd once you have that information you can start making deductions yourself, or you can have your character help you. Several character abilities assist in interpreting evidence, and can help put your deductions on the right track. They\u2019ll never solve the case for you, but they allow you to utilise your character\u2019s experience in the field to aid in the deductive process, should you need it.\nThe game emulates your favourite crime fiction genres, whether that be a civil and proper Cozy mystery such as a Hercule Poirot adventure, a hard-boiled detective flick like The Big Sleep, and more! It also provides advice on how to make your game feel the way you want.\nGrey Cells is a race, and the villain is already a step ahead. They have their own agenda - the thief escapes with their prize, the hacker erases their tracks, the killer stalks their next victim. Take too long to catch them, and they could be long gone.\nCases can involve a lot of dialogue with non-player characters, be they witnesses, suspects or even friends and allies brought into the world by the players themselves. However, Grey Cells doesn\u2019t have a Charisma stat to help you convince and manipulate them. Instead, how well you can persuade or intimidate someone depends on how much you know about them. Discover what they want, what they fear, and what their dirty secrets are and you\u2019ll have them talking in no time.\nThis creates a more thematic experience - people won\u2019t cave until you have something to press them with. Also, since success is dependent on something that\u2019s not on your character sheet, each player\u2019s voice is equally powerful; you don\u2019t have to stand aside while the persuasive character does all the talking.\nWriting mysteries can be tremendously challenging, especially for a roleplaying environment. This is why the game includes tools to help gamemasters weave their own mysteries, expanding and connecting elements of the story until they have a full web of mystery. Furthermore, you don\u2019t need to lay every piece of the puzzle beforehand - the same mechanics that help keep the investigation\u2019s momentum going also help the gamemaster create clues during the course of play.\nCrafting a compelling case still requires more preparation than many other types of roleplaying adventure, but it\u2019s one of Grey Cells\u2019 goals to make the process as smooth and effective as possible.\n- 83 pages of content\n- Basic rules of play\n- Guidance on how to play in different genres: Great Detective, Cozy, Hard-Boiled, Police Procedural and Thriller\n- Six unique backgrounds for player characters: The Beat Cop, The Crook, The Detective, The Reporter, The Scientist and The Socialite\n- Special actions to uncover new information, engage in combat, and more\n- Rules for adding permanent new characters to the game in the form of Contacts\n- Rules for Exploits: Special advantages representing your investigator\u2019s strengths\n- Rules for Momentum Powers: Potent abilities to make breakthroughs in the case, and other special effects\n- Extensive guidance on how to create and run a mystery adventure\n- Rules for making custom backgrounds\nThe core rules of the game are already complete. The game is playable, and in terms of rules all that remains is to tweak and perfect them. This will require more playtest sessions to find weaknesses in the design and improve the systems and verbiage used in the rules.\nThe zine will require numerous art assets. Of these, the most important will be character designs to represent the six character backgrounds available to the players. They will reflect not only the background but also an associated genre. These character concepts will be used in illustrations throughout the rest of the zine.\nSeveral stretch goals are available, including supplementary materials for the game. If the goals are met, any backers receiving PDF or printed copies of the core game will also receive PDF or printed copies of the additional materials, as matches their tier.\nIt all started with Poirot and cake. My friends and I would gather to watch Agatha Christie mysteries and enjoy unhealthy quantities of cake. Eventually, this interest overlapped with our passion for roleplaying games, and we tried our hand at creating investigative crime fiction adventures.\nAlthough the adventures were fun, it always felt like we were playing two separate games. The games we played were great for epic combat and high adventure, but the rules took a back seat when it came to investigation and deduction. I decided to make my own game that put the investigation itself in the spotlight.\nI\u2019ve studied game design and participated in multiple Game Jams. With my history of tabletop roleplaying I wanted to use that knowledge to create a game that supported and encouraged the inquisitive style of play we were after.\nUPDATE:\nThanks to the massive support received, I'm adding Discord & playtest access to the Junior Detective ($3) tier! Also, the Detective ($5) tier and upwards will gain access to weekly update emails, including development notes and artwork to be included in the final book! Unfortunately the text on the backer rewards can't be changed after launch (which makes sense!) but rest assured that you'll get them!\nUPDATE:\nI've completed the first set of playtest case notes for Grey Cells, and as promised they are going to be freely available. The following link goes to a google drive folder that contains not only the PDF of the case notes, but also JPEGs of all the Profile Cards involved in the case.\nDeath of a Survivor is a hard-boiled mystery that should take about two 4-hour play sessions to complete. Full disclosure: Most playtest cases will be a bit shorter than this one, but I will try to maintain this standard of quality. Furthermore, playtest cases will be from all of genres supported by Grey Cells, including Fantasy, Sci-Fi and Lovecraftian cases as development continues.\nI hope this gives you an idea of what Grey Cells has to offer, and that you enjoy Death of a Survivor!\nAlso, if you'd like to see an example of how this case works in action, you can find a recording of the playtest here!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is not the first game I\u2019ve designed, but it will be my first professional release. However, this is not the first iteration of Grey Cells - throughout its development it has had two major rewrites, replacing, redesigning and improving large portions of the game. Now it has reached the stage where it can stand on its own, and I\u2019m ready to share it with a wider audience.\n\nWith the core of the game nearly complete, the most risk lies with the design and illustration of the zine itself. Preparing enough illustrations to fill the zine could take longer than I\u2019ve accounted for and cause delays, but in this event I will recruit additional artists to assist in production.\n\nAs a black and white zine, printing risks are low even with a zine of this length. Distribution could face delays depending on shipping factors, but even in the event of delays backers would have the PDF available to them.\n\nThis is my first crowdfunding campaign, and while I\u2019m going in with eyes open there may be issues I have not anticipated, especially surrounding pricing and shipping. If issues arise, I will be as transparent as I can be and try to resolve them in a manner that is as fair as possible to the backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 3 or more", "title": "Junior Detective", "descp": "Receive a PDF copy of the Grey Cells playtest rulebook, as well as a PDF copy of the finished rules and any supplementary materials met through stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["314 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 5 or more", "title": "Detective", "descp": "Everything above, and access to the Grey Cells Discord channel, where you can participate in online playtests.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}], "stat": ["75 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 15 or more", "title": "Inspector", "descp": "A printed copy of the rulebook, as well as printed copies of supplementary materials met in stretch goals.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests\nPrinted copy of the finished rules and stretch goals", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["246 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 30 or more", "title": "Super Sleuth", "descp": "Gain access to PDF copies of the case notes from each playtest, so you can run them yourself.\nINCLUDES:\nPDF copy of the playtest rules as soon as possible\nPDF copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nCommunity Discord access\nChances to participate in online playtests\nPrinted copy of the finished rules and stretch goals\nAccess to playtest case notes", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jun 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["76 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 50 or more", "title": "Ace Investigator", "descp": "Receive PDF case notes for a unique single-session murder mystery with yourself cast as the villain or the victim.

Each one offers a quick setup to get you into a fast-moving game with very little to no prep time. All you need are 2-5 players, a few decks of standard playing cards, pencils and paper, and an afternoon.\nvs. MIRRORSHADES\nYou\u2019re a Citizen of the MegaCity in this cyberpunk game. It\u2019s 20 minutes into the future and the world is a dangerous place. Slap some chrome on, hack the Network, and fight the Man. vs. MIRRORSHADES contains a wealth of locations and opposition forces, plus rules for hacking a global network from your living room in a tight little package.\nvs. PIRATES\nSet in the Caribbean of our childhood memories, villainous pirates sail the seas. Captain a crew of pirates or defend the good people of Port Victoria from them. Fly your own colors or declare allegiance to one of the Great Powers. vs. PIRATES contains rules for naval combat, a simple generator for towns and targets in the islands, and great feats of derring-do.\nvs. MARS\nStrange things are afoot in your sleepy little town: odd lights in the sky, something unnatural is moving the woods, and the phones have gone out. In vs. MARS, you and your friends are in a small town during an alien invasion. With a half-dozen different invaders to choose from and several stock locations to take refuge in, you might find that other survivors might be the more pressing threat...\nAVAILABLE REWARDS\nAny one vs. game for $8. Two vs. games for $15. Or all three for $20. \nWant to leave your mark in the game? At a limited $50 level, you get all the vs. games and unlocked expansions in this campaign, plus your character is in one of the games! \nTHE VS. GAMES\nAll three games are printed on both sides of a multi-panel sheet of 10pt glossy cardboard stock paper that folds down to a 5.5\u201d square. (Stretch goal expansions are on 5.5\u201d square sheets.) Each title is a complete, self-contained game. All you need are 2-5 players, a deck of regular playing cards for each player, something to write on and with, and about three hours.\nPlaying any vs. game follows a basic guideline: Reveal a number of cards equal to one of your character's attributes \u2013 if any of the cards\u2019 ranks beats a target level, you succeed!\nThe game system is based on vs. Monsters by Philip Reed, which you can find more about \u2013 including downloading a copy of the original game \u2013 at http://www.battlegrip.com/what-is-vs-monsters/ . \nThese games are inspired by the condensed Wild West version of his game, vs. Outlaws. The games offered in this campaign take the same form factor of that one, which drove the game design. \u201cBy working within a small (5.5\" square, six total panels) format it helps to strip away unnecessary complexity and fluff, leaving you with only what you need to actually play the game,\u201d Phil explained.\nThe vsM Engine and the vsM Engine logo are trademarks of Philip Reed and are used with permission. Visit battlegrip.com for more information about the designer. \nSTRETCH GOALS\nThree content updates! A format update! A graphic update!\nAdd fantasy races and magic to vs. MIRRORSHADES' MegaCity with vs. MAGICSHADES. It\u2019s the most requested add-on to any cyberpunk game, so I\u2019m adding it to the list right now before anyone requests it. (I want it, too!) Elf and Ork, Dwarf and Troll! Spell casters and spirit summoners! It\u2019s all here!\nI wanted to run a mashup of Buffy, the Vampire Slayer and Pirates of the Caribbean for the home group but we went with something else. vs. DAVY JONES updates vs. PIRATES to create that game \u2013 the Age of Piracy where all the legends are true. Cursed ships and treasure! Unearthly monsters and villains! It\u2019s all here! \nIt's no longer an invasion: now it's war. Up the stakes in vs. MARS with vs. ALIEN OVERLORDS. Fight in the cities against the aliens, lead the insurgency in occupied Earth, or take the fight back to the red planet. More invaders! More plots! More guns! It's all here, too!\nA note on the above expansions: if a vs. game's expansion stretch goal is reached, it automatically comes with that vs. game. \nOnce we hit this goal, every backer gets a printable pdf copy of the vs. game(s) they choose as a reward, including the expansions!\n\nWhile I have illustration assets that work well with vs. MIRRORSHADES and decent ones for the others, at this level I can add some better and more-thematic artwork to the other vs. games. (Needless to say, all artwork shown is not final.)\n\nIt is a time of civil war in vs. EMPIRE. Become a new force of hope in the galaxy as your rebellion strikes back against a tyrannical empire. Outnumbered by the menace of the Galactic Empire, rebels fight for a return of freedom to oppressed people everywhere. You are a hero. You are the Rebellion! \nYes, you can play a space wizard with a laser sword.\nSHIPPING\nShipping within the United States is factored into the reward levels. Printed material will be placed into a bubble mailer envelope with DO NOT BEND stamped on the outside and shipped through the USPS.\nAs an individual creator and given the size and weight of the final product, it is extremely cost-prohibitive to ship outside the United States. There will be no shipping outside the United States. I wish I could \u2013 I mean, hell, Canada is right up the road from me \u2013 but the cost alone for shipping these small letters internationally is insulting to everyone. Sorry, my international friends.\nABOUT ME\nHey there! Here\u2019s the standard bio I\u2019ve been using and modifying as time marches ever onward:\nThomas Deeny is a graphic designer who specializes in book layout and game design. His layout work can be found in roleplaying games like John Wick Presents' 7th Sea, Atlas Games' Unknown Armies and Over the Edge, MCDM Production's Strongholds and Followers, and Modiphius Entertainment\u2019s Star Trek Adventures. His work on boardgames include WIBAI's Pathogenesis, AEG\u2019s Nightfall and Tempest line of games, and Tasty Minstrel Games' Cthulhu Realms. He lives in a house in the middle of a spooky forest at the edge of civilization.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile I have been an official collaborator on seven projects and an unofficial collaborator on seven others (including the 7th Sea, Second Edition Kickstarter campaign) this is the first campaign I have created on my own. My roles on those other campaigns allowed me access to planning and strategy sessions behind several of the fourteen. I have taken that background (and the advice of some colleagues who have launched their own) to help avoid common pitfalls. It is my belief that most of the major challenges and risks encountered by a first-time creator have been avoided or minimized.\n\nI am an individual who will be packaging envelopes and taking them to the post office. Everything should ship on schedule, but things can go wrong with shipping. Because it\u2019s just me doing this, unexpected life emergencies could delay fulfillment of promised rewards.\n\nAt launch, all three core vs. games and two expansions have been written, laid out, and have had digital proofs created. vs. ALIEN OVERLORDS is being written. Upgrading the artwork for the vs. games and expansions are dependent on hitting that \"more art\" goal. If we hit any \u201cand then...\u201d stretch goal, those games will have to be written and laid out.

Four horror adventures for your favorite tabletop RPG, designed to be easily slotted into existing campaigns or run as one-shots for new and experienced parties. \nFeaturing writing by Camilla Greer, Comrade Pollux, Mabel Harper, and David Shugars. Edited by Fiona Geist, with art by Lauren Bryce. \nSneak through the ruins of an ancient dwarven library, avoiding both the shadows of the past and larger, hungrier threats in Hush. \nVenture into the depths of a long lost tomb in search of powerful occult rituals--but be silent in your pillaging, else you wake the Vampire Princess and her deathless subjects, in She's Not Dead, She's Asleep. \nExplore the ancient wizarding school, under sinister new management, and solve the mystery of the missing children in Night School.\nAnd hack your way through possessed cultists to save a quiet town from a fate worse than death in Bad Faith.\nThe Demon Collective, Vol. 1 will include eight original B/W illustrations by Lauren Bryce, with four additional full-page B/W illustrations as a $3500 stretch goal.  While a relative newcomer to the RPG scene, she's a long-time gamer and her skill with an isograph pen speaks for itself. \nA band of adventurers uncovers a grisly scene in Mabel Harper's \"She's Not Dead, She's Asleep.\"\nLayout will be handled by David Shugars, whose previous work includes the previously kickstarted 5e/Pathfinder adventure Petals And Thorns: Strangers in Ramshornby Chamomile, as well as Kidnap the Archpriest, Tomb of the Serpent Kings, and Veinscrawl by Skerples.\nLayout sample featuring the basilisk and several game mechanics from \"Hush.\" Please note that layout is tentative, and subject to change.\nZine Quest\nGMDK is proud to participate in Zine Quest, and as such The Demon Collective, Vol. 1 is represented in its physical form as a saddle-stitched, a5 B/W softcover, digitally printed via Mixam. If the print run exceeds our wildest dreams--to the point where it would be cheaper to mass-print 500 or more copies--we're in talks with an independent print shop that would provide a higher-quality product for a similar price. \nThe book is currently in layout, so entirely accurate page counts aren't yet available, but current estimates place it at 32-36 pages, depending upon if we hit the stretch goal for four additional full-page art pieces. \nYour book probably won't come alive and eat you, but if it does, we'll send a full refund to your next of kin.\nShipping\nWe're thrilled to announce that we've partnered with Exalted Funeral, an established storefront for RPGs and other books. Shipping costs to the US are factored into the price, and subsidized for international backers. \n$1 or more: Supporter\nYou're a certified demon now. At just $1 you'll receive the artless, raw text version of The Demon Collective, Vol. 1 as soon as the Kickstarter ends, and be able to comment and receive updates on the project.\n$5 or more: PDF\nIn addition to everything at the $1 level, you'll get the full-art, PDF version of The Demon Collective, Vol. 1, fully interlinked and optimized. \n$12 or more: Print + PDF\nEverything above, plus a digitally printed, full-art a5 zine shipped right from our infernal realm to yours. Shipping to the US is included in this price, and a subsidy is added for backers outside of the country. \n$50 or more: Duchess/Duke of Hell (10 SPOTS ONLY!)\nThis is where it gets fun. At this price, you'll get a special, one-of-a-kind certificate with a title, rank, and sigil marking you as a greater demon, designed and signed by the Vampire Princess herself: Mabel Harper. \nPlayers always bugging you about optional movement rules? Stop them in their tracks by whipping out your official title, proclaiming you HALCLAST THE THOUSAND-LEGGED, WHOSE STRIDE IS THE MEASURE. \nInspired by the demons listed in the Lesser Keys of Solomon, we'll work with you to define your domain, your name and pseudonyms, and the symbol denoting your influence. Afterwards, we'll ship you a certificate proclaiming such, on high-quality archival paper, to be placed wherever you frequently find yourself needing to prove your infernal authority.\n$50 or more: The Doomed (10 SPOTS ONLY!)\nSend in a photo, and Lauren will use you as a reference model for one of the doomed adventurers. You'll be petrified by a basilisk, pursued by vampire spawn, overwhelmed by cultist, and ensorcelled by wizards. However, your final moments will be preserved for posterity within the pages of The Demon Collective. \n$2,000: Fully Optimized PDF\nThe works. At this level, David Shugars will give the PDFs the highest quality treatment: full interlinking, toggle layers for a print-friendly design, and total PDF/UA accessibility compliance, for use with text-to-speech programs for the visually impaired. \n$3,500: Four New Illustrations\nLauren Bryce will draw four full-page illustrations, one for each adventure. \nAt this price point, we'll also unlock the option to add on an 18x24 poster of the illustration of your choice for $5 (separate shipping rates will apply). \n$5,000: Reference Cards and Hand-Drawn Maps\nIf we hit this, GMDKs first publication will have succeeded beyond our wildest expectations.   We'll have Shay (twitter, instagram) hand-draw the workable-but-basic versions we already have (and which will be in the raw text document) with a beautiful, stippled style that will go perfectly with the rest of the art and design. We'll also include with every print copy a set of a5 reference cards (along with a PDF to print more, if you so choose), printed on both sides, and designed to provide everything you need to run the dungeons at-a-glance. These will be exclusive to Kickstarter backer.\nWe are GMDK, a tabletop role-playing game publisher devoted to the idea that RPG's are for everyone. Our goal is to provide a way for marginalized writers, artists, and designers to share their vision with the greater gaming world, and to produce high-quality, table-ready books that are as exciting to run the first time as they are the 20th.\nWe're also committed to paying the best rates in the business for creative work: a significant portion of your backing goes directly to the writers, editor, and artist for this project in the form of royalties, ensuring they are fairly compensated for their work.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs this is our first Kickstarter, we've done dozens of hours of research into other projects to avoid the typical pitfalls.

If you want to check out a work in progress of the books layout, here\u2014we've got one. Ok, back to the rest of the kickstarter. :)\nA Strange Long Trip\nThe Ultraviolet Grasslands and the Black City is a tabletop role-playing game book, half setting, half adventure, and half epic trip; inspired by psychedelic heavy metal, the Dying Earth genre, and classic Oregon Trail games. It leads a group of \u2018heroes\u2019 into the depths of a vast and mythic steppe filled with the detritus of time and space and fuzzy riffs.\nThe UVG is the work of the designer, artist, and writer Luka Rejec and was made possible through the generous support of hundreds of discerning fans at the Stratometaship patreon. Luka's previous work includes illustrating Chris Kutalik's acid fantasy Misty Isles of the Eld, co-writing What Ho Frog Demons with the Hydra Co\u00f6perative, and writing, art, and design on the already-sold-out adventure of witch-hunting: Witchburner.\nIn partnership with Exalted Funeral Press, the goal of this kickstarter is to finally give the UVG the hardback full-color print run this celebration of metal psychedelia deserves. The writing and art are all done, the editing and final layout are currently in progress. The estimated date of delivery is late August 2019.\nThe well-travelled way.\n\"Honestly, this module is like you climbed up inside my head when I was feverish with malaria while listening to Blood Ceremony and Wolfmother and also with a 5th of bourbon in me, and then laid out all my weirdest imaginations in a far better, more organized, and interesting fashion than I ever could. The only way this module would be more my thing is if you tattooed it on me.\" \u2014A Fan (Was it you? Who wrote that? It's well written!)\nBut those aren't our words.\nA Module for Journeys of Discovery\nThe UVG is for referees and players who want to run a months\u2019 long science fantasy Marco Polo-style voyage across a weird, old world.\nThe UVG is for any gamer who wants to mine it for inspiration, adventuring locations, odd characters, maps, items, and random encounters.\nThe UVG is an art book knitting together Luka's illustrations and maps and writing.\nThe UVG is loud, heavy music, and grinding, tectonic sci-fi given flesh as a rule-light old-school 'R' or what have you continent-spanning rpg adventure.\nHey, there's a free version of the manuscript available for download. That's what it is.\nPT Helmet faces a Lamarckian Monstrosity. So brave.\nThe Vast Edge of the World\n\"A world begins when it emerges from the mists of time. So it is with the civilizations of the Rainbowlands, which mark their count from when the Long Ago ended and the Now began.\nThe Rainbowlanders are the humans of a later era, undisputed masters of the fertile lands around the Circle Sea, dwellers in the Eye of Creation. They come in many shapes, colors, creeds, and faiths. They pile unkempt technology and misremembered lore together into a teetering whole. They rule the settled lands under their polychrome deities of ill-repute.\nThis story is not their story. This story begins at the edge of their world, at the Left End of the Right Road. At the westernmost outpost of humanity, the Violet City. Bastion against the hordes, entrepo\u0302t to the exotic sunset lands, and last port of civilization before the trackless steppe studded with the detritus of the Long Ago.\"\nThe dark sea at the edge of space.\nThe UVG threads its way across seven time zones of vast continent to end at the fabled Black City, where time and space become one on the shores of the wine-dark sea.\nStrange new humans, from the poly-bodied porcelain princes to the ever be-suited satraps and the mind-controlling cats.\nDozens of modular mechanics for handling caravans, survival, theft and trade in a vast strange country.\nThirty otherworldly areas, from the Porcelain Citadel to the Dead Bridge and the Forest of Meat, linking the civilizations of the Circle Sea and the mysterious Black City.\nOver 100 points of interest, from the Fallen Iron Obelisk to the Erosion of War and the time-distorting Copper Hulls.\nHundreds of encounters, strange characters, odd magics, uncanny equipment.\nOver 300 pieces of art by the author.\n80,000 words completed, loved, encouraged, and enjoyed by over 300 members of the Stratometaship patreon. Now being edited.\nTraces of past times tunnel through the world like worms.\nThe People Behind the UVG\nLuka Rejec, owner of WTF Studio, is a Slovenian designer, illustrator, and writer based in Seoul, South Korea. We've mentioned him before. He's done the art and the writing for the UVG, he's now working on the layout. He loves dogs, heavy metal, 1970s sci fi art, and rocks. Also penguins and owls.\nCristin and Matt Kelley of Exalted Funeral Press are building the place for the DIY and OSROWHY community to get all their printed materials. They got frustrated with searching for the books they loved, and decided to do something about it. They're printing and distributing the UVG after the successful collaboration on the first edition of Witchburner.\nFiona Geist and Jarrett Crader are the MoonRat Conspiracy and collectively responsible for editing Witchburner and also other works like the Spellburn podcast, Fever Swamp and Troika! from The Melsonian Arts Council, Sounds of the Mushroom Kingdom from LotFP, Solar Blades and Cosmic Spells from Old Skull Press, Phantasmagoria from Apollyon Press, the recent kickstarter Silent Titans from Swordfish Islands, and, not least, the Mothership Players' Survival Guide and Mothership: Dead Planet from Tuesday Knight Games. Whew. They're making sure the book makes sense.\nSaker Tarsos is a grad student going into information science, and an ttrpg player since he was six. He's also behind a series of cool digital DM screens for other games, like Sean McCoy's acclaimed Mothership. He's joining the project to build a digital companion web page to the tables in the UVG, so you can generate results on the fly, from your handy personal digital assistant or using your desktop terminal console computing unit.\nYup, it's a sky church.\nFunding the UVG\nThe goal is simple: to cover the cost of good editors and print 1,000 high-quality copies of this beautiful book. At $15,000 we've got this covered:\n2 of the most beautiful editors in the biz.\nhardcover A4 books.\n192 full-color pages to hold all the words and the art on their heavy pages.\nStretch a bit further for the perfect selfie in front of the cerulean waters.\nOverclocking the UVG\nWe've seen many kickstarters sunk by over-ambitious stretch goals, that's why we're keeping ours on a tight leash: none of these stretch goals involve any new writing or content. It's all about applying the extra funding to improve design, add some cool accessories, and make the game easier to run.\n$20,000 \u2014 Accordion Map\nThe UVG has a 140-centimeter (55-inch) long map. Well, if we hit $20k we'll spruce it up, prep it for print, and get it turned into an folded accordion map where you can track your adventures as they unfold. We got this! Check out an early version of the map.\n$25,000 \u2014 Dice Set\nWe'll design a polyhedral dice set just for the UVG, so you too can burn your gaming eyes on some deep retina-searing purple dice. Also got these!\nWe've also got some other color options. Check out the update above.\n$40,000 \u2014 The Game Master Screen\nOur editors are compiling the most relevant tables, rules, and information in the UVG anyway, but it's a rough thing. If we hit $40k, we're going to lay out the whole thing, whip Luka to make a 4:1 landscape artwork for the screen, and commission a fancy limited-edition screen to complement this kickstarter edition.\nUPDATE: early March, 2019: huh, you guys smashed that. Cool.\nMore stretch goals!\nUVG kickstarter - new stretch goals\nDear backers! Dear fans of the Ultraviolet Grasslands! Dear people of infinitely good taste, you smashed all our stretch goals, so we've developed a few new ones. We worked hard to make sure that none of them should break our production schedule.\n$60,000 \u2014 Book and Editors Upgraded\nWhen we hit $60K we're upgrading the production and compensation quality of this kickstarter. The UVG book is getting a stitched spine and a ribbon (trying to make it purple!). Our editors at the MoonRat Conspiracy, Fiona and Jarrett, are getting their paycheck doubled for all their hard work (and they get to proofread the Big Map, too, hah!).\nUNLOCKED! Our editors are happier!\nThis is a mockup of the regular cover. Final limited edition cover coming soon.\n$70,000 - Full Color Ultraviolet\nIf we hit $70K, we're paying Luka some extra cash to hide in a bunker for a couple of weeks and bring full color to the UVG. This doesn't mean every last page is going to be a riot of color (yes it does \u2014Luka). Sketches and details will remain just that, but the rest of the book will get the high-detail treatment.\nUNLOCKED! All the art that can handle color is getting color!\nAll the art will not be this eye-burningly multi-colored. Probably.\nLast of the Stretch Goals\nWe've gotta be clear here ... when we started, we hoped we'd do well, but never imagined we'd find an audience this big. Lots of kickstarters sink themselves by going overboard with additional stretch goals that break the piggy bank and the project timeline.\nWell, here we have it. Full technicolor. So what now? We're not going to add massive extra goals because we've already got a lot on our plate with the editors' #NeedsMore.\nBut stretch goals are ... motivational? So we're adding two final, ultimate goals. One is serious, the other is fun.\nColors! Bursting! Strange machines!\n$85,000: Digital Reference Companion\nAt $85K Saker Tarsos gets paid to make a free digital reference for the UVG: with all the tables and generators set up on a single page. Sort of like what he did for Mothership but with more UVG art and Saker spending time to figure out how to make the work better and faster. This goal is completely divorced from the delivery of the physical goods and will be handled by Saker Tarsos. \nMinimum product is: a website with automated generators for everything UVG. Maximum product: we might get Saker to build a small tool that makes it easy to import random tables, spit out code, and embed it on other web pages. Think of this as all of us in the #OSROWHY (old school reorientation or what have you) giving gaming tools back to the world.\nThat was the fun stretch goal. \nUnlocked! And we made it! Thank you!\n$99,999: Ultimate Stretch\nWe'll make a heavy metal, leather jacket yoga video for the ultimate stretch goal. It will be terrible, just like the pun. We will do it after the books are shipped. We won't prepare for it beforehand. We won't script it. The shooting quality will be dreadful. Watching it will not make you a better person, a better game master, or a better roleplayer. It won't even teach you much yoga (downward failing dog, maybe?).\nOk, but the serious bit: this is a bit of a joke, and if we reach this goal, we'll add more jokes\u2014but all of them will be weird, silly things we'll do to express our gratitude after the book is done and printed and delivered. Right now our goal is to bring you the most epic world crawling game.\nGreat. Now Luka has to start actually practicing properly and getting a routine down. Sigh.\nBeyond: $111,111 and the Infinite* Exalted Stretch\nOk, let's have some fun with an infinite stretch goal ... Matt's Metal Mindfulness Mountain Meditation.\nAuthors reserve the right to change the mountain without prior notice. Donkey not included.\nAfter all the packing and shipping is complete, we're going to force march Matt up a remote Idaho mountain to become one with himself, experience wellness, breathe in love and breathe out heavy metal.\nFor every $1,000 over $99,999 Matt is going to spend a minute in silent, mindful meditation, while listening to heavy metal on top of a mountain.\nIf we reach $111,111 we are going to add a special extra six minutes and sixty-six seconds of meditation on top of the rest. And then, we'll add another six minutes and sixty-six seconds at $122,222, at $133,333, and so on. Ok, ok, won't be totally infinite. We're capping the maximum mindfulness meditation at 129 minutes\u2014the length of the 1982 classic, Conan the Barbarian. The film crew has to have something to do while Matt sits and meditates, after all.\nWe're only going to release a Six minute and sixty-six second video though, trimming the full meditation session down, because otherwise it'd be kind of boring to watch. But we'll keep the video and the clocks running.\n*Definition of infinity subject to change.\nNote: this stretch goal has zero impact on the actual deliverables or outcome of the kickstarter, but it is going to force our Exalted Funeral members to take care of their health after shipping all those books.\nAwakened from a forgotten time, the spaceonaut is perplexed.\nShipping Costs Estimated\nWe're calculating shipping as a separate charge when backer surveys are sent out. The numbers are not completely precise yet, because we're covering a range to account for the final weight of the book, the map, the screen, the dice. As a rule, with just the book, you're looking at the lower end, with the whole bundle, close to the upper end (all prices in USD).\nUSA: $4\u20138\nUK and EU: $12\u201321\nCanada: $18\u201325\nAustralia and New Zealand: $21\u201325\nRest of the world: $30\u201345\n Off-world: not available \nExalted Funeral Press is negotiating shipping and distribution around the world. We're working with the Melsonian Arts Council for distribution in the UK and hammering out details with a couple of other companies to cover Australia, Canada, New Zealand the Continental EU (CEU), because Brexit is looming and we're trying to bring those shipping numbers down for you.\nWhy does the EU have such a spread? Well, there are 26 or 27 countries in the EU (depending on when you're reading this), each with their own postal service. Once we have the numbers nailed tighter for each individual country, the list will get longer.\nImport duties, taxes (VAT), and additional charges are not included in the price or shipping cost. Any additional charges added on by the destination country will be your responsibility. Please check with your country's customs office to determine if there will be any additional costs, and what they might be. <- We took this paragraph straight from the Silent Titans kickstarter, because it seemed sensible. Thanks, Jacob!\nHow much will delivery of just the dice cost? Less. Not sure how much less, but quite a bit. We'll get those numbers out soon.\nWe'll be fiiiine. Right?\nEstimated Timeline\nContent Editing: 6 weeks [85% complete] - we've run into Luka having to write a few thousand supplemental words to cover the #NeedsMore hashtags.\nCopy Editing: 4 weeks [80% complete] - most of the book is ready for layout.\nLayout: 3 weeks [15% complete] - we've begun\nProofreading: 2 weeks\nFinal Layout: 2 weeks [end of May 2019]\nPrinting: 6 weeks [June 2019]\nShipping: 2 weeks\nExtra fat month, just in case: 5 weeks\nTotal: 31 weeks [end of August 2019]\nWe've estimated how much work there is to be done, then added a bit more time on top, then added another month, because we suspect we missed something.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOk, time for the scary stuff.\n\nAs we've said, the Ultraviolet Grasslands are written. They are currently being edited and laid out, and a digital version will be available no matter what. The purpose of this kickstarter is to give the UVG the print run it deserves. After all, the upfront costs of a solid full-color print run are scary for a small indie press.\n\nBut things could go wrong. Sickness, nuclear war (the author and designer lives in Seoul, after all) and global economic crashes could derail us.\n\nA risk for EU backers will be Brexit, because our fulfillment in Europe is currently on the capable shoulders of the Melsonian Arts Council. If the customs and postage from the UK to the EU become ridiculously complicated, we will change the distribution arrangement. Fortunately, there's a lot of time between Brexit (29 March), the EU elections (26 May), and the delivery date (31 August) to sort that out. We should be fine, but this is the big risk to be aware of right now.\n\nFortunately the hard work (writing and art) are all complete and the tasks that remain are fundamentally technical: editing, layout, print, distribution. All of us organizing and participating in this kickstarter are doing our darndest to make ourselves replaceable in case something happens to us. None of the stretch goals require large additional work - dice designs or game master screen visuals would also work with a different artist (though, you know, Luka would be sad if that happened, for obvious reasons).\n\nBut, we're a small team, and that kind of trouble could delay us. To that end, we've laid out our timeline for you, and will communicate regularly to make sure you understand how things are going.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Watcher on the Walls", "descp": "The caravan leaves civilization for the strange sights of the utter west.

And all in a compact zine format.\nA Pound of Flesh is a brand new module for the Mothership Sci-Fi Horror RPG. It's largely centered around the notorious space station, Prospero's Dream, a grimy and sprawling outer-rim black marketplace where mercenaries and raiders rub elbows with spooks and slickscreen stars. The Dream is a cramped city-sized criminal haven where anything can be bought or sold and any crew can find well paying work (if they're willing to get their hands dirty). Written by Donn Stroud and others, with art & layout by Sean McCoy.\nThe Choke, a cramped slum hidden in the bowels of the Dream. Those who can't afford the hefty Oxygen Tax often end up here.\nWe've built this dark corner of the universe for you to slot into your Mothership (or any other Sci-Fi RPG) campaign, and we've filled it to the brim with nasty NPCs who we've armed with weapons of mass destruction, and then pumped full of illegal stimulants. We think you're gonna like it.\nBut there's a lot more to A Pound of Flesh and Prospero's Dream than meets the eye. \nWith APOF you'll have access to easy-to-use generators for quickly populating your sector with your own dingy space stations and seedy backwater outposts. In just a few die rolls you'll be able to throw down a unique space station and then find out what kinds of trouble lies aboard (with a cool mad-lib style generator. Yes, mad-libs).\nWe also did a podcast episode about it that you can listen to.\nMothership is a sci-fi horror roleplaying game that places a huge emphasis on being easy to run but difficult to beat. It uses a simple d100 roll-under system similar to Call of Cthulhu, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and the Basic Role Playing system. It's incredibly easy to hack to meet your table's needs (increasing or decreasing the difficulty as necessary to create a fun and challenging time).\nYou play as one of four classes: Teamster, Android, Scientist, or Marine, and then customize that class to your liking with a branching skill tree.\nClick the image to download the Character Sheet\nWe wanted building characters to be easy so we put all the rules for character creation right there on the character sheet. With a game this deadly it's important that players are able to get right back into the action if their character dies. And why is it so deadly? Well, aside from just taking damage (from, you know, like, a scalpel wielding void raider) your characters also accumulate Stress which builds up until something terrible happens (like oh, you know, seeing your crew mate get ripped in half by the thing that just crawled its way out of the airlock), after which you'll make a Panic Check. If you roll poorly your character could be inflicted with awful conditions ranging from chronic night terrors to permanent phobias to full on psychopathic rampages!\nTrust us, it's fun. \nIf you want to check out the system the PDF of the Player's Survival Guide is Pay What You Want on DriveThruRPG. Take a look and let us know what you think. We've also got a great Discord server with an awesome community full of people ready to answer questions and help out with anything you need.\n\nPrototype cover - not final artwork\nA Pound of Flesh is jam-packed with content ready to plug-and-play as soon as you get it. We have a penchant for cramming as much content as humanly possible into our Mothership adventures, and APOF is no different. It contains:\n48 page zine in 2 colors, printed in a limited edition format. We're really excited about this zine and we're going to try out some cool experiments with the format during printing.\n Prospero's Dream: a complete, ready-to-play location with over 10 sections (including: an opium den, mercenary company, cage fighting arena for strange creatures, and more), a dozen NPCs, and adventure seeds for taking missions onboard or outside the station.\nEquip your characters with entirely brand new weapons and interesting drugs with fascinating effects.\nAn entire section devoted to Cybernetics and how to use them in your game, their cool effects and devastating cost (I mean, it's Mothership, what did you think they were gonna be like?)\nA generator for building your own space station on the fly. Give your players a place to rest, refuel, find work, and get into a little trouble after only a few d10 rolls.\nDozens of patrons, jobs, and unique encounters which make the Dream come alive as you get to know it over time.\nAnd more! \nCybernetics in Mothership are both a gift and a curse, but you knew that already, right?\n There are three pledge levels for this campaign and we're pretty excited about all of them.\n $5 PDF Only: Get the PDF version of A Pound of Flesh and access to any digital only stretch goals that we unlock.\n $15 Print + PDF Bundle: Get A Pound of Flesh in both print and PDF as well as all Physical + Digital Stretch Goals that we unlock.\n $45 Mothership Mega Bundle: Get the Print and and PDF versions of A Pound of Flesh, as well as the Print + PDFs of the Mothership: Player's Survival Guide and our very first module, the critically acclaimed Dead Planet. You also get all the Stretch Goals (physical and digital) that we unlock and the limited edition Lucifer-1 patch. \n\nWe've unlocked all the Stretch Goals for this campaign!\nWhoa! We unlocked every stretch goal we had planned for A Pound of Flesh. This is absolutely going to be the best version of A Pound of Flesh we can possibly make. Thank you all so much!\nIf you want to know more about Mothership, check out these reviews. We also have a few actual plays that you can listen to:\nTuesday Knight Podcast - Mothership Playcast\nBoard With Life - Mothership part 1, part 2 \nWe'll be using Backerkit after the kickstarter as a pledge manager, which will give you an opportunity to pick up extra copies (like say of the print version of the Player's Survival Guide) if you want. Additionally, we ship customs friendly to: the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China. \nIn the Dream you can buy anything, for a price.

They seek that elusive edge. Mercenary or motivated, idealistic or just hungry; the street elite infiltrate, invade, and impersonate to make a buck off the giants of industry. This is the story of cybered-up outsiders slipping into the penthouse of dystopian accomplishment uninvited. It\u2019s a retrofuturistic tale of defying the social order, the authorities, and the odds. \nCYB_R is a cyberpunk genre conversion for D&D's 5th edition, employing bleeding edge rules modifications to allow for cinematic gameplay and leveraging 5th edition's template-style character building to allow for characters that just seem cool from the get go. Characters are post-future adventurers, pulling gigs for and against the most powerful entities on the globe and they're looking rad doing it. Chrome limbs, boss haircuts, and padded shoulders are the norm. CYB_R is the bridge between the monsters of fantasy gaming and the neon future we all feared we\u2019d be living in by now.\nEach character class is modified from a tried and tested D&D class, with innovative archetypes providing access to gambits: an alternative to spells. Gambits allow for heroic stunts, explosive maneuvers, and creative hacking talents. It\u2019s all about style and gambits allow each character to really shine in their area of expertise.\nLet\u2019s not forget crossover. Since CYB_R is built on D&D it takes very little put magic into the mix, however you explain it. If you want dragons and sorcery to come back to the world due to some crazy old prophesy, that\u2019s easy. If you want nanotech to be so advanced that nanite programmers are the equivalent of modern wizards that works too. Nothing is holding you back. You can file off the serial numbers on your favorite monster to create a cybered-up foe with ease.\nCYB_R is a game toolbox which embraces the themes of the cyberpunk genre and runs with them. Games are set in a dystopian vision of the future from the perspective of 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s fears about technology, globalization, and corporate rule. It\u2019s glamorous and sexy to the point of surreality. It\u2019s dirty and grimy, and mad about it. It lends itself to heroes with attitude and style.\nTo put a point on it, cyberpunk is dated, and that\u2019s cool in a nostalgic kind of way. CYB_R is peppered with outdated technical and cultural terms. It\u2019s filled with 80\u2019s style and somewhat obsolete ideas about the role of technology in our lives and bodies. It\u2019s a retro vision of the future we embrace as its own kind of awesome.\nCHECK OUT THIS FREE PREVIEW OF THE GEEK CLASS: https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/265845/GEEK-A-preview-Class-for-CYBR\n[classes]\nThe following are CYB_R's classes and (tentative) archetypes for each.\nController. I\u2019ve mastered the interface to the vehicle of your destruction. Dexterity class based on Rogue. Archetypes: Demolisher (explosives expert), Driver (cybernetics replace the wheel and the yoke), and Operator (drone and robot master).\nEnforcer. I have my own allegiance, which grants me power and resources when I need them. Constitution class based on Paladin. Oaths: \n Corporate Policy (proud sellout)\n Family Honor (criminally connected)\n Serve and Protect (officer of what\u2019s left of the law)\nGeek. I\u2019m the brains of the operation. Carry my stuff, will you? Don\u2019t drop it. Intelligence class based on Warlock. Archetypes: \n Doc (combat medic / street cutter)\n Gamer (gamify reality)\n Hacker (breaker of systems). \nMartial. I know how these kinds of situations go. Follow my lead. Strength class based on Fighter. Archetypes: \n Artist (punching past technological limitations)\n Tank (armored up and powered on)\n Trenchcoat (laden with armaments). \nStar. I\u2019ve got style, talent, and a way with people. Hand me a gun already. Charisma class based on Bard. Archetypes: \n Athlete (peak physical condition)\n Rocker (inspirational musician)\n Journo (influential voice and investigator). \nStreetwise. I came from the streets. I stayed on the streets. I\u2019m cool with people who\u2019d kill you on sight. Wisdom class based on Ranger. Archetypes: \n Ganglander (master of turf and cred)\n Nomad (traveler and member of the caravan)\n Urban Explorer (acrobat and scout all in one).\n[systems]\nCYB_R utilizes the \"gambit system\"; a way of giving non-magical characters a dramatic replacement for spells. All classes are modified to integrate the \u201cpulling\u201d of gambits, with gambit slots replacing spell slots. Characters learn \u201ctricks\u201d instead of cantrips, and tend to use technology or weapons rather than casting implements and other material components. It's a simple fix which allows classes to be balanced based on existing D&D rules, while giving characters with gambits the ability to really shine. Spells are not just for nerdy wizards anymore.\nCYB_R also employs an easy-to-use template system for building simple NPCs and enemies. No more struggling to come up with balanced creatures. Just choose a base CR and add a couple tiered templates and you\u2019re good to go.\n[books]\nThe CYB_R Corebook\nA 150+ page color core rulebook with all you need to start your dystopian campaign of infiltration and destruction.

Shards aims to streamline that process for you, giving you the sort of things that you'd pull out of these big pieces in a form that's easier to simply slot in to your world.\nTo show you what we mean, here's a free shard that won't be in the Zine - The Druidic Routes\nWith a new issue every month we aim to make sure you never run out of inspiration. And with the first two issues being extra long due to our People's Heroes we'll be getting started with a bang.\nEach issue contains: \nThree Setting Shards: pieces of setting that can easily slip into whatever world you're using (including notes on how to do so for specific settings or how to adapt to other genres where relevant)\nAn article dealing with certain tips or tricks for building your own world\n [Unlocked by Philanthropist Backers] - The Magpie's Nest, talking about how to steal concepts from reality and/or mythology and repurpose them for your own world \nA segment where our resident Agony Aunt - the Letter Lich - answers some more specific world-building problems. [Possibly including yours, if you send them to us!]\nShe's full of good advice - especially if your problems are caused by a shortage of undead\n\nDetails of NPC and monster statistics for some of the more popular roleplaying systems will be available on our website where appropriate.\nAccessibility\nWe want to make this project as widely readable for all English-speakers as possible: Two of our team are dyslexic, along with several of our family members, so we have personal experience with how people who love to read and expand their personal worlds can struggle to do so.\nOur PDFs will have all the text as text - rather than embedded in images - and images will have embedded descriptions to ensure accessibility for screen readers. [this is also why te section header images have captions]\nWe're making sure the paper used is not bleached white - but instead will either be a light cream or the same sort of \"natural\" paper as novels - in order to make reading easier for colour-sensitive dyslexics.\nOur font choice is based on advice from dyslexia websites and our own dyslexic team members, in order to allow for shape-sensitive dyslexics to read - Century Gothic is our font of choice as it remains readable without the \"childish\" impressions assigned to ultra-readable fonts such as Dyslexie.\nInternational Postage\nPostage is included with the Zine because we'll be sending Shards to you as a letter rather than a parcel, and thus the cost doesn't vary anywhere near as much for different nations.\nWith a tiny number of exceptions, documents (such as Zines) at a value per issue of \u00a38, sent through the regular postal system do not need to be addressed by customs - each individual delivery is below all relevant thresholds. Thus the deliveries should be customs friendly by their nature - and they'll all be labelled with the appropriate customs declarations, so as to prevent delays and fees for inspections.\n\nWhy We're Kickstarting\nCrowdfunding is ultimately the best way small groups like us have of simultaneously funding our projects and gauging the demand, as well as providing a great opportunity to improve the final product by working with its audience - for example Marcos Hidalgo, a backer who helped us with our art on our earliest projects. We've had many successful Kickstarters, and two where the ultimate result has been \"this isn't what people want\" and we moved on to the next project.\nAs an ongoing project, Kickstarter was not our first choice for this style of release - instead we tried using Patreon. But ultimately we found that a lot of our past supporters didn't like the platform or were wary of automatically repeating charges, so we put it on the back burner. \nWith Kickstarter's Zine Quest we realised that a \"6-month subscription\" model would answer a lot of people's concerns - so here we are.\nWhy a Quickstarter?\nWe've found in the past that we end up worrying about the funding for the entire duration of the Kickstarter, slowing down our work. Going Quickstarter means we knock 10 days off our default time, and we don't bother with stretch goals at all - so we're spending less time worrying, and more time working on June and July's issues!\nWho we are\nWe're all writers and roleplayers, but we each bring our own experience and style to Shards.\nLoz: He has been a tabletop gamer for a quarter of a century, and in that time has come to realise he likes light-weight systems which don't get in the way of the story. \nWhen running games, he creates his own locations and NPCs (and so rarely if ever uses published modules), and when playing he likes his characters to be up to their necks in the lore of the world, and will frequently write additional things to provide hooks for the GM. \nAmy: Our resident artist-in-training, as well as a biology graduate - Amy tends to take a scientific eye to both alien and fantasy ecologies, but armed with a knowledge of just how outlandish the real world is, this definitely doesn't mean that they get less weird.\nAs a GM Amy tends to run more conversational and explorational scenarios, revealing aspects of the world through peaceful means; while as a player she likes her characters to look at the world from an unusual angle, whether that be due to coming from a different social standing, a different place or even a different time\nSte: While technically the boss (because no-one else wanted the job) Ste is by far the newest to roleplaying with only 12 years of experience, although his love of speculative fiction and worldbuilding has been around since childhood. \nAs a GM he likes to challenge the PCs and give them tough choices - and loves it when the players come up with a better option that he hadn't foreseen. As a player he tends towards characters with conflicted motivations, especially ones where each motivation drives them towards interaction with different parts of the team, and of the world.\nAli:  She's been a roleplayer for 24 years, and has played quite a range of RPGs - from classic to modern fantasy; from hard sci-fi to supers. Her favourite typographic character is the hyphen - (see!) as she tends to write in bursts. \nAs a GM, she tends to the cinematic, using language culled from film making, like calling NPCs extras. As a player, she likes to play Galahads - characters who are naive or ignorant, and let her discover the secrets of the campaign with them. \nArt on this page: Bearowl by Ravenfire55, Letter Lich by Artyom Semenov Design, Manacled Eye composed by Ste Coffey from work by Tamas Baranya and Keistutis, Computer-diamond by Somerset Geere, Dragonborn Bard by Dean Spencer.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have run several successful Kickstarter campaigns before - notably the Concept Cards line - so we know most of the issues that are likely to crop up.

The blindfold does not seem to hamper its vision as it slowly dips a spoon into the bowl of stew before it. Deliberately, it raises the spoon to its mouth, but there's no food in it as the spoon is upside down? Puzzled, it raises the utensil to examine it, turning it slowly between black gloved figures as if it has seen a spoon for the first time. The inn keep breaks the figure's reverie when he plunks down a full mug of ale next to seven other equally filled mugs at the figure's table. The figure drops the spoon, its blindfolded gaze felt by T'rank and Jeffeth. \"Tell me what you saw,\" it whispers, its lips moving slightly slower than the words. \"Then forget....\" \nIntroduction\nI was really excited to learn about the Zine Quest initiative here on Kickstarter. Zines are foundational to a wide swath of subcultures from gaming to music to social activism and beyond. The 'beyond' in my case, is in the field of UFOlogy. When you think of modern accounts of aliens and UFOs, you might not realize that a lot of what you know from popular culture was actually born out of zines back in the day. The old UFO zines, if you can find them, are amazing resources. They detail alien encounters, sightings of strange cryptids, all that good stuff, but they do it from the dawn of the movement, before the zeitgeist gelled around what a 'standard' alien encounter looks like in the mid 80s. \nThere is a parallel between the zines featuring early RPG content and those featuring UFO content. In a way, they both were testing grounds for new concepts, new scenarios. Those that took off would become accepted parts of the culture, while those that did not would dangle like vestigial tails, evolutionary dead ends. Thanks to the internet, there's been a bit of a resurgence in mining these old ideas and since we now live in a remix culture, I'd like to combine them and a zine seems like a great way to get started.\nUFOs and fantasy gaming do have a bit of a shared past beyond both relying on zines in their early days. H.G. Wells, one of the fathers of science fiction who helped define what aliens wanted in The War of the Worlds, also was an avid gamer who published his own rules in Little Wars some fifteen years later. Gary Gygax brought a crashed spaceship masquerading as a dungeon to conventions in the form of Expedition to the Barrier Peaks. The derro, that race of degenerate underground dwarves, share a lot of traits with the dero, another degenerate underground race promoted as part of The Shaver Mystery. So while UFOs and fantasy roleplaying are not at the 'chocolate and peanut butter' level, they're pretty soundly 'chocolate and cayenne pepper' tier.\nWhat is High Strangeness?\nFor What Happened at Wyvern Rock?, I'd like to focus on the concept of High Strangeness and how you can use it to add some fun complications to your fantasy setting. High Strangeness is a concept introduced by Dr. J. Alan Hyneck (now seen being played by Littlefinger on the History Channel's Project Blue Book) that covers the weird elements of UFOlogy, those experiences that cannot be directly explained or quantified. This is the weird stuff, weirder than just seeing a flying saucer - it's the unreality that often accompanies a sighting - animals not behaving as they should, mysterious figures lurking at the fringes, dreams and visions and prophecies and...\nOof! One of the first parts of What Happened at Wyvern Rock? is to go into High Strangeness and how it can manifest in your campaign. I'll save the in-depth description for there, so for simplicity's sake, I'll point to some High Strangeness examples in modern pop culture - The Black Lodge from Twin Peaks, the 'Jose Chung's From Outer Space' episode of The X-Files, and 'High Strangeness' from Adventure Time. Like I said, this is the weird stuff!\nSwords and Saucery\nOne of the biggest ideas I'm looking forward to exploring is how exactly to incorporate the concept of High Strangeness into an already strange world. Would a farmer who often trades with dwarves or halflings, keeps an eye out for goblin and orc raiding parties, and attends a church overseen by an elf freak out upon seeing a Grey alien? If they saw a glowing light in the sky, would they be bothered or would they think it was just a wizard flying home?\nTaking a further step back, would a player be bothered? They know that everything they encounter in game has a sort of grounding to it in the form of dice rolls and rules. They are not overly worried by encountering new creatures and they can source the origins of that creature to a published resource. If the creature is too much for their character, that's on the GM. Think about how players react to a puzzle versus how they react to a new monster - while trial and error occurs in both, the former has a lot more effort put in to figuring out the puzzle's internal logic, assuming of course the player has not already read up on that particular monster in advance of the game session. By making the nature of the monsters a puzzle in itself, I hope to enhance player engagement at your table.\nIf you're familiar with John Keel or Jacques Vall\u00e9e, you're aware of the idea that there is an intelligence behind High Strangeness. I really like the idea that by making What Happened at Wyvern Rock?, we are taking that role upon ourselves.  \nOn This Rock I Build My...\nWyvern Rock is my generic fantasy setting that I'll use to discuss these concepts and set up encounters. You are obviously free to take what you like and ignore the rest. Should this zine blossom into something bigger, then a full campaign setting will be on offer, but before that happens, I'd like to get a zine of three under my belt! Until then, I want this to be useful to as many people as possible, so Wyvern Rock and its environs can be slotted into almost any rural area in your existing setting. The rock itself, named after the flying lizards that once roosted there, looms large on the horizon.\nProject Plan\nMy goal is to create the first issue of a zine focusing on introducing the High Strangeness of modern UFO encounters into fantasy roleplaying games. The zine will be 64 pages long and printed professionally by Kickstarter-recommended Smartpress. Issue #1 of What Happened at Wyvern Rock? will include:\n An Introduction to the World of High Strangeness - Plus how to apply it to a fantasy campaign setting.\n Random Close Encounter Tables - From sightings to experiences, these tables will help you roll out the weird in puzzling, engaging dollops.\n Scenario Hooks Based on \u2018real\u2019 UFO Encounters - Some of my favorites include the Hopkinsville Goblins, Cisco Grove, and the Travis Walton Experience. \n Species Spotlight - A look at the Greys, their goals, and how they may interact with your fantasy campaign setting.\nThe entire zine will be illustrated using my hand carved blockprints. Many of these prints already exist and are ready to be pressed and scanned right now. You can even see a few stuck in on this page or on my social media @coreypress (Instagram, Tumblr, Facebook). Without a doubt, I\u2019ll carve up some new ones specifically for this project.\nMy plan is to keep the content of this zine rules light - my familiarity is mostly with the extended d20 family of fantasy RPGs and I don\u2019t want to exclude an alien invasion at a table running Pendragon, GURPS, or a homebrew system. Where I can, I\u2019ll offer options for reskinning creatures or effects. This is not to say dice and rules won\u2019t be in the zine, just that I hope to keep it as generic as possible.\nI\u2019m deliberately keeping this Kickstarter campaign simple and straightforward. This is my first go around and my #1 goal is to get a completed project that we're happy with into your hands in a timely manner. If this campaign is successful, there will be further issues focusing on different elements of High Strangeness including cryptids (Mothman!), abduction experiences, and other alien races. I don't want too far ahead of myself, but if things appear to be going really well, I have a few stretch goals planned.\nI chose August 2019 as my delivery date and feel confident I can make it. Ideally, I\u2019d hope to have everything together and ready for the printer by the end of May, but from backing past Kickstarters, I\u2019m fully aware how Life Happens and would much rather risk delivery early than late. \nKeel helped to popularize the Men in Black, the Mothman, and other strange experiences.\nHi! My name is Drew and I\u2019ve been carving scenes of medieval UFO abductions for several years now. Each piece is hand carved, bound in ink, and pressed to wood by me here in Salem, MA under the shop name The Corey Press (get it?). I\u2019ve also been a gamer since cracking open the Red Box one summer in 4th grade. Since then I\u2019ve dabbled in the RPG industry - running LARPs in college, doing a bit of freelance editing during the d20 boom, and even drawing a few illustrations for Jon Peterson\u2019s Playing at the World. I've been a fan of UFOs and the paranormal since I saw my first UFO - it was on the cover of a Time Life book at the library.  \nProcess-wise, I embrace the DIY ethic that is common among zine makers. I'm largely self-taught and the challenge of figuring out how to do something new is a large part of what drew me to this project. I hope you can join me on this wacky adventure. \nMy influences are the works of John Keel, Charles Fort, Jacques Vall\u00e9e, David Paulides,  Rosemary Ellen Guiley, and anyone else who looks at the weirder aspects of the paranormal (Sorry, Stanton!). Podcasts are a great source of inspiration as well - a few of the podcasts I listen to as I carve include Mysterious Universe, Last Podcast on the Left, and Bigfoot Collector's Club. I pretty much grew up with Dungeons and Dragons, went through my Vampire: The Masquerade phase in college, and continued to pick up books even when life was to busy to play. My eight year old has recently expressed an interest in D&D and rolled up a pretty OP Elf Rogue, although my wife has forbidden me from giving him alien abduction nightmares.\nThank you so much for taking the time to read through this particular slice of madness! I hope you're one of the elect that dig both aliens and RPGs - I have high hopes for this project and look forward to getting to work!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, so I've set everything to be as simple as possible.

Now that we're funded, we're excited to get back to writing wonderful stories. If you have any late questions about the game or campaign, feel free to ask in a message or comment. And if you want to learn more about the game, visit Plumplim.com.  It's our website for all things related to 1001 Odysseys. \nBlast off to ADVENTURE! You\u2019re the stalwart crew of the deep-space starship Odyssey. The distant stars beckon you to explore, to overcome the unknown, and to befriend the entire galaxy in this whimsical science fiction journey. \nGather your weirdest friends (or journey on your own) and strap in for a whimsical science fiction adventure like no other. 1001 Odysseys is the feel-good, narrative-driven journey full of adorable space aliens we\u2019ve always wanted to play. Unlock the map and choose your own path through Insula, a far-flung galaxy of curious aliens who can't wait to meet you.  Choices made by players decide how the story unfolds.  It is simplest to play with four enthusiastic players who can each take on one of the crew roles; however, it is very easy to share roles and let more people play or combine roles to allow for fewer players.  With hundreds of choices to make, no two gameplay experiences will ever be the same!\nWant to see the game in action?  We've put video playthroughs  and a PDF walkthrough in The Game section below.\n1001 Odysseys is easy to learn, quick to begin, and it's simple enough to save your progress and pick up again later. Our stories are divided into bite-size Chapters, each of which takes 30-60 minutes to play through. With over 30 chapters of content to experience, you'll have all the adventures you can imagine! \nEach piece of the game is managed by one of the crew roles: Operations, Information, Navigation, or Commander. It\u2019s great to have one player per crew role, but it\u2019s also easy to share or combine roles to accommodate more or fewer players.\nWe've published a walkthrough PDF for part of the first Chapter. If you want to see the game in-detail, check it out!\nSimple rules\nDecide as a team (or on your own, if that\u2019s your thing) where to go and what to do next. The Mission Control Board shows letters and numbers for available actions and missions and the Map shows the coordinates for all the locations you can visit. The Operations and Navigation Officers report the combined code to the Commander, who looks it up in the Story Book and assigns a crew member to read the next part of the adventure. Will you discover a new place on your current Map? Uncover an item that might come in handy later? Experience a strange alien encounter?  \nHere's an example:\nThe updates section following the story text contains clear instructions for crew members on what to do next. New locations, missions, and actions will open new options for continuing your adventure!\nThat's all there is to it - make choices, and follow the instructions the Story Book gives you. You can be adventuring through fantastic weird space within minutes of opening the box.\nSaving your progress\nAs your crew plays through the adventure, the Information Officer will be asked to keep track of certain items, contacts, and unlocked chapters in the Passport. This becomes your single \u201csave file\u201d for the game. If you want to play a Chapter again, just insert a new Chapter sheet.  If you want to start a completely new playthrough, add a new Story folder. \nChapters\nPlaying through a Chapter takes about 30-60 minutes, and when that Chapter is over, everything can simply be dropped back in the box. When you're ready to play the next chapter, the Commander begins by reading its first page and play continues with a short list of exactly what should come out of the box.    \nPlaythroughs and Reviews\nOn Feb 4, we joined TWIST Gaming's Twitch stream to play 1001 Odysseys with them. We played through a full chapter of the game, and everyone had a lot of fun! Thanks to all who came and watched live.\nTWIST Gaming Playthrough:\nTWIST also filmed a review segment to talk about their feelings on the game (spoiler: they liked it a lot, but you knew that already if you watched the playthrough above!)\nTWIST Review / First Impression:\nBack in November, we played the game on the Penny Arcade Twitch channel, before bringing the game to PAX Unplugged. It was lots of fun, and you can get a feel for how the game flows from watching our adventures on Brumigum. \n Content Warning: While the game is kid-friendly, some swearing does occur in this video! \nA big, shiny new galaxy requires a big, shiny new space box! You will receive four Story Books, half a dozen gorgeous illustrated Maps, an Almanac filled with creature information and art, Passport supplies for a full adventure, a Discoveries Booklet full of obtainable inventory items, 200+ cards, a Mission Control Board, DISCs, map markers and more!\nNote: Components on display in this image and elsewhere on the page are prototypes, not final production quality. Our goal is to have the best components possible :)\nStory Books\n Note: Components on display in this image and elsewhere on the page are prototypes. The books will be perfect-bound with a thick cardstock cover. \nThe Story Books are your guide to adventure, containing full narrative prose detailing your travels and adventures through Insula. Each Book will include one Story that is roughly six to ten Chapters long and can end in many possible ways. Four of these Books are included with the core game, containing approximately 400 pages of tales in total. \nMaps\nThe intricate watercolor maps provide the background for your interactions, showing you several of the different worlds and locations you'll visit in Insula. The maps have an easy to read grid along their border (more on that below!), and they become more detailed as you adventure through the galaxy. \nLocation Cards\nAnd how does the Map become more detailed, you ask? Great question. As gameplay progresses, your Navigator (or you, if you\u2019re managing the ship on your own) will reveal Location Cards with detailed information on them.  Each can be placed on a specific spot on the Map, sliding into place so that the background art lines up perfectly. Voila: now you have a more complete view of where you can go!\nDecision Information Storage Chips (DISCs)\nIn some locations, you'll want to remember which choice you made, or how the environment changed when you visited. These simple DISCs, which are literally disks, will sit on top of the Location Card to keep track of it for you. \nCrew Location Marker\nYou'll move your crew marker around the map as you interact with the environment, allowing you to easily pinpoint your current position's grid coordinates. Your coordinates are used to look up paragraphs in the Story Book. \nMission Control Board\nThe Mission Control Board is how you determine which actions and missions are available to you at any given moment. It also keeps track of the effects of your choices, guiding you to new parts of the story that show the results of your earlier actions. \nMission Cards\nAs you work through the story, your Information Officer will record Missions in the Passport. On your Mission Control Board, you'll place cards representing them. Each row on the Board corresponds with one Mission in your story.\nAction Cards\nEach one of these cards represents a type of action that you can try to further your missions. Will you talk with a passerby? Study records? Look upon the vista? Action Cards are tucked underneath Missions to give you options on how to proceed.\nMomentum Cards\nAs you progress through the story, you build Momentum toward certain outcomes. The Story Book will direct you to place Momentum Cards in certain slots in a Mission's row, representing the choices you've made. When you complete a row, these cards will combine to produce a code that you look up in Story Book to advance or complete the Mission. \nWere the Plumplim impressed with your interactive topiary installation? What happens if you try to engineer your own spaceship? \nPassport\nEach Story has its own corresponding Passport Folder, where you can keep track of which Chapters you have unlocked, which items you've uncovered, and who you've met. It also holds the Chapter Sheet where you keep a list of your active missions. Keep the Passport safe, and you'll know right where to begin next time. \nDiscoveries Booklet\nSometimes you'll meet fascinating individuals or find interesting items lying around the galaxy. Record the new item or contact in your Passport, pull the corresponding sheet out of the Booklet, and tuck it into your Passport Folder. They might come in handy later.  \nAlmanac\nAn all-encompassing dossier of the species you'll meet and places you'll visit, the Almanac provides an illustrated trove of background information for anyone new to the region. Easy to reference quickly, it might just answer that age-old question: which came first, the Elemens or the egg? \nChoices That Matter\nThis isn't a novel. There's no linear path to follow from the beginning to the end. Instead, each choice you make leads you to new locations, unlocks new actions, or adds new missions that will direct the flow of the Story. Some choices may even remove actions that are no longer relevant. When you finish one Chapter, the next Chapter you\u2019ll play is determined by the choices you made and the secrets you discovered.  \nNo Wrong Choices\n Don\u2019t worry about making the wrong choice. It's not possible to make a choice that will end the game early, though you might find yourself in some exceptionally strange situations if things don't work out the way you expected. Maybe you weren't planning on participating in a planet-wide, inter-species pillow fight, but sometimes it's best to just roll with it and see how things turn out. \nPlaying Again\nStill wondering, \"what if...?\" after your last adventure? Add a new Chapter Sheet to your Passport, and play that Chapter again! Try out different choices and learn even more about the story that's unfolding. On a second playthrough, you\u2019ll find new missions, uncover strange locations, and even unlock whole new Chapters you haven\u2019t yet played. One path through a Story Book will hit only about 30% of its content!  \nRefresh Pack\nMost of the components in 1001 Odysseys are not modified at all during play. Maps, Story Books, cards, and wooden bits aren't changed or consumed. The Passports, Chapter Sheets, and Discoveries Booklet all get written on as you adventure. The Refresh Pack add-on contains a fresh new set of all these components, in case you want to start over from scratch! Passports and Chapter Sheets will also be available as free PDF downloads.\n1001 Odysseys is the biggest and most ambitious game the company has created thus far. We've brought together a whole slew of writers and artists in order to create your space journey, and we can't wait for you to make a bunch of friends in outer space. If you've attended Gen Con in the past few years, you might recognize some of our squad from our Department of Fun demo room!  Here's our creative team for the project: \n1001 Odd Questions Stream\nWe like talking about our game! So much, in fact, that we spent a whole hour talking about 1001 Odysseys and various other fun things (like cats). \nInterview\nBefore the campaign, Chris (Owner of Asmadi Games) and Julia recorded a podcast talking about the game. Here's the interview with Jason of Every Night is Game Night.   \n Ivy has yet to agree to any interviews!\nOn November 13, 2018, an odd transmission was heard throughout the galaxy from a satellite linked to plumplim.com. Here, we asked readers to help us shape the past, in order to unlock the future. The prologue story of 1001 Odysseys has begun to unfold, based on the choices of the readers! Plumplim.com will continue to operate as the Kickstarter campaign rolls on. You'll be faced with life-changing choices, like the ideal location to eat cake, whether to wear disguises and infiltrate sentient cat planets, and which odd space creature to follow for information about the world of 1001 Odysseys. \nJoin the story today!\nDuring the campaign, we'll be running Act II of the prologue, and you're able to vote on what chocie is made next.  We're also posting design diaries every Tuesday. The first one, \"No Wrong Choices,\" is already live! \nAfter the campaign, Plumplim.com will serve as the central location for all 1001 Odysseys information. Fun downloads, extra background stories, and more! \nWith your help, we'll be able to unlock components of the game that will make your journey even bigger and better! \nAt $75K, we unlocked Achievement Medals that will be in every copy of the game! Fun stickers, for your fun adventures.\nAt $100K, we unlocked a free set of crew badge pins to every single backer of of 1001 Odysseys. These will be exclusively available during the Kickstarter campaign and BackerKit pre-order period. \nAt $150K, we unlocked the Fates of the Iliad expansion box. This will be a separate (smaller) game box available as an add-on, containing content from guest authors. \nThe stretch goals at 200K and 300K weren't reached during the campaign, but we'll be counting funds raised in the post-campaign BackerKit toward them! So don't lose hope - we're going to get all the amazing things into the game we can :)\n\n\n\nSample track: Journey Through Insula\nWe have a variety of bonus goodies you can add on to your pledge for 1001 Odysseys. To secure one or more of these wonderful items, add the amount to your pledge for whatever your space-heart desires!  During the BackerKit, you'll be able to assign your dollars to items appropriately.\nThe Explorer + Goodies level includes one each of the Plumplim pin, plush, and refresh pack, at a bundle discount.\nPlease note that the canvas, pin and plush are only available in the USA.\n\nBecause of the weight of this game (literally, books are heavy!) and the fluctuating costs of shipping, we'll be calculating and charging shipping during the post-campaign BackerKit, when it's close to shipping time. The table below lists our estimated shipping cost per region. This shipping cost is flat, regardless of the number of add-ons you purchase.\nOur goal is to come in at or even below these estimates. This is especially true if we have a high enough volume of backers to be able to send a full container of games overseas.  \nEstimated Shipping Costs: \nOther Regions:\nIf you are not in one of the areas listed above, our best option may be to ship directly from the US, instead of using an overseas partner. Shipping is likely to be higher ($35+), depending on the exact location. \nIs the project EU-Friendly?\nThe short answer: we hope so. The long answer: We can't be sure, based on the evolving laws and Brexit situation. Our shipping hub is in the UK, but we will try to add one on the continent if things go messily. \nRefund Policy\nAs with all of our campaigns, if you're unhappy with our progress or product for any reason, we'll give you a full refund. This includes the case where shipping costs rise beyond our targets. Also, because of the complex issues surrounding Brexit, we cannot predict what the taxes / import situation will be when this project fulfills for backers outside the US. \nTo be super clear: If for any reason once production is done it turns out that it'll cost more to ship than you're willing to pay, simply ask and we'll refund your pledge.\nTiming and Logistics\nThe planned schedule for delivery of 1001 Odysseys is March of next year. We've fully written one of the four Story Books, and mapped out ideas for the other three. The bulk of the effort left to be done is writing the rest of the content, painting beautiful maps, and creating the rest of the supporting artwork. Once the campaign completes we'll provide updates on our progress roughly monthly, and you might be able to catch a sneak peek or playtest of the other stories at conventions later in the year! \nStores + Retail Release\nIf you're interested in pre-ordering as a store for retail sale, contact us directly in KS messages, or by email at asmadigames@gmail.com. We don't have a retail pledge level, but will get KS exclusive bits to retailers who pre-order before release.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've run many Kickstarter campaigns, and have had plenty of experience getting things together and sent out to all our backers.

Black core would be great, white core may feel a bit flimsy short of 320gsm. What is the finish? Matte, gloss, linen? What is the play mat? It appears to be just a paper fold map, which does raise concerns about the durability, and spills at the game table. What is the thickness of the quest boards? And yes, have you considered upgrades instead of having a co-author join at 200k? It frankly seems you have the writing done and well in hand, what does that goal add as opposed to enhanced materials to make the game last longer?

It uses cards, a d20, and an free companion app to get you straight into epic adventures with friends and family - even if you've never played an RPG before.\nExpedition contains endless depth: it's fully open source with customizable cards and 100+ community-created quests. We even have a GM mode to provide veteran gamers a more traditional Game Master led experience. \nExpedition: The Future is the second expansion to Expedition: The Roleplaying Card Game, expanding the universe into science fiction with new quests, abilities, enemies, and skills!\nIt requires a copy of Expedition and The Horror to play - if you don\u2019t have Expedition yet, you can pick up a copy of the new Deluxe Edition, which includes Expedition, both expansions, new and improved tracker clips, art-enabled enemy cards, and even more storage.\nThanks to our incredible community, we\u2019ve funded both Expedition (300% funded) and Expedition: The Horror (900% funded) on Kickstarter.\nOur players are constantly creating new quests and coding new features into our free and open-source companion app, so Expedition is always improving. In the past year alone, we\u2019ve added online multiplayer, offline support, an infinite combat music engine and quest saving. Now you can pause and return to epic adventures with your friends, at home or across the world!\nThe Future introduces a new skill check mechanic, along with new enemies, abilities, and loot cards inspired by science fiction.\nSkills allow for more roleplaying depth and add an extra layer to combat strategy. Now, when you level up, you can choose to learn or level up a Skill, which helps you do better at checks both in combat and in the story. You also gain a powerful, single-use ability to help you get out of a tight spot.\nTech abilities add a new combat style. You can use Tech with loot to help your team and get the best of your enemies, unlocking powerful synergies with the existing abilities.\nSynth enemies are mechanized creatures that you will encounter in many future quests. From the lowly Repulsor Probe to the heavily-armored and ever-hungry Cyclonic Digger, the selection of new enemies offer loads of exciting new storytelling directions.\nWhile this expansion is focused around Sci-Fi, its mechanics can be used for stories of all genres! Expedition is a template to help our creators in imagining their next great adventure. These enemies, skills, and abilities can be used in any setting, from low fantasy epics to steampunk comedies to space operas.\nAlongside The Future, we\u2019re also introducing Expedition: Deluxe Edition! This new package includes Expedition, Expedition: The Horror, and Expedition: The Future -- allowing for a complete collection in one convenient box.\nWe also took your feedback to heart. We added art to all our previous enemy cards, upgraded the cardstock quality and designed new custom clips that protect the cards. We also improved the balance on numerous base and Horror cards, and even upgraded the box, which now has space to fit 366 sleeved card! (using standard thin sleeves)\nThe Deluxe Edition a great starting point if you're new to Expedition and a solid upgrade if you're already a fan.\nSpecial Thank You for Returning Backers\nOur backers mean the world to us - you've made Expedition possible, and believed in us since the early days.

This will be our third Kickstarter working with ShipNaked, so we look forward to another smooth delivery - our last project, The Horror, even delivered ahead of schedule!\nWe'll be using the BackerKit Pledge Manager for our post-campaign surveys; look for them about two weeks after the end of the campaign, once funds have closed.\nManufacturing\nThis will be our third Kickstarter working with AdMagic, and we\u2019ve been working with them since July to prepare materials. We\u2019ve also listened closely to your feedback from previous runs and made numerous improvements. Specifically, we\u2019ve designed new custom clips for Expedition that are both more thematic and easier on cards, we\u2019re using a thicker, more durable cardstock, and color matching will be improved by manufacturing all three sets at the same time for the Deluxe Edition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter with Expedition - we'll be using the same manufacturer and fulfillment company as before, but with further improvements to the game (including better card stock and custom clips). Because we're designing custom clips, manufacturing will take longer than it has in the past - but we've worked with our team to account for this in our timelines. We even started working on clips' mold before the Kickstarter launched!\n\nOn a higher level, the international trade climate is constantly changing, and a sudden new tariff may impact our campaign. We're closely monitoring the situation, but if this happens, we will the situation discuss with our backers to decide the best route to proceed.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "The Future expansion", "descp": "Expand your Expedition adventures into Science Fiction!

No one knows the exact nature of those who built the Dome, but the founders of this advanced civilization have come to be called the Forefathers.\nClick to download ultra hi-res\nYou will discover miraculous technologies and weird artifacts in the labyrinths of the Dome, but that is not all the Forefathers left behind. Watch out for automated security systems, traps, and inexplicable anomalies.\nIn addition, the Dome itself is showing signs of consciousness. It has been reacting to the human presence since the first explorers entered its domain. Once inside, no one is able to leave. Uncovering the wonders and dangers of the Dome is a one-way road.\nExploration and exploitation of the Dome is carried out by the CRONUS Foundation, a massive organization founded by the world\u2019s most powerful governments.\nNarrative\nLearn more about the narrative of Encased - in KS-update #14\nWhat the press says\nWhy Kickstarter?\nWe want Encased to be just the way you see the perfect CRPG: a huge game, rich in content, sort of \u201cthe Fallout of our dreams\u201d, which all of us could be proud of. \nWe are developing the game for a while already. We have reached pre-alpha and we are confident that Encased could become a great game. But we are a small team, and there is a lot of things that we\u2019d like to add. With your help, Encased could become a way more ambitious, better fleshed out and polished project!\nBut it\u2019s not just about the money that could help us expand the game! One of our ground rules is to create games arm-in-arm with our community.\nA little bit about where the money will go\nKickstarter and taxes will take away about 10% of the funds. Part of what\u2019s left will be spent on actual implementation and shipping of all the wonderful rewards we\u2019ve come up with. All the rest we will spend on polishing, expanding, and improving the game. That includes a possibly bigger team - one more artist and several designers and scripters - which will spruce up the graphics and increase the number and quality of fights and story interactions. Also, the money will go towards voicework and localization which will make the game more fun and accessible for everyone.\nSocial Goals\nLearn more about social goals in KS-Update #11!\nFacebook likes: Like the Encased Facebook page and encourage your friends to do the same!\nFacebook shares: share the Encased announcement post on Facebook.\nTwitter followers: follow @darkcrystal_hq on Twitter and encourage your friends to too.\nTwitter retweets: retweet the announcement tweet from @darkcrystal_hq\nTwitter likes: Like the announcement tweet from @darkcrystal_hq\nDiscord fans: join our Discord group.\nThe Story\nAs a new recruit, the player must choose one of five Wings:\nBlack Wing - military and security forces;\nWhite Wing - scientists, medics and researchers;\nBlue Wing - engineers and technicians;\nSilver Wing - upper management;\nOrange Wing - ex-convicts who have exchanged their prison jumpsuits for the uniform of a CRONUS laborer.\nThough your selected Wing grants certain starting bonuses and opens interesting options, your choice does not lock you into a \u201cclass\u201d. You are free to develop your character, distribute skill points, and choose abilities as you wish.\nUpon completing character creation, you are summoned to Crystal Sands, a city built directly outside the Dome as a staging point for personnel and equipment.\nThe transition station mounted at the apex of the Dome, above the only aperture, is called the Spire. After basic training, you will descend from the Spire into the Dome to land at Magellan HQ. \nThere is much to uncover during your first mission underground\u2026. Relying on your stats and Wing training, you will find there are several ways to resolve each challenge. Replayability is one of our main goals for the game. After your briefing at HQ comes your first task: exploring a newly discovered Forefathers compound tagged Object O-12-Nashville.\nAfter a few adventures inside the Nashville object (which we don\u2019t want to spoil just yet), your group encounters an entirely new anomaly. You awaken something dreaming deep beneath the desert of the Dome. Your trespass has activated Maelstrom, a telepathic entity created to serve the Forefathers. \nAll connection with the world outside the Dome is lost and Maelstrom rages across the desert, infecting the minds of everyone it encounters. You and your group fall into a technology-induced stasis for five long years. And when you come to, the entire world has changed. \nEncased combat is inspired by classic, tactical turn-based systems, with a grid overlay, action points, cover system, special abilities, various ammo and damage types, many different resistances, and more!\nThe player has direct control over his character only. You will manage the behavior and tactics of their your henchmen but their specific actions will be guided by the game\u2019s combat AI system, introducing funny and interesting situations into your battles.\nThere are dozens of weapons to be found, many of which can be stripped and upgraded. \nThe world of the Dome has from its discovery been a place full of weird creatures and dangerous traps. There\u2019s no telling what lies around the next bend in the road, or inside the twilit cave, or beneath the murky waters of the swamp. But who knows? Perhaps humans are the biggest threat in this bizarre land.\nMaelstrom dominates everything. It's telepathic rage sowing chaos in the minds of everyone, trapped under the Dome. But the player, having \"freed\" the entity, enjoys a special relationship with it. The two of you have regular interactions and Maelstrom may even grant \"whishes\" to the player... but be warned: every call for assistance will eventually incur a price. \nMaelstrom's power grows stronger the closer you move to the heart of the Dome, and that's exactly where you must go to find the answers. There is a special stat influencing interactions with Maelstrom: Psyche. Resistance to Maelstrom's negative effect can be developed in several ways, and develop it you must before you may venture deeper into the Dome. There is also a special skill branch related to Psychic abilities.\nWe will talk about Maelstrom and gameplay related to it in the future updates.\nFollowing the devastating events of Maelstrom\u2019s release, CRONUS splintered into multiple other, often warring, factions. The world has changed while you were in stasis, but has the nature of Man? Trapped inside the Dome like spiders in a jar, these factions will show the worst and best of humankind. Will you join them, or strike out on your own?\nLearn more about factions in our Kickstarter Update #2\nIf the player chooses to commit crimes against the society, he will incur penalties to his reputation and earn titles ranging from 'Petty Thief' to 'Enemy of the State' or even 'Threat to Humanity'. Crime begets punishment. The player may be fined, imprisoned, and even executed. Luckily, there are several ways to deal with your arrest: bribe judges, organize a jailbreak or return alive from the Labyrinth of Death (this last one may be particularly challenging).\nEncased features a day and night cycle with accompanying lighting effects. It would be wise to study NPC routines while adventuring.\nThe Dome is huge and for the most part is an open sandbox (if you are able to resist the psychic presence of Maelstrom). The map consists of more than 170 sectors, each crafted by hand. There are abandoned bunkers, black caves, the complexes of the Forefathers, as well as wastes, swamps and other biomes.\nRandom encounters have been a standby of the old-school role playing game since the dawn of the genre. But Encased will bring them to a new level. Each encounter is a separate post-apocalyptic story, not just a bunch of critters attacking you. Want to participate in a game of Russian Roulette? Find a pathway through a deadly anomaly to find a rare relic? Defend an automated rail transport from raiders? Or end up a victim yourself. All this awaits you, in addition to more classic encounters.\nRead more about Random Encounters in our Update #5\nGuest Stars and Experts!\n  Platforms and dates\nEncased is being developed for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch. Early Access for the Windows version will likely begin in the first quarter of 2019, exclusively on Steam. The final version will launch during 2019 on Steam, GOG and other services. The console edition is planned for the winter of 2020.\nDigital Rewards explained\nCRONUS employee ID badge\n\nAn employee using your name set out on an expedition in the desert\u2026 and vanished. Nothing was found but their badges. The mystery must be solved before it happens again. Will you accept the quest?\n\nMap\n\nA detailed map of the known world under the Dome, showing all the cities and settlements of the Foundation, along with the entries to the \u2018objects\u2019, explored and unexplored. Restricted to higher ranks amongst certain Wings, the map also indicates some locations that the Foundation would prefer to keep secret. A gift for those with the time and inclination to explore 30,000 square kilometers of desert.\n\nLorebook\n\nA digital version of the lorebook, containing all that is known and worth knowing about the Dome and the world within. The story of its discovery, an atlas of its most interesting sites, and an insight into the CRONUS Foundation \u2014 including never-before-told stories of some of its more secret projects \u2014 this is the only book a dedicated digital Domehead will ever need.\n\nSoundtrack\n\nThe hum of a machine of unknown origin, deep beneath the shifting, singing sands. Undeciphered signals from the Tower, snatches of CB radio and a quiet guitar arpeggio in a sleepy roadside bar. In the hands and mind of the Mushroomer \u2014 composer for Pathologic 2 \u2014 the desert becomes music.\n\nA short story about the Dome\n\nCharlene Putney, writer on the renowned Divinity: Original Sin 2, spins a tale of the events that followed the discovery of the Dome.\n\nPortraits\n\nAn extended set of hand-drawn in-game avatars, exclusive to campaign backers.\n\nClosed alpha and beta access\n\nHelp test the alpha or beta versions of the game testing.

In random encounters, the game picks a random name from a database. Your nickname \u2014 on our approval \u2014 will be one of them.\n\nBaseball card\n  Pretty much everyone supports the Crystal Sands Rogues baseball franchise - at least until they lose - and the players\u2019 baseball cards are collected and traded across the Foundation. Recruited from Orange Wing employees with talent and application, under-performing gets you cut from the roster - and getting cut sees you sent into the Dome.\n\nLife Pass\n\nFree lifetime access to all projects released by Dark Crystal Games.\n\nDesign a non-generic NPC\n\nWork with the devs to build a character - come up with their name, appearance, and role in the story.\n\nPlayer portrait\n\nYour face here. We will add a character avatar drawn from your photo to the game, and also give you a digital copy of the image.\n\n\nAn episode of the story-based mini-game, dedicated to you\n\nGames are popular under the Dome too. Some of the miraculously preserved terminals house a popular text game, the hero of which bears your name. Coincidence?\n\nDevelopers stream\n\nWe\u2019ll join you on a livestream of the game, for your audience or ours.\n\nA cool in-game item, exclusive to and chosen by the backers\nA rare gun? Custom armor? An unusual combat stim? You, the backers, will decide. But remember, it won\u2019t break the game\u2019s balance. We\u2019re not that generous.\n\nPhysical Rewards explained\nBlue Wing Engineer t-shirt\nIn vivid antifreeze blue, this fine t-shirt is the favorite of CRONUS technical staff, from the lowliest technician to the chief engineer. While not standard issue, most Blue Wing employees have one. And now so will you.\nRogues baseball cap\nThe Crystal Sands Rogues baseball franchise is largely recruited from Orange Wing employees with talent, aggression, and a desire to avoid entering the Dome. Last year\u2019s was a winning season, and none of the players lost their places. But luck shifts like the sands, and this year may be different. And you, the fans, can be less than forgiving.\n Explorer hoodie\nThe desert is cold at night, so each CRONUS employee who must venture outside is issued with a sweatshirt. Soft and comfortable, it offers excellent protection against the cold, so at least you won\u2019t freeze to death while you die of radiation poisoning.\nCRONUS Badge\nPrinted Lorebook\nThis 70-page glossy volume contains all that is known and worth knowing about the Dome and the world within.

However, despite our experience and best efforts, there\u2019s always a chance that something will go wrong. \n\n1. Early access and release dates. All of the people on our team have already delivered commercially successful games on time and in great condition. However, no true professional will ever tell you, that he is fail-proof. There is always a chance Encased RPG will require to postpone it's set final release date. At least to get an extra coat of polish.\n\n2. We might have delays in delivering our reward promises. The reward delivery channels are extremely reliable, but, there's always a possibility that the reward delivery could be delayed due to technical issues.\n\n3. We are used to dealing with budgets large and small. Financially speaking, Encased RPG budget has been calculated precisely. We are also financing most of the game ourselves, calling community only to finance additional features. However, a drastic change in rates of currency, financial depression, and other unforeseen economic consequences may rob our game of some of the promised content. The odds of that are amazingly low, but it's only fair to mention that as a risk.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "About 1.2 USD", "descp": "CRONUS Combonds!\nCRONUS Foundation thanks you for your support in our fight for the future of humankind!

Looks like we\u2019re going hunting for Dooley and our Stretch Goals!\nStretch goal 2 (underway) - Honey, I Shrunk The Detective\nA poorly-picked gift by Dooley leaves McQueen to traverse the corporate jungle. How did it get so dusty down here?\nStretch Goal 1 (hit!) - The Darkside Detective Anthology\nMcQueen and Dooley aren't the only people in Twin Lakes and they certainly aren't the only ones living interesting lives. The Anthology Case consists of a number of short shorts focused on a day in the life of other characters you've met in Season 1 \u2013 The Bloodwolves, Ghouley and McScream, and Raxa.\nYou might have thought that solving season 1\u2019s nine bizarre cases would have cleared the books on spooky crime in Twin Lakes, but you\u2019d have thought wrong. Those schmucks at Spooky Doorway have crafted a whole new season of paranormal puzzles for you to investigate, starting with finding Officer Dooley!\nThat\u2019s right, at the end of season 1, everyone\u2019s favourite character named Patrick Dooley, got himself lost in the Darkside\u2026 Only you and McQueen can save him. Heck, only you and McQueen will even look.\n\u201cBut guuuUUuuuuyyyss!\u201d we hear you cry, \u201cI didn\u2019t play season 1, I don\u2019t know what any of this means!\u201d - don\u2019t worry, you can play it right blooming now! We\u2019ve even set up a tier for people who want to buy both copies. But, if you\u2019d rather skip over season 1 (for some eldritch reason) then it\u2019s worth mentioning that The Darkside Detective is modelled off classic cartoons like The Simpsons, meaning it\u2019s a series of stand-alone stories. You can dive straight into season 2 right off the bat and start enjoying the award-winning comedy that has won the hearts of many. We\u2019ll even include a \u2018PREVIOUSLY ON\u2019 to bring you up to speed. Netflix ain\u2019t got squat on us.                                                 \nTry the first 2 cases of Season 1 for free!\n                                              \nThe Darkside Detective Season 2 will be available on Mac, PC, Linux and Nintendo Switch.\n     Where cultists crawl, where demons dwell, where the occult\u2026 occults? you\u2019ll find Detective Francis McQueen, of the criminally underfunded Darkside Division. \nWhen evil darkens the doorsteps of Twin Lakes City \u2013 hell, even when it just loiters around shop fronts or hangs out in shady alleyways \u2013 he\u2019s there, ready to investigate the cases that nobody else will. He is The Darkside Detective.     \n  The Darkside Detective is a classic point and click adventure game with a distinct sense of humour. Season 1 came with six cases and had three extra cases added post launch. Season 2 will also contain 6 cases, each containing 45 plus minutes game play.  \nJoin Detective McQueen and Officer Dooley as they investigate these bizarre cases ranging from the occult to the supernatural, anything is possible in this adventure game.\nTwin Lakes is just like any other American city \u2013 mean streets, twenty-four hour diners, trans-dimensional doorways\u2026 wait, no. No, that last thing isn\u2019t right. It is, in fact, far from right. But it is common in Twin Lakes.  \nSomething is wrong in the city, an evil exists here, overlapped but out of sync with the world as we know it. A place that shouldn\u2019t exist, but does. A place that goes unwritten about in their papers, full of things that go unjudged in their courts. A place that Lonely Planet described as \u201cIndescribable.\u201d  \nWhen flesh-hungry tentacles rise from the sewers, when the moon shines extra red, and when one sock goes missing from the dryer, you can bet that somehow the Darkside is involved\u2026  \nSeason 1\u2019s nine cases brought us across the city of Twin Lakes, investigating incidents at the local library, the subway, the museum, police station, the woods, local shops, homes and more. Season 2 takes us to places both familiar and new:\n Including a trip overseas\u2026\n ...to sunny old Ireland\nAnd, of course, we\u2019ll explore more of the Darkside itself...\nThe Darkside Division\nYou might ask how a city operates when the forces of evil are around every corner and in every coffee shop (hogging the nice window seats and bathroom stalls right when you need them). Well, ignorance is bliss and the people of Twin Lakes are pretty blissful. Most don\u2019t even believe anything strange is going-on. But thanks to people like Police Chief Scully and Detective McQueen there are a few precautions against the darkness \u2013 occult items are banned, vampires are on a no-fly list and there is the Darkside Division, the two-man operation responsible for enforcing the more esoteric rules of Twin Lakes and investigates strange goings-on across the city. McQueen and his sidekick Officer Dooley are, for better or worse, the first and last line of defence against things that go bump in the night (things that go bump during the day are the jurisdiction of another department).  \nChief Scully\nEven now McQueen still isn\u2019t sure what Scully witnessed to finally open her mind to his requests to start up the Darkside Division. For months she had been rejecting it over and over and suddenly, one day she called him into the office to approve it. She never explained why, but since then she\u2019s been funding his investigations and covering for him when things go slightly awry\u2026 She\u2019s from a prominent family in the city, and in fact, she\u2019s the new mayor\u2019s twin sister. Strangely, though, McQueen could swear he remembers her telling him she is an only child...     \nRaxa Anand\nRaxa is a student in Twin Lakes University (majoring in the occult and minoring in computer science). To help pay for her tuition fees, she\u2019s become an Inspooktor - a franchise of ghost hunters, most of whom are charlatans on late night cable access. Raxa\u2019s seen things, though, real things. As a result, she\u2019s become an ally to The Darkside Division helping with technical matters on a few cases.    \nThe Brightside Division \nMost things in Twin Lakes have a Darkside counterpart and our heroes are no exception. Chief Ghouley and Special Agent McScream have their fair share of run-ins with McQueen and Dooley, usually over jurisdictional affairs.\nTheir personalities are mirrors to that of McQueen and Dooley, with Ghouley being competent but cold and McScream being unhinged, howling at the moon and speaking in riddles.\nOthers\nTwin Lakes boasts a population of 75,666 residences (nobody is sure if the Darkside has census data). Season 1 introduced us to over 140 of them, but that still leaves a whole lot of new faces for us to meet!\nWe don\u2019t want to give too much away, but there are still all manner of wibblies to investigate in Twin Lakes. Some cases we\u2019ve subtly set up in season 1, while others have freshly baked in our brains!\nWithout discussing the mysteries themselves, season 2 will see the guys taking on a fun fair, a retirement home, an amateur wrestling circuit and their scariest case yet - their high-school reunion!\nThe Darkside Detective is developed by Spooky Doorway, an Irish studio made up of three devs who met on a cursed island off the Irish coast. They formed a pact to work together on something, but had no idea what. One game jam later (and with the help of several wonderful friends) The Darkside Detective was born.\nThose three devs were (and, barring some slight loss of self, continue to be):\nPaul Conway - Art - @DoomCube\n Dave McCabe - writing - @davetheallthing\n Treasa McCabe - Development - @FarrellyTracey\nNeed something to cover up that sentient patch of mould that whispers dark secrets and keeps you awake at night? Then this fancy-pants poster is for you! For added protection we\u2019ll sign the ancient sigils that make up our names on it, too.\nStick it on your laptop, your school books or that angry child who\u2019s always looking funny at you in the mall. However you do it, let the world know you\u2019re a fan of The Darkside Detective. How else will evil know to leave you alone?\nEver look at your t-shirts and think \u201cwhat is this cotton-polyester-blended muck?\u201d Well, you won\u2019t need them once you get this exclusive shirt. You\u2019ll be the talk of the town. Which town and why they are talking about you are questions best left unasked.\nTry decipher the devs\u2019 chicken scrawl and find out what\u2019s written on your card. Is it a joke? The meaning of life? Is it part of a larger riddle that will only get solved when all cards are gathered and aligned correctly? There\u2019s only one way to find out.\nHalf art book, half lore book, half activity book, the Almanac has it all \u2013 unseen case files, new lore about Twin Lakes and the Darkside, puzzles, the Bloodwolf charter, newspaper clippings, rituals, bios on citizens, criminals and beasties and more!\nYour face, in the style of the game's portraits, printed onto a poster with McQueen and Dooley \u2013 be the pixillated criminal your teachers always knew you could be!\n *Characters appearing in the game will have your appearance and name, but final say on their actions and dialogue sits with Spooky Doorway. We'll endevour to ensure you say or do nothing embarasing or offensive, but it will be in tone with other characters in the world.\nMilestone 1 - get the cash!\nMilestone 2 - make the game!\nMilestone 3 - deliver it!\nMilestone 4 - profit!  \n\u201cHold up, chums - why are there no dates on any of these milestones?\u201d  \nOoooh, you caught us! We know from making Season 1 and the additional cases that came afterwards that each case takes the time it takes. As the world gets bigger and cases get longer, we want to make sure that quality doesn\u2019t drop. That\u2019s not our style, daddios. To give us the room to do deliver that quality we foresee an 18 month dev cycle. As most things in The Darkside Detective are bespoke - the gags, locations, puzzles, music, etc - we can\u2019t break it down more than that (sometimes a case goes really smoothly, sometimes it needs a lot of iteration ), so instead of a timeline, have this nice cakechart (we don\u2019t like pie) of where the money is going:\n \u201cYeah guys, why the Kickstarter? You already made the first one, didn\u2019t that make you enough cash? Jeez!\u201d  \nGood question, fictional friend. Yes, the Darkside Detective Season 1 made us some cash, but a lot of that went into porting the game and making new content for it. More is being invested into further ports and localisation of season 1. And, as we made season 1 with no budget, we had some debts to clear. We do however have some money left over, which is going into Darkside season 2. But games aren\u2019t cheap to make and we need a little help to bulk out what we have. That\u2019s why we\u2019re only looking for \u20ac35k. Games costs a lot of money to make and businesses are expensive to run, after all!  \nAlso, this Kickstarter will give us an idea of how much interest there is in a season 2. We\u2019re old people and don\u2019t know how much time we have left. We want to make sure that if we sink it into a season 2, that people will want to play it. Otherwise we\u2019ll just go outside and play with our families and pets.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere\u2019s not that many, actually.

We\u2019ve also shown over the last year that we\u2019ve kept supporting it with longer, better content and continual patches and tweaks. \n\nAll the production aspects of season 2 are known to us.

Play the Demo!\nEnjoy a sneak peek of life on the mean streets of Cradlebridge...\n___\nThree months ago, you died. And in that moment you were reborn as something new. A monster. A predator. Not a creature of the night, but one of its masters.\nUnfortunately, things aren't simple as they used to be. Vampires have finally been exposed, and though your existence is tolerated, your new nature is not. You came to the City hoping for a new start, but found only suspicion and starvation. Now you stare at the ceiling of your cheap hotel room as a penniless outcast, suckling on rats and destined to wither away.\nBut every new era brings new opportunities, and in the political chaos of a world gone mad, even an outcast may rise. An outcast can change everything.\nThis is the story of how you rose.\nLatest Updates\n#10 - Nighthawks Exposed - City of Colours\n#11 - Nighthawks Exposed - Second Death\n#12 - Nighthawks Exposed - Flashbacks\n#13 - One Week Remains - Stretch Goals, The Demo, Cats\nPress?

Check the bottom of the page for assets, including a YouTube version of the trailer to share, or e-mail contact@nighthawks-game.com.\nEmbrace the Night \nYour new life begins... on the wrong side of the tracks in a city that hates you.\nNighthawks is the brand new urban fantasy RPG from Wadjet Eye Games (The Blackwell Legacy, Unavowed, Technobabylon) and writer/designer Richard Cobbett (Sunless Sea/Sunless Skies, The Long Journey Home). The initial concept for the game came when working on Sunless Skies and dreaming of seeing that calibre of interactive fiction merged with the atmosphere of some of his favourite urban-fantasy books and games, in particular 2004's Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines... and then deciding he wanted to play that new game far too much to just leave the idea sitting in the mental \"What If?\" folder.\nWhich brings us to now. Welcome to the mean streets of a city grudgingly trying to show that humans and vampires can live together, despite the cynicism and conspiracies raging on both sides. It's a place of bleak horror and dark humour, filled with monsters who don't all have fangs and a thirst for blood, and featuring new stories down every dark alley. What part will you play, and how will you turn a newly awakened world to your advantage?\nAbout The Game \nRun your own nightclub, as your personal sanctuary and a trap for unwary visitors.\nNighthawks is a mix of story-driven RPG and undead life-simulation, where every decision you make is another move in your chess game against the world. Invest your time into learning new skills or honing your fighting style as you uncover the city's mysteries and venture deep into its darkest secrets. Gather fellow outcasts to your side, binding them with favours and choosing when to cash in. Manage your eternal thirst, legitimately, or balancing the risks of being caught stalking unwary victims and working the black markets.\nAnd of course, what would a vampire be without a few secret powers? Choose from a range of dark Gifts, including Corpse-Talking, Tenebraean Form and Mesmerise. Be careful to hide all evidence of them from the authorites, while keeping them ready as your ace in the hole. Embrace your vampire side, sprinkle a little cinnamon in your blood to handle that pesky iron aftertaste, and get ready to live the nocturnal nine-to-five.\nStructurally, think a freeform RPG core, with stories branching off it - some funny, some tragic, some horrific - where your decisions are always bleeding together. Get caught lying too often and your untrustworthy reputation will follow you around, while raising suspicion will draw the attention of first mortal, and then darker authorities. Do you, for instance, break a window and hurriedly search a crime scene while the alarms wail, pick the lock and explore at your leisure, or use vampire powers to impersonate the security guard and walk right in? The choice is yours, and all part of learning the beat of the city, developing new skills, and building up favours and contacts to help seize the day by the throat.\nChoose Your Friends Carefully... \nKnowledge is power. Your bartender Rebecca hears everything that's going on in town.\nNever travel alone. Befriend and recruit a wide circle of fellow outcasts, such as Madame Lux, vampire stage magician capable of fooling any eye with delusions of light. Con-artist turned cult-leader Maze. Vampire enforcer Saiorse, as comfortable discussing great works of opera as she is getting her claws into the most dangerous dockland fighting pits. Former Queen of the Black Sea Inez, a ruthless pirate out of her time. Disgraced scientist Morgan Shah, funding her attempts to cure vampirism by selling crystal meth. Maybe even Samuel, a former doctor cursed with good intentions and a withered brain that considers no fate worse than death for patients who end up in his care. No matter how much they beg.\nCompanions here don't just fight for you. Take part in their lives as they work on their own problems, have them look into rumours with their own contacts and social circles and dive into their deepest secrets with interactive flashbacks set in locations like 17th century Nassau, Las Vegas, and the corrupt European courts of the Eternal Dynasties. Help them handle their demons, and they'll help you deal with yours. But good deeds rarely go unpunished, and everyone has their own agenda that consumes their endless nights.\nEnter The Story  \nWith every choice comes consequence. How will you live your second life?\nWhy are we focusing on text? The possibilities! Games like Sunless Sea and 80 Days and Cultist Simulator have repeatedly demonstrated this over the last few years, and we intend Nighthawks to be seen in that company - a deep, wide, replayable RPG in which a favour can be the ultimate weapon and the friendliest smiles often have the sharpest teeth.\nText-driven gameplay lets us really focus on details and mechanics, including bringing you a living city with little seen features like NPC scheduling (you might, for instance, know a guy who'll slip you blood from the hospital blood bank, but he only works Tuesdays to Fridays and it's Saturday), varied stories, incredibly reactive characters, and most importantly, player freedom. You're planning to head out on a quest you were expecting to pay for your hotel room this week, but the friend you wanted to bring along isn't available. Do you wait? Take someone else? Risk going alone? Hope for another opportunity?\nWe're drawing inspiration from a wide range of RPG classics, from Baldur's Gate 2 to Yakuza to Bloodlines to Fallout to Quest For Glory, and in particular, their sense of freedom and focus on letting you live in their worlds. In Nighthawks, you're in charge of your destiny, whether it's running your nightclub sanctuary, playing politics, or plunging into stories that range from light-hearted adventure and modern political intrigue to blisteringly bleak horror.\nMeet The Team \nJust a few of the games our team has worked on...\nAll that said, it's also going to look and sound great! Along with Richard Cobbett on words and design, we have Ben Chandler (Unavowed, Shardlight) and Ivan Ulyanov (The Charnel House Trilogy) on art, painting a 'living book' style that combines backgrounds and animated ambient effects in glorious 4K resolution.\nLast, but definitely not least, we have adventure game legend Dave Gilbert (The Shivah, The Blackwell Legacy, Unavowed) acting as executive producer and overseer of the whole project, cracking whips and ensuring things stay on track. Budget allowing, we also hope to bring in additional writers to help produce extra-varied stories and characters, as well as other experts to help polish everything up to a fine shine. On top of all that, we're bringing a full voice cast to breathe life into the characters, and of course, plenty of original music.\nThe Biz Side \nWe're looking at a development cycle of around 18 months, not including time already invested to get to this stage. We're not doing physical rewards like pins and posters, so as to be able to spend every dollar on creating the best RPG we can make. Instead, we're focusing on rewards that let backers at every level become immortalised within the game itself. Be the vampire you deserve to be... or the unwary blood-bag, or undead hunter, or crooked cop, or depraved sewer abomination. Are you ready to be killed by yourself?\nTarget Platforms and Beta Access \nA living city full of stories. Write yours.\nOur key platforms at the moment are PC and Mac. We also hope to bring Nighthawks to iOS at release, and will be looking at other platforms closer to the release date.\nAs for beta testing, we don't believe in offering it as a reward tier - you're helping us! - but there will be opportunities to sign up and take part in that during development.\nCommunity\nJoin the Discord!

We're a small team, aiming to bring you more design innovation with text, careful art and a tight budget than many AAA RPGs and developers with all their fancy polygons and resources.\n\nBut that's the fun part! And we can do it. We're all interactive fiction veterans with multiple titles to our name, using well-established tools like Ink and Unity to bring you a game we think will be both special, and the deep urban fantasy experience gamers have been dying for. The main risk is that development time is always hard to predict, save that everything always takes a bit longer than expected, and stretch goals especially always mean extra work to get things right. But we will. Everyone on the development team has also promised to look both ways before crossing any major road, just to be on the safe side.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Nighthawks Supporter", "descp": "Stay up to date with all the latest updates, including beta testing information/opportunities.\nINCLUDES:\nOur Gratitude\nBacker Name In Credits", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2020"}], "stat": ["68 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 20 or more", "title": "Guest", "descp": "Nighthawks for PC/Mac.

However, the pieces are in place, and I think they're working pretty well. In case you've missed the info in the past, it's card based - more like Slay The Spire than Hearthstone, and without any deck building. Your deck is instead made for you based on your player state, companion, weapons (one melee, one ranged) and stats, and any injuries or similar you might already have sustained.

Sammons for Chaosium Inc's 7th edition Call of Cthulhu roleplaying game. It has a dark tone, like most Stygian Fox titles, more akin to True Detective and American Horror Story and is written for Mature Gamers Only. The scenarios look into the dark heart of humanity and the mythos... but this book has a twist.\nOne of the problems long term Keepers can face when running Call of Cthulhu is their players becoming too jaded or blas\u00e9 regarding the Cthulhu mythos. \n\"Oh, Deep Ones? Yeah, we've killed these before. Open fire.\"\nRather than; \"Oh my God! They're real! Run!\"\nIt's difficult to maintain that suspension of belief when you have been facing the same creatures year after year. This is where Occam's Razor comes in, being a collection of scenarios where initially they seem to be linked to the mythos but they have mundane causes and outcomes.\nI have run these type of scenarios for twenty years and every time they sucker players in and help them see how paranoid their characters have become and, more importantly, when it comes time to face the actual mythos again, many players believe the adventure will have a mundane cause. When interspersed with mythos adventures this leads to some serious panic when the players realise that this is real. Used sparingly, these adventures lull players into a false sense of security and make the next real mythos encounter all the more vivid.\n\nOne of my players had his character just stand and watch as a colleague was eaten by a dark shadow in a toy store because the player refused to believe it was a mythos entity. This was a ten year veteran of the game.\n\nOf course, a separate sidebar is provided for each adventure if you wish to have actual mythos elements in your game. \nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\n Brian M. Sammons has created 6 scenarios which tease at mythos causes but will ultimately lead to a mundane resolution. A murder is just a murder, a cult site is just kids with spray paints, etc. Here is a summary of the scenarios contained within the book.\n\nDeep and Dark \u2013 the investigators find a snuff film on the dark web, but one of a pretty girl getting mauled by a Fishman monster. Did the deep ones mess up and accidentally get filmed in this modern world where everyone has a camera phone or is it something else?  \nEye of the Beholder \u2013 an art student goes missing while doing late night research in a museum with ties to the local university. Maybe it\u2019s a coincidence that the museum just got in a huge statue from South America of a little-known death god called Thul\u2019Cathul. Yep, total coincidence.  \nThe Watchers \u2013 a woman living alone in an apartment in the big city notices that people are watching her. Following her. They even broke into her home. But why? What do they want and how far will they go?  \nA Whole Pack of Trouble \u2013 a group of film school students go to an isolated, abandoned, and reportedly haunted asylum to make a found-footage horror movie and make a fortune? Whatever could go wrong with that? Well, when the filmmakers go missing the investigators will have to find out.  \nA Cleansing Flame \u2013 People are dying by fire. No one knows why and no one knows how. When the latest victim is a friend to one of the investigators and an astronomer who reportedly made a recent discovery of note, it\u2019s up to the investigators to put out these flames.  \nVisions From Beyond - Tommy is a friend who makes some new friends. That\u2019s nice. Unfortunately those friends have a strange reputation, they get up to some bizarre practices, and then one night Tommy calls one of the investigators in terror, begging for help, then the line goes dead. What\u2019s a friend and an investigator of the Mythos to do?\nThe book will be in PDF, ePub, Softcover, and hardcover formats and will be full colour.\nBrian M. Sammons - Writer\n\nBrian is a fiction editor for Dark Regions Press and the Chief Editor for Golden Goblin Press, a film and literature critic for over twenty years and has penned stories that have appeared in such anthologies as Arkham Tales, Horrors Beyond, and many more. He has edited the books; Cthulhu Unbound 3, Undead & Unbound, Eldritch Chrome, and Dread Shadows in Paradise, among others. His game work is mostly for the Call of Cthulhu game and includes scenarios for Secrets, The San Francisco Guidebook, Doors to Darkness, The Things We Leave Behind, and more.

You could add an order for the add-on in there.\nPlease note that we will add shipping fee for the add-ons (including all pledge with the add-on items). We will use pledge manager and send the survey 1 - 3 weeks after the campaign ended\nFor Megacorp Premium Item Collection, you will get megacorp music discography (4 songs) even though you didnt see it in the pledge level.\nWhat if everyone you know, loved, and remembered are just complex simulations in a computer-generated universe? What if you began to see through the shroud that separates what you think is your life from what is real? What if you wake up from this simulation, only to wonder if you are in another?\nSimulation Theory is a Boardgame for 1 to 6 players which combines elements of an escape room and a dungeon delve. The game has 3 major modes for different audiences from casual (17 minutes playtime) to hardcore (2+ hours). Simulation Theory is played with a combination of standees, cards, boards, and Dice. The dice are mainly used for tiebreakers.\nSimulation Theory was created by Mark G. Koh (Megacorp), Shawn Siow, and an international team. For the full credits, see team credits below. We put together this Kickstarter campaign because we cannot build this without you.\n\nThe base game will include 3 realities, each with 5 unique characters. The 6th character per reality will be available as a stretch goal. Each of these characters has their own strengths and weakness plus a unique backstory which has a real impact in the Ultimate mode (rules and game components will update soon)\nSeveral ways to play\nCasual mode: Easy to learn and teach, only 15 - 30 mins to play\nChallenge mode: Additional depth for experienced players, try out a special Scenario\nCompetitive mode: Much more deterministic mode of the game, with fixed treasures and it relies much more on the skill of the players than a lucky topdeck or discovery\nUltimate Mode (Stretch goal): A different way to play with branching quests for each character and deterministic gameplay. Directly integrates the story and history of the different Realities together with the gameplay\nCongratulations! You guys made it to unlocked \"Ultimate mode - Stretch goal\". In Ultimate Mode, players need to complete various quests, unique to each Character, to gain treasure and Ascend to the next Reality. Each turn, players also discover part of the story of Simulation Theory and can choose to take different actions towards one of four unique outcomes per Character.  \nThis mode will take a much longer amount of time to play than the casual or challenge mode \u2013 we estimate around 2 hours for a full game with players that are familiar with the other modes of Simulation Theory\nStretch Goal Unlocked : Ultimate Mode\nThis mode rules assume players are already familiar with the Challenge Mode and Comepetitive Mode rules an the basics of Simulation Theory are assumed here.\nSETUP \nChoose one reality. Take it's challenge deck. Find and remove the boos card, shuffle the challenge deck. Place the boss card at the center (3,3) position on the 5x5 board and fill out all the other spaces with the challenge cards face-up on the board from top to bottom, starting left to right. \nShuffle both of coordinate decks (column and row) \nTake the top card of each coordinate deck - showing a pair of coordinates - row and column. \nRandomize the purple generic tokens face down. Take a purple generic token and place it face down (without looking at it) on that position, on top of the card occupying the card at those coordinates. Do this eight times. \nEach player chooses a character from the present reality. \nSetup each player with their story tracker card on the left hand side of their character card. place the life token on \"2\" position and the book token on the \"1\" story node position for each character\n\nFIRST TURN POSITIONS \nDuring the first turn of ultimate mode, players each take their standee and choose a challenge card which is not surrounded by 4 cards orthogonically (e.g.: has a card above, below, left and right of it) - this is that player's STARTING POSITION. Each player's standee must be at least 2 spaces (horizontally or vertically) away from the next player. Two standees can be diagonally next to each other. All players must agree on their positions before the game commences. Players cannot choose a starting position with a token or standee on it.\nTURN SEQUENCE  \nThere are three parts in each turn, a planning phase, an action phase and a quest phase.\nPLANNING PHASE\nDuring the planning phase, all players act simultaneously. Each player chooses which action to perform in this phase:  \n-MOVE  \nMove the character standee into an adjacent space by specifying coordinates with the dice. The space chosen must be horizontally or vertically next to the standee. A move cannot be made into a diagonal space. Do this by placing the two dice on one of the characters traits on the board (the first to represent a row number and the second to represent a column number.) The character must have an equal or higher trait value to the challenge card in order to move onto it, otherwise they will lose one health. Can move onto challenge cards with a token or another standee (e.g.: another player) on it, if they do  \n-REST [recover life]  \nIf a player has 0 life, this is the only action they may perform The player gains 1 life and may not perform any other actions this turn. To perform a heal action. The player places his dice onto a trait of his choice but with the numbers 6/1\nACTION PHASE  \nThe action phase happens after all players are ready and reveal their dice placements. Each player who chose to move, moves their standees now. Then each player that chose the heal action, increases their health by one position. If their standee was lying down (0 health), they now place them upright.\n-INTERACT/ATTACK\nA character that lands on a challenge card with another player/character on it triggers an attack. If a character standee moves into a space with a token on it, this triggers an interaction. Interacting with a PURPLE generic token triggers a story event for that player in the QUEST PHASE -UNLOCK CHARACTER QUEST -\n-UNLOCK CHARACTER QUEST\nCharacter Quests can be unlocked when a player moves onto a card which is any one part of a 1-3 card pattern matching a quest unlock pattern that that player has. The player must declare it when it happens when they resolve during the QUEST PHASE\nQUEST PHASE During the quest phase players resolve the story items that are triggered due to the course of their actions. \nFor PURPLE TOKENS - these tokens are turned number side up. The player then refers to the ultimate mode manual pdf and will look to \"Encounter Events\" section of that reality and do the actions on encounter events.\nFor CHARACTER QUESTS: these are the quests that are unlocked and are often narratives from a character's memories/past.\nINJURY AND DEATH IN ULTIMATE MODE  \nTaking damage: Characters are dealt damage as a consequence of story events or combat. Whenever a character is dealt damage, move their health that number of positions equal the damage to the left of their life track\nASCENSION IN ULTIMATE MODE  \nAscending from the present reality in ultimate mode is the objective of each session. A player that successfully completes any combination of 7 character quests and events will asend. Failing this, the player that enters the 3/3 position after the final boss of the reality is defeated OR if the final event runs out of time (in ACT 4) will ascend.  \nTHE END OF THE GAME  \nEach session of ultimate mode is set in one reality. The players play until one player Ascends and then the session is finished and scores are taken.\nSCORING IN ULTIMATE MODE  At the end end of each session, each player counts the the following as their score\n1. ascension tokens - the player that ascends receives the gold ascension token and has 20 VP  \n2. treasure - the face value of each treasure card collected counts as VP\n3. Quests - each quest card has a VP value\n4. EVENTS -each major events card has a VP value\n5. HEALTH - every point of health a player has at the end of the session converts to 1VP\n6. Trait tokens - take the total number of positive trait tokens minus the number of negative trait tokens a character has, this converts to VP \nRETAINING SCORE\nEach player should record down their scores for an ultimate mode session. The scores should be cumulative into the next session. Until all available realities are completed, the final winner is the player with the highest total score of all sessions\nBasic Gameplay: Casual Mode\nThis describes fundamental core mechanics only: the game has much more to offer in two other modes\nSimultaneous Turns\n\nPlanning Phase: Secretly select which card to hit, and which trait to use\nEveryone simultaneously reveals their plan\n Action Phase: Compare your stats to the card\nMiss - Leave the card face up for later\nWin - Gain a treasure!\nLose - Skip the next turn, or discard a treasure\n\nPlan well and you could encounter rival players in the same location to help or hinder.\nAscend through the three Realities\nDefeat the boss or find the Exit and wake up in a new Reality. Gain a new Character to face new challenges, or return to your previous Reality with Godlike power.\nAscending\nGain a new character\nFill board with new reality challenge cards\nGames End\nThe game ends after someone ascends from the third Reality\nAdvanced gameplay : Competitive mode\nDownload and try the free print and play here.\nTry Simulation Theory on Tabletop simulator here.\nNote: The game pieces in both the print and play and the tabletop simulator only have rudimentary art instead of the illustrations used for the final production version.\nExplore three different realities. Which one is real? Who knows\nThe Stone  \nLegend has it that millennia ago, a star fell from the heavens crashed into the world of Gaeus. It is said that this stone is imbued with such vast power that anyone that touches the stone would perish. Other stories claim that instead of dying from its touch, someone worthy would be able to wield its Godlike power. The stone was thought to be lost but has been rediscovered when a mighty quake cracked the earth asunder, revealing the ancient temple that was built around it. As it is, the primacy of the 8 God Kings is threatened by a warlord immune to their magic, who is also amassing a tremendous horde. Heroes have experienced fevered dreams, brought about by the stone calling to them.\nYou are one such stoneseeker. You awake disoriented, having lived some other life in a place where magic does not exist and the God-kings do not rule.\nThe land of Teres, where the stone fell, is now a hotbed of political intrigue, with adventurers and royals alike gambling their lives on reaching the stone first. And through it all, a horrid otherworldly blight twists all life it touches as it spreads unchecked. Will the stone grant you the power to fulfill your wishes?\nThe Prison  \nYou awake, wearing a prison jumpsuit and strapped to a Virtual Reality machine. You are deep in the bowels of a black site that officially does not exist; Level 44.\nThe prison is the infamous Simbulan Penitentiary, located in the city of San Miguel. The prison is privately owned and staffed by sadistic ex-criminal guards and robotic EXA units.\nBut you are not in any normal cell. The machine you were connected to moments ago should induce Virtual Enhanced Interrogation. The technology is so advanced that the life you just experienced feels more real than the shithole you are now trapped in. None of this is even remotely legal, even by the corrupt standards of San Miguel.\nSuddenly the locks on your cell open as a prison riot rages throughout the facility. The supermax inmates have spilled over into the black site, taking over section by section in a murderous rage. Is it too late to escape? Is it too late for answers?\nThe Ark  \nAfter the near-apocalyptic singularity event on Earth, the newly risen AI's left behind a seemingly benevolent member of their kind, GENECIA. Her intervention veered humanity away from the brink of extinction, by providing them the gift of viable long-distance space travel. A part of that gift is the designs of the Genisis Ark. Like millions of others, you are on one such Ark. Yours is headed toward P4-11, a habitable planet.\nYou awake in a cryo-pod as one of the privileged few who went on this journey to a new home with their entire body intact. Less important colonists only had their brains transported, awaiting their bodies to be reconstructed when the new world is settled.\nThe Ark has virtual reality programs to keep the minds of those in stasis active. Your VR sim was strange, almost entirely too real. That, and you were woken too soon. Alarms are blaring, the life support system seems to have been damaged. The ship's AI is mysteriously absent. Where is the captain? Can you save the mission? Can you save yourself?\n\nDesigner note: We didn't just 'tack on some lore' for our game - we take storytelling very seriously. The story behind each reality in Simulation Theory is part of the MEGACORP UNIVERSE\nTremendous value for just USD 35+ \nUnder-explored theme (simulation hypothesis)\nMultiple game modes and high replay value. \nFriendly shipping worldwide through our existing Distribution partners*\nA lot of art - each game piece has unique artwork (not shown in demo playthrough videos) \nDeep, compelling lore\nHigh-quality components as with our previous games (watch this)\nIt helps the young ecosystem of tabletop games in Southeast Asia\n*Distributors:\nAsia: Ludus Distributors (Philippines), Animart (Indonesia), VX Global (Singapore), Phantasia games (Taiwan)\nEurope: Intrafin (EU, Switzerland & UK)\nFor first time players and for casual groups with non-gamers, Simulation Theory's casual mode is easy to learn and can be a hit at parties (Yes, we even did demos in public AT parties). Learn the basics here. \n\nThis is a simple 1v1 playthrough in casual mode in a hotel room\nRemember that all our playthrough videos use rudimentary placeholder art. Please do not judge the components by what you see here. The standees and the main board components are not shown.\nThe purpose of these videos is to demonstrate the core mechanics and craftsmanship of STG's game design. The two other game modes (challenge/adventure) build on the knowledge from playing casual mode at least once.\n Challenge mode utilizes the basic rule framework of the game to deliver almost infinite replayability with Challenge scenarios (you can try the ones below with the print and play!). Believe us, it is almost like designing an entirely new game each time.\n\"Arkfall\" - 4 Players - Stone Reality Scenario\n                                                                                                        \"Decontamination Protocol\" - 3 players - Prison Reality Scenario\nCompetitive mode is a much more deterministic mode of the game, with fixed treasures and it relies much more on the skill of the players than a lucky topdeck or discovery. The challenge cards are dealt face up in a 5x5 grid, with the boss card at its center. Ascensions move the boss.\nPlaythrough video of Competitive mode in Singapore\nWhat Others Says About Simulation Theory Game\nIGN Post-launch (SEA)\nIGN Pre-launch (SEA)\nGames Hub (Malaysia)\nTantrum House - on 37:50 mark in the podcast (USA)\nGame It (Spain)\nDAGeeks (Philippines)\nBoard Game Geek (USA)\nMany thanks to Lytt Labs for manufacturing the official STG watch!

The campaign will alter the contents of the box (and the box itself) via the stretch goals.\n\nOur team has previously delivered the Megacorp TCG complete with display packaging, circle seal and booster/starter wrappers using world-class factories who also print several of the top TCGs in the world. A TCG is far more involving in terms of production and logistics than a traditional board game and we are confident that you will be escaping your reality sooner than you expect. Our previous campaign was shipped almost immediately after the end of the campaign.\n\nPlaymats \n\nOur playmats are industry standard high quality rubberized fit for TCG play. If you have bought or won a Megacorp TCG (tm) playmat from us before you would know how good they are. These will be shipped separately, possibility even ahead of the game itself as we have the infrastructure for efficiently producing them in place.\n\nApparel \n\nWe are working directly with a fair trade apparel partner in Indonesia for clothing rewards which is an advantage for our region as there are no middlemen or communication barriers.\n\nLogistics \n\nWe have current, active distribution for our existing games for all major markets such as Europe, America, Australia (Oceania) and our home region of southeast Asia. Our plan to deliver simulation theory will be through these channels to reduce the risk of delivery issues by having it handled professionally through people we know and trust.

As some of you know, his mother has been afflicted with cancer and from what I hear from Mark K it is an experience I would not wish on my worst enemy. That is why I agreed to get on board and help with the writing. I am going to speak candidly here and say that once I got here things were a little helter-skelter, to say the least; and Mark K\u2019s requests were on the ambitious side. That said, it was a great opportunity to present a little something of myself to share with all of you and I hope you all will feel it fun to experience. Some details. The stone reality and ark reality has been written and is currently being conformed into the Ultimate Mode (Scenario) format. Stone abilities are done, with the prison and ark realities being playtested and worked on. Everything\u2019s permitted and nothing is forbidden... In the Ultimate Mode, I have taken the creative license to divert from the Megacorp canon of the realities. Stone, prison and ark. My reason for doing so is to provide a more streamlined experience where the focus is on the Ultimate Mode\u2019s story and gameplay. For example, in the Stone Reality, we follow in the steps of one of the \u2018Paladin\u2019. Players may take turns playing this character or each player may have their own characters throughout the reality. In Ultimate Mode you will use treasures to purchase abilities and customise your characters as you best befitting your play style. Now, imagine the ultimate mode as a play. There will be an Active, Inactive and Required character. Active characters are named characters in the current quest, while inactive characters are characters who have the abilities of the class (prince, wizard, etc) but are not actively participating as a named character.

Each group has its own story arc, progressing through three stages as it encounters Delta Green agents and the evils they fight. Some groups corrode, wither, and die. Others gain hideous strength and uncover profound new horrors. Each has connections to other groups, ensuring that players find fresh hells at every turn. But all are destined to change \u2014 and the journey each one takes holds up a mirror to the agents themselves.\nBecause things fall apart. The center cannot hold. And once you enter the Labyrinth, you will never escape.\nDiscussion\nHear the authors of Delta Green discuss The Labyrinth\nGeek & Sundry profiles John Scott Tynes and The Labyrinth\nBrie Sheldon asks five or so questions of John Scott Tynes\nJohn Scott Tynes discusses The Labyrinth with Ross Payton of Role Playing Public Radio\nDelta Green: The Labyrinth will be a sourcebook for Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game, about 192 pages long, hardback, in full color. Written by John Scott Tynes, illustrated by Dennis Detwiller, designed by Simeon Cogswell, edited by Shane Ivey, and published by Arc Dream Publishing, The Labyrinth will join the ever-growing line of beautiful and terrifying sourcebooks for Delta Green.\nThe Labyrinth will contain brand-new factions for players to encounter. Some will be sources of friendlies, allies, and aid. When their exposure deepens due to contact with Delta Green agents, however, those people\u2019s lives and realities will corrode. A group that begins as an ally may end as a foe. Others will be enemy cults and monstrous exploiters of reality. Even those that start small may metastasize under investigation, gaining power and influence.\nWhile this is a faction book, the combinations of story arcs for each faction, and the connections between factions, mean that it can also serve as a de facto campaign. For groups with more self-directed players who like to chase down their own clues, The Labyrinth will be a narrative sandbox they can explore in multiple directions at once.\nThroughout, the point remains the same: the mosaic of American life is schisming before us and when exposed to the unnatural, and to the best intentions of Delta Green, it weakens and shatters. The Labyrinth portrays America\u2019s march towards the End Times in microcosm.\nCORE GOAL\u2014$27,000 (UNLOCKED): The Labyrinth in PDF and full-color hardback.\n$35,000 (UNLOCKED): A kit of handouts and props for The Labyrinth in PDF: props and clues related to the organizations of The Labyrinth: web pages, photos, police reports, maps, brochures, and other elements that diligent players can turn into their own walls of clues.

Born of the U.S. government\u2019s 1928 raid on the degenerate coastal town of Innsmouth, Massachusetts, the covert agency known as Delta Green opposes the forces of darkness with honor, but without glory. Delta Green agents slip through the system, manipulating the federal bureaucracy while pushing the darkness back for another day \u2014 but often at a shattering personal cost.\"\nIn Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game, the cosmic horror of the Cthulhu Mythos meets modern-day technothriller conspiracy. Delta Green postulates a secret group of men and women dedicated to investigating and neutralizing inhuman and supernatural horrors, misappropriating the resources of the U.S. government to wage a war that they must at all costs keep hidden. Delta Green has explored this world of secret horrors in dozens of game books, novels, and anthologies for over 25 years, winning awards and acclaim all along the way. Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game and the sourcebook A Night at the Opera were nominated for seven ENnie Awards in July 2018.\nLearn more about Delta Green in the free quickstart rulebook, Delta Green: Need to Know.\nJohn Scott Tynes founded Pagan Publishing and the magazine The Unspeakable Oath in 1990. He first wrote about Delta Green in \"Convergence,\" a groundbreaking scenario that appeared in The Unspeakable Oath issue 7 in 1992. The idea of Delta Green immediately seized the imaginations of gamers around the world. Tynes expanded it with co-creators Dennis Detwiller and Adam Scott Glancy in the sourcebooks Delta Green (1997) and Delta Green: Countdown (1999), both of which won Origins Awards. Tynes' novel Delta Green: The Rules of Engagement also won an Origins Award in 1999.\nTynes continued to advise the Delta Green creative team over the years as Pagan Publishing and Arc Dream Publishing created Delta Green: Eyes Only (2007), Delta Green: Targets of Opportunity (2010), and Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game (2016 to present). Tynes also wrote Arc Dream Publishing's Origins Award-nominated RPG Puppetland, and co-created Atlas Games' RPG Unknown Armies.\nIn an encrypted message left in an unlisted voicemail drop, John told us: \u201cAfter completing the new edition of Puppetland for Arc Dream last year and contributing to the new edition of Unknown Armies for Atlas Games, I found myself haunted by strange dreams of an America plagued by discord, ruled by monsters, and slouching towards one of several moral or literal apocalypses. Fortunately, none of that is happening in the real world, so this seemed like the perfect time to explore these completely fictional ideas in the world of Delta Green.\u201d\nWe're very excited to have John back in the world he was so fundamental in shaping.\nIn late 2015, Arc Dream Publishing ran a successful Kickstarter campaign to launch Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game. For the first time, Delta Green is its own game system, fully customized for the uniquely suspenseful and fearful experience that Delta Green scenarios offer. That campaign funded a long line of sourcebooks and adventures, many of which have now been published. We have produced over a thousand pages of new material for Delta Green since that Kickstarter project ended.\nThe final shape of Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game inspired John Scott Tynes to write The Labyrinth, his first new game material for Delta Green in many years. At the same time, illustrator Dennis Detwiller's most substantial work from that Kickstarter, writing the King in Yellow campaign Impossible Landscapes, will be done by the time John has finished The Labyrinth. The timing lines up perfectly. Other books\u2014Deep State, PISCES, Falling Towers\u2014and scenarios are in development by other writing teams. \nFunding for Delta Green: The Labyrinth will pay for its writing, editing, illustration, and design, and for printing it as a full-color, hardback book with the same high quality as the Agent's Handbook, the Handler's Guide, and other books in the Delta Green RPG line.\nWe love working on Delta Green. We want every new book or scenario to be even better than the ones that came before. This campaign gives us a chance to do just that.\nWant to get other Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game books or downloads as part of your rewards?

We take pride in the incredible amount of work we put into every project. Delta Green game books have occupied the top two spots in RPG.net's index of game reviews for many years. They have won Origins Awards and ENnie Awards. They have earned passionate praise from gamers around the world.\n\nThe estimated delivery dates are our current best estimates. When it comes to Delta Green, delivery dates are always in flux, but we ALWAYS deliver what we promise and then some. The Kickstarter for Delta Green: The Role-Playing Game proposed a 300-odd page hardback rulebook -- and delivered a mammoth slipcase set with a 192-page Agent's Handbook and a 382-page Handler's Guide. Backers should expect delivery of The Labyrinth to occur when the book is ready -- and they should expect it to be more than worth the wait.\n\nMost backers outside the U.S. are accustomed to high shipping costs for hardback books, and this one will be no exception. Our warehouses in the U.S. and the U.K. have to charge backers what it costs to actually deliver their books. Backers outside those countries should expect to be charged for relatively high delivery costs when the books are ready to ship.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Witness", "descp": "From the fringes, you hear the horrors that Delta Green agents confront and see the blood and wreckage that they leave behind.

Vast empires have come and gone like waves against an unimaginable shore.\nBut some strange voyagers chose to remain outside the churn of civilizations, pursuing a greater purpose. When a new force comes to the galaxy, will these eternal wanderers remain who they are\u2014or, at long last, change?\n Archives of the Sky is a tabletop storytelling game with an epic sci-fi backdrop and a focus on very human stories. This is a roleplaying game, but no gamemaster or advanced preparation is required. You and some friends will collaboratively create a great House, a group of interstellar wanderers with a set of inviolable core beliefs\u2014and then, like any good storytellers, find a conflict that pits those beliefs against each other.\nThe core rules of the game are finished and available for you to preview now, but they need some help to really shine. With your support, I'll extend them in a full-color sourcebook chock full of examples, play aids, breathtaking art, and ideas you can mine to help your stories come alive.\nArchives on the Delvecast podcast!\nA review by Cannibal Halfing Gaming\nMore coverage...\nYou might have played GM-less roleplaying games like Microscope, Fiasco, or Downfall before; but even if you haven't, Archives is a great place to start. This thrilling style of roleplaying involves every player in the creation of the story from scene to scene. Rather than one player preparing a setting and a story in advance, everyone gets to help create the world and plot, which gives rise to unpredictable stories brimming with ideas sparked by constant collaboration with your friends at the table.\nThis might sound intimidating, but Archives has been fine-tuned through over a year of playtesting to help even novice storytellers build an incredible world together, and then tell a meaningful story within it. The mechanics are carefully designed to help unleash your inner Ursula Le Guin, Alastair Reynolds, or Gene Roddenberry:\nYou'll create a deck of words from your favorite sci-fi novels, and draw from it when you need inspiration or a random outcome.\nTake turns playing roles like \"the Epic\" and \"the Intimate,\" focused on making the story breathtaking and huge in scope,or keeping it grounded in human details and sensations.\nThreaten the values of your characters and your House with new plot developments, and build towards a dilemma that puts them in conflict.\nIn three to four hours, you'll invent, tell, and resolve a complete story with a galactic scope and a very human conflict at its center... with the option to keep telling more stories with the same characters the next time you play, or create a whole new galaxy and start again.\nTo get a sense for how this works in practice, check out this brief sample of play, which shows players spontaneously creating a scene together.\nHow does Archives work? At its core, the system provides a structure for storytelling based around a Dilemma, a conflict between two Values.\nAs in much great sci-fi, the epic scope provides a canvas for big questions: what does it mean to be human, and what are our ideals really worth to us?\nValues\nWhen you start play, you'll collaboratively create a House of galactic wanderers devoted to some all-encompassing mission: to seed new life, to protect the helpless, to hunt transdimensional titans, to record the past\u2014whatever you can think of. You'll create a set of core Values for your House, like We always help a friend in need. Each player will then make a character within that House who has their own personal Values, like Chen hates sentient machines.\nThe rules of the game help you improvise a story that moves toward a Dilemma putting two Values into conflict. For instance, what would Chen do if a persecuted robot came to her House seeking asylum? How would she reconcile her loyalty to her House with her own unshakeable vendetta?\nTwo House Values. Can you think of a story where these two would come into conflict?\nOnce you've found your Dilemma, the characters try to come to consensus on a course of action. Ultimately, someone will have to make a decision that betrays a Value, and herein lies the core of the game, and of many gripping stories:\nWill Kirk change history to save Edith Keeler?\nWill President Roslin rig an election on Galactica to prevent a traitor from rising to power?\nWhen push comes to shove, does might make right, and do the ends justify the means?\nWhat will your characters do to defend what they believe in?\nThe Trove\nWithout dice or hidden information, Archives needs a source of uncertainty and randomness, and that's provided by the Trove, a deck of player-created cards with interesting and evocative words drawn from your favorite books. You can draw from the Trove if you need inspiration, resolution, or just a piece of flavor.\nHow you interpret your draw is up to you. The word fire might mean a catastrophic explosion, or the fire in your character's eyes as they pull off an amazing maneuver. Your Trove word will almost always give an interesting nudge to the story, or even inspire its whole climax!\nAdapting\nDepending on how the story ends, your characters might have to Adapt, permanently changing as a result of what happened. A character who acted against a Value might decide to Let Go of it, erasing it from their record sheet. Or they might choose to Resolvethat value, becoming even more committed to it, and swearing never again to compromise it.\nYou can play through multiple Episodes with the same characters, seeing how they evolve and change over time, or run the game as a one-off: it works fine either way.\nThe core rules of Archives are complete and playtested, and you can even download them now to try the game out yourself. A game like this, though, really benefits from a well-designed book that carefully lays out the rules for maximum clarity; that contains lots of examples and idea seeds to help get your creativity flowing; and that's illustrated with beautiful artwork that conjures up the immense vistas of a galaxy eons into the future.\nIf the Kickstarter is funded, I'll be able to publish Archives to print and PDF as a full color sourcebook, a 6x9 softcover with 80-100 pages. In addition to the rules, the book will contain:\nSample names for characters, Houses, and planets\nA thousand juicy Trove words to choose from (in case you don't have a stack of sci-fi novels handy when you play)\nA \"Quick-Start\" guide that you can read aloud to introduce the rules, introducing new concepts gradually across the course of your first few scenes\nActual play examples (edited for clarity) to show key rules and mechanics in action\nSample story seeds, scene ideas, Values, and villains: for when you need more inspiration than a word from the Trove\nVariant rules for playing in other settings, and a \"fast play\" mode that streamlines character creation and takes out some mechanics, suitable for pick-up play at a con or game night\nFull-color, awe-inspiring sci-fi art\nI'm finishing up this additional content now. Your Kickstarter pledge will go to professional layout and art design for the book. I've got an experienced RPG layout designer and art director who's agreed to move forward on this project if funded, so the last piece we need is the budget to make it happen.\nAbout the Author: I'm a lifelong roleplayer and award-winning digital game designer who's been making interactive fiction for fifteen years; my 2014 game The Ice-Bound Concordance won an IndieCade award for Best Story. This is my first tabletop game and I couldn't be more excited about it.\n(Fun fact: I also recently finished a dissertation about new kinds of interactive narrative and what digital story games can learn from tabletop. An early version of Archives is in the appendix!)\nMe and one shelf of my roleplaying books. No, YOU have a problem.\nMy budget breakdown can be seen below. A bit over a third the funds will go towards layout and art, with a bit over another third going to order fulfillment for printed books. The remaining money goes to Kickstarter fees and miscellaneous expenses.\nFor fulfillment, I'm partnering with DriveThruRPG to deliver both digital and print-on-demand physical copies of the book. The physical books will use DriveThru's highest quality printing option, which produces beautiful books worthy of sharing a shelf with your other favorite sourcebooks.\nThanks for reading, and I can't wait to hear what stories you tell with Archives of the Sky.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've previously done a successful Kickstarter (for The Ice-Bound Concordance, a digital game that came with a physical book) which was successfully delivered. \"Archives\" is a simpler and smaller-scale project.

He's done book covers for an unbelievable cross-section of genre authors over the years, including Mercedes Lackey, Brian Aldiss, Iain Banks, Greg Bear, Elizabeth H Boyer, Gordon R Dickson, Tanith Lee, Michael Moorcock, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Jack Vance. will feature several of Mark's paintings, including one image painted for a book cover but never used."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Artists: LP \u01fckili Ross and Tobias Roetsch", "update_content": "I'm extremely pleased to report that we now have all the art licensed and positioned in the Archives of the Sky book, and I'll be sending the files to the printer later this week for a test printing! The book is looking fantastic, folks... I can't wait for you all to see it!\nOver the next couple updates I want to share with you some of the incredible artists whose work will be featured in the book. While we originally thought we would split our art budget between commissioning a few original pieces and licensing the rest, the route we've ultimately taken is to use all licensed art. The advantage of this route is that we could afford a higher-tier level of artwork than we'd have been able to otherwise, and the results are truly stunning.

Following cataclysmic events on Earth the fragile veil between reality and the Void was shattered and the truth of existence revealed. As mankind cried for salvation they were torn from their homeworld by Void-torrents and the surviving peoples of Earth were scattered among the stars. Countless were lost and mankind seemed all but perished. Over the decades the survivors, stragglers and ragged remnants of mankind\u2019s tribes struggled for their lives across countless uncaring worlds. However, a few managed to go beyond mere subsistence and travel the Void-currents to congregate in fabled Llyhn, epicentre of the cosmos.\nBLACK VOID is a dark fantasy tabletop roleplaying game revolving around the fall and subsequent resurgence of humanity after cataclysmic events have torn them from Earth. Pursuing power, prestige and enlightenment - humanity is struggling to find a new place and purpose in a vast and unfamiliar cosmos. Players can focus on the personal struggles and stories of their characters or expand their scope putting emphasis on the fate of humanity as a species and the part they play in this.\nBLACK VOID core book: A high-quality, 400+ page, full colour and hardcover book with everything you need for players and game-masters. The book is filled with original art, novel species and monsters, extensive descriptions and rich lore, detailed maps and much more bringing the BLACK VOID to life.\nGame themes: The game takes place in a distant past which is both familiar and outlandish in its dark and exotic ambience. As descendants of the survivors of Earth, characters can adopt many roles such as:\nServing as emissaries, defending the enclaves and last remnants of human civilization.\nTravelling the Void-currents as explorers seeking riches and glory across the cosmos.\nVenturing to find Earth, the long lost cradle of humanity.\nSeeking influence and claiming a new home for mankind, taking their rightful places as leaders of mankind.\nDiving into the intrigues of Llyhn or perhaps building an empire in the dark depths of the city\u2019s underworld.\nDiscovering the true essence of existence finding enlightenment beyond the veil of reality; in a Void filled with mindless abominations.\nGame Concept: At its core the game is about the exploration, struggle for survival and will-to-power of humanity as it encounters an outlandish, bizarre cosmos. This is not a typical game of \u201cgood versus evil\u201d. Rather, it takes a less rigid approach and probes the grey areas where morals are point-of-view. The game revolves around three main concepts:\nInto the unknown - How does humanity fit into a cosmos it knows little about and where the possibilities are endless? In a cosmos where humanity\u2019s ideals and tenets are insignificant mankind needs to adapt or succumb!\nBeyond the horizon - Exploring the cosmos and faced with adversity, political intrigue and cultural tension on a scale unknown to humanity, players must cope or risk becoming collateral damage in the struggles of uncaring factions. In the end humanity must claim its place in the cosmos or perish trying!\nWhat is humanity - Humanity is exposed to strange and oftentimes bizarre philosophies and ideals. As a result the characters must define, establish and decide what humanity is and what its place will be in the cosmos!\nRules: The entire system is based on a few basic principles, making the rules easy to grasp and implement, which in the end gives more time for the fun bit, namely playing the game. The point of simple rules is that they can be made to fit anything an inventive Game Master or player can come up with, granting endless possibilities within the game.\nGame mechanics: Actions are resolved by a single roll using a twelve-sided dice to determine their success or failure. Actions have a difficulty rating, which is the value the dice-roll must equal or exceed for the action to be successful. Rolls are modified by adding Trait, ability and conditional modifiers - with the key feature that actions can be associated with differing Traits or skills enabling players to adopt their individual style depending on circumstances or personal preference.\nKey features: Two main factors in the game are enlightenment and waastah. Each factor significantly impacts the game as enlightenment grant characters the ability to traverse the Void as well as extraordinary powers and abilities while waastah confers tangible and vital sway, authority and social influence with other sentient species. Aspects that are essential as mankind\u2019s \u2013 and the character\u2019s - very existence is threatened.\nVersatility: Points-based character creation and non-linear progression allows you to create exactly the character you wish; chosing homeworld and allocating points between traits (physical, mental and social characteristics), talents, background, skills, attributes and powers. Want to play a sly smuggler or a beguiling blood ritualist, a cheeky chatter broker or a mesmerizing mystic? Go ahead, all options are open.\nCombat: Harsh and gritty, the manoeuvre-based combat system ensures consistently versatile encounters as combatants can employ a wide variety of combat actions tailored by their personal style, preference or strategic approach. Despite its versatility combat consists of only a few simple steps: Determining the sequence of actions, then declaring and resolving these.\nPowers: There are two main powers in the game - blood rituals allow characters to imbue boons and fortunes from sacrifices, divine prophecies from the entrails and much more, while mysticism lets characters manifest esoteric phenomena, changing reality purely through acts of will. Both practices however, carry inherent dangers as backlash or calamity may strike the unfortunate.\nGame-play: Encouraging and rewarding player creativity and ingenuity, this game is well-suited for gamers who are looking for more player agency and freedom of choice without needless restraints. A rich, versatile and ambient setting allows players to explore unknown worlds pursuing enlightenment, prestige, wealth, physical prowess or whatever their hearts' desire. The game is best suited for extended sandbox games.\nThe Black Void RPG is set in a dual reality: A vast cosmos and beyond this evident world an intangible void. The cosmos is the universe we know; home to mortal species such as mankind and many others. In contrast the Void is an entirely alien and bizarre domain; an ethereal ocean constantly fluctuating and inhabited by unimaginable life forms and in its depths the mindless ghostly abominations. The void is chaos and catalyst as opposed to the order and constancy of the cosmos.\nA metaphysical entity, known as the veil, divides and screens these contrasting spheres from each other. But the veil is unstable and occasionally perforated allowing the influence of one to emanate into the other and people to cross the boundary and travel between worlds.\nThe central arena of the game is Llyhn the eternal, a median port and cosmopolis at the heart of a massive convergence of void currents. Llyhn is a vibrant melting pot of species from across the known worlds as well as more esoteric entities, attracting cultural tensions, social intricacies, religious polemic and political rivalry. It is here that humanity is struggling for survival, staring up from filthy alleys and shanties at opulent alien palaces beyond the shadows of looming walls under the watchful eyes of the masked Hohr\u2019loh\u2019kin, the extended arm of the unseen rulers of Llyhn.\nIn addition to character creation and game mechanics the core book comprise a game master chapter, extensive lore sections, rich world descriptions and numerous original species and monsters. The GM section provides everything the discerning game master needs to know about the game and how to bring the unique flavour and atmosphere of the setting to life.\nThe key areas of the setting, including Llyhn, multiple core worlds and numerous other notable areas are annotated with enticing plot hooks as well as many flavourful NPC's. In addition to a one-shot adventure introducing central themes and concepts of the game an extensive compilation of tools are presented for developing flavourful new worlds, NPC's, adventures and exciting stories for the players to explore.\nTo learn more about the BLACK VOID RPG visit our website and follow us on Instagram, Facebook or Twitter.\nThis is how you add an add-on to your Kickstarter pledge:\nGo to the BLACK VOID RPG Kickstarter page and press the \"manage your pledge\" button.

With its new art, varied formats (PDF, Kindle, softcover, and hardback), and an extra scenario, this Kickstarter will make its rightful return to print, uplifted to Call of Cthulhu, 7th Edition.\nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\n Miskatonic River Press released New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley to great acclaim and it quickly became a favourite among Call of Cthulhu Keepers. Its faithful adherence to Lovecraftian themes and its location along the dark river it takes its name from, meant a return to an authentic home for many players who cut their anti-mythos teeth on earlier adventures set in the valley.\n\n\nStarted by Keith 'Doc' Herber and Tom Lynch, it quickly marked MRP as a company to watch. Tragically, Doc passed away while working on a subsequent title (Our Ladies of Sorrow with Kevin Ross) but Tom kept his dream alive and grew upon it with further books. Sadly, MRP closed its doors a couple of years ago and the titles have been out of print as Tom Lynch focused on writing fiction and his family.\n\nLast year, Stygian Fox purchased four titles from Tom Lynch/MRP in order to bring them back to players of the world's greatest horror game and in turn, we aim to release new and updated versions of New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley, More Adventures in Arkham Country, Our Ladies of Sorrow, and Tales of the Sleepless City.\nIn New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley, there are currently six scenarios and we aim to add a seventh set in the valley or Innsmouth (although Innsmouth isn't in the Miskatonic Valley it is such an integral part of Lovecraft Country as to be hard to ignore). The original is black and white and 130 pages. We aim to increase that to 160 pages and to make it full colour with all new art.\nThe Authors\nThe original scenarios will appear and be updated to 7th edition Call of Cthulhu (still fully backwards compatible with previous editions) and are works by Christopher Smith Adair (The Darkness Beneath the Hill, Children of a Starry Heaven, This Village Belongs to Us), Tom Lynch (Ties That Bind, Vinea Perversa, Lines In The Sand, Lovecraft eZine) Oscar Rios (The Nature of Faith, The Legacy of Arrius Lurco, Borne Into Darkness) \nKevin Ross (Kingsport: The City In The Mists, The Music of the Spheres, Tell Me, Have You Seen The Yellow Sign?) \nand Doc Herber (H. P. Lovecraft's Arkham, H. P. Lovecraft's Dunwich, Escape From Innsmouth 2nd Ed., and far too many others to mention)\nTheir adventures are set in such diverse locations as Arkham, Foxfield, Dunwich, and Kingsport and are:\nThe Reeling Midnight, by Tom Lynch\nWasted Youth, by Christopher Smith Adair\nSpirit of Industry, by Oscar Rios\nProof of Life, by Keith Herber\nMalice Everlasting, by Oscar Rios\nThe Night War, by Kevin A. Ross\n\nProduction Staff\nThe folks behind this new version of New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley have a proven track record of bringing new Call of Cthulhu content to gamers everywhere via Kickstarter and other platforms.\n\nStephanie McAlea - Owner of Stygian Fox, Cartographer, and mad idea summoner (Hudson & Brand, The Things We Leave Behind, Horror On The Orient Express, Cthulhu by Gaslight 3rd ed., 2300AD, The Book of Contemporary Magical Things)\n\nBadger McInnes - Layout Artist and Word Wizard (Secrets of San Francisco, Secrets of Kenya, Secrets of Los Angeles, Our Ladies of Sorrow, More Adventures in Arkham Country, The Things We Leave Behind, Feed The Shoggoth!)\nSome of our contributions to RPG publishing\n As mentioned, the book will contain a new adventure set in the valley or nearby, the layout will be by Badger McInnes and we'd like to add further art by creators we admire and trust to deliver, including more art by Mihai Bila (shown below). This is where the Kickstarter funds come in. The book will be printed in a premium format and, as Stygian Fox customers have come to expect, will use art to portray a slightly more horrific and mature version of NTotMV. \nMihai's Facebook page with examples of his art is here: https://m.facebook.com/mcrassusart/\nThe funds for this Kickstarter will go towards commissioning more art and the hiring a writer and creatives of quality to expand the book. The funds will also go on printing and distribution.\n'The Festival' by Mihai Bila\nBackers can look forward to lovingly produced PDFs, Softcover and Hardcover books, and increased quality and content. Apart from a few tweaks to the text in order to update the scenarios, very little of the adventures will actually change. The entire cost of your books and getting them to you is covered by your pledge.\nPDF: Backers will receive a full-colour PDF of New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley via DriveThruRPG. \n\nSoftcover: Backers will receive a full-colour standard print in softcover format of New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley via DriveThruRPG along with a free PDF. \nHardcover: Backers will receive a full-colour premium print in hardcover format of New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley via DriveThruRPG along with a free PDF.\n\nHardcover + Naming: Backers will receive a full-colour premium print in hardcover format of New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley via DriveThruRPG along with a free PDF plus their chosen name and occupation done up all fancy n' such in the back of the book (we reserve the right to reject any inappropriate names or occupations).\nWith this project, our focus is to bring back MRP's first book back in print in a beautiful format. As it is a previously written project, there's only so much we can do in terms of stretch goals. We're already adding new art and maps but, hopefully, we can add a few other things too. If we're lucky enough to reach the top levels we'll also give a 'thank you' gratuity to the authors of the previous edition (even though it was paid for as work-for-hire) and we'll up our cents-per-word scale for the new writer and artists for helping us get there. Admittedly, this doesn't benefit our backers but as pay in the RPG industry is seriously low, I'm sure you'll want to help the creatives involved to get a bonus.\nDistribution is via DriveThruRPG/RPGNow.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all projects, there is a risk but as this is an update to a complete book we think this has very little risk to it. \n\n You'll receive a coupon for the full cost of the book and shipping from Stygian Fox which you will then redeem at no extra cost from the distributor.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Drifters", "descp": "You're just breezing through and feel like helping out!

What type of society will you create?\nOptional rules for character aging, as well as how to handle wealth and lifestyle in the colony.\nNew interstellar colonization-related gear, vehicles and genelines!\n\u201cGreat setting with a ton of awesome info and backstory and cool art...\u201d\n\u2014Jack M., DriveThruRPG\nTwo hundred years from now what should be the shining beacon of the future is instead cloaked in conspiracy and horror. Humankind has expanded throughout the solar system, and there it has discovered mysteries older than humanity.\nThe culture has shattered into myriad subcultures; nation-states are the hollow shells of what they once were. Corporations and other groups wage small-scale wars in the streets or in space. Bioengineered horrors left over from these conflicts stalk the hulls of ruined stations and abandoned colonies.\nBut for an enterprising team willing to brave the horrors, there's always a profit to be made.\nThe Shadows Over Sol core rulebook was first published in 2016. Since then, seven adventures, three supplements and four accessories have been published for the game line. Siren's Call will be the largest and most ambitious to date!\nOnce the initial funding goal has been reached, additional stretch goals will be unveiled. These goals may either be unlocked at specified funding levels, or at a specific number of patrons for Tab Creations' accompanying Patreon project. The conditions for unlocking each goal will be specified in its description.\nUNLOCKED! - Siren Poster Map - $2000: Our first stretch goal unlocks a world map of Siren, the planet to be colonized by the ARC Project. This will be made available in print as a poster map, and digitally in a high resolution image format. The electronic version and an \"at cost\" code for the print version will be included in all reward tiers at THE GAME and up.\nUNLOCKED! - Player's Brief - $3000: The Siren's Call Player's Brief will be a full color PDF document containing all of the player-facing information and options from the Siren's Call campaign and sourcebook.

It will be included in all reward tiers at THE GAME and up.\nUNLOCKED! - Colony Ship Deck Plans - $4000: This stretch goal unlocks a set of deck plans for the ARC Project colony ship.

This includes adding a GM Screen Insert for the new Colony Building system, updating the Roll20 character sheet and revising the Quick-Start to include better art and an upgraded layout.\nUNLOCKED! - Double the Art Budget - $6000: At this funding level we can afford to double the budget the game has for art and layout, making the final sourcebook better for everyone!\nUNLOCKED! - Additional Scenario - $7000: When this funding total is reached we will add an additional scenario to the Siren's Call sourcebook, further expanding the adventure possibilities for everyone! This scenario will be one of the many optional \"side treks.\"\nUNLOCKED! - Prelude Adventure - 25 Patrons: Tab Creations has a Patreon where every three months we release an adventure or other short supplement. If we can increase our Patreon to 25 patrons by April 26, we will release a prelude adventure to Siren's Call free to all patrons and backers of this Kickstarter!\nUNLOCKED! - Pregenerated Colonists - $8000: At this funding level we will publish a set of pregenerated colonists, ready to use as player characters or as NPCs in your Siren's Call campaign.

Three journals themed around At the Mountains of Madness, The Call of Cthulhu and The Dunwich Horror. The fourth is a Mythos Flora and Fauna journal documenting an investigators descent into madness. \nAt 8 x 5 inches and with 200 pages of quality notepaper inside, they are the perfect size to be used in game for note taking or to map out your Call of Cthulhu campaigns. \nThe four journals will come in two brown and two black leather hardcovers and each will have it's own embossing art. \nBelow we have also included the Masks of Nyarlathotep emboss art. Join the Carlyle expedition.\nEmbossing Art\nAt the Mountains of Madness will will sport the \"Antarctic Expedition\" motif as seen in the picture above\nThe Call of Cthulhu will have embossed on it The Stars Align symbol\nThe Dunwich Horror will show The MU Letterhead sigil.\nThe Flora and Fauna journal will have The MU Botanical Society symbol.\nThe journals evoke the feeling of discovering an artefact full of esoteric script or hidden clues, but this time, you are the dread author. \nFirst Edition\nFeaturing exclusive art from the talented HP Lovecraft Historical Society, including some never seen in print before , these hard cover, leather bound journals will transport you back in time to the desk of Henry Armitage himself.\nPLAY\n\nWhy We Chose Journals \nWe wanted each journal to emulate those found during games and in Lovecraft's own stories. To give investigators a chance to tell their own stories, to document their own descent into madness. Perhaps, later to be found and read by others. I can think of nothing that would excite me more than a player showing me their journal after a long campaign, filled with madness, clues and strange events. Personal, unique, exciting. \nThe Investigation Continues\nThe Flora and Fauna journal features original artwork by talented artist, Seth Laster. Inspired by Victorian era Flora and Fauna books, with a distinctly mythos twist. \n\"Clutching your journal, sketching into it the madness you dare not acknowledge, you know that you are coming to the end. Soon you will turn the last page and you must sketch your final piece. A self portrait. What have you become?\u201d\nEvery investigators nightmare...\nShoggoth Draft Sketch\nStar Vampire Draft Sketch\n ...and that is where it gets really good. \nJournals for Your Campaigns\nChaosium has asked us to make a series of Campaign Journals for their existing and future Call of Cthulhu games, including the up coming release of Masks of Nyarlethotep. WHICH WE ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT ARGGHHGHH!\nSorry, just a bout of temporary insanity there. \nIn fact, if we hit our targets we will get to work straight away on a MoN journal, which, may even get added here, as an add on, in time for the launch of Masks.\nNew Masks - Art by Sam Johnson\nExclusive Backer Rewards \nBut you don't want to know all that, you want to know what exclusive Kickstarter content we have on offer. \nWe are going to produce exclusive Flora and Fauna postcards with art not used in the journal that wont ever be seen anywhere else.

We have been pouring over the assets from the HP Lovecraft Historical Society and taking some expert advice from them and the printers and think we have picked out some winners.  \nSo, we will be including some physical ephemera in each journal. From the vast HPLHS library of assets we have chosen some of our favorites.\nHPLHS Ephemera\nBut, don't take my word for it, here is a message from Andrew Leman himself. \nPLAY\n\nThe second stretch goal we want to offer is the inclusion of a fountain pen. To scribe all your insane writings with and accompany you on your investigations.  \nSample Image Only\nAs our third and final stretch goal, we would like to give everyone an A4 colour botanical print of one of Seth Laster's terrifyingly beautiful Mythos Flora and Fauna imaginings.\nStretch Goals\nAdd Ons\nWe are excited to announce that we will be offering our official Masks of Nyarlathotep Campaign Journal as an add on. The Masks journal will be available to backers at the Expedition Member and higher. \nAdd Ons\nMasks Journal\nWe have been asks for some details about the Masks Journal. \nThe Masks journal will contain NO spoilers from the campaign. \nJoin the original 1919 Carlyle expedition. We wanted the journal to be 100% use-able during your campaign of Masks and not compromise your enjoyment. So, the journal is designed from the perspective of the original Carlyle expedition. Fill it with your story and enjoy the immersive ephemera printed within. \nThe Masks Journal will be available as an add on for Expedition Member and higher levels. \nMasks 2018 Edition\nKickstarter Schedule \nKickstarter Schedule\n What happens next? \nWe are ready to go.

It is possible that an overly successful campaign would create the need for higher volumes of leather required from suppliers than normal. This would put a strain on supply and thus a strain on production. The consequence would be a delayed delivery schedule. However, we would know about that well in advance of the beginning of production and be able to communicate that to backers.\n\nProduction time.\n\nThe time taken to make the journals and the stretch goals, particularly the ephemera is not inconsiderable. That time cannot be effectively reduced without compromising quality, which is not an option. Again, an overly successful campaign may put stress upon production. This can be managed internally here at TYPE40. We have specifically put aside time in our work schedule to dedicate to this kickstarter if it should be successful.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge AU$ 1 or more", "title": "Believer", "descp": "Show your support for the expedition and receive a digital copy of Mythos Flora and Fauna artwork exclusive to this Kickstarter.\nINCLUDES:\nDigital copy of the Mythos Flora and Fauna artwork", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}], "stat": ["14 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 10 or more", "title": "Postcard from the Edge of Sanity", "descp": "Receive evidence of other worlds from the expedition in the form of a Mythos Flora and Fauna postcard.\nA postcard with the Mythos Flora and Fauna artwork on it will arrive on your doorstep.\nINCLUDES:\nMythos Flora and Fauna Postcard\nDigital copy of the Mythos Flora and Fauna artwork", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2018"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge AU$ 25 or more", "title": "Return to Skiven Rock", "descp": "Join the TYPE40 family and carry your challenge coin with you at all times.

These maps are being created on a twice-weekly basis throughout the creation phase of the project (April 2018 - March 2019).\nEach map will be provided to those who pledge $20 (or more) in digital format (JPG) for integration into any tabletop RPG with alternate virtual tabletop (VTT) versions provided simultaneously with each map release.\nMost maps will be geared towards a futuristic setting, though a few will likely have potential of crossing genres. The focus of this collection will be various science fiction locales such as space stations, planetary outposts, asteroid mining colonies, futuristic cities, science labs, spaceship deck plans, alien locations, and interplanetary waypoints, but will also include offerings for subgenres such as cyberpunk, science fantasy, and neo-noir.\nThere are several rewards available with content to be delivered to backers at every pledge level!\nTry it out!

All you have to do is click on the \"Manage your pledge\" button located at the top of this page. Then click on the \"Change your pledge\" button on the bottom of the next page. There you will be able to change your \"Pledge Amount\" and then click on the \"Continue\" button to confirm.\nCheck back during the Kickstarter campaign as additional sample maps will be released every week!\nStart benefiting from your pledge almost immediately! Rather than waiting until the entire project is completed to release content, all of the maps created for this collection will be released to backers who pledge $20 (or more) on a continuing basis via a planned schedule of two maps per week throughout the project creation phase.\nThe first of the maps will be provided to applicable backers tarting the day after the campaign funds are collected (usually about two weeks after the Kickstarter ends). Future map releases will continue with a minimum of twice-weekly updates throughout the creation phase until all the maps for the collection are completed.\nBackers who pledge $20 (or more) will be provided with an URL and unique login information to a special website they can visit to access and download the most recently released maps and all previously released maps for this project.\nScreenshot of the Digtial Distribution Tool (DDT) website.\nA finished book including all of the non-VTT \"Gamemaster\" and \"Player\" versions of the maps will be provided as an indexed PDF to all backers who pledge at the $10 (or higher) pledge levels. The estimated PDF release date is around April 2019.\nBackers at the $20 (or higher) pledge levels will also have the option to buy either hardcover or softcover print copies of the book at the price of production cost + shipping cost when the print version is released to the general public later in 2019. The estimated print release date is planned to be around April-June 2019. More info on pricing for print copies will be provided nearer to the project completion.\nShipping Costs for Print Book Purchases:\nThe print versions will be distributed as print-on-demand via DriveThruRPG.com. Domestic and international shipping charges will be handled on their end with purchase of any print copy of the book.\nVolume 1: Fantasy Adventure was released in hardcover print last week. The following video is a 2-minute flip-thru of the book. We are trending steadily towards Volume 2: Science Fiction being just as huge!\nPLAY\n\nEvery digital map in Volume 2 is created at 600 dpi resolution.\nAll of the digital maps scale up as crisp-and-clear print at poster size. This includes printing at the 1-inch scale popular for use with tabletop miniatures.\nThis project is not producing any physical poster map prints.\nCheck out the demo video below from the Volume 1 Kickstarter to see a sample map printed on premium glossy laminated paper.\nPLAY\n\nFor more information on the poster-print quality digital maps, check out this update from the Volume 1 Kickstarter that explains it in more detail.\nWho is Justin Andrew Mason? I am a professional tabletop role-playing game designer, ENnie Award-winning author (Adventureaweek.com Blog 2014), graphic designer, and professional cartographer (AAW MapMaster 2014 winner).\nI am also the creator and cartographer of the first volume of this series, The Big Book of Maps for Tabletop Roleplaying Games - Volume 1: Fantasy Adventure.\nThat Kickstarter funded with over 1,000 backers raising $24K, and (with unlocked stretch goals) produced 230+ maps, 650+ map icons. It was completed more two months early and fulfilled to all backers months ahead of schedule.\nWatch this project's intro video at the top of the page for a slideshow with several hundred examples of my cartography.\nMy various works have been published and commissioned by multiple game publishers and game-related companies including AAW Games (Into the Wintery Gale, Rise of the Drow, Snow White, Aventyr Bestiary, Underworld Races & Classes, and the Mini-Dungeon Tome), AetherCon Online Gaming Convention, EN Publishing (EN5ider; Friend of the Children, The Mystery of Mordecai's Monster, and Dia de los Dinosaurios Muertos), Dark Naga Adventures (Confronting Hastur, The City of Talos), Kobold Press (Southlands, Advanced Races Compendium, Tome of Beasts, Book of Lairs, Demon Cults, Midgard Campaign Setting, New Paths Compendium, and Creature Codex Kickstarters), Legendary Games (Hypercorps 2099), Mythoard (Adventure Hook Cards), Playground Adventures (After School Adventures), Rogue Genius Games (Veranthea Codex), and TPK Games.\nI maintain a professional blog, Paths to Adventure, where anyone may keep track of my current projects, finished commissions, the latest releases of my work, and several free RPG-related web apps and generators I've developed (like the Tavern Sign Crafter). I even do a bit of self publishing through the platform as well.\nWhat is the difference between VTT and non-VTT maps?\nBackers at the $20 level (or higher) level will be provided digital access to both a VTT (Virtual Tabletop) and a non-VTT versions of every map produced for this project via the weekly releases via the Digital Distribution Tool website.\nA VTT map contains no scaling grid, room numbers, icons, or hidden room contents (such as secret compartments). A non-VTT map includes  these features. The final PDF and printed book will include only the non-VTT maps.\nThe purpose of the VTT version of every map is provide a convenient import to Virtual Tabletop software platforms. In addition to access to the twice-weekly released downloads, at the end of the creation phase of the project all backers at the $20 (or higher) level will be provided a link to download a package (ZIP) containing both versions of every map in digital (JPG) format.\nThere are two non-VTT versions available of every map in this project. The \"GM\" version which includes numbers and labels. And the \"Player\" version which does not include numbers or labels. All downloadable sample maps on this page have been updated to include all three versions of the digital map for reference.\nNot interested in science fiction maps? There\u2019s still something for you here! As an incentive for folks who may not need science fiction maps for their games, I am adding in a THIRD BOOK full of all-new fantasy maps as a reward for reaching a special funding goal.\nWhen this new Kickstarter meets or exceeds the funding met for the previous Kickstarter project ($23,562 US), I will create a third book in the Big Book of Maps series that focuses on fantasy-themed \"Mini-Dungeon\u201d maps.\nWhen unlocked, this extra book will begin production immediately after the science fiction maps for Volume 2 are completed and released to backers.\nThis third collection of maps will be provided as a indexed PDF and released to all backers of this Kickstarter. Backers who pledge $20 (or more) will also get the high-resolution digital files and  VTT maps for the Mini-Dungeons, and a voucher to buy the print copy of the third book at production cost + shipping cost.\nExamples of Mini-Dungeon cartography I've crafted for other publishers.\nWhen unlocked, the third book will include over 100 fantasy mini-dungeon maps.\nWhereas Volume 1 - Fantasy Adventure focused on massive maps that sometimes included as many as 70-100 rooms, this bonus book will focus on dungeon maps consisting of around 15-25 rooms each (great for those one shots, or smaller locales). It\u2019s the perfect fantasy map companion to the first Big Book of Maps!\nNote: If this special funding goal is unlocked, the Mini-Dungeon book is considered a bonus. It's completion is not tied to the estimated timeline for delivery of Volume 2. It will likely take several months after this Kickstarter has been completed and delivered to backers before the bonus book becomes available.\nLicensing Note: The Stock Cartography license provided by the $295 pledge level of this Kickstarter does not extend to the 100+ Mini-Dungeon maps. If you have backed at this level, and would like to extend your license to cover the 100 extra bonus maps when it is unlocked, please increase your pledge by $50.\nEvery week a new Featured Addition will be added to the project. These additions are bonus material, and just my way of saying, \"Thank your for all the support!\" Be sure to check back every Friday during the kickstarter to see what new goodies have been added!\nThe Week #1 Feature Edition is Planet Portfolio 1 and Planet Portfolio 2! Originally created as a print-and-play tabletop solution, Planet Portfolio has now been updated with full VTT support! Every asset of the book has also been provided as a 300 dpi PNG image with transparent backgrounds. You can download it here for free right now!\nPlanet Portfolio 2 is being created as a bonus for this kickstarter project, and will also be added for free download when it is completed. Estimated delivery is 1-2 weeks after funds clear for this project.\nCombined, the Planet Portfolios provide over 100 VTT assets for your spacefaring adventures including: stars, rocky planets, terra-like planets, gas giants, moons, asteroids, dwarf planets, comets, and more!\nThe Week #1 Feature Edition is Starship Deckplan Maps! A series of 20 detailed starship deckpans has been added to the collection. Like all other maps, these will include GM, Player, and VTT versions.\nAlso, for each stretch goal bonus map or mini-funding goal bonus map added to the campaign an additional starship deckplan map will be added as well!\nThe Week #3 Featured Addition heralds the arrival of an all new Add-on option! The Starship Builder Kits. Want to try it out? Click here to download it right now. If you want the rest of the kits, you can get them as an add-on by increasing your pledge by $25.\nEach kit includes 20 ship sections that allow you to easily create your own customized starship deckplan!\nThere are 5 core kits, and for every $5k this kickstarter funds, another 5 sets will be added. That means right now there are 25 kits (500 starship sections) with more to be added to the add-on as funding continues to increase!\nDesigned to allow you to utilize various stylized starship sections to compile your very own custom starship deckplan. Each kits is designed to allow you to mix-and-match any of the sections included with sections included in other sets in the series.\nStretch Goals: For every 50 backers that pledge to this Kickstarter campaign, one full-page, full-color bonus map will be added to the collection. This even includes the $1 backer level count, so get your friends to back for a buck and get more maps into Volume 2 of the Big Book of Maps!\nThese bonus maps will be included in the final book and will be released via the backer-only website on a staggered schedule as time permits.\nPlease Note: Should this project result in a very large number of backers, the process of creating the bonus maps could delay the final release of the PDF and Print versions of the book. However, there will be no delay in the twice-weekly release schedule of digital maps to applicable backers.\nIn addition to the bonus map stretch goals based on the number of backers, an additional series of stretch goals based on overall amount pledged to the project can be unlocked.\nStretch Goals ($1k - $14k): When the project is funded, and for every $500 pledged beyond the project's $1,000 funding goal up to $14k, a series of 10 all-new map icons will be unlocked for backers.\nSuper Stretch Goals ($15k +): When the project reaches $15k funding, and for every additional $1,000 pledged beyond that, an additional map icon is added to every previously unlocked map icon set. That's 27 new map icons for every super stretch goal unlocked!\nBonus Stretch Goals: There will periodically be threshold-based bonus stretch goals that are in addition to the planned recurring stretch goals. This include special bonuses that are unlocked at the $5k, $10k, $15 and $20 funding levels.\nThe icons will be released in themed packs as they are created, and made available to all backers via \"backers only\" updates here on Kickstarter as well as the Digital Distribution Tool.\nAll of these unlocked map icons will even be available to $1 backers -- so everyone who shows support for the project walks away with something worthwhile!\nMap icons are the various elements that can be placed onto a dungeon map via a virtual tabletop (VTT) platform or graphic editing software. This includes objects such as doors, treasure chests, furniture, traps, treasure, etc.\nFor the purpose of this project these map icons will be provided as PNG graphic files with transparent backgrounds (to allow easy import and placement via VTT software).\nExample of how map icons will be released in sets.\nThe map icons will be released to all backers in themed sets as they are created. A \u201ccomplete collection\u201d of the map icons in a single download will also be made available for backers at the end of this project\u2019s creation phase.\nThe map icons produced by this project are super-high 600 dpi resolution and especially created to properly accompany the matching high resolution digital maps offered. This means the map icons will also scale up to poster-map quality.\nThe planned release schedule for the map icon sets is once weekly starting the day the project funds clear. These sets will be made available to all backers via the Digital Distribution Tool.\nEach map set initially includes 10 totally different map icons (not just color/texture variations). The number of icons in each set can be increased via unlocked stretch goals beginning at the $15k funding level.\nResources: Music used for intro video: Ambient Music 6 by Essa.

However, I have years of experience with designing or running successful Kickstarter projects for various publishers (including some of the most successful Kickstarter projects by AAW Games and Kobold Press). This isn't my first rodeo, and I have already learned many of the \"difficult lessons\" that many first time project creators face.\n\nIn comparison with some of the more complex Kickstarter projects I've assisted with, this project is very straight forward. I foresee no likely hurdles in providing backers with the completed product as promised.\n\nHowever, as with any project in the making, there are inherent risks. As the sole producer of this material, if something where to happen to me that prevented continued content creation the project could become delayed. Even in that unlikely event, backers would still have full access to all of the content that was created for the project up to that point and a contingency is in place to release any pending and completed maps to backers should the gods choose to cast lightning to strike me down.\n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please drop me a message in the comments section for this project and I'll get an answer to you as soon as possible (as well as updating the FAQ here if deemed necessary).\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Keep Me Updated", "descp": "Interested in this project, but not yet ready to back at a higher level?

The game was first published nearly ten years ago, and has since been translated in to French, Catalan and Spanish.\nThis Kickstarter is to fund the creation of a new full-colour version of the game with improved mechanics based on the Open D6 system, in 200 page 6\"x9\" book format.\nIn Summerland, players take on the roles of Drifters, characters who travel beneath the Sea of Leaves, the vast supernatural forest that has devastated the works of humanity. They are driven to constantly move on due to a past trauma that while protecting them from the Call, the siren-song of the forest, prohibits them from being accepted in to what's left of society. Instead they must confront their past, resolve their trauma and at last join the remainder of humanity. Like my last game Exilium, also funded via Kickstarter and delivered earlier than anticipated, this new version of Summerland uses mechanics specifically to model the process redemption, giving the game a clear 'end-game' linked to actual play.\nThe original version of the game came out around ten years ago, quickly followed by a revised and expanded edition. I'm now raising funds for a new full colour second edition of Sumerland, with new mechanics based on the Open D6 rules set as used in Exilium, so still rules light, but modified to fit the themes and goals of Summerland.\nSummerland has been out for some time in it's original form with different mechanics to this new version. Check out some reviews at the links below (and bear in mind what's changed in this new edition, listed in the next section)...\nhttp://mostunreadblogever.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/tommys-take-on-summerland-revised-and.html\nhttps://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?483617-Summerland-Any-good\nhttp://www.bluestockings.ca/2014/09/game-review-summerland.html\nDrivethruRPG customers:\n'What captivated me about this setting was the mysteries and the connection to nature. It reminded me very much of the books of Robert Holdstock, where a huge forest places an important role as well. There is something strange here that I hope to one day explore! The cover art is amazing!\nRating: [4 of 5 Stars!]'\n'The premise is both intriguing and deceptively simple: a primeval forest has overtaken the world overnight, destroying civilization in one fell swoop. Why and how? That's up to the narrator to decide--or to leave as a mystery. It's an evocative, open-ended setting with unlimited possibilities and designed with an eye to letting the players and narrator create a very personal, collaborative story. Personally, it's just the thing I was looking for. I can't wait to play it.\nRating: [5 of 5 Stars!]'\nSince it's release, Summerland has been translated into French, Catalan and Spanish.\nFor a Q&A on the new edition which talks about the game, check the link below:\nhttps://gmshoe.wordpress.com/2018/02/23/qa-greg-saunders-summerland-2nd-edition/\nThe core of the game is identical, the setting material and 'Fallen leaves' the sandbox campaign, are all as before. There are two main changes...\nFull colour layout, featuring art from the talented Tithi Luadthong. The original game was black and white with treated photos. This version will be packed full of wonderful and evocative art like below in both one page and double page spreads. The game will also feature the beautiful original cover by Paul Bourne of Cubicle 7, modified for the new edition.\n  New Open D6 engine. The original game had a short, very narrative rule set, which these days has proven to be insufficiently robust in play. So it's been replaced by the Open D6 rules based on MiniSix from Anti-Paladin games that I used with my other game Eixlium. The rules for resolving traumas and stress are the same however, as they riff off of die results from actions.\nSample of the layout:\n  The Open D6 game system is extremely versatile, and can be implemented in various degrees of detail for games that are light to heavy in style. Summerland is definitely rules light, but that doesn't mean you couldn't bolt on things you like from the free to download Open D6 rule books. It's a great, simple versatile system, so that's why I use it in my games.\n  There are two main tiers - one for a PDF of Summerland, one for PDF+softcover and one for PDF+hard cover. The books will be formatted to 6\"x9\" dimensions and are expected to clock in at 200 pages. We will be using DriveThruRPG for fulfillment.\nPDF vouchers will be sent out when the project completes for the final product.\nPrint copies will be produced by DriveThruRPG as well, slightly after the final PDF is produced to allow for proofs to be ordered. Backers who back for print copies will receive a discount voucher to receive a print copy of their choice (softback or hardback) at production price, but they will need to pay the production price and the shipping cost.\nThe production price for the softcover book is expected to be approximately $8 or \u00a36, depending on final page count.\nThe production price for the hardcover book is expected to be approximately $30 or \u00a320, depending on final page count. This is the best quality DriveThruRPG can do, with glossy printed pages where the colours really pop, but it does cost a bit to make.\nShipping will depend on your location, estimates for common destinations are given below:\nThere is also a tier to get a PDF or voucher for an at-cost print copy of Exilium, my previous game. It's a science fiction game where you play post-humans kicked out of your higher reality for a crime you committed, desperately trying to find a way back in. Here's a link with reviews and lots of additional supplements:\nhttp://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/215176/Exilium-Core-Rules\nExilium rewards will ship as soon as the Kickstarter ends.\nThere will be stretch goals for this project in the form of PDF mini-supplements, similar to those now available for Exilium. These will feature locations, factions and new rules for Summerland, as well as adventure hooks. Some full-blown adventures will also feature - the list will update as we unlock more goals!\nStretch goals will ship as they are completed, but this should be very close to the same time as the main rule book.\nThanks for looking at my Kickstarter - hopefully you'll decide to join me on this journey!\n    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my second Kickstarter, my first was funded and delivered early, and risks are minimal.

Their binding knowledge is poor and the entities of the Wild Hunt strain against their bonds. The splinter group is holding a hungry tiger by the tail and can only keep the Hunt busy lest it turn on them. They seek out the Investigators and endeavour to strike a devil's bargain; help them end or control the monsters, or see them create a bloodbath the likes the North-East of America has never seen.\nCan the rebel group be trusted?\nCan the Investigators walk away and live with their decision?\nCan the Wild Hunt be controlled? And by whom?\n\nIt is time for you to find out!\nCall of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com.\nThe book will also contain the main adventure written by Tyler Omichinski, NPCs, plans, scenario seeds, and options to expand the Investigators' dealings with the Wild Hunt. Layout will be by Stephanie McAlea, but we'd like to add further art by creators we admire and trust to deliver. This is where the Kickstarter funds come in.\nTaking its inspirational cues from Celtic myth, classic monsters, and H.P. Lovecraft, the book takes a mature look at the horror of Mythos interpretations by historic cultures and will also summarise the tragedy of terrorism, self-determination, and their links to organised crime. There will also be information on how Celtic cultures in Britain and Ireland re-interpret the mythos to fit their cultural narrative and, as the subjects within can be sensitive for many, this book is for mature gamers only. \nThe funds for this Kickstarter will go towards commissioning more art and the hiring more writers and creatives of quality if the book is to expand. The funds will also go on printing and distribution.\nUnlike their characters who face insanity and death, backers can look forward to lovingly produced PDFs, Softcover and Hardcover books, and increased quality and content depending on stretch goals.\nAt the moment, the books are 90 pages and will be perfect bound. They will have a colour cover and greyscale internal pages. Due to stretch goals, these are all subject to change.\nThe entire cost of your books and getting them to you is covered by your pledge.\nThe top tier reward is slightly different. Those who pledge at this level can look forward to Stygian Fox's owner, Stephanie McAlea, running a scenario at the Continuum gaming convention on the 21st of July at Oadby Campus, in Leicester, UK. It will be an abridged version of The Wild Hunt with pre-generated characters.\nAs the book won't be ready for distribution at this point, backers at this level will receive their copies in due course but will also receive copies of some of our previous titles and other goodies as a thank you for backing!\nA Note of Caution\nThe onus is on the backer to attend the convention and they must at least have a day ticket already purchased before pledging. Stygian Fox is not responsible for the backer failing to attend due to illness, act of a deity, or rail strikes. No refunds will be forthcoming for a failure to attend. \nAll convention rules must be adhered to and those not doing so, or flouting 'Wheaton's Law', will be removed from the table (and possibly the convention) immediately and without refund or compensatory gifts from Stygian Fox/Miss McAlea.\nThese rules are strict to protect both Stygian Fox/Miss McAlea but also other players and conventioneers. I'm sure you understand.\nMore information on this most excellent of gaming conventions can be found here: https://continuumconvention.co.uk/\nWith this project, our focus is to produce a beautiful and entertaining book but budget and time constraints may hamper that. With stretch goals and the economy of scale, we hope to furnish the book with better maps, more information and art, and have a premium level of quality in regards to printing and binding. If we're lucky enough to reach the top level we'll pay our writers and artists more for helping us get there. Admittedly, this doesn't benefit our backers but as pay in the RPG industry is seriously low, I'm sure you'll want to help the creatives involved to get a bonus.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with all projects, there is a risk but as the manuscript is mostly complete we think this book has very little risk to it.

They hold up to twenty character sheets that can be turned over like a book due to being kept in place with ultra strong neodymium magnets. They can be removed and changed around. There are trays to store and roll dice, or you can roll them on the main board.\n\nWhen you're finished you put the lid on and everything is carried and stored safely until your next game.\n\nThey're made to set free your role playing games, making them more mobile and reducing setup and takedown time. They free up space on the games table and they even allow games to take place without a table. You can play on the sofa, in a hammock, on the lawn, in bed, around a camp fire. You can keep three in the back of the car to keep the kids occupied during long journeys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe designed the OS Board, it's for philistines, barbarians and the old school elite who only need a pencil, paper and dice to restore order to the realm. It has a lid to help you transport everything and a large A5 (or a Junior Letter pad for US/Can orders). It can be rotated to suit people who are left or right handed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe designed the MN Board, it's more compact, thinner and without a lid it is light enough to dual wield. It's ideal for the games master to keep several at home to lend out when people come over to play. It holds a mobile phone or other small device for using apps or linking over skype. Comes in left and right handed options and features as A7 Pad (This has been modified to 76mm x 76mm to fit yellow stickies or 3inch square pads). Available in left or right handed options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe designed SF Board, it's a techy version that has Tablet and Mobile Phone dock for apps, browsers and skype games as well as a lid. Comes with an A6 (or a 4.25\u201d x 5.5\u201d pad for US/Can orders) pad and available in left and right handed options.\n \n\n\n\nWe designed the GM Board, it does lots, but not only does it do lots but you can customize how you use it so it does lots of what you want it to do. It has everything the others have and then a bit more, most notably 7 white GM Tabs form a GM screen.\nNote: Due to extensive backer feedback the GM Board has been modified. the A5 ring bound pad has been removed. In its place there is a tray for miniatures, a smaller notepad and 4 areas for different coloured post-it notes/stickies. This seems a fairly unanimous upgrade in function. The GM board still features 7 GM Tabs and all are the full height (not different heights as featured on the production prototypes video)\n\n______________________________________________\nSpecification/Details:\nProduction: CNC machined to 0.2mm accuracy by Novacrylics Engineering, my family company run by me and my brother in Warwickshire, England. Magnets: Specially developed Chrome plated Neodymium-Iron-Boron magnets, losing only 1% of their strength per decade. These magnets are safe to use with electronic devices such as laptops, tablets and mobile phones.\n\nBacker Security: Please read my profile and learn about what resources and experience I have behind me\n\nProduct Security: Patent Pending and Registered Design in major world markets.\n\nWood: High quality, sustainable, cavity free, FSC rated Birch Ply\nTablet and Phone Compatibility: Compatible with all known tablets. If you roll a critical fail on your choice of tablet and you got an oval one or something then thats too bad, but we tried nearly 30 different tablets and every one of them sat on it just fine. Phones wider than 70mm don't sit well on the MN and the SF but are fine on the GM.\n\nGM Tabs: The GM tabs acting as a screen on the GM Board are made of cast PMMA with an mirco-etched finish allowing them to be drawn on with a normal pencil (is exactly the same as using a chalk board). Pencil marks can be removed with an eraser. In testing the tabs have been written and erased over 100 times with no effect to function, it is likely they can be used an unlimited number of times. In addition you can write on the tabs with a permanent marker which doesn't come off allowing hitpoint counters which stay in place even if you cross off and erase hitpoint ticks.\n\nPads come with the boards and are available cheaply as refils. Links will be sent at the end of the kickstarter for the cheapest pads sourced.\n\nMN\n3inch Pads, Yellow Stickies or Post it notes (76 x 76mm / 3inch x 3 inch)\n\nOS\nHeadbound A5 plain memo paper pad (UK)\nMemo Pad 5.5\u201d x 8.5\u201d (US)\n\nSF and GM\nHeadbound A6 plain memo paper pad (UK)\nMemo Pad 4.25\u201d x 5.5\u201d (US)\n\n\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPledge Map\u00a31,800 ***Unlocked***\nMN Board pledges fulfilled at reduced RRP cost of \u00a330 (or 4 for \u00a3100)\nOS Board pledges fulfilled at reduced RRP cost of \u00a340 (or 3 for \u00a3100)\nCustom Board pledges fulfilled at \u00a3350 (limited number)\n\n-\n\n\u00a32,000 ***Unlocked***\nThicker felt(Free Upgrade)Used on all of the pledges (unlocked)\n\n-\n\n\u00a32,200 ***Unlocked***\nLatex feet(free upgrade)Added to all of the pledges\n\n-\n\n\u00a32,400 ***Unlocked***\nPapermate Pencil and Eraser(free upgrade)Added to all pledges\n\n-\n\n\u00a32,800 ***Unlocked***\nSF Board pledges fulfilled at reduced RRP cost of \u00a345 (or 3 for \u00a3115)\n\n-\n\n\u00a35,400 ***Unlocked***\nGM Board pledges added and fulfilled at reduced RRP cost of \u00a380\n-\n\nStretch goals added 20th Jan 2018\n-\n\n\u00a36,000 ***Unlocked***\nOS Paper Size Modified for N.American Market(Free Upgrade to US/Canadian orders)The OS modified to fit widely available standard US paper, Junior Letter size pads.

This second upgrade to the dice trays results in a hard wearing easily cleanable surface of charcoal coloured elastomer. Stays much cleaner than felt and is easier to clean with water if it does get dirty. More durable and entirely water proof allowing the die tray to be used as a cup holder too. Rolling is a little bit quieter than on felt and the dice seem to jiggle and bounce around a bit more when rolled as its a slightly springier surface. This goal will be applied to all unlocked CharacTable Boards and all boards.\n-\n\u00a314,000 ***Unlocked*** \n28mm Miniature Case (Paid Upgrade at \u00a315 each) A case that contains chunky foam pieces (not pictured) that can be attached to the velcro strap. Carries up to four 28mm characters or the equivalent. A character, a mount and a familiar/animal companion could be stored in the case for example. This attaches to the velcro strap.\n-\n\u00a316,000 ***Unlocked***\nCarry Case (Paid Upgrade at \u00a330 each) A lid that features a carry handle allowing the CharacTable to be carried like a briefcase. Be aware that this makes the CharacTable around 7.5cm (3in) higher.\n-\n\u00a319,000 ***Unlocked***\nMagnetic Side Tab (Free Upgrade) A white bar clamps character sheets to the main board and replaces the two button magnets. This allows for easier turnover of pages and prevents the individual magnets from being lost. It is made from the same material as the GM tabs and so allows a small area alongside the sheet for short term tracking of hitpoints, spells, temporary modifiers to saves/weapons etc. This can all be done alongside the character sheet next to the relevant stat/weapon/character instead of repeatedly writing on and erasing the character sheet. This goal will be applied to all CharacTables past and future.\n-\n\n\u00a320,000 ***unlocked***\nHandle + 100mm (4in) Velcro (TM) Strap (Paid Upgrade at \u00a314) A specially made 25mm birch ply handle on a 100mm velcro strap. Holds the Miniature case and many rule books.\n-\n\u00a322,000 ***Unlocked***\nCabinet Finish (Paid Upgrade) Two coats of high quality semi-mat spray varnish to seal and protect\n-\n\u00a324,000 ***Unlocked***\nFully Covered lid (Free Upgrade) All CharacTable boards that currently have lids are upgraded to feature a lid that covers the full surface of the CharacTable. This goal will be applied to all CharacTable orders past and future. We have had a lot of requests for this one, the reason this is so late in the pledge tree is because it requires much more wood, and stronger (more expensive) magnets to hold the bigger lid securely in place.\n-\n\n\u00a326,000\nMobile/Tablet Charger conduit (Free Upgrade)\nA hole and modified board for the mobile phone charger cable to run to the phone and tablet docks allowing them to be used in portrait orientation while being charged (seen on the production prototypes video)\n\n-\n\n\u00a328,000\nAcrylic Lids (Paid Upgrade).\nA variety of coloured and clear acrylic lids.

Each game is set in a unique part of a desolate world, with strange characters passing the time until the Black Monk visits.\nIn between these visits, the character's lives are interrupted by sometimes trivial and other times confusing events. Everything seems to fit together like an elongated jigsaw puzzle, but no one can see the starter pieces stretching across the horizon.\nBut they don\u2019t complain. There is always more work. The village needs workers.\nThen one evening, the sun stayed in the sky all day. When there should have been night, the sun remained. And now it feels as though it\u2019s been years since the Black Monk came. But perhaps it was yesterday. Nothing is right\u2026\nIs that blood?\nThe first Black Monk game was written a year ago and is available online. For completion's sake, it is available through this kickstarter as well.\n  In The Black Monk, Sunrise End the characters live in a desolate, but vibrant world where time seems to have lost meaning. Living for decades, perhaps longer, in isolation from others, the people of Gallow\u2019s Dawn toil in work, visited often by a mysterious and powerful figure known as the Black Monk.\nWhenever the Black Monk visits, the sun disappears and night falls over the village. Whenever the Black Monk leaves, the sun reappears and hangs in the sky for days on end. While the sun is still there, there is work to be done. And when the sun disappears, the people of Gallow\u2019s Dawn can rest.\nBut the people of Gallow\u2019s Dawn want neither work, nor rest. They want an end to this seemingly meaningless cycle of tedium and punishment. The Black Monk is neither wicked, nor fair. He just is. A thing that predates the valley. A thing that predates reason.\nIs that the sun returning?\n  People can come and go as they please, but why would they want to. Thornwood is paradise. Granted, the Thornwood Beast haunts the forest just outside the village. But if you avoid the forest, you\u2019re fine. No harm can come to those who just do their work and enjoy the fruits of eternity.\nBut stories have began that a figure known as the Black Monk has been traveling the countryside. Sometimes his visits bring sickness. Other times redemption. No one has ever heard of him before, so these are obviously rumors. Who would dare interrupt paradise?\nWhy is the sun fading?\n  In The Black Monk, Oubliette the characters live inside a dark monastery that\u2019s been turned into a self-made prison. It\u2019s name is Absalom, home to roughly 100 people, all living in fear of the outside world.\nThe outside world. Desolate. A place where time has lost all meaning. A place where a host of unimaginable monsters dwell, including the undying Black Monk. A vile man bent on keeping the inhabitants of Absalom alive just long enough to drive them insane.\nWhenever the Black Monk visits, the sun disappears and night falls over the valley. The people retreat to the monastery. Whenever the Black Monk leaves, the sun reappears and hangs in the sky for days on end. For hours after, the residents remain, fearing a surprise return of the Black Monk.\nInside, the hours drag on. Endlessly. It\u2019s cold. Is this eternity? Or damnation?\nHow are there shadows inside the darkness?\n  It\u2019s been ages since the Black Monk visited and the people of Witherfall  built a tower in preparation for his return. They no longer fear his reprisals and sudden turns of mood. They have readied themselves.\nThere will be no more suffering.\nThe sun is fading now. The torches are lit, the boiling oil and defensive machinery are ready. It\u2019s only a matter of time before the Black Monk is finally sundered and returned to the ether.\nIs that an army of shadows he brings with him? Or just more damned?\n  Black Monk, and all its extensions, utilize an innovative game system called Praxis.\nPraxis is GMless gaming at its best, offering player motivations, and broad outlines that allow you to take a deep dive into the characters without distracting, overt maneuvering.\nEverything is character driven. You and your fellow gamers, are characters inside the story and authors outside the story. You create scenes based on your individual character wants and needs. If you succeed at a milestone, you move forward in the story along one path. If you fail, your side effects (trepidation) open story pathways in another direction.\nEverything you need for your specific character is on a character sheet like this one.\nEach player receives a unique character sheet to build their characters. Each sheet provides world building questions, character motivations, relationships with others, names, quirks, abilities, and so on. It acts as a guide encouraging players to fully flesh out the \u201cworld\u201d their characters inhabit and since no two sheets are the same and much of the play centers on how your character interacts with the others in the game, it virtually guarantees that no two gaming experiences are the same. Ever.\nBlack Monk is 96 pages long, complete with all the rules, advice, and character sheets needed to play.\nThis project is 99% complete, with the exception of game 6 and the omnibus. Within a month of the project funding, I hit the print book button and ship your game. Don't expect any long-winded updates about the project being delayed. Because it's done. The day the project ends, I hit send and your book gets printed and shipped.\n(Or we can exchange the hostage in a parking lot, somewhere.)\nYou are buying a finished game. A progressive step in GMless games. A project that I'm really proud of.\nI love playing these games.\n  At $1000, all five games fund and I send out PDFs and books to all the backers. However, if we get further along, the following additional character (and stretch goals) are given to backers for free based on their pledge level.\nEach game already comes with six characters.\nThe Homunculus from book 2 and the Green Manalishi from book 3.\nThe Red Pope from book 4 and the Rat Fiend from book 5.\nThe Doomfairy from book 2 and the Thornwood Beast from book 3.\nThe Chimeric Gargouille from book 4 and the Rat King from book 5.\n  The Embalmer from book 2 and the Dryad from book 3.\n The Sexton from book 4 and the Golem from book 5\nThis is the big stretch goal. At this level, I release a 6th game in the series, along with both of it's advanced character classes: the Cyclops and the Lord of Locusts. No details about this game are being revealed at this time. I will reveal the game title when we reach this level.\nI also make quick-reference scene cards available with all the scene types defined in handy cards that you can place on the table for players. More on this later.\n  The TBN from book 2 and the Judas Lantern from book 3\nThe Bailiff from book 4 and the Sculptor from book 5\nI create and offer the Black Monk omnibus: all six games in one book. Backers have the option of getting a hardcover version that would never be available once the kickstarter concludes.\nTwo additional free characters for use in ANY black monk game. TBD.\nCharacter compendium created, which I think is essentially what people wanted from the omnibus. All 40+ characters in one PDF package. Free to backers of $33 or more. A book of characters will also be created, but not for free. More on this in the coming months.\nSeriously, if we make it this far, I'll have to do something amazingly cool. Maybe a 7th black monk game. Yes.

Whether you like challenge-based play in a Tom Clancian technothriller or the futuristic hijinks of Mission Impossible, Operators has you covered. \n  The core mechanic revolves around rolling four Fate Dice. Players look for pluses in order to succeed and the Game Master looks for minuses that mean the task becomes unexpectedly complicated. \nOperators also uses a deck of cards to help narrate fight scenes and chase scenes. The Fight Cards all have unique illustrations and moves taken from various martial arts, but mostly those seen in the Bourne movies. These cards, along with rolling the dice to see which moves land, are turned away, or are countered, make it easy to narrate a kinetic fight scene. Chase cards work similarly, except instead of having fighting moves on them, they have the ways the person in the lead tries to get away.\nYou can find a free quickstart of the game and all the mechanics in depth right here. along with some additional player aides for the Game Master (called Director in Operators) and some mock-up character sheets with a loose scenario to play through if you and you group want to get it to the table to see how she runs.\nClick to download the free Quickstart - still a work in progress\n \nThe book is going to be graphic novel size, softcover, full colour, and around 200 pages.\nThe Cards will be a deck of 52 cards in total and will be regular playing card size (2.5 x 3.5\"). 19 of them are used for Chase Scenes, 33 are used for Fight Scenes. One of the main goals of the kickstarter is going to be increasing the size of that deck. I'm hoping to add quite a bit more. In the quickstart above you can check out what the cards I already have look like.\nCards Mock-Up (Not Final)\nIn addition, these cards can be used with all kinds of other games, like Night's Black Agents, Delta Green, or any other game where you want to narrate out a brutal martial arts sequence between opponents.\nI also want to be able to hire a professional to do photo manipulation and photo realistic art throughout the book. It's a big challenge since it's not a style that is commonly seen in RPGs and I'd really like to do it right.\nIf you know any of my other projects, you know it pays to back my stuff on kickstarter. You'll get it first, and you'll get it cheaper. No sales a couple months after the product's release, no selling at conventions like Gen Con before you've got it. You'll get a discount off the MSRP, as seen in the reward tiers, and you have my guarantee no one will get it cheaper than you for at the very least a year. I value each and every backer and know that I would not be able to publish games without you.

I will be using the same printer in South Korea, the same fulfillment services (The Dice Latte and Indie Press Revolution). We've also got much of the same team in place for art and editing.\n\nInternational backers (anyone outside of the U.S.) will receive their packages from Korea, from the Dice Latte game cafe in Seoul. Anyone in the U.S. will be receiving their packages from Indie Press Revolution and I have every confidence in both of them. We had some issues shipping stuff on Chinese New Year the first time we did fulfillment in Korea, so we've learned our lesson there and will be avoiding that time.\n\nI've found that most delays tend to stem from art and coordinating the schedule of getting the art and layout schedule right. While I can't be certain that artists will deliver on time, I've reduced this risk considerably by purchasing a great deal of it, the cards in particular, up front to off set any issues getting it out the door.\n\nThat said, since this project is essentially two-in-one, with the cards and the book together, I decided to leave myself a bit of leeway space for delivery. That said, the cards should be ready pretty quick, and well before the book as all that needs to be done there is ordering additional arts for the cards and then dropping them into the already-done templates we have.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 10 or more", "title": "Digital Card Shark", "descp": "You get the Fight and Chase cards in their digital formats.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2018"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 15 or more", "title": "Digital Shooter", "descp": "You get a digital copy of the Operators core book.\nINCLUDES:\nOperators Core Book PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}], "stat": ["7 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 20 or more", "title": "Card Shark", "descp": "You get a physical deck of Fight and Chase cards as well as their digital formats.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase)\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Mar 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 25 or more", "title": "Digital Operator", "descp": "You get the Fight and Chase cards as well as the Operators core book in digital formats.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase) PDF\nOperators Core Book PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}], "stat": ["33 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 35 or more", "title": "Shooter", "descp": "You get a physical copy of the Operators core book as well as the digital PDF.\nINCLUDES:\nOperators Core Book\nOperators Core Book PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 35 or more", "title": "Ace", "descp": "You get a physical copy of the cards and a digital PDF of the Operators core book.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase)\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase) PDF\nOperators Core Book PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["16 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 45 or more", "title": "Agent", "descp": "You get a physical copy of the Operators core rulebook and digital copies of both the core book and the cards.\nINCLUDES:\nOperators Core Book\nOperators Core Book PDF\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["4 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 55 or more", "title": "Operator", "descp": "You get both physical and digital copies of the Operators core rulebook and the Fight and Chase cards.\nINCLUDES:\nOperators Core Book\nOperators Core Book PDF\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase)\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["75 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge CA$ 50 or more", "title": "Zero Dark Thirty", "descp": "You get both physical and digital copies of the Operators core rulebook and the Fight and Chase Cards.\nINCLUDES:\nOperators Core Book\nOperators Core Book PDF\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase)\nThe Cards (Fight and Chase) PDF", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2018"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["Reward no longer available", "30 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #8", "update_userinfo": "Operators PDFs Away!", "update_content": "Hello everyone,"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #7", "update_userinfo": "Card Update", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\nJust wanted to post a quick update to show off what the final cards will be like.

If you're a fan of Stranger Things, The X-Files, Kolchak: The Night Stalker, Firestarter, Fringe and other horror stories and shows like I am, you'll be very comfortable playing in the world of Don't Look Back.\nI developed Don\u2019t Look Back (DLB) in the early '90s and published two editions of the rulebook and an alien abduction/government coverup supplement called Giant Psychic Insects From Outer Space. We put in a lot of work and it paid off with really good press and some great reviews.\nDLB has been out of print for a while, but I'm proud of the fact that I still hear from people who covet their copies of the rulebook. The resurgence of paranormal horror on TV and at the movies, coupled with conspiracy theories on every news channel, makes this feel like a perfect time to bring DLB back. This is not just a reprint \u2013 I want to bring out a revised and expanded full-color version of the game with new art and improved gameplay, but I need your help.\nBy backing this project, you will help support revising and expanding the game with new material, as well as updating the look and feel with new art and graphic design. You can also help shape the direction by providing feedback during and after the campaign. Backers can receive an exclusive Kickstarter Edition of the game, featuring material that will not be in the retail version. I am removing as many barriers as possible to get these games in people's hands. Backers of this Kickstarter edition receive free shipping anywhere in the world, and the Kickstarter prices are at a considerable discount. When the retail versions of the new edition are released they will be considerably more expensive. Everybody who has backed the project by Halloween will get a special treat -- a PDF Quick Start Version of DLB and a scenario you can play with your friends.\nAll backers at the PDF and print levels will receive all extras added through stretch goals. The paperback and hardcover versions of the Kickstarter editions will include a PDF copy through DriveThruRPG, and will receive a numbered bookplate hand autographed by myself and Lester Smith creator of the D6xD6 rules.\n  DLB is set in a dark modern world where government laboratories experiment on helpless citizens, aliens plot the downfall of humanity, powerful organizations go to extremes to cover up the truth, and you never know who you can trust. Nothing is what it appears. Truth is dictated by the media, and history is rewritten by the bureaucracy.\nPlayers take the roles of characters who see through the veil of secrets. They could be anything from kids investigating strange lights in the woods, to detectives trying to solve a string of ritualistic murders, to the subjects of mind-altering experiments who escaped from a government lab and are now running for their lives, or even running from the zombie apocalypse. Maybe they are part of a clandestine government agency that investigates the paranormal or maybe they help cover it up. \nDLB easily accommodates any modern supernatural and paranormal horror scenario. I like to deviate from the standard tropes to keep it interesting. Seriously, where else are you going to find Giant Psychic Insects From Outer Space and enormous, lactose-intolerant, flesh-eating amoebas?\nWhat even long-time fans don\u2019t know is that the conspiracy was always intended to extend beyond time, space, and realities. Are the puppet masters of Earth merely puppets themselves? With the promise of other dimensions and alien worlds, the adventure possibilities are limitless.\nI am rewriting Don\u2019t Look Back to utilize the core D6xD6 rule system, with a few tweaks. The original DLB game mechanics were fast and easy, but they were also isolated. Making the easy shift to the D6xD6 mechanics helps players create characters in 5 minutes or less, and helps the Guide (Game Master) resolve game actions with fewer dice rolls. People who have played DLB before will have no problem making the shift. You can be up and running with minimal preparation, making it an ideal game for fast one-off adventures and convention play even with people who have never played DLB or other RPGs before.\nThe other reason I chose to use the D6xD6 rules as the base rules is so players can access scenarios and settings that already use the same rules. So far, more than 30 settings written to work with the D6xD6 rules have already been published and there is an existing D6xD6 community that DLB players can join. I am excited that Lester Smith -- Origins award-winning designer, and creator of the D6xD6 system has agreed to have DLB become the first standalone RPG using his system. D6xD6 gamers can also immediately pick up the DLB rulebook and use elements from it in their own games.\n  All stretch goals include the addition of adventures, chapters, and other material to supplement the core DLB Kickstarter books. All backers slated to receive a PDF, softcover, or hardcover copy of the rulebook will receive all stretch goal benefits! Please tell your friends! The more support we have, the more material you will receive!\nUPDATED STRETCH GOALS -- The backers were so supportive we added a stretch goal to reach the funding goal in the first week and they did it! I am so excited so I added a new $5,000 stretch goal and Lester is so excited about writing his adventure we reduced the threshold for it to $7,500.\n  At the request of a number of backers, we are adding some nostalgia in the form of PDF copies of the previous editions of the rule-book and the supplement Giant Psychic Insects From Outer Space. These have never been available before as PDFs. Anyone who is backing the project at the $12 level or higher is eligible to add on copies of these classics for $5 each or $12 for all three.\nTo receive one or more of these classics, add the appropriate amount to your pledge. I will contact backers to ask which PDF(s) they would like after the Kickstart ends. These PDFs will be delivered at the same time or earlier than the new edition of Don't Look Back. Please note, these will be high quality scanned copies of the old books. The original files are not accessible to create new PDFs.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my first Kickstarter, so I have read as much as I can about doing an effective campaign, and I have spoken to friends and received feedback about the way I planned to do this one. Still, I'm sure I have much to learn. Please let me know how I'm doing in terms of setting up the campaign and communicating with you as a backer.\n\nI created the DLB game and wrote both previous editions of the rulebook as well as handled art direction, layout, and graphic design, so I know I have the background and skills to create the new edition. I have already rewritten significant sections of the rulebook.\n\nMigrating to the D6xD6 rule system will be a new challenge. I spent a significant amount of time on the D6xD6 system, and have spoken at length with the developer to be sure I understand all the nuances as well as what kinds of tweaks will be needed to reflect the essence of DLB. Happily, Lester is a big fan of DLB and has agreed to review those adjustments.\n\nAnother challenge is updating the look and feel while keeping a style that matches the mood of the original game. The shift to full-color provides an amazing number of stylistic choices to be considered. I am already sketching out some possible options, and I have started getting referrals for good artists.\n\nProduction is always a challenge. But, I already know where I will have the books printed, and I have experience with this company and their technical requirements. Popcorn Press will be publishing DLB after the Kickstarter and they have been very gracious in terms of advice and smoothing the way to prepare for getting the PDF copies out. Still, this is not my first rodeo and I know all too well that there are always unforeseen issues, so I padded the delivery date by a couple months just to be sure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "You Want to Believe", "descp": "Thank you for your support!

We inter their bodies in the ground in expensive caskets, or entomb them in ornate stone monuments, or burn them and keep their ashes in urns. We remind ourselves, in this way, that death comes for all of us, but that even in death we are due respect. \nHow horrifying, then, when the dead won't stay contained. \nArt by Alessandro Alaia\n  In Undead, we examine the creatures of the Unknown that animate the bodies of the dead. These creatures aren't the mindless, hungry, infectious zombies of cinema. They are the spurned and jilted lovers who come back from the grave seeking a mouldering kiss. They are the wronged dead, the unhallowed dead, murdered and shoved into shallow graves or buried without ceremony and longing for the respect they are due. They are the innocent dead, killed before their time and wanting only to taste the life they never really knew. \nPity them if you wish, but put them down quick and hard. They are vicious and violent, and all them want to take company back to the grave with them. \nUndead is a 120-page, full-color antagonist sourcebook for Chill 3rd Edition. Like Monsters, our preceding release, it is partially written \"in character\" by a SAVE researcher attempting to categorize and understand the living dead, and partially written for players and Chill Masters to allow them make full use of this horrifying class of creatures. \nUndead includes:\nFurther insight into the history and workings of SAVE (the Eternal Society of the Silver way, dedicated to investigating and combatting the Unknown)\n10 (or more!) new undead creatures, including the grotesque penangallen and the fearsome lich\nAn in-depth look at how different undead creatures come to be, including discussion of the role these beings occupy in different cultures\nNew pregenerated characters to be use as support or as PCs\nA new campaign-length case written by Morgan A. McLaughlin McFarland, one of the contributors to all of the Chill 3rd Ed line\nA brand-new comic by Leonard O'Grady\nNew Edges & Drawbacks\nArt from SAVE: The Eternal Society by Alessandro Alaia\n   If you missed our previous Kickstarters - welcome! Chill 3rd Edition was funded on Kickstarter in November 2014, and fulfilled in August/September 2015.\nIn November of 2015, we successfully funded our first sourcebook, SAVE: The Eternal Society, on Kickstarter. The pdf was released to backers in May 2016, and the book was shipped to backers starting in August 2016. In October of 2016, we funded Monsters, which was released in PDF in May 2017 and in softcover in August 2017. \nYou can see a brief explanation of the game and how the core system works here, and purchase previously released Chill products here.\n  The undead return for a variety of reasons, and all of them are terrifying. SAVE has to contend with these rotting horrors, as well as the vampires, ghosts, werewolves, and just flat-out monsters that also come slinking out of the Unknown. And we'd like your help in identifying these creatures. \nFor every 100 backers of Undead, we'll create a new case for free download on our site. The cases will be approximately 5000 words, and be written in the style of our other free cases (which you can download here, right now!).\nBut we need your help in finding these cases! So as the Kickstarter campaign progresses, we'd like you, the backers, to supply photographs of the places in your area where monsters lurk.\nTake pictures of weird and creepy things, places, and situations that you encounter, and put them up on Facebook, Twitter (just tag @GrowlingDoor) or G+. Hashtag them #SAVEisonyourside, and we'll find them more easily. Our case writers will use these photographs as inspirations for the cases.\nHere's an example!\nTHESE CAME OUT OF NOWHERE. THEY STING. #SAVEisonyourside\n  You might notice that we haven't included reward levels that allow any combination of Chill Third Edition products; that's just because we already have a bunch of different levels and we didn't want to confuse things too much. That said, we definitely want to make the Chill products you want available to you!\nAs such, if you want to add products to your pledge, you can! All of our products will be available through BackerKit, but if you want to pledge now (which would be fine with me, since it gets us closer to goal!), the amounts are below:\nChill Master Screen: Add $10 to your pledge \nChill Third Edition Hardcover: Add $50 to your pledge \nSAVE: The Eternal Society Softcover: Add $30 to your pledge \nLimited Edition Boxed Set: Add $75 to your pledge \nMonsters Softcover: Add $25 to your pledge \nIf you pledge for items that are already available and you want them immediately following the Kickstarter (say, you want to get your Chill hardcover now and just get Undead when it's printed), you can do that, you'll just wind up paying a little more in shipping. I'll be in touch with instructions on that after the Kickstarter ends.\n Looking at the rewards, you may notice that we're not charging for shipping during the Kickstarter. This is because any money that comes through the Kickstarter is subject to fees, and we'd rather charge what shipping will actually cost rather than mark it up to compensate for those fees. We will charging shipping through BackerKit when the books are ready to ship.\n If you look at the reward levels, you'll notice four Regional Coordinator levels: Indianapolis, Toronto, Milwaukee, and Columbus. I've used those cities because I know I'm going to be there (for various conventions), but let's say you aren't going to go to any of those cons, but really want to take advantage of the fantastic deal that the reward level gets you? (In brief: $650 gets you five copies of Chill, five copies of Undead, custom artwork for up to five players' characters, and a custom scenario written and run for you by me.)\nI'm happy to add a new reward level for Regional Coordinator: Wherever. Just drop me a line and we'll discuss it. This is all contingent on you living somewhere I can get to, but as any SAVE envoy knows, nothing is impossible.\n(Backers of our previous Kickstarters might also note that I've raised the price on these. Why? Short answer: Everything is more expensive, including travel and art, and I need to keep up my margins.)\n Valid question! Here's where your money goes:\nPaying artists. You can see some of the artwork from Chill on this page, and we'll be hiring these artists again to help bring the dead to life. \nPaying for layout. Enter Thomas Deeny, the same wizard who laid out all of the books in the Chill line, and who is going to make Undead magnificent. \nPaying the editor. Normally, Growling Door Games co-owner Michelle Lyons-McFarland edits our books, but she's finishing her dissertation (though she is also contributing to Undead as an author). Therefore, we need to allocate some funds to paying an editor. \nPaying for materials. Books cost money. Part of the money raised with this Kickstarter will go toward a print run, both to fulfill the rewards for backers and to send to retailers. \nPaying for the license. Growling Door doesn't own the Chill IP, and part of the funds from this Kickstarter are going to satisfy our contract with Martin Caron.\nPDFs will be delivered as soon as they're ready (typically in late April/early May) and that part of fulfillment will be handled by DriveThruRPG. \n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is my standard \"Risks & Challenges\" spiel, so it'll look familiar if you backed our other projects.\n\nAny Kickstarted project carries a risk, one that I like to call \"the flammable cat.\" When I worked for White Wolf Game Studio as the developer for the Dark Ages line, we would occasionally say, when a book was delayed, that somewhere along the way a cat caught fire.\n\nObviously, no actual felines were ever combusted (not to my knowledge, anyway!), but the point was that with an endeavor like an RPG book, any number of things can go wrong. They're not anyone's fault - people get sick, have car accidents, relatives pass away, babies are born, and so forth - but they do slow things down. The trick to keeping things on track isn't to safeguard against the flammable cat. That cat is GOING to catch fire at some point.\n\nNo, the best plan is to have a fire extinguisher handy. To break the metaphor, what I mean by all this is that I'm sure something's going to go wrong or get delayed. As such, I've built a lot of extra time into the schedule. The text for Undead isn't finished as of this writing, but the authors have turned in first drafts and I'm in the process of getting them back for revisions. I have no doubt it'll all be done before it needs to go to press.\n\nWe don't have all of the art contracted yet, but I have a number of artists lined up to work on the book, I know how fast they work, and we'll have plenty of time work with them even if something does go wrong in the interim.\n\nIt's also worth noting that we've licensed Chill from Martin Caron, and as with any licensed property we'll have a round of approvals. The terms of our contract, however, state that approvals have to be conducted in a timely manner, and I know from my interactions with Martin that he's just as keen to see this project realized as I am.\n\nI don't anticipate everything going smooth, because as a certain space captain once said, it never goes smooth. I do anticipate that my team of professionals - writers, editors, layout folks, designers - can handle whatever cats catch fire. Growling Door Games has already delivered four products funded through Kickstarter, and I hope that you will join us for this one!\n\nOne other thing: Backers will receive the pdf of Undead before it goes on sale (I've labeled delivery for the pdf as \"August 2018\" for consistency's sake, but the truth of the matter is that we'll need it done in April if we're going to have it printed on time). The plan is to have the books shipped before GenCon 2018. However, if something gets delayed, we reserve the right to sell the game at GenCon. It's not economically feasible for us to turn down the opportunity to debut Monsters at GenCon, even if the books haven't shipped to backers. We can promise that the game will not go into distribution until the books have shipped.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "SAVE Contact", "descp": "Every little bit helps!

The book contains a series of five or more adventures set in the Hockomock swamp in Massachusetts to be used with 7th edition Call of Cthulhu RPG.\nThis product is produced under license from Chaosium Inc. (www.chaosium.com). Call of Cthulhu is the Registered Trademark of Chaosium Inc., and is used with their permission. www.chaosium.com\nThe Devil's Swamp includes adventures that can usually be run in one or two evenings. They can be run as independent one-off adventures or strung together as a mini-campaign using the same characters. All of the stories are set in the Hockomock which literally means 'the place where spirits live.'\nAs a member of the Bridgwater Preservation Society, you and your friends investigate the stories people plague the city and area with. The stories the police won't investigate, or quit on way too easily. Living next to the Hockomock, at the heart of what will later become known as the Bridgewater Triangle, gives you easy access to delve into any of the stories that arise. \nThe Hockomock Swamp, named the Devil's Swamp by the original English settlers, is a known site for paranormal activity. Everything from Bigfoot, aliens, thunder birds, huge snakes, strange lights, Puckwudgies, Native American curses, cultists, mutilated animals and more have been reported in the area. So join me and my team as we help unravel the Mythos tied to the mysteries of the Hockomock.\nThe Devil's Swamp is written by Ben Burns, features the artwork of Evgeny Maloshenkov, the cartography of Bryan McWhirter, player handouts by Elizabeth Bakowski and edited by Alex Burns. In other words the entire team that produced The Star on the Shore. We are the same company, just a change of name.\nJoin us in completing this great adventure book, so that we can share it with the world. Please back our Kickstarter today to help make these adventures a reality.\nThe funds will go toward the artwork already commissioned, extra adventures by guest writer(s), allow for more artwork, commissioning of the cartography for the maps, the editing, printing and shipping.\nStretch Goals\n$5,000: We successfully funded!! (UNLOCKED)\n$10,000: Add in a 6th Adventure by Brian Courtemanche (UNLOCKED)\n$15,000: Add in professional Cartography (UNLOCKED)\n500 Backers: Add in a 7th Adventure by Christopher Smith Adair (UNLOCKED)\n$20,000: Upgrade Player Handouts to be Photorealistic (UNLOCKED)\n$25,000: Add in a 8th Adventure by a guest writer\n$30,000: Add in a fold out removable Player Map\n$35,000: Add in a 9th Adventure\n$40,000: ???\nRewards\nADD ONs\nYou will have the opportunity to include Add Ons after the campaign is complete including purchasing extra copies, prints, the Art Book, Insanity Dice, and copies of The Star on the Shore.\nOur Artist\nWe are always asked who does our art work. Evgeny Maloshenkov was the main artist for The Star on the Shore and will be doing 90% of the art work in Devil's Swamp. He is a professional artist from Ukraine. He now lives in Kiev working for Frogwares doing software CGI art. He still freelances commission work for several companies including Chaosium as well as New Comet Games. You can see more of his work at his portfolio site here: emaloshenkov.carbonmade.com\nPage Count\nWhile we will not guarantee any minimum page count, the first 5 adventures are almost finished, and the book is currently around 60-70 pages. The more people pledge, the more adventures we will add in and the longer the book will be. If we hit the stretch goal for 6 adventures, it will probably be 70-85 pages. If we hit the stretch goal for 7 adventures It will expand to be 85-100 pages. If we hit the stretch goal for 8 adventures, it will expand to be 100-120 pages. If we get all the way to 9 adventure modules, we could push this well over 130 pages!\nThe delivery time for the books includes the anticipation of the extra adventures.\nGuest Writers\nOur first guest writer is Brian Courtemanche. He will be joining our team at the $10,000 stretch goal level. He wrote one of the adventures in the award winning 'Doors To Darkness' book produced by Chaosium. In addition, Brian has been in Arkham Now; Terrors From Beyond; House of R'lyeh; Atomic Age Cthulhu; and More Adventures in Arkham Country for the Miskatonic River Press.\nOur $20,000 stretch goal level will open up the 7th Adventure. This author worked with Brian on the award winning 'Doors to Darkness' book, Christopher Smith Adair.  https://csmithadair.com/  His works include A Cold Fire Within, Atomic Age Cthulhu, New Tales of the Miskatonic Valley, Strange Aeons II, and articles in the Arkham Gazette.\nOur $30,000 and $40,000 stretch goal scenario authors will remain under wraps until we draw closer.\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere is almost no risk at all unless we sell a million or more copies, then there might be some delay in shipping, but I am willing to take on that challenge. Otherwise I do not see any real chance for any delays barring real life tragedy, or perhaps the stars aligning and Cthulhu rising. \n\nThe adventures are almost finished. The initial art is complete and the artist, Evgeny, is standing by ready to draw any stretch goal art. Our cartographer, Bryan, is ready to start on the maps as soon as we fund. We are working with the same printer that created the beautiful copies of the Star on the Shore.\n\nI have published 6 other modules before this one, including The Star on the Shore, so I am very familiar with the process, and do not expect any surprises. I have also run 8 successful Kickstarters before this one. All have been successful and either delivered on time or are currently on schedule.

You and your crew adventure across a vast, cowboy-themed, steampunk world simply known as \"The West.\" You're looking for whatever work you can find--bounty hunting, smuggling contraband, running guns...maybe even a little train robbery if yer so inclined. 'Bout anything to pay the bills, keep the guns loaded, the boiler stoked, and keep your ship in the sky!\nMeet our story's hero in the cinematic trailer below!\nPlatforms: PC, Mac, Linux\nDistribution: Steam and DRM free\nGenre: Strategic, turn-based CRPG\nExpected Retail Price: $20\nEngine: Unity\nThis Page in Japanese\n  Home.\nYour home is a rusty, rickety, steam-powered airship. She's seen better days, but she\u2019s a tough old bird. Constructed over half a century ago, she was originally built as an unarmed cargo ship. She hauled loads of munitions and coal to the front lines of the Great Iron War. Since then, the old girl's been modified and renovated many times. Her hull's been reinforced, sensors upgraded, and the ship has been retrofitted with heavy weaponry. Home sweet home!\nWhen trouble comes, you'll battle enemy airships using a deeply strategic, turn-based combat system. Far from a button masher, AOG will require careful thought to achieve each victory. A heavy cannon might do well against a slow moving, heavily armored enemy, but perhaps a long-gun will be more effective when gunning down a more agile opponent. A machine gun might be powerful at first, but as the barrel overheats it's effectiveness will diminish. With clever strategy, a weaker ship can typically bring down a much stronger foe.\nmillions of possibilities!\n'Course it wouldn't be an RPG without all that sweet, sweet loot! Your ship is fully customizable--every last component can be upgraded. Build a flame spewing flying tank or a nimble sharpshooter--there are literally millions of potential player ship configurations!\nWeapons galore!\n  You can buy better machinery from one of The West's many shops and dealers, or you might be able to salvage better parts from the wreckage of a vanquished enemy's ship. As you improve your airship you\u2019ll be able to take on bigger and more powerful foes and, in so doing, spread your fame across The West!\n'Course a ship's more than just guns and iron, she's home to your crew. As your journey unfolds, you'll get to know them better and learn their individual stories. As you progress, you'll be able to upgrade your crew and gain access to new and interesting abilities.\n  a massive world to explore!\nWith over 50 unique and compelling towns to discover, The West is a great, wide, and varied world. Railroad tracks crisscross the landscape. Mines, forts, and trading posts dot the countryside. Your journey will take you through cactus covered deserts, red rock canyons, tropical sandy beaches, and the harsh forests of the northern mountain chains.  There's untold riches to be found, and danger lurks behind every cloud.\ntravel from town to town via the game's overworld\nThe West is divided by different factions--each has its own culture, background, and interests. The factions don't typically get along too well, playin' nice ain't exactly their forte. War is looming, liable to break out at any moment. Armies are gathering and massive navies of armored airships are being constructed with great haste. The fate of The West is about to be decided!\nThe West has deep lore. We've written centuries worth of rich history to flesh out the world, to make it feel real and lived in. As you explore The West, you'll uncover ancient mysteries time has forgotten. Hidden secrets lay ready to be unearthed, and lost treasures wait to be found.\nInteresting folk of every variety work, live, and die here. Brave patriots, vile traitors, bandits, lawmen, ranchers, inventors, prospectors, fur traders, and adventurers of every caliber all call The West home.  At each town you'll meet an assortment of colorful characters.  A few might have a job to offer or cargo for you to haul. Others might be fixin' to just shoot you where you stand.\nVideo games can tell stories with a sense of depth and immersion that no other medium can approach. At its core, AOG is about the people you meet, what story they have to tell, and how you choose to interact with them.  Every conversation matters and determines how your Wild West adventure will unfold.\nThink of your favorite video game. Now stop for a second and think of the music. Chances are it was awesome.  Music is the soul of any good game. We might not always consciously realize it but a solid musical score adds a huge amount of tone, emotion, and depth to a video game.\nThis game will need music that can bring its vast and colorful world alive.  Age of Grit will feature an original orchestral score. A core soundtrack is already complete, though with your help we'd like to expand the soundtrack to include more tracks. \nAge of Grit OST - Sample 1\nAge of Grit OST - Sample 2\n Age of Grit OST - Sample 3\nAge of Grit OST - Sample 4\n    Howdy!  My name is Andy Morrison.  I live with my wonderful wife and beautiful daughter in sunny Phoenix, Arizona.  Me and a few talented friends comprise a small indie studio called IQ Soup.  Right now I'm the only full time member of the team, everyone else is currently working as part-time contractors.\nour little family\nI've been playing and loving games ever since my family got \"Super Mario + Duck Hunt\" for the NES.  Making games for a living has always been my dream as long as I can remember.  I can vividly recall playing Dino Park Tycoon as a young child and dreaming of one day making a game that was just as cool--except the T-Rex wouldn't immediately escape despite all the countless electrified concrete walls you built!\nthe good old days\nWe previously held a crowdfunding campaign here on Kickstarter and were overwhelmed with the support we received from the community!  We were incredibly grateful to raise over $15,000. Just as importantly: to receive so much support really gave us the confidence to continue with our vision for AOG.\nWith the money we raised we've done a lot and now have built a working prototype of the game. Most of the art assets are complete and all of the game's major systems are functioning. However it has become clear that in order to make AOG the polished experience it deserves to be--and do so in a timely matter--we will need further funding.  We've discussed this with our original backers and the feedback we received was extremely supportive.\nOne way or another this game is going to get finished, but with additional funding our team will be able to devote a lot more time to the project--less need for other jobs and side gigs.  We'll also be able to hire on a few more people and get everything wrapped up much faster. \nWe turn to the Kickstarter community once again for this final round of crowdfunding. Thank you all for your support and for believing in Age of Grit!\nDigital Copy of AOG: The game!!! Upon release you'll receive a Steam key of Age of Grit on either PC, Mac, or Linux.  If you prefer you can opt for a DRM free copy instead of the Steam key.  Available to SMUGGLER tier and above.  Expected retail price will be $20.\nCredits: All backers at the SMUGGLER tier or higher will be honored in the game's official credits. You can be listed by your real name or the alias of your choosing. You are a big part of Age of Grit and deserve some recognition! \nWallpapers: Six beautifully illustrated Age of Grit wallpapers exclusive to LAWMAN tier backers or higher. Set your favorite as your desktop background. We will format wallpapers in all of the most common resolutions so you'll be sure to have the perfect fit for your screen. \nDigital OST: A DRM free copy of the Age of Grit's entire original soundtrack. Available to GUNSLINGER tier and above. \nLoot Item will Mention Your Name: A specific loot item in the game will feature your name (or alias) in its description! Perhaps your name will be the manufacturer of a mighty fine six shooter (Made by YOUR NAME CO.). Or perhaps someone has etched your name into the back of an engine's maintenance hatch. You'll have to find the item in the game to see! Available to LEGEND tier and above.\nAOG Guidebook: Entitled \"The West: A Traveler's Compendium,\" this is a detailed traveler's guide of The West. It is written from perspective of Nessmuk T. Franklin, a famous adventurer and traveler of The West. It contains some of the history of The West, bios of some of the important figures, and write-ups for various settlements. The guide is complete with detailed sketches and illustrations. BOUNTY HUNTER and HERO tiers will receive a physical copy, printed and bound to resemble a vintage Old West style book. It will measure roughly 4 x 7 inches and will be a great way to showcase your AOG enthusiasm! GUNSLINGER tier backers and above will receive a PDF version of the guidebook.\nCloth Map: A full-color detailed cloth map of The West. Key settlements will be featured along with terrain and other details. It will look and feel authentic--like it's a true artifact from the game! It will be approximately 8 x 15 inches and will look great framed or hung on a wall! Available to BOUNTY HUNTER and HERO tiers. \nDesign an NPC: Fully design an actual NPC--a rival ship captain the player will meet in the game. Choose the character's name, disposition, gender, race and personality. You may even help create his or her appearance. Our artists can base the portrait off of you or design it as you see fit! Available to CAPTAIN and HERO tiers. \nWooden \"Age of Grit\" Sign: For the HERO tier, this is a gorgeous handcrafted wooden Age of Girt sign painted by Andy's wonderful wife Kay--who does this sort of thing professionally. The ultimate AOG bling!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOur game is already in the later stages of development--currently approaching a solid, playable, fully-featured beta. Assuming the world doesn't suddenly shift orbit and come careening into the sun, this game is going to be completed. The most likely risk is that the game is going to take longer than expected to finish. That's always a risk for game developers big and small. That being said, we've been working at this game for a while now and have a pretty good sense of the work load that remains and how long it's gong to take.

They ported Lifeless Planet to PS4 and are working on other very exciting developments in the Lifeless Planet world. Watch the founder's TEDx talk and you'll see why Serenity Forge's philosophy is totally in sync with Stage 2.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nDeveloping a game like Lifeless Moon requires a monumental amount of effort. The cool thing is, when lots of individual people like you chip in a even little bit, amazing things are possible.\nThere are multiple core efforts we need to cover, including:\nArt and Design\nProgramming\nMusic Composition\nSound Design\nVoice Acting\n3D Modelling and Animation\nTesting and Deployment\nIn addition, there are other items including basic overhead, marketing and the costs of the rewards themselves. The good news is, we have a profitable studio that allows us some flexibility to absorb day-to day costs, and we have a proven track record with Lifeless Planet.\nBut without your support, the extra costs of projects like this can be impossible to cover. So, we're coming to Kickstarter for the boost of funding and the support, energy and motivation that only comes from our awesome fans... like you!\n  ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk will be release date. We are able to pay the bills with client work, but this sometimes means we have to spread our attention between projects. But we've done this before and it worked... Why are we asking for $17,000? In part, because that's what was pledged here for Lifeless Planet several years ago. We delivered before with that budget, and we are confident we can do it again.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Space Cadet", "descp": "Exclusive 4k desktop background and your name in the credits as a Supporter.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}], "stat": ["1 backer"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "Astronaut", "descp": "Digital Pre-Order of the Game (for one platform of your choice).

Add the price of the reward you want(listed below), and you can tell us later in a survey what you raised your pledge for (do not change the tier that you are currently pledged at).\nAdditional Digital Game(Steam or Humble): $15 per copy\nDigital Art Book: $5\nSoundtrack by Alex Roe: $10\nClosed Beta + Private Discord Invitation: $15\nThe Iron Oath is a turn-based tactical RPG that is set in a dark fantasy world. Recruit, manage, and embark on missions with a roster of adventurers, testing the limits of their mortality. Every decision made carries weight and can have a minor or major influence on your characters and the world that surrounds them. As you and your guild progress, the world changes dynamically, enabling new storylines to discover and resulting in a unique experience for every playthrough.\nTactical turn-based Combat: Deadly foes, traps and destructible objects means one misstep could be your party\u2019s undoing. Proper planning and execution is vital to your success.\nA Large and Dynamic Overworld: 9 regions with over 50 hubs to visit. Cities can be overtaken, destroyed and rebuilt; while various factions can emerge, rise and fall. A playthrough can potentially last hundreds of years, resulting in many changes to the initial world state.\nIn-depth Guild Management: Control your guild's finances, resources, alliances and roster. Your characters will age, retire and frequently die in combat and you will need to recruit and train their replacements.\nCharacter Development: Every recruitable character has their own personal backstory, incorporating events that have taken place during your playthrough. Their motives, alignment and traits all stem from this, but each of the three is subject to change as their career progresses.\nDynamic Dialogue: Characters will converse over a variety of subjects such as the current state of the world or relevant past experiences, along with offering their input on any decisions you face.\nDecisions Matter: Your choices bear consequences and they can affect your characters, your guild and the many factions that exist throughout the world.\nDetailed Pixel Art: Meticulously hand-crafted pixel art characters, animations and environments help set the mood for your journey.\nThere are 2 main aspects of gameplay in The Iron Oath: The Mission phase & the Overworld phase. Missions focus on combat and exploration, while the Overworld deals with managing your guild's affairs and traveling.\nCombat is a near certainty in any mission you choose to undertake. You will have to overcome your enemies' strengths and exploit their weaknesses by carefully planning your party's composition, formation and using each class's skill-set to its fullest potential.\nEvery character class has a set of unique abilities that cost Spirit to use. The key is not just understanding how to use your abilities, but also when to use them. Resource management is paramount during missions and Spirit is your most valued resource. Do you use the Paladin\u2019s \u2018Holy Barrage\u2019 now to deal with the horde of undead that are upon you? Or do you instead employ your Spirit more conservatively in case a greater threat lies beyond?\nYour characters will react accordingly to various events and abilities that will see their Spirit pools fluctuate. Striking a critical hit, killing blow or casting abilities at key moments will spur your character's confidence and increase their Spirit. Conversely, having an ally get knocked down or even killed can see it plummet.\nCombat in The Iron Oath is turn-based and occurs on a hex grid. The size and shape of the grid varies depending on the the environment, and can be further altered by various destructible objects, traps & abilities. You might find that certain party compositions fare better in confined quarters with choke points, while others excel in wide open areas. There are many viable compositions for every situation, and you will be encouraged to experiment and discover your favorites!\nMany objects that obstruct hexes can be destroyed\nIn between combat engagements, you will explore procedurally generated dungeons on your way to completing your mission. Enemies are not the only obstacle that your party must overcome. Traps, hazards, rare events & scarce resources will all seek to challenge your resolve and that of your characters.\nNot everything is a detriment to your party however, there are many interactable objects and events that can prove beneficial. Hidden passages can be uncovered, unlocking secret areas that contain rare loot or long forgotten artifacts. Shrines of ancient Gods can grant their blessing to those who are deemed worthy. You may even stumble across an NPC who requires your assistance, or one who offers theirs to you.\nA traveling merchant offers to sell you his wares\nMuch like combat, exploration has a heavy emphasis on resource management and decision making. If your party is low on health or Spirit, perhaps it would be best if you left that corpse alone rather than risk an unwanted battle. Whenever there is a choice to be made, your characters will offer their opinion on what they believe is the correct course of action. Heeding their advice is generally wise, but they will not always agree with one another and ultimately you will have the final say.\nWhen dungeons are long enough you will be given the opportunity to set up camp. Doing so allows your party to rest and recover their HP, Spirit and possibly remove any negative traits that they have acquired on the way. Your party may even end up with a few well-rested bonuses providing the conditions are met. Choosing when and where to camp are both equally important; camping too early may squander its benefits, and choosing to camp in an unsecured room could prove disastrous.\nFull map of the known world\nThe overworld is comprised of 9 unique regions with over 50 cities and towns for you to visit. The map begins the same for every playthrough, but as time passes, world events and the choices you make will dynamically change the economy and political makeup of it. There are a variety of events that can occur in the world, triggering outcomes such as wars, the destruction of cities, or even the complete collapse of a once powerful faction. All of these events and their outcomes shape what storylines and missions are made available to you.\nAn overworld view of the realm of Lithus\nThe decisions you make on your journey can also have a profound influence on the world and your guild. You may choose to spare a powerful sorcerer who bargains for his life, only to see him spawn a large faction of undead that begins to threaten or overtake the region. There are a number of encounters you will face while in the Overworld, and you will need to consider your choices and their consequences carefully.\nOne of many possible encounters in the Overworld\nAs you travel throughout the overworld and complete missions of your choosing, you will earn gold and reputation for your actions. Gold is obviously valuable, but your guild\u2019s reputation can be equally important. Do you want to be known as cut throat mercenaries, leaving a pile of bodies and enemies in your wake? Or do you want to remain honorable by helping those in need and forging meaningful alliances. Whatever path you choose will have an effect on the missions and opportunities made available to you. Keep in mind, your characters have their own motives, opinions and a sense of loyalty towards the guild. Making choices that they do not agree with can decrease their Loyalty, leading them to question, abandon or even betray you.\nMaintaining your guild is a costly venture; you will need to pay expenses for travel, accommodations, and supplies. Your characters don't risk their lives for free either, and they will expect to be paid on time and by the terms of their contracts. Planning out your travel route and accepting the right missions goes a long way to running a successful organization.\nAs time passes your characters may retire, leave or die and you will need to be on the lookout for new recruits. Recruiting can be done while visiting towns and cities, but you will also have the chance to recruit some NPCs that you encounter in the overworld or while completing a mission.\nWhen it comes time to begin a mission, choosing the right party and provisions are crucial to success. There are a few important factors to consider for this:\nAre they willing? Depending on the mission, some of your characters may not be inclined to participate, either for moral, psychological, or other reasons. You may force them if you wish, but it could lead to problems within the dungeon or even further down the line.\nAre they fit for duty? Your characters can succumb to a number of negative traits, illnesses and injuries that should all affect your decision to include them in the party.\nWhat threats are you likely to face? Certain classes and compositions perform better than others against a particular foe, and taking along the right potion or antidote may just save a life.\nDo these characters get along? Your characters have an Affinity rating to one another which can affect the party\u2019s synergy. If two of your members dislike each other, tensions between them could potentially unravel the mission.\nMany class compositions will be viable for any given situation, but you will need to take into account all aspects of your characters in order to form the most effective party.\nChoose your party and provisions wisely\nEvery character that is available for you to recruit has their own backstory. Their backstory is comprised of moments in their life that shape who they are, and incorporates world events that have occurred during your playthrough. Perhaps they grew up in a small town that was ransacked during a recent war, and lost their home and family. A character\u2019s goals, traits and alignment are determined by these moments in their backstory. Using the above example, they may want revenge on the offending faction or they may simply hold a general dislike towards them. Moments often have a character trait associated with it, which can be either positive or negative.\nThere are a number of ways for you to develop and customize your characters as well. Once a character has earned enough experience to level up, you will be able to spend an ability point to augment one of their abilities. Each ability has its own skill tree of enhancements for you to choose from such as: increased potency, reduced cost or added crowd control effects.\nThe Paladin's ability bar\nTraits are another aspect that you have some partial control over by way of the Mentor System. This feature allows you to assign an experienced character to mentor another of the same class. By doing this, the mentor will be able to pass on some of their more positive traits, and also increase the rate at which the apprentice gains experience. Additionally, if the mentor manages to survive until their retirement, they will pass on their passive ability to the apprentice.\nLastly, gear allows you to further customize your characters. A Diablo-like loot system allows you to obtain a variety of equipment through merchants, quest rewards and by looting either enemies or misplaced chests of treasure.\nWe are planning to launch the game with 12 distinct classes, each possessing 6 unique active abilities and up to 2 possible passive abilities. We\u2019ve also fully mapped out another 9 classes that we'd like to eventually add to the game.\nThe 4 classes currently in-game\nThe 4 classes currently implemented are the Paladin, Pyrolancer, Stormcaller, Valkyrie. The other 8 are the Grappler, Hellraiser, Shifter, Sage, Warden, Nightstalker, Trickster, Troubadour. Read more about each class in THIS update!\nThe Grappler has been revealed with the 4th Social Goal! Read all about him HERE\nLineup of various enemies you will face\nThere will be numerous enemy types to provide you with both variation and challenge, such as: beasts unique to each region, bandits & various human factions, undead creatures, demons, and the Blighted.\nThe Valkyrie prepares herself against the Blighted\nYou will also come across many neutral NPCs on your excursions including merchants, blacksmiths, other adventurers and more. Your choices during these encounters can have a number of possible outcomes for your guild and potentially the world.\nIn the first age humanity was young and vulnerable. Then came the Gods, who shared their wisdom and knowledge. The Gods shielded humanity from the threat of the Blighted, and they grew into prosperity.\nHowever as time passed, so too did the Gods. They were replaced by a great being of darkness; one that brought only death and disease to the land. Those afflicted by its blight lost their minds, their bodies and their souls as they slowly became abominations of the flesh and outcasts to society.\nThe Dragon, a great being of darkness, death & disease\nYet in the wake of this tragedy heroes began to emerge, taking up the mantle left vacant by the gods. They defended the realm with their lives for centuries, but eventually they too would fade. So humanity endures, waiting for new heroes to rise up that can perhaps put an end to the suffering that has plagued them for so very long.\nThe Void is a dark realm where the souls of the living linger after they die\n--------------------------\nA fragile peace now exists between the factions of the world. Every few decades, the dragon(whose exact origins remain a mystery) ventures out from its slumber within the Void, returning to the realm and inflicting its sickness upon the people. Those afflicted are known as the Blighted, and they slowly transform into aggressive abominations who are often then shunned, excommunicated or killed.\nThe game begins on the eve of the dragon\u2019s return(or so the people believe). Uncovering and completing the main storyline of the game is entirely optional, and you may choose to ignore it and let events unfold without your input.\nThe Iron Oath boasts a dark fantasy orchestral soundtrack produced by talented composer Alex Roe. Alex draws from a wealth of experience in writing remixes & original music based on the Dark Souls and Bloodborne series. Other influences for the soundtrack comes from titles such as Castlevania: Lords of Shadow, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, Shadow of the Colossus and Soul Sacrifice.\nIf you'd like to hear more of Alex's work, we encourage you to visit his Bandcamp: http://alexroe.bandcamp.com\nThe Iron Oath will be released on Steam for PC, Mac and Linux. DRM-free versions will be made available through The Humble Store. Our targeted release date is Q1 of 2019.\nWe\u2019d also love to bring the game to consoles but as we\u2019re a small team we cannot yet commit to the idea. Whether or not it happens will depend on opportunity and the success of this campaign\nYour pledge means everything to us, but there are other ways you can support the campaign too!
