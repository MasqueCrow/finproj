These unique dice supplement your standard polyhedral set with defined damage in each roll during battle. Available in Metal and Acrylic. Plus, uniquely functional and stylish dice for spells, saves, sneak attacks and class features.\nTins for the metal dice sets\nWhy We Want This\nOne thing was clear after the completion of our original Damage Dice campaign for magical damage types; folks wanted to get physical. With these dice you can roll a war hammer smite with a bludgeoning die and radiant die at once and know which damage is what. Different colorways for each design allow for rolling multi-attacks all at once and knowing which attack roll goes with which damage roll. Why should only casters get the fun of rolling big hand fulls of dice!  Mostly, this is about style. D&D is a game of color and theme after all, so it's nice to have a special set of metal piercing dice for your favorite rogue.\nMetal?! Yes metal. We want our damage dice to embody each type to the fullest so  metal seemed the obvious choice. The material allows for each design to further represent slashing, piercing and bludgeoning. Additionally, we\u2019ve created acrylic sets for a more accessible cost option (and we know metal isn\u2019t for everyone).\n Damage Dice Sets are special: \nJust like our magic sets, these sets are specifically designed for damage rolls.\nSets include what you need for attacks with standard D&D weapons \u2013 1d4, 2d6, 1d8, 1d10, 1d12 and a 1d20 (dice quantity doubled in acrylic sets). \nD10s are d10s, not half of a percentile set. You roll 1\u201310 damage, not 0\u20139 or 00\u201399.\nStylish custom molds with damage type in the design and edge\nTins for metal and embroidered bags for acrylic with the damage type.\nWhat else?\nSome of the stretch goals in our last campaign were dice that could have been their own campaigns, such as the bardic inspiration set. This time, we considered going a more traditional route; keeping the stretch goals to simple accessories \u2026 but seeing as a ultra-specific purpose-built, surprise dice sets are kind of our brand now, we figured why not! This is about bringing as many dice into the world as we can.\nHow We\u2019re going to do this\nWe\u2019re using everything we learned from our first project creating the magical damage types to make these even better. We\u2019ve already created some prototype molds and we\u2019ll need to make so many more molds. Each design requires a unique mold, and minimum order, so we need the community\u2019s help to bring these dice into the world, and onto our tables.\nWho is doing this?\nGyld is a small company in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Gordie, Al and James have pooled their free-time and free-cash into this and a few other projects in the name of creating items for table-top that we want to exist (and use).\nShipping Rates & VAT\nShipping and VAT costs are not included in your pledge. We\u2019ll be using Pledge Manager after the campaign which will calculate shipping based on your location. Estimated shipping costs are below, and may change based on location, rates and whatever weird stuff happens between now and the ship date (2020, as you may remember, was a little bananas).\nWe have arranged for UK, EU and Australian distribution this time so VAT will be handled in Pledge Manager as well so you won\u2019t have to worry about paying on delivery. NOTE: EU and UK are changing VAT rules for 2021 so we\u2019ll update this section once we know specifics.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe designs and prototypes are complete for this campaign which reduces our risk further from the last campaign. However, as we learned in 2020, anything can happen. The delivery estimate here is what we were able to deliver within even with a global-pandemic shutdown so we\u2019re very confident that we can make it happen, but then again \u2013 who knows.\n\nOne of the things we learned from the last campaign is that the best part of Kickstarter is working with the community to create something that doesn\u2019t exist, and that we wouldn\u2019t be able to make by ourselves, or at a big company. We can make weird, ultra-specific, dice that only work for one spell, like Chaos Bolt. We can take input from the community during the campaign and include it in the final designs \u2013 y\u2019all really got behind matte finish so we pushed it up - and that\u2019s what we love. So please remember that this is a pledge not a pre-order. We may change designs, finishes, ink colors or details based on the campaign and community input.

Leave the troubles of the road outside and have a seat by the fire. Welcome to a project that is certain to help you put the worries of the outside world at bay. Black Oak Workshop is proud to return to Kickstarter with our 2021 lineup of Advent-ure Calendars! The Holiday Tavern and the 2020 Calendars were well received and we have returned with new themes to ensure there is something for everyone. 2020 is GONE and we are excited to kick off 2021 with some polyhedral adventure!\nDue to the positive response last year, we are returning with three all new calendars this year. The goal with three is to allow choices for our backers. Not everyone celebrates the Christmas holiday that is associated with traditional Advent calendars, so we present an additional holiday themed calendar (Halloween) as well as offering a calendar that is not specifically tied to any holiday. This allows everyone a way to countdown with cool dice.\nWe've got some wonderful surprises for everyone included in each calendar. There are some new, extra large dice and an altogether custom shape which is very exciting! Our costs were impacted as a result, but we only had to increase prices marginally over previous calendars. In addition to the cool new sizes and shapes you will discover this year, we're including a bonus, thematic item in each of the calendars designed to match the theme. Read on adventurers!\nAdvent-ure Calendars are filled with custom polyhedral dice that follow a theme. Our calendars are inspired by traditional advent calendars and they help you count down your holidays or any other event while celebrating a love of dice. Each day, a new chamber is opened and inside you will find custom polyhedral dice that feature all new, never before seen designs. You will never find old overstock dice or standard mass produced sets in our calendars!\nOnce again, we have commissioned the Fraim Bros to do our box art and we feel they really brought the magic to this project - the artwork is gorgeous!! Check out these beautiful calendars!\nAdvent-ure Calendar 5: The Dragon's Lair The dark and foreboding cave entrance warns of terrible dangers within! Do you have the courage to draw your sword and press onward to discover untold treasures? Beware the dragon that lies within! Count down to any special date with these cool dice!\nCustom Polyhedral RPG Sets: 3\nCustom Polyhedral Singles: 3\nTotal Dice: 24\nDimensions: 13.2 x 8.8 x 1.7 (in)\nMSRP: $65\nAdvent-ure Calendar 6: The Deathgale Galleon Storm clouds foretell the coming of the haunted galleon! The crew is said to be cursed and will forever sail the seas in search of new prey. Do you dare board the ship and discover dark mysteries inside the barnacled hull? Count down to Halloween with these not-so-terrifying dice!\nCustom Polyhedral RPG Sets: 4\nCustom Polyhedral Singles: 3\nTotal Dice: 31\nDimensions: 15.5 x 11.2 x 1.75 (in)\nMSRP: $75\nAdvent-ure Calendar 7: Santa's Workshop The dream destination of children all around the world is certain to hold a great many magical surprises! Come inside and see what Santa has been working on with his elves! Count down to Christmas with these holiday themed dice!\nCustom Polyhedral RPG Sets: 3\nCustom Polyhedral Singles: 3\nTotal Dice: 24\nDimensions: 13.2 x 8.8 x 1.7 (in)\nMSRP: $65\n We hope you think these themes are as exciting as we do!\nAs with our previous Advent-ure Calendars, we are steadfastly choosing not to reveal images of the dice inside to preserve the magic and fun of opening a countdown style calendar. However, we can tell you the following:\n Big! All the dice are larger Black Oak sized dice - these are big and fun to roll!\n Bigger! We are introducing some special over-sized (even for Black Oak) dice in two of the calendars this year.\n Exclusive! All the dice feature entirely new custom designs and they are not available anywhere else - these dice are exclusive to this project!\n More Exclusive! We have an entirely new dice shape for one of our calendars this year! Hint: Have you been naughty or nice this year?\n Variety! Each of the dice are unique. Other than the possibility of set pairs, there are no duplicates of the dice inside. Also, you will never find our old stock in these calendars - we don't use them to thin out stuff that isn't selling well.\n Style! All the dice feature either solid, swirl, transparent or glitter styles. And maybe even glow-in-the-dark!\n Thematic! The packaging for each calendar embraces a unique theme and features beautiful artwork to help bring this theme to life. This theme carries over to the dice designs as well.\n Collectible! Except for a few of the dice outlined below (see Special Singles), none of these will be available outside of this project. This is it!\nWe always strive to provide a fantastic product to our backers while also putting a focus on value. We are offering the same exceptional quality as our previous calendars while including a few specialty dice this year (larger and new shapes). As a result, the pricing for the new calendars is slightly higher than last year. Additional calendars in the pledge manager and those available post project on our website will be sold at the MSRP rate.\nWhile we are choosing not to reveal the dice in these calendars for obvious reasons, we can show you dice similar to what you will receive. Below are photos of some of the polyhedral sets from our earlier Advent-ure Calendars.\nAs you can see, the dice in a given calendar come in a mix of designs, but they follow a general theme. Our backers resoundingly loved these dice and we can promise you that the dice featured in the new calendars will be just as cool.\nNo project would be complete without something fun to look forward to. For this project, we are continuing with extras that match the themes we've selected. Please help us spread the word out there so these items can find their way into the world!\nBelow is a text only summary of the project goals:\n $40,000 Funded! **UNLOCKED** All three of the new Advent-ure Calendars are now unlocked. Additional calendars will be available for purchase in the pledge manager.\n $50,000 Dice Bags! **UNLOCKED** The three matching dice bags (one design matching each calendar) are unlocked. All backers will receive one of these dice bags of their choice per calendar backed for (LIMIT 3). These bags are made of the same quality materials as our standard dice bags and are 5.5\" X 8.5\" in size. Additional dice bags will be available for purchase in the pledge manager at a discounted rate.\n $60,000 Mystery Dice Level 1! **UNLOCKED** Each calendar will have an additional mystery die included somewhere inside the calendar itself. These dice will be matching in theme, size and quality and each features a unique design and/or color scheme from other dice in the calendar (these are not doubles).\n $69,000 Mystery Dice Level 2! **UNLOCKED** Each calendar will have a SECOND mystery die included somewhere inside the calendar itself. These dice will be matching in theme, size and quality and each features a unique design and/or color scheme from other dice in the calendar (these are not doubles).\n $78,000 Mystery Dice Level 3! **UNLOCKED** Each calendar will have a THIRD mystery die included somewhere inside the calendar itself. These dice will be matching in theme, size and quality and each features a unique design and/or color scheme from other dice in the calendar (these are not doubles).\n ??? Additional mysterious stretch goals are possible.\nWe will be releasing a few of the dice from the calendars as singles available for a purchase outside of the project. This is because we know they will make cool gifts and our backers may very well want a few extras to throw in their dice bags.\nOut of the 79 dice included on the project, 7 will be available as add-on purchases. There are 2 dice from each calendar that we are revealing and an additional die from the Deathgale Galleon (total 3).\nBelow is a text only summary of the Special Singles:\n Sparky d4 (Dragon's Lair) Who doesn't love cute little dragons? You can use this one to roll or as a marker for your familiar! A tiny flying dragon means you've rolled a 4 on this purple swirl with silver ink d4.\n Dragonstone d20 (Dragon's Lair) The crown jewel of the Dragon's Hoard, this oversized crystal clear d20 (white ink) is a handful! Our standard d20s are scaled to match a 19mm d6, but these d20s are even chunkier. A crystal marks the 20 result.\n Rolling Bones pair of d6s (Deathgale Galleon) These two d6s are black with white ink and have an increasing number of bones to indicate the result with a cool skull as the 6 result. Pirates love them!\n Jib the Monkey d20 (Deathgale Galleon) He's a loyal companion, but you can bet he's looking forward to finding a new home on dry land! This beige swirl and brown ink d20 has a little monkey for the 20 result.\n Giant Christmas Tree d4 (Santa's Workshop) There is always a big Christmas tree standing in Santa's Workshop! This giant sized d4 is almost identical to our d4 in Advent-ure Calendar 1, but it's a LOT bigger!\n Naughty/Nice d2 (Santa's Workshop) This d2 comes in the shape of Santa's book of names. It is a beige swirl with brown ink and this shape is a first for us. Have you been naughty or nice this year?\nIn addition to the singles from the calendars, we have plenty of add-on items to choose from. You can see most of our available products on our website. Most products there as well as a few others will be available as part of the pledge manager process that will begin shortly after the campaign funding period ends.\nBelow is an overview list and general price breakdown of our products:\nAdditional Advent-ure Calendars 5-7 at MSRP\nSpecial Singles Calendar Dice $4 (reduced for backers)\n Rolling Bones pair of d6's (Deathgale Galleon) $8 (reduced for backers)\n Dragonstone Oversized d20 (Dragon's Lair) $11 (reduced for backers)\nCalendar Dice Bags (if unlocked) $10 (reduced for backers)\nBlack Oak Thematic Polyhedrals (singles) $5\nBlack Oak Thematic RPG Sets $15\nAdditional Dice Bags $12\nTotally Geek Pins $8\nYou can choose to add additional funds to your pledge now to cover add-on items or simply add them post project during the pledge manager process.\nFor those of you who have not seen or rolled our dice, we are sure you will be pleasantly surprised. Below is a size comparison of a Black Oak d20 and a standard d20. All of our dice are scaled to match a 19mm (3/4\") d6 instead of a standard 16mm d6. The result is that they have a better feel in your hand and look great when rolling. They are also much easier to read. Note that all of the calendars this year contain an even larger die than our standard size or a specialty shape we have not produced before.\nWe like to be creative and innovate! Last year we introduced a new take on the traditional d4 in some of our calendars. This allows additional design space for the theme while maintaining functionality. The Campfire d4 was one of these. We received an overwhelmingly positive response to this last year and are continuing with the concept this year on more of the d4s.\nYou can back our projects with confidence! Reviewing any of our past projects will reveal we go above and beyond to deliver a great experience to our backers who are the best backers on Kickstarter! We take our commitment to you seriously and you can trust us to deliver. We have shipped on time or early on virtually every one of our projects.\nWhat you see is what you get on this and all of our projects. Black Oak Workshop always strives to show you photo samples of the actual product. We carry an upfront investment to do this so that you can feel safe in helping produce a great product. Below are images of the actual calendars - the product you will receive will be exactly like what you see here!\nUPDATE: We will be shipping internationally for the project with the exception of the United Kingdom. All international shipping costs are to be determined and will be charged in the pledge manager post project.\nAll shipments will be processed through the United States Postal Service. Please note that 2021 shipping rate changes have impacted the shipping estimates. Domestic (USA) orders will ship utilizing Priority Mail. International orders will ship utilizing First-Class Package International Service. All rewards will be packed securely in an effort to minimize risk of damage during shipping. Tracking numbers are emailed to backers at the email address on file with Kickstarter upon printing of the respective shipping label.\nAll rewards will ship in the month of September 2021. Domestic USA orders should arrive by October 1, but we cannot guarantee that. We have seen some shipments take a few days or 2-3 weeks to reach the end destination due to staffing issues of the USPS. International orders are not guaranteed to arrive by any specific date.\nNOTE: All shipping fees will be collected post the campaign as part of the BackerKit pledge manager process. Please see the shipping matrix below for cost estimates. For the THREE CALENDAR SET (triple pack) and RETAILER ONLY reward levels, we are only shipping to the USA.\nCOVID-19 NOTICE: The delivery timeline and above cost estimates are subject to change based on the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, we feel confident in meeting the delivery schedule and staying close to these cost estimates. However, as the world learned in 2020, things can change quickly. We will always keep our backers updated as to any changes as they develop.\nAre you a verifiable brick and mortar retailer? Would you like to carry the Advent-ure Calendars or any of our other products in your store? We'd love to earn your business! Sales for our retailers on our previous Advent-ure Calendar projects were fantastic and we only had one complaint: they wanted more to be available than we were able to provide! This will not be an issue on this project! Note that online based retailers are not permitted. \nSimply back at the 'Retailer Only' level and, if this is your first time backing a Black Oak project, contact us through the creator contact area of the Kickstart page or through our website here so we can verify you as a brick and mortar retail store. Your pledge will serve as a credit towards your selections in the pledge manager. Qualified retailers receive a wholesale rate on all our products and all products will be available in the pledge manager for you at wholesale rates. The suggested MSRP for the Advent-ure Calendars are $65 (24 chambers/custom dice) and $75 (31 chambers/custom dice). Note that if additional 'mystery dice' are unlocked, they will be incorporated into the calendars, though the MSRP will not change.\nNOTE: Costs for shipping to retailers will be based on quantities ordered and will be determined at the time of shipment. Final shipping costs for retailers will not be handled in the pledge manager.\nThank you for checking out our latest project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIf funded, our priority will be to meet or exceed backer expectations.

These cards provide keywords to spark your imagination and example phrases for their use. Written by novelists and organized by dungeon-masters, the cards are designed for quick on-the-fly use and inherently add randomization. The list of monster parts uniquely depicted include, but are not limited to, the following:\n Horns\n   Teeth\n   Claws\n   Protrusions\n   Bodily Forms (Hides, Ears, Eyes, etc.)\n   Tails\n   Wings\n   Tentacles \nBetween great heroes and great monsters lies the pinnacle of drama \u2014 Combat. The unrelenting tension that comes with knowing blood will be spilled, and life may be lost. Monster Description Cards will guide you while you detail these moments, providing keywords and examples for horns that PIERCE, claws that SLASH, tails that BLUDGEON, and more. Hundreds of new ways to describe monster strikes in these familiar categories: \nSlashing\nPiercing\nBlunt\n\nWhat happens when a monster is cornered, heavily injured, or both? What if the creature is smart enough to be deceitful, spiteful, or vindictive in its last moments? How can you subtly share that your monster is on its last legs, but there is still a worrisome hint of malice in their eyes? These questions are all answered by the LAST STAND section of the cards. Where examples help illustrate the response of creatures facing overwhelming odds and perhaps displaying heroism, sacrifice, or wickedness of their own.\n\n\n \u201cWRITERS OF ALL LEVELS LOVE THE IMPACTFUL NARRATIVE EXPERIENCES DESCRIPTION CARDS ADD TO THEIR WORKS\u201d \nThere are common composition principles that ask writers to \"show and not tell .\" That is, allow the reader to experience the story through actions, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's summarization and cliches. The Monster Description Cards reinforces this principle by providing keywords to spark the imagination and elegant examples chock-full of distinctive story-building concepts.\n\"Cliche Busting Cards\"\nThere are three cliche busting writer's tools within the Monster Description Cards.\n\n 1. Above all else, the \"core descriptions\" provide brilliant creature concepts. They share unique ways to introduce or explain distinct physical features to an audience. These \"core descriptions\" allow writers to stay far away from monsters, terms, phrases, or even ideas that are now unoriginal and thoroughly overused.\n   2. The second tool in the deck is the Combat Sections. These areas focus on drawing an audience into the sheer violence of monstrous combat, exploring unsettling concepts like great height and length, great strength, even preternatural abilities. They touch on the tension that lingers with the threat of a hero's death. These cards collect these concepts and inherently randomize them for writers to literally draw inspiration.\n   3. The LAST STAND is a fresh and new idea for our card tools. Whether you write horror, sci-fi, or fantasy fiction, your creatures and oddities will need to be compelling and memorable, particularly in their last moments. The LAST STAND helps by offering depictions of your monstrosities on the verge of defeat while adding a bit of doubt in the reader's mind with one last defiant moment.\n  AS A STORYTELLER, HAVING A MEMORABLE ANTAGONIST IS A KEY INGREDIENT TO SUCCESS. SO JOIN US! WE BELIEVE YOU WILL LOVE THESE CARDS.\nFor GameMasters (In-game Play)\nThe cards will melt right into your game, and your players will think you are brilliant. They will provide idea after idea on improving monster encounters. But more importantly, they will also drive you to new, full-blown campaign ideas. The type of campaign that players will reminisce about for years to come. The Monster Description Cards archive these feats by offering up concepts over statistical modeled stat-blocks. The cards narrate one-of-a-kind characteristics that you can easily add to existing monsters, creatures, or oddities. \n\nIntroduce extraordinary creatures to your players, giving them clear signs of why they might be unique, even among their kin. \n\nImprove combat by focusing on the right adjectives associated with the body part landing the blow, such as claws, tails, or fangs. Not only are there specific narrations for specific body parts, but they are also broken down by blunt strikes, slashing strikes, and piercing strikes. With these multiple combinations, you can keep your combat fresh game after game. \n\nLastly, there are always moments in the game where a GM would like to subtly provide hope to their players by indicating the monster is nearing defeat. These epic final moments are depicted in the LAST STAND sections of the Monster Description Cards.\nWriting advice on worldbuilding typically leads towards lists of 'rules' and 'tips' which are either too general to be useful or downright wrong. The Monster Description Cards instead provide concepts and implementations of ideas capable of driving your imagination to discoveries about the world you want to create. Alongside the Magic Description Cards, the Monster Description Cards can immerse you in creative ideas and concepts that are anything but clich\u00e9.\n\nIF YOU'RE A GM, THIS IS AN EASY BUY, BUY, BUY DECISION.\n\nFamiliars and Animal Companions: Your Familiars and Animal Companions are cool as hell. Let me make them sound cool as hell. Select a few cards that match the combat style of your familiar or animal companion and hand them to the Gamemaster to describe their attacks with style. Critical hits made by your Familiars or Animal Companion should be magnificent, and these cards provide that strike description that can be so satisfying. You can even have a LAST STAND card ready for your Familiars or Animal Companion just if things come down to that. Moreover, the cards' descriptions can be the basis of the unique features that make your Familiar or Animal Companion distinctively yours. So let\u2019s build something special with these cards.\n\nShapeshifting: In tabletop RPGs, there are thousands of classes/powers/feats/spells that can shapeshift or grow body parts into lethal weapons. Thousands more transform hands to claws, teeth to fangs, arms to tentacles or growing tails, bony protrusions, even wings. Each of these wonderful transformations can benefit from the Monster Description Cards. The Cards will instantly make these transforms unique and unforgettable with clever depictions, separating your character's ability from the crowd of other characters with similar capabilities or sometimes the exact same class ability, power, feats, or spells.\n\nUsing the cards to depict transform spells: Using the Monster description cards to verbally illustrate the results of magical effects that modify a character's body is more than just a way to be unique; it's how you build a legacy. Stylize your character's abilities with these cards, so they are recognized by others, respected, or even feared.\n\nMonster Journal Entries: Commemorate the monsters you've encountered by inserting Monster Description Cards in your monster journal. Flip through cards of unique descriptions to depict the memorable battles along your character's journey. Each card is your personal trophy, a memento of your battle-scars from the most challenging encounters. You can even use these cards to log essential information about certain monsters in your campaign, making every entry a result of your character's meticulous observations during battle. Sing the song better than any bard could with these encounter-defining descriptions. \nBuild a strong visual library with the entire series of description cards from Conflict Games. The entire Description Cards line can be used as a database for ideas, concepts, events, environments, and fight scenes. Not only do these cards bring new ideas to concept art, but the combat styles and descriptions therein can help portray your creation in a way that works and sells a room on the idea.\n\nDuring the Concept art process, Game Design, and Film writing, an artist and designer often craft creative assets like anomalies, monsters, characters, and fight scenes that heavily influence the final work. Our Descriptions Cards have been used during this process for great success. If the goal is to provide realistically visualize ideas for VFX teams, animators, and modelers, then the Magic, Combat, and now Monster Description Cards can be an innovative way to help and become key part of your process.\nUnlike our previous description cards, these cards are double-sided and chock-full of goodness.\nBackers will receive: \n200+ Descriptions and introductions of various monster components\n  300+ Combat descriptions sorted by monster appendage\n  100+ \u201cLast Stand\u201d descriptions, for portraying monsters that are heavily damaged vengeful, desperate, or relentless\n  Printed on heavy card stock (350 gms)\n  Large Format Card (tarot sized cards)\n \nSize: 2.75'' x 4.75'' (70mm x 120mm)\n  Over 100 total cards, including stretch goals\nEach card is organized under the following general categories:\n Horns & Frills\u2014Horns are hard permanent outgrowths, often curved and pointed and typically found in pairs. Frills are upward-curving bony plates typically extending behind the skull.\n\n Fangs & Maws \u2014The Fangs category is considered the mouths, jaws, teeth, and maws of large, small, or odd creatures.\n   Claws & Pincers\u2014The claws category consists of pincers, paws, talons, and hooks. That is, any style of sharp, usually slender, and curved nail at the end of hands and feet.\n   Protrusions & Osteoderms\u2014This category consists of bony deposits that form knots above scales. Protrusions regularly produce sharp structures that can be used offensively, or widen scales and plates that add to the defenses of a monster.\n Bodily Forms\u2014Creature hides, eyes, noses, ears, or other physical oddities that might distinguish a creature from its nightmarish kin are the focus of this group.\n   Tails\u2014The hindmost part of a monster, such as the flexible extension of the backbone in a vertebrate. Tails can be used to whip, constrict, or trip an opponent.\n   Wings\u2014This category focuses on wings of all shapes and sizes, functional or non-functional: Elliptical wings, high-speed wings, long soaring wings, and more. For the cards combat backside, wings will batter with winds, slice with sharp edges, and stab with spiked ends for a unique description style.\n   Tentacles\u2014The tentacles cards help depict any elongated, boneless, flexible organs, limbs, antenna, or barbels of famed monsters.\nPotentially more to come with stretch goals, so please back and share this project.\n\nOne the backside of the cards are Combat Description for the associating Monster part. The cards are divided into three suits, which correspond to the three common attack types of Blunt, Slashing, and Piercing.\n \n\nWe understand that there are a multitude of genres, points-of-views, worlds, rulesets, and games that writers and tabletop gamers choose. That\u2019s why our writing philosophy dictates the following rules which will ensure our content is system-agnosit, narrative Neutral and friendly to writers at all levels of expertise:\n We don\u2019t describe the person perceiving the monster.\n   We don\u2019t give names to monsters.\n   We don\u2019t mention blood specifically, but generalizations like \u201cfluid\u201d are occasionally used .\n   We don\u2019t describe the surface the monster is on.\n   Nothing cheesy, corny, or racy will be accepted.\n   Both Heroes and Antagonists should be cool, so let\u2019s make them sound cool!\n  System Neutral: The card descriptions are not tied to any tabletop ruleset or Genre, meaning they can be used to describe monsters in any of your favorite tabletop-rpgs. If you run multiple games in multiple systems, these cards are great to use in any and all of your games.\nThe cards will help you answer question like these:\nIn a sea of zombies, what if you need one to stand out?\n  In a world of dragons what makes this dragon different? Special? Memorable?\nAnime is all about unique characters and ability, so why not use the cards to create singularity among a crowded field?\nREWARD SUMMARY\nPLEDGE LEVELS\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add an add-on to your Kickstarter pledge, follow these steps:\n1.

Fortunately, this is our 5th Kickstarter under the Conflict Games LLC brand and we have consulted on over 20 others. The Monster Description Card Deck is a fairly straightforward product. However, the foreseen risks involved include shipping logistics and the unexpected cancellation of contracted artists, writers, editors or product manufacturers. In the case of contract cancellation, the contractor will need to be replaced. Which in turn, could delay the project's completion but shouldn\u2019t prevent its completion. \n\nIn regard to shipping, logistics could become burdensome. We are unable to control the fact that domestic and out-of-the-US shipping costs seem to be spiraling out of control. However with our target funding goal, we don't foresee this preventing the project from succeeding; although, it may impact delivery dates. \n\nThe one guarantee we can make is that we will be transparent with issues and communicate them to our backers as quickly as we can. We strongly believe our target funding goal is sufficient to complete our vision for the product. \n\nIf you're as excited about this card deck as we are, then help us exceed that goal - we have much more we wish to do for this card series. This is just the first step in an exciting journey so please JOIN US!\n\nPlease Note: The final design of the Monster Description Cards deck and stretch goals may vary as many of the graphics above are digitally produced. Examples of this include, rounded card corners vs squared corners and raised lettering vs flat ink on the final packaging.\n\n\nRequired Attribution Text\nThanks to:\nsolid platonic solids by Dank By Design from the Noun Project\nDeath by rayhan maulana rikzan from the Noun Project\nrating by Flatart from the Noun Project\ndigital by Eucalyp from the Noun Project\nstretch by KEN MURRAY from the Noun Project\nShipping by Gregor Cresnar from the Noun Project\nbooks by Yeong Rong Kim from the Noun Project\nD20 by Lonnie Tapscott from the Noun Project\nCards by Henry Ryder from the Noun Project\ntwo by Laura Reeny from the Noun Project\nfall by Rendra Tri Kusuma from the Noun Project\nUnicorn by Lazar Nikolic from the Noun Project\nStory by Lars Meiertoberens from the Noun Project\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you kind Sir or Madam!", "descp": "You will receive project updates & Mark M.

However, some of the best descriptions are longer than others. This may be a problem for physical cards, but not for the digital products. Therefore, we will be doing another round of selection to ensure only the cream of the crop gets printed. At the same time, we did not want to shortchange you guys on the creative efforts because of trivial physical limitations. Therefore, we have also decided that all 880 descriptions will be published on the Digital products (i.e., API, app, and writer's grid). The physical cards are my favorite, but there is an advantage to digital. With the bulk of the writing work completed, we are now moving on to the project's subsequent two phases.

We are still writing and editing the Monster Description Cards content.  This part of the process should have been completed about 30-40 days ago. However, I have been extraordinarily particular about the descriptions that make the final cut. In my mind, they must be good \u2014all of them.  For that reason, our writing room has created a ton of descriptions, and to guarantee high-quality creativity, we also have many rejections, edits, and rewrites. Each of these steps has gone slower than I anticipated.  I may add writers to the project, but I believe the best solution to the delay is to simply keep writing.

Set in a world overrun by greenery, Wildsea uses a narrative, fiction-first d6 dicepool system that draws inspiration from games like Belly of the Beast, Blades in the Dark, and 13th Age. \nClickthrough to access the Quick Start Rules!\nThis campaign's goal is to raise funds to produce and print a 1st edition of the Wildsea RPG. This is a production Kickstarter: after the campaign closes, we'll be using the funds raised to create a fully realized beautiful rulebook. The budget goal of $15,000 represents the minimum amount needed to bring the book to life with the resources we currently have available. \nAny additional funds will be funneled back directly into the production of the RPG, adding more content, art, professional layouts, and an offset print run to deliver a premium tabletop roleplaying book that will be a showcase for any collection. \n Some three hundred years ago the empires of the world were toppled by a wave of fast growing greenery, a tide of rampant growth spilling from the West known as the Verdancy. \nNow chainsaw-driven ships cut their way across dense treetop waves, their engines powered by oilfruit, rope-golems, honey and pride.\nYou play a wildsailor, part of a motley crew consisting of humanity's weathered descendants, cactoid gunslingers, centipedal fungi, silk-clothed spiderfolk, and other, stranger things. \nWith your fellow crewmembers, you'll journey across the lingin' tide discovering charts, pursuing drives, and avoiding mires of the deep. \nThe Wildsea hungers and grows, roots sinking deep into the forest floor as the waves above ripple with life.  What will you discover in its depths? \n\n\n\nCheck out our Actual Play on the Don't Forget Your Towel Podcast!\nThe Wildsea is a fiction-first roleplaying game with narrative and character decisions driving your interaction with the mechanics of the Wild Words engine. The game uses a d6 narrative dicepool system that constantly pushes the story forward.\nAt character creation, players select a Bloodline, Origin and Post, each with a variety of options to inform and customize a character's background and playstyle:\nThe four core bloodlines of the Wildsea: the cactuslike Ektus, Ardent survivors, hive spider Tzelicrae, and fungi Gau.\n Your Edges represent the way in which your character is most used to solving problems. Your Grace, Iron, Instinct, Sharps, Teeth, Tides, or Veils. \nYour Skills are more specific areas in which your character has training or a natural advantage. Things like Climbing, Charming, Cooking, Breaking, or Scavenging. \nYou also have Aspects - gear, traits, or companions - that can be used, expended, or damaged throughout the course of play. \n Resources are useful oddities, short term expendables used for things like whispers, scavenge, and specimens.\nYour known Languages allow you to engage with different people and cultures in the diverse world of the Wildsea.  \nFinally, your Drives and Mires define your personality, motivation, and long term goals. \nEach crew will also have their own ship, a vessel capable of braving the unique challenges of the lingin tide. You might cut a path with a chainsaw-ridged prow, drag yourself with hooks and grapples or scuttle from branch to branch on insectile limbs.\nCustomize and upgrade  your ship by designing its Size, Frame, Hull, Bite, and Engine, and outfitting  it with different Fittings. Make it your home on the waves! \nStories and Characters develop as the crew pursues milestones, while time in the game is abstracted through three distinct phases: scenes, montages, and journeys. \nThe Wildsea will initially be presented in landscape, 11.5 x 8.5'' inch (~29 x 22 cm) hardcover book with around 200 pages of mostly black and white interiors punctuated by full color spread chapter headings.  \nMockup. Artwork and Design of Physical Book not final. Design shown is a hardcover perfect bound edition that would only be unlocked should we reach certain stretch goal milestones.\nAs the campaign grows, so will the quality and contents of the book. Should we reach certain stretch goals, we will upgrade the physical book to a 3-piece clothbound, full colour, sewn book sure to be a centerpiece of any collection. For more information, see the Stretch Goals section below.\nThe initial funding goal of $15,000 represents the bare minimum for the creators to produce and print physical copies of the book and recoup the funds already expended by the creator to the artists. \n\nCommunity Copies: At Collector's Edition and above tiers, we'll include additional digital Community Copies to be claimed by the public. Community Copies provide a way for those with less means to enjoy content and are a feature of Itch.io. When our page on the platform goes live, we'll add Community Copies commensurate with the amount of backers we have at higher tiers.\n\nShipping is not included in the pledge levels for this campaign and will be calculated and added on when we are ready to ship via Backerkit. This is a production Kickstarter and it may be up to a year before we start shipping out physical copies. It would therefore be inaccurate  to include the shipping rates as part of the funds raised for this campaign. \nAs in: you will not be charged additional VAT or Customs Taxes on your shipped goods.\nMythopoeia is currently in the process of partnering with fulfillment centers based all over the world to deliver customs-friendly shipping, including to Europe and Oceania.  According to our most recent quotes, packages for a <1kg (~2 lbs) package average around $7.50 to the USA, UK, Germany, and Netherlands and around $20 to Oceania and Canada. \n\nShipping has been quite tumultuous in recent months due to the ongoing pandemic and politics. Canadian postage from the USA seems to have taken a dramatic spike over the past four years. This is a problem we are actively working on. If you know any local Canadian or Australian distributors for USA goods, we would love to hear from you! \nClick through to Felix's Twitter.\nClick through to Pierre's Instagram.\nClick through to Omercan's Instgram.\nClick through to Katy's Instagram.\nClick through to Kyllian's Instagram.\nClick through to Alexis' Instagram.\nClick through to Liam's Soundcloud.\nClick through to say hello to Ric [@Cerebric] on the Discord!\nClick through to Ryan's Twitter.\nClick through to Mythopoeia.\nClick through to Mythopoeia's Itch.io\nIf we reach our initial goal of $15,000, we'll include new Origins for character creation not seen in the Quickstart Rules! We'll also throw in a set of digital wallpapers and other high resolution Wildsea Artwork as part of the Kickstarter exclusive digital bonuses. \nAt $17,000 we will be able to commission a full Wildsea Soundtrack from the amazing Liam P. Vaughan, composer of Thrash, Tangle, Sink, the song used in our Kickstarter video!  \nAt $20,000 we'll be able to afford to turn the book from mostly black and white to full colour! To do so will require us to go back and recolour about two thirds of our total art assets - a significant endeavor! \n\nAt $25,000 we'll bring on board a Professional Layout Artist to help design the final look of the book!  We'll also produce and release Virtual Play Surfaces to facilitate online play on your favorite platforms of choice.\n\nAt $30,000 we'll be able to raise the rates of our artists as well as commission an expanded bestiary from bestiary artist Katy Shmeckerel (@schmeckerel)! \nAt $32,000 we'll release the SRD for the Wild Words Engine, allowing you to hack and release your own games! To celebrate this milestone, we'll also be commissioning Creators to create new content for the Wildsea including new factions, beasts, and  ships, and perhaps even additional Reaches...\nAt $35,000 we'll be able to upgrade the specs of both the Standard and Collector's Edition of The Wildsea! This may include things like an offset print run, three piece clothbound hardcover, and embossed finish. \nAt $37,000 we'll include a chapter on Arconautics - the study of the weird and strange. Arconautics presents an array of additional options for both players and Fireflies that want to embrace the extraordinary - alchemists, augurs, ironbound automatons, manipulators of metal and plantlife. Includes new bloodlines, origins, posts, skills, and hazards! \nAt $40,000 we'll be able to spare no expense when it comes to printing the book, including being able to lower our carbon footprint by printing locally. We will also will look into more printing bells and whistles like foil stamping, endsheets, booksmarks, et. all.\nAt $42,000 we'll be able to bring on even more Creators to create content for the Wildsea! We'll announce if we get here, but preliminary discussions have included an appendix on gardening, and ventures deep into the undiscovered waves...\nAt $45,000 we'll be able to raise the rates of our artists yet again and commission more artwork for the final book. Perhaps we might even be able to include an illustrated Chart or three...\n At $50,000 we'll be able to produce a fully realized actual play of the Wildsea for your viewing enjoyment! This may include partnering with an existing show or perhaps striking out on our own. Details to come if we get here! \nAt $55,000 we'll be able to add a set of ship creation options, unique hazards and Firefly guidance based around the ideas of exploring the upper skies and lower branches. Now we just have to work out what to call a submarine... \nAt $60,000 we'll set aside a portion of the funds to subsidize the shipping fees for the project. This will hopefully enable us to lower shipping rates by $1-2 dollars per package, depending on a number of factors. Internally, what this means is that no matter what we will allocate a portion of our funds raised to shipping costs, which we'll then pass the savings unto you when it comes time to charge and fulfill via Backerkit.\nAt $65,000 we're going to pay Wildsea creator and designer Felix Isaacs more! The majority of funds raised from  the last stretch goal to this one will go directly to Felix in addition to his overall cut of the campaign and future sales.\nAt $70,000 we'll be able to raise the per word rate of the various designers and writers we are bringing on board to the Wildsea (which I promise we'll announce soon in a future update). Freelance game design is not exactly a lucrative profession but we're committed to building a bigger tent and providing opportunities to others when and where  we can.\nAt $75,000 we'll be able to design and manufacture a set of custom  wooden Wildsea Dice which will be available to purchase as an Add-On via BackerKit. This is something we wanted to have ready for the start of the campaign but alas simply ran out of time. Nonetheless, reaching this tier will give us the resources to begin the process of making these dice in earnest.\nHandcrafted dice from Might Dog Games. Now available as add-ons.\nAt $85,000 we'll include the last content update for the core book: The Farthest Reaches. Consider this an expansion of the Arconautics chapter already unlocked detailing the furthest corners of the Wildsea. More obscure content, to be announced if we get here!\n\nFinally, our ultimate goal at $100,000 will allow us to lower shipping rates yet again, reducing the rates by another $1-2 per package. In the interim, the funds raised to get this tier will allow us to pay the principles of the project just that little bit more :)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a production Kickstarter, the primary risk is that the book still needs to be created in full before printing and distribution can begin. For that reason we typically like to run print Kickstarters where the product is already completed instead, but sometimes that's not possible when launching a new and amazing project like the Wildsea! \n\nRay and Vince bring over six years and 13 projects worth of crowdfunding experience into this campaign. We know how to produce beautiful books and communicate with our backers and fans on every step of the process. We strive to have 100% satisfaction guaranteed when it comes our projects - ask our past backers about their experience! \n\nWe gave ourselves a wide breadth for the campaign - almost a full year - but should we meet and exceed our goals, we will use that time to build a better world filled with gorgeous art and a handsome book you'll be proud to have on your shelves. There is always the possibility that things may be delayed further. We will do our best to deliver in a timely matter while maintaining transparency and striving always for the highest quality work possible.\n\nShipping is another major uncertainty heading into the year 2021. The state of global politics means that things like postal rates and customs and tariffs are in a constant state of flux. Brexit and the USA/China trade war may impact the printing and manufacturing of the Wildsea in ways we cannot foresee. Nonetheless, we will do our best to navigate these uncharted waters, just as we have done for the past four years. \n\nBacking this project means you're not only buying the book, but helping produce the work to make it real. For that we can't thank you enough. Together, we'll build something amazing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more", "title": "HARDSHIP TIER", "descp": "A single copy of the Wildsea: RPG Digital PDF at a reduced price for those experiencing financial hardship.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Wildsea RPG [Digital PDF]\nStretch Goal Bonuses [Book Upgrades]", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2021"}], "stat": ["458 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "DIGITAL COLLECTION", "descp": "A single copy of the Wildsea: RPG Digital PDF.\nINCLUDES:\nThe Wildsea RPG [Digital PDF]\nStretch Goal Bonuses [Book Upgrades]", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["509 backers", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 49 or more", "title": "PRINT EDITION", "descp": "A single copy of the physical edition of the Wildsea: RPG.

A tangled web of conspiracy spans North America. In the war for survival, it does not matter what your creed, color, culture or gender is \u2013 all stand together. But as the Revolution has begun, something far more mysterious stirs. Agents of the occult entreat both the Rebel Continental Army and Loyalist Red Coats. Freemasons conspire in the City of Brotherly Love. Maryland is in the throes of a witch hunt by the Knights Templar. Amid the chaos, other grim fairy tales have emerged.\nThe cover art depicts a young, powerful Black woman leading the charge with sabre and flag, as an older Indigenous soldier prepares their musket and a Colonial militiaman fires a Pennsylvania long rifle. British Loyalists stand at the left-hand side of the conflict.\nReports of witches have been seen in the Great Dismal Swamp. Indigenous sachem say that devils called Manitou walk among the living. Flesh-gobbling ghouls have been tunneling beneath Boston. The Pine Barrens of New Jersey are haunted by what the locals call the \"Leeds Devil\".\nIn this game, most people have either chosen to deny the supernatural or rationalize it away. A rare few accept it for what it is and act. You are among those heroes, and are destined for greatness\u2026 or death. \nWelcome to Flames of Freedom, where your grim & perilous tale hangs in the balance!\nFlames of Freedom & Every Stretch Goal Unlocked ($200k) Mock-up\n\n Flames of Freedom is an American gothic horror RPG, powered by the Zweihander RPG d100 game engine. Intensely researched by Richard Iorio and developed by a diverse group of game designers, this game explores a range of cultures beyond the history of Europeans in North America. Developed with Black cultural consultants in key decision-making roles, interwoven with Indigenous writers of the nations represented in the work and guided by RPG safety and trauma experts, this game will show that colonial horror can be represented in a mature way.\nClick to enlarge\nThis game represents a melange of heritages and conflicting beliefs, one where cultures and genders outside traditional standards were equally as instrumental in fomenting and conducting the rebellion. And, although traditional games set during the Revolution place men at the fore of the conflict, Flames of Freedom calls upon the true history: one where heritage and genders outside the norm were just as important \u2013 and, oftentimes working behind the scenes \u2013 during this pivotal time in America\u2019s founding.\nIt is the dawn of the rebellion in 1776 and life is on the verge of drastic change. To some degree, the Europeans shun folklore and witchcraft as the so-called \u2018Age of Reason\u2019 is upon them. Tucked between missionaries, mutineers and midwives there are those who know they know the real truth. Sorcery \u2013 along with monsters, demons and mythological creatures \u2013 is real. \nClick to enlarge\nExperience Flames of Freedom right now by downloading the free 61 page Quickstart! It comes equipped with 32 pages of game rules, an 11 page adventure, 7 pre-generated characters, cut-out paper miniatures and a print-out map. It can be played one-on-one, but also supports up to 7 players and one Historian. The rules and adventure are designed for new gamers, providing a 2-3 hour play experience.\nDownload the free Quickstart from DriveThruRPG\nMODERN, SKILL-BASED DESIGN: This game is designed to accommodate a style of play where role-playing drives the story. The exception to this is when there are potential consequences for failure - then, and only then, is a Skill Test required to determine the outcome.\nTRAD MEETS NARRATIVE GAMEPLAY: Melded with narrative gameplay elements, this game has four modes: Chase Scenes, Combat Encounters, Overland Travel and Social Interactions. All are handled in the same way: you\u2019ll roll percentile dice using a Skill Test. Rolling equal to or under your chance of success means you succeed. Rolling over means you failed. If the dice match, something special happens - either a critical success, or critical failure.\nClick to enlarge\nLIGHT TO MEDIUM COMPLEXITY: This game embraces modern, familiar mechanics with smooth character creation and plenty of tactical depth to last a lifetime. If you have experience with games like Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder and Zweihander RPG, the game will feel familiar, encouraging role-playing and alternative forms of interactions before combat. \nBOUNDLESS OPTIONS: With over 84 character types, numerous cultures, tools, weapons, magic and threats to face, your adventures will take you far across North America into the very heart of supernatural darkness.\nClick to enlarge\nLet us be clear: Flames of Freedom is not a tabletop RPG where you will discriminate against women, practice slavery, slaughter innocent people or \u2018tame the wilderness\u2019 of Indigenous nations. It is a game where people come together to fend off a secret war that took root long before the American Revolutionary War. \nClick to enlarge\nFlames of Freedom is a tabletop role-playing game where you\u2019ll blaze your own path, free from outdated thinking. History certainly informs the story, but it is not meant to be completely historically accurate. This game does not endorse discrimination of any kind based on differences of the period its set in. \nClick to enlarge\nRegardless of characters' identities, there isn\u2019t any mechanical, intellectual, physical, emotional or spiritual distinctions between women, men, intersex, agender, non-binary and transgender characters, or any between cultures. This game will come equipped with ttrpg safety tools to help you navigate and embrace its positive elements while allowing you to explore its more visceral moments. We'll further deliver upon this promise across the entire Zweihander RPG game line with the release of our upcoming Touch The Darkness ttrpg safety tool.\n We have several exciting First Looks and Actual Plays for FLAMES OF FREEDOM scheduled over the next 30 days (and a couple of special extended campaign announcements after the Kickstarter ends):\n\n\nMock-up (not final)\nFlames of Freedom is unlike other tabletop RPG when it comes to quality. We lean into sustainable quality book materials, over-index on durability & aim to provide a great reader experience without skimping on premium features. Every hardback book is crafted as a collector's item and can be proudly put on display and used around the table without compromising its condition. Here's what you'll find inside:\nPremium offset hardback book\nSoft touch matte coating cover for easy grip\nReinforced plank & rounded spine, guaranteed to last\nSmythe binding, so pages never tear out\nThick, tasteful ribbon to mark your place\nChunky, matte coated interior paper (no reflections/ink bleed-thru on pages)\n\"Old school\" sepia, black & white illustrations that evoke colonial pamphlets\nOptimized information flow for an easy reading experience\nEntire UX designed using legible font types, optimized for accessibility\nInformed padding and spacing choices for those with color deficiency & dyslexic readership\nPerforated pull-out horizontal & vertical character sheets\nThe cover for Flames of Freedom is digitally painted by Ken Duquet. Ken returns as our cover artist, coming fresh off of production of our last Kickstarter Main Gauche: Grim & Perilous Supplement. Watch his progress on the cover art from concept to finish at the video below:\nReturning a 4th time to our projects is our artist-in-residence Dejan Mandic! Living as a full-time illustrator in Serbia, his exquisite drawings can be seen throughout the entire Zweihander game line. Dejan's artwork aims to be inclusive of age, body type, culture, gender, hair styles and situations for Flames of Freedom. Every single piece of interior art has been hand-drawn by Dejan, with little if any digital touch-up.\nJoining him is Amber Seger, an industry certified UX designer. Her key focus is on information design and user experience in the book. Following her breakout Twitch hit series for character sheet redesign DESIGNH\u00c4NDER, she joins our team to reexamine our layout standards from previous editions, and to reflow the entirety of Flames of Freedom. \nOur PDF will be fully screen reader accessible.\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nIn Flames of Freedom, your character will be changed by the choice they make in the world. Will they become a force for the Rebel patriots or the Loyalists? Will they fall prey to the wishes of the Freemasons or the Inquisition? Will they bend their morals to parlay with the Knights Templar? There is no right or wrong answer; there are only shades of grey.\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nCartographer Gabriel Brouillard has mapped out the cities, settlements and long-forgotten places of North America. His map work spans New France and Canada, south along the Thirteen Colonies, into Florida and the Caribbean. Gabriel's maps permeates the cultural sections of the book, breathing life into Flames of Freedom.\nClick to enlarge\nClick to enlarge\nFollowing our all-in-on approach from Zweihander RPG, Flames of Freedom will come with a player's handbook, Historian's guide, over 100 spells, a fully-illustrated bestiary of 80+ legends & threats, the setting of 1776, a 35 page adventure set during the Siege of Boston & an urban-based sandbox in and around Boston. We anticipate the book to be 600 to 668 pages when lain out. Much like Zweihander RPG, there will be upwards of 300+ pieces of art. Here's the chapter breakdown:\nClick to enlarge\nWe've set up 6 simple pledge levels, which communicates in detail what you'll get at each pledge level:\nOnce unlocked, Stretch Goals are FREE to different pledge levels. To keep it simple:\n Pledge $75+: get all Physical + Digital Stretch Goals for FREE.\n Pledge $15+: get all Digital Stretch Goals for FREE.\nAt $20k we will include a full-color perforated World Map in the back of the book! Illustrated by Gabriel Brouillard, this thick, matte-coated gatefold map will be perforated for easy removal from the book (approximately 22\"x17\"). The map will be made of sustainable paper, matte coated and will exceed what the current ttrpg market offers.\nAt $35k we will include Campaign Coins! We'll partner with Mark Morrison & team at Campaign Coins to produce high quality engraved Metal Coins to track fortune & misfortune mechanics. They will be 6 poker chip-sized coins (39mm)\u2013 larger and heavier than a US half dollar. They will come engraved with a skull on one side (when the Historian needs to play the coin), or the rising star when in the player's hands.\nAt $50k we will include Custom Dice! These will be produced by our partner Geekify. The dice set will contain six total dice: 3D6 (face 1-6) at 14mm, 1D10% (face 00-90 percentile die) at 15mm and two 1D10 (face 1-10) at 15mm. The face 6 will come engraved with the Rising Star, marking the face '6' whenever dice explore for massive damage. The face 10 will be engraved with Skull, marked for critical hits.\nFREE UNLOCK! We went back to our vendors, and are now able to unlock the 24\"x36\" Canvas Map for FLAMES OF FREEDOM ! As always, our physical Stretch Goals are 100% free to pledges at $75+\n\n\n\nAt $65k we will include a GM Historian's Screen! This will be a four panel horizontal gatefold screen, lain out by Amber Seger. It will be made of the same heavy duty stock we use for book covers, and matte coated. We'll poll our backers to gauge what sort of scene you want Dejan Mandic to illustrate on it. \nAt $80k we will include a Magnetic Dice Tray! These will be produced by our partner Geekify. Using strong magnetic clasps, the dice tray locks in place easily. With a plush velvet interior and leather exterior, they won't scratch your table or make a loud CLATTER sound as you roll dice.\nMock-Up (not final)\nAt $100k we will UPGRADE the Custom Dice to Metal Dice! These will be produced by our partner Geekify. These will be copper-style dice, with engraved black enamel numbers: 6 dice: 3D6 at 14mm, 1D10% at 15mm, and two 1D10 at 15mm. \nMock-Up (not final)\nAt $110k we will include a Velvet Dice Bag! These will be produced by our partner Geekify. These luxurious pouches make for the perfect fit with both your Metal Dice and Campaign Coins.\nMock-Up (not final)\nAt $125k we will Upgrade the Magnetic Dice Tray to a Wood Dice Vault! These will be produced by our partner Geekify. Made of a luxurious solid dark wood and soft interior liner, it will store and protect all the dice included in this Kickstarter.\nMock-Up (not final)\nAt $140k we will Upgrade the Velvet Dice Bag to an Embroidered one! These will be produced by our partner Geekify.\nMock-Up (not final)\nAt $155k we will include Pawns! We've selected a selection of characters, legends & threats in thick punchboard to represent iconic encounters. Pawns do not come with plastic stands.\n\n\nMock-Up (not final)\nAt $185k we will Upgrade the Small Canvas Map to a 24\"x36\" Small Velvet Map! This will be produced by our partner Geekify. The velvet is a slightly higher grade material than canvas.\nAt $200k we will Upgrade the Small Velvet Map to the canvas 32\"x48\" Canvas Monster Map! This will be produced by our partner Geekify. This will be the ultimate Flames of Freedom map! \nShould we blow the doors off the $200k Stretch Goal, we may evaluate some other fun stuff we didn't add to this Kickstarter. We'll let you know here!\n\nThis project has been selected by Kickstarter to pilot their new Add-On program! This means you can get Add-Ons when completing your pledge or by managing your current pledge in Kickstarter.

All shipping charges will be at-cost, minus the discounted rates we have negotiated through our partners. Packages sent in the US will be tracked/sent via USPS while packages send to Canada and international will be tracked/sent with other trusted carriers. Packages with unlocked physical Stretch Goals will begin shipping July 2021 out of the United States.\nShipping estimates are as follows, based on 2020 rates and assuming all physical Stretch Goals are unlocked (estimated 11 lbs. box). This includes shipping + VAT/GST/taxes by country. If your country isn't listed, shoot me a message and I will get you a quote back:\nImport laws and high customs rates prohibit us from shipping to Afghanistan, Belarus, Brazil, Kazakhstan, Russia and the Ukraine.\nDepending on where you live, VAT/GST (\"customs\") may be added to your order in Backerkit.

Let's make fantastic looking games, games that are produced well with high quality components, games that don't overstay their welcome at game night and games that inspire repeat plays... basically the stuff WE want to play too.\nWe have two exciting reward types, both of which defend your games on the table! \nWe're creating 3 custom coasters with beautiful art and we have also officially partnered with Gametrayz to bring you some great resource x-trayz - including a unique color design never made before!\n\n KEEP IN MIND, YOU CAN ADD X-TRAYZ TO ANY TIER ORDER!\nPhoto courtesy of Christian Strain and Sparta the cat.

Illustrated by Greg Swearingen with amazing attention to detail, these cards will add a new layer of fun as you use them to play your favorite traditional card games.\nClick to view the rules\nClick to See How to Upgrade\nLimited Editions: These decks will only be printed once through this campaign! The deck seals will be uniquely numbered based on the total number of decks printed for this campaign (ie: 0042 / 1000). Resale of limited edition decks are allowed if purchased through this campaign (recommended $17 per deck).\nSummary of Limited Edition Deck Features:\nPrinted by USPCC on Bicycle premium paper stock, air cushioned, poker size\n52 cards + 2 jokers + 1 double backer + 1 bonus card\nOne-way backs and fronts, with 100% custom court and number cards\nCard back vine graphics printed with metallic ink\nTuck boxes with premium metallic inks \nEach tuck box seal has a unique limited edition number\nSelf-fulfilled within the US, ArtOfPlay for international \nTuck boxes wrapped in cellophane \nEach suit features unique characters from a completely new mythic world. Imagine a realm where the champions (Aces), royalty (J,Q,K), and soldiers (2-10) meet together in a tournament to compete in games of strength, skill and strategy. Invent your own ways to apply this theme to your favorite card games, or just enjoy playing games with awesome artwork.\nIllustration Award: Four of the images from Mythic Kingdoms were juried into the Society of Illustrators Los Angeles 58th Annual Illustration Competition. The Queen of Hearts, Queen of Clubs, Jack of Spades and Jack of Diamonds were all exhibited in L.A. The Jack of Spades\u2014One Eyed Jack\u2014was recognized further with a Silver medal!\nMany of the games we play require multiple decks of cards, so we created two decks that work perfectly as a set (just like Bicycle has red and blue decks). The decks are green to represent nature and purple to represent magic\u2014two common elements in fantasy. The Nature and Magic decks use the same number and court cards, but the jokers are different.\nArt in progress for joker and treasure cards\nArt in progress for joker and treasure cards\n\nAbout the Two Extra Cards\nBelow is an image that shows which extra cards will be included in each set. A double backer is a favorite among magicians for card tricks. The treasure and wizard cards can be used as an additional joker, a first player marker, a trophy to present to the winner of the game/tournament, a moving marker for the current winner of a game, or anything else you'd like to spice up whatever game you're playing.\nAbout the Sets\nFor some of the stretch goals, pledge tiers and add-ons it will be important to understand what we mean by a \"Set\" of decks. Throughout this campaign, we refer to a \"Set\" of decks as a combination of one Green Nature Deck and one Purple Magic Deck. The $45k and $50k stretch goals apply to Sets of decks. Here is a graphic to show the differences. \nSoftcover  |  8\"x10\" |  ~64 pages\nSee the Add-On section if you'd like to add an Art Book to your pledge.\nAn insider's look: Throughout this campaign we've shared the details and inspiration for many of the illustrations. These details, and much more, will be compiled into the softcover Art Book that you can purchase along with the cards.\nSoftcover | Design and layout in progress\nArt book design and layout still in the works\nSee the creative process: What you don't often see when you buy finished products is the creative design process. So, the art book will include examples of how some of these concepts took shape, such as the design of the suit symbols and the creation of the characters.\n\nAdd-Ons are available for backers who have chosen pledge levels with one or more decks of cards.\nHow to add more to your pledge: 1) If you have already chosen a pledge level, go to the top of the campaign page and click the button that says \"Manage your pledge.\" 2) Next, click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. 3) Now manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge amount, making sure to select the correct amount based on your location/country. 4) To finish, click \"Continue.\"\nThese add-on amounts having shipping included. After the campaign, we will be using BackerKit (a pledge manager) that will allow you to tell us exactly which add-ons you have selected. \nThroughout the campaign we are featuring some favorite card games and sharing ideas for how these games are played within the Mythic Kingdoms.\nClick to View the Rules\nHere are links to the campaign updates that are featuring favorite card games:\nUpdate #1: Invitation to Mention Your Favorite Card Games \nUpdate #2: Game Highlight: Hearts \nUpdate #4: Game Highlight: War, Deck of All Things \nUpdate #5: Game Highlight: Pitch \nUpdate #6: Game Highlight: Spoons \nUpdate #7: Mythic Challenge: The Card Game \nUpdate #9: Game Highlight: Crazy Eights \nUpdate #12: Game Highlight: Nerts \nUpdate #14: Game Highlight: President \nUpdate #15: Game Highlight: Slapjack \nGreg Swearingen has made illustration his career for over 20 years. His work has received awards in the most prestigious illustration competitions in the world including Communication Arts, Society of Illustrators New York, and Spectrum Contemporary Fantastic Art.\nJim Wittwer and Jon Wittwer are brothers who partnered with Greg back in 2011 to create the website BoardGaming.com. Although Jim, Jon, and Greg all live in different states, they get together at least once a year for multiple days of gaming. \nThe Finest Quality Cards: The cards will be manufactured by the USPCC (Bicycle) for its premium quality cards and environmentally friendly paper, ink, and laminating. As limited edition decks, we will print at least 1000 of each deck (the minimum USPCC will print) plus additional decks if necessary to fulfill backer rewards and add-ons.\nCard Details: Premium Paper Stock, Air Cushion Embossed Card Finish, Poker Size\nTuck Boxes:  Tuck boxes will be manufactured by either USPCC or another premium tuck box manufacturer, depending on stretch goals.\nReward Guarantee: We will not stop working until everyone who has backed us has received their rewards.\nShipping\nFulfillment: We are partnering with ArtOfPlay.com to handle all non-US fulfillment, and shipping within the United States will be handled by us. This will allow us to pass on some savings to our backers in the US. We have done extensive research, gotten advice from many other game and card publishers, and will be taking special precautions with respect to handling all packaging.\nCustoms Fees: The international (outside the US) shipping costs do not include customs fees. Customs fees due to imported goods will be the responsibility of the individual backer.\nCovid-19: The pandemic has caused a lot of uncertainty in overseas shipping costs and delays. The estimated delivery by Jan 2021 is a conservative estimate that includes shipping delays. We hope to have rewards delivered much earlier than that. We will be keeping our backers informed of the progress and possible delays.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nCovid-19 has thrown a wrench into many plans in 2020. Delays in overseas shipping may occur, depending on the country. We will keep our backers up-to-date to report on these types of delays. There may be import taxes for some countries that backers must pay before they can receive their goods. ArtOfPlay.com is handling our overseas fulfillment and they have a lot of experience in this area. If the volume exceeds our expectations, we may use ArtOfPlay.com to handle all fulfillment. \n\nWe expect to begin production about one month after the campaign is completed. We are working with reputable companies for production, so we do not expect significant delays. However, if businesses get shut down again due to Covid-19, there may be delays. We will continue working through challenges until our backers receive their rewards.\n\nFor the art book, we have our pricing set based on estimates from 2 different book publishers. We will be printing samples prior to the final print run to ensure the best quality for the cost.\n\nWe will not be satisfied with poor printing and production, so although our prototypes so far have turned out amazing, there is always a risk that the final version won't be as expected. This may cause delays, but we will reprint if necessary to ensure that the final delivered product is the best quality possible.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nProprietary Bicycle(R) playing card stock means premium quality playing cards\nSustainable materials\nSustainable forest paper\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nVegetable-based inks", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 13 or more", "title": "One Deck of Your Choice", "descp": "Get your choice of a single Green Nature or single Purple Magic deck.

To ensure that we remain respectful and authentic, we have employed a range of expert cultural consultants: Daniel Kwan, David Pena, Heba Elsherief, Mehr Husain, and Sachiko Burton. We would also like to thank our consultants, Salt and Sage Books, for their services in arranging specialist readers.\nHere are just some of the many mythological figures and maleficent monsters that you will find within. \nThis 230-page full-colour hardcover contains over one hundred stat blocks drawn from myths, legends, and history all across the world, each beautifully illustrated with full descriptions and designer's notes, with Challenge ratings from 1 to 35 (well, we had to include Lucifer, Cthulhu, and Fenrir!) \nForeword by James Ward (Deities & Demigods)\n\nMythological Figures is a weekly column on EN World by Mike Myler. It includes both historical and fictional figures built as NPCs using class levels and standard ability scores, and mythical monsters designed with statblocks that adhere to the stories told about them in our world. A new entry appears every week on Monday. The first entry was Achilles, in March 2018. This book compiles the column with all new art!  \nEntries come from origins as wide-ranging as British, Chinese, Norse, Greek, Japanese, Middle Eastern, American, Egyptian, Mesopotamian, European, and more.   \nThe back cover\nSo, who's in? \nThe 100-or so entries included in Mythological Figures & Maleficent Monsters were those requested to be featured in the weekly column by Mike Myler. They represent a fun and eclectic sprinkling of different archetypes, encompassing myth, legend, and history. Also found throughout the book are over 30 new magical items, such as Excalibur and Mj\u00f6lnir. Mike's column is ongoing, so if there's any mythological figure you'd like to see in the future, be sure to ask him on EN World!\nThe Masterclass Codex\nYou may note that some of the mythological figures in this book use classes not found in the 5E core rulebooks - Billy the Kid, for example, is a gunslinger. We have tried to keep to the core rules, but where the design demanded it, we recruited additional classes from The Masterclass Codex. \nThe Masterclass Codex, was a very successful Kickstarter we ran last year. It had over 2,600 backers, and is a very popular 5E book. You can pick up The Masterclass Codex, which contains 16 classes for your 5E games, right here.\nThis book contains the alchemist, cardcaster, diabolist, feywalker, morph, noble, occultist, bloodweaver, fatebender, gemini, geomancer, gunfighter, lodestar, monster tamer, savant, and tinkerer classes. \n\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 \"Brand new, original and fully developed classes that will make the other players at your table jealous.

The alchemist uses an almost scientific approach to magic to make alchemical discoveries. Will your alchemist become immune to poison, or discover the Elixir of Life? Will you delve into the Science of Creation and build a homunculus, or research the Science of Destruction and devise explosives? We also expand on the alchemist class with three new advanced studies: the Science of Illumination, the Science of Mutation, and the Science of Regeneration. Also included are two new spells, and an update which gives the alchemist a little more \u201coomph.\u201d\n Cardcaster: Seers of Fate. The cardcaster uses a tarot deck to release magic, playing cards to cast spells\u2014although she doesn\u2019t always have control over what spells are currently made available to her by the winds of fate! Also included are three subclasses: the Knight of Swords, which embodies mental force and determination; the Page of Wands, which embodies the magical power of creation; and the Queen of Cups, with embodies the emotions. This class is also supported by new feats and new secrets, including the King of Pentacles, which pertains to thrift and wealth; and the Jack of Beasts, which unleashes the trapped spirits of monsters.\n Diabolist: Students of Darkness. Diabolists deal with forbidden secrets and dark entities, grasping for power through dark pacts. While they have things in common with necromancers and warlocks, diabolists are something entirely more\u2026diabolical! Also included are two dark paths: the Demonic path and the Devilish path. We also introduce some conjured horrors, such as the accuser devil, contract devil, and more!\n Feywalker: A Taste of Primal Chaos. The feywalker is a mysterious warrior with mystical powers. Feywalkers can teleport short distances, breathe in air and water, and enchant others with a glance. They can also choose from three primal spheres: Beasts, Plants, or Entropy.\n Morph: Changing Faces. The morph is a shapechanging specialist, able to slide between different forms. Morphs have a choice of three essences\u2014the Doppleganger, thePrimordial Beast, and the Trickster\u2014and a selection of Morph Talents they can choose from and acquire.\n Noble: Chessmaster and Commander. Leader, tactician, and a source of inspiration, the full 20-level noble class is able to command and inspire through three paths: the Path of the Heart, the Path of the Brave, and the Path of the Tactician.\n Occultist: Freeing the Monster Within. The occultist allows you to play a monster, with a choice of three distinct paths: Abomination, Vampire, or Werecreature!

Bloodweavers fuel their magical powers with their own blood, enhancing their own prowess, healing or bolstering allies, and flaying open their foes.

Choose from the Bloodbinder, Crimson Witch, and Scarlet Reaper subclasses!\n Fatebender: Destiny\u2019s Chosen. At the extreme edges of fate\u2019s tapestry, fatebenders pull upon its fraying threads, tugging at the strands of chance. Fatebenders manipulate their own dice rolls as well as those of allies and enemies, further relying on luck to make uncanny discoveries, avoid lethal attacks, and make the most of their own strikes. Subclasses include the Mascot, Jinx, and Weaver!\n Gemini: Two\u2010Faced Warrior. Evading and confounding enemies, gemini create dangerous semi\u2010real multiples of themselves and copy their foes\u2019 techniques. Their duality affects more than how they wage war however, and each embodies two major contrasting ideals, never certain which will be at the fore the next time they wake. Will you select the Atavist, the Equalist, or the Reluctant Hero?\n Geomancer: Nature\u2019s Hearthmage. These mages turn the surrounding elements into potent weapons and tools and fuel their spells with the primal components of creation. Geomancers can also protect companions from harm and draw upon nature outside of battle to reveal reality\u2019s secrets. Four distinct orders\u2014the Conqueror, the Apothecary, the Architect, and the Rune Knight.\n Gunfighter: Black Powder Desperado.

The Bushwacker, Drifter, and Maverick make your choice of subclasses!\n Lodestar: Fractured Soul Given Form. In combat lodestars are poetry in motion, their innate powers bringing both wonder and woe. To keep from unraveling into madness these fractured souls must train and hone their skills, becoming masters of body and mind\u2014and their lodestones, magical spheres used to attack, defend, and more. The lodestar chooses from three methods: Control, Imagination, or Instinct.\n Monster Tamer: Companion of Beasts. Monster tamers bond with monstrous pets, whether beasts, exotic aberrations, slimes, or even draconic in nature! Though significantly weaker on their own, tamers with companions make for a potent and unique addition to any group of adventurers able to tolerate the presence of a monster in their midst. Select from the Animalist regimen, Monstrous regimen, and Oddball regimen.\n Savant: Mind Over Matter. Sometimes saving the day means weaponizing knowledge. Savants are brilliant detectives, iconic martial artists, and adventurous physicians, each utilizing genius where others rely on magic or brute power. Repositories of lore, savants also use canny combat tricks to put enemies at a disadvantage. You might be an Adversary, a Chirurgeon, or a Coordinator.\n Tinkerer: Engineer of Wonder. Tinkerers bring life to impressive contraptions, create incredible devices, and forge legendary destinies! When not making or improving mundane items, tinkerers use their technical genius to unleash elemental fury upon their foes, relying upon their own brilliance to resist any magic that might subvert their will. Steam Knights, Bombardiers, and Mechanics make up the tinkerer's choice of subclasses!\nCollector's Gift Set\nFor collectors, and those looking for a great gift, we are producing a special Collector's Gift Set of both hardcovers with gorgeous faux-leather covers. We will only be doing one print run of these, so get 'em while you can!\nFinal design may change\nBonus Villain Spotlights! \nWe have a collection of additional villainous figures from the pages of EN5ider. Unlike those in the book above, these myths are not from our own world; they're our own fantasy creations! \nThese operate a little like 'stretch goals' -- each of the below Villain Spotlights is a PDF which all backers who have backed \u00a315 or more (the PDF tier or higher) will get for free as we reach certain funding targets. The higher the funding reaches, the more bonus free stuff you get! And not only that...\n... we give them to you as soon as we hit the stretch goal. Not after the campaign. Right away. Just as a little thank you for the trust you put in us and our project.\n REACHED! \u00a310,000 Villain Spotlight: Jaxi the Blightgunner. Although they are certainly places of decay and death, swamps are also home to a great deal of life and they bustle with activity\u2014the popping of gasses rising out of the muck, the chittering of insects ever searching for food, and in Chokewater, the clack of colliding lead firing off an explosive charge from Jaxi's rifle! The Blightgunner has fiercely protected her lair for 16 years now, though she has long since ceased loving her home and desperately searches for a way to escape its influence without giving up the powers it has bestowed upon her. In addition to her statblock (CR 7) this article includes a trio of magic items: an acid bullet recipe, drypowder, and Thorncase. Designed by Peter Martin, illustrated by Herman Lau and Savage Mojo.\n REACHED! \u00a320,000 Villain Spotlight: Rosie Arkwright. Halloween is the theme of this supplement, and to help spookify your games we've got an unassuming horror to titillate, captivate, and eviscerate adventurers: the undead ragdoll Rosie Arkwright. Despite her small size she is durable, deadly, and able to create legions of creatures like herself, vastly outnumbering victims before swarming upon them with mystical needle and thread used to sew up mouths, eyes, and lives! Brilliantly penned by Andrew Engelbrite with a wonderful illustration by Xanditz.\n REACHED! \u00a330,000 Villain Spotlight: Dras'a Wolf. This entry into the Villain Spotlight series is all about the scourge of the seas men know as Dras'a the Wolf, a hobgoblin pirate with incredible ambitions and the cunning to see them through. Originally master of the Drelway Chain of islands, after capturing a learned shipmaker from afar the monstrous buccaneer has been preparing for when his abductee's drafts and designs lead to ocean-worthy vessels, boats that will unleash him and his underlings to become a scourge upon the open waves.\n REACHED! \u00a340,000 Villain Spotlight: Skrivena Moc. Usually found deep within a dungeon near the site of a bloody battle, the blade Skrivena Moc seems at first to be a powerful weapon able to sear foes with fire and strike through even the toughest armor. What more it speaks to its wielders, offering advice and admiration in equal parts\u2014but only to gain their trust, convincing them that their unnatural attachment to it is nothing to fear all the while it slowly consumes their very soul! This devious intelligent magic item and creature was written by Andrew Engelbrite and illustrated by Rachel Maduro.\n REACHED! \u00a350,000 Villain Spotlight: Eshaq the Zealoutous. Eshaq was once the prophet of an evil deity. His reward for a lifetime of faithful servitude was being embalmed and interned in a temple but he was quickly forgotten with the passage of time. 200 years since the last of his disciples have perished Eshaq has risen to spread the gospel of his now dead god. A CR 17 undead creature from Robert Lashley; illustrated by Indi Martin. Also includes details and map of of Eshaq's lair, plot hooks, and the new Zealotous Undead template.\n REACHED! \u00a360,000. Villain Spotlight: Syndrathrax the Soul Eater. A mighty CR 27 monster! While technically an ancient red dragon, Syndrathrax\u2019s necromantic transformations and attempted apotheoses have forever altered her. Though she shares the massive size of her fellow red wyrms she is gaunt and skeletal, and her scales sapped of their red luster and now bone white. Thanks to the necromantic energy that permeates her body she radiates a faint spectral glow that she can mask when she chooses--the souls of those that she has swallowed are sometimes seen struggling vainly to escape in this light.\n REACHED! \u00a370,000. Villain Spotlight: Granny Buccus. Sweet, maternal, a dab hand in the kitchen, Granny Buccus is the heart of the town of Cridhe Briste. As the town\u2019s baker she provides the people with bread, cakes, and pastries\u2014on special occasions she even makes her famous  and beloved Boiled Tarts. The adoring townsfolk don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re under the spell of a succubus, ready and willing to do whatever 'Granny' asks of them!  By Anna Blackwell; illustrated by Alba Palacio.\n REACHED! \u00a380,000. Villain Spotlight: Glamdrellyxxana the Gold. A gold dragon druid under the influence of an ancient curse, Glamdrellyxxana believes the only way to ensure that the world remains \u2018good\u2019 is to destroy all humanoid life. From her lair in a mountain lake she's amassed an army of plant creatures to sweep down across the world and cleanse it of the blight from meddling civilizations destined to bring ruin with their advancement, yet the dragon often feels melancholy about the need to destroy so many living things. Glamdrellyxxana is resigned to this course of action however, convinced by fell visions of an industrialized future\u2014and distracted by mind-altering plants when the guilt becomes too much to bear. By Will Gawned; illustrated by J\u00falio Rocha.\n REACHED! \u00a390,000 Villain Spotlight: Vengar the Reader. Goblins are known for many things\u2014reading is not typically on that list, but it's not like Vengar is a typical goblin. Once a trapfinder for the Chokeleaf tribe, this errant necromancer went entirely off the deep end after selfishly stealing an ancient tome to fulfill his ambitions of power. The cursed book has sucked away his vitality and now Vengar travels from tribe to tribe posing as a shaman, utilizing everything he can to acquire more magics able to extend his piteous life before the dark entities he's pledges his soul to come calling for his debt. In addition to his statistics (CR 5), Vengar has access to a variety of enhanced undead that explode, ignite, poison, become conduits of deathly energies, and even hide other monsters inside their bodies. Designed by Charlie Brooks, illustrated by Renan Moraes.\n REACHED! \u00a3100,000. Villain Spotlight: Ezekial.Ezekial is a minotaur gifted (or maybe cursed) with intelligence and cunning beyond that of most of his kin. Ezekial is the leader of a small band of thieves who are on a crime spree stealing priceless artifacts and rare tomes of knowledge. This article describes Ezekial, his goals and personality, a description of his band of thieves, and lists possible plot-hooks that involve Ezekial.\nREACHED! \u00a3110,000. Villain Spotlight: Bezkusmet the Unscaled. Dragons are known to be terrifying but all pale in comparison to Bezkusmet the Unscaled. As his name suggests there is no hue or substance to his draconic scute leaving his musculature and skeleton bared for the world to see, lattices of finger-thick veins and arteries the size of a human\u2019s wrist inexorably pumping blood across his utterly naked body. Only a thin sheen of transparent magic holds Bezkusmet\u2019s organs and muscles in place, the last of the twisted supernatural energies of his birthright all that keeps him intact. By Mike Myler; illustrated by Claudio Pozas and Ekaterinya Vladinakova.\n\u00a3130,000. Monstrous Menagerie: From Stranger Woods. Four fantastical new fey monsters for your 5E game! The goat-horned ochokochi with a bony cleaver; the capricious trickster poludnitsa; the angelic-looking samovila, ladies of drought and harvest; and the repulsive via, with their gaze of dread. These creatures are inspired by Eastern European folklore.\nWe'll unveil more if we're lucky enough to reach those funding goals! \nAdd-Ons\nWant more than just one of each book?

We hope to resume when it is safe to do so. There was and will be no fee but voluntary contributions on the day were/will be welcome; we didn't/won't track who donates what. You have to be at least 18 years old and RSVP through the site: https://www.meetup.com/London-DnD/. Then you just turn up at the main venue before 1.30pm on the Saturday and get assigned to a game. No need to bring or prepare anything, and no knowledge of the rules required: we would/will have beginners' games every Saturday as well as games for more experienced players. The Meetup started in 2006.

However, it would not have been possible without the support of 13 of your favorite publishers who partnered with me to see their logo, as well as their most popular games turned into handmade component mosaics. Whether you want to brighten up your kitchen, geek up your office so you can have your co-workers ask you about board games, or spruce up your game room - this is the perfect calendar for you. \nEvery image I create takes between 3 to 8 hours to assemble. Sometimes I use a reference image to help me with proportions, but I also like to go with the flow for some creations. I begin the process by choosing the colors I need from the game boxes I know contain the right pieces. Once I have the correct components, I plan out where each part will go. As I carefully lay the pieces I am constantly moving them into just the right place! I use a pencil to move pieces in tight areas because it helps with precision. Photographing each image takes almost an hour. Depending on which pieces I have used for the mosaic, the angle of the lighting needs to be adjusted. There is a lot of trial and error when taking the shots, and climbing up a chair over top of my gaming table is time consuming! \nPLAY\n\n\nEvery month has a component mosaic of a well-known board game as the main image, as well as a mosaic of that publisher's logo.\nThere is a write up about the publisher, including their website so you can check out their games.\nThe calendar includes a section to write the games you played during the month.\nAt the end of the calendar, you will find a 10x10 challenge page!\n\n\nPLAY\n\nYou asked for prints, coasters and magnets; so here is your chance! When you manage your pledge in Crowd Ox, you will have the opportunity to add the following: \n set of 4 Wingspan-inspired coasters (*Not an official Stonemaier Games product) These coasters are 3 mm thick, made of hardboard with a glossy finish, and have a cork underlay so they do not scratch your furniture.\n$US17 / $C23 for the set \n Alternate set of 4 coasters \n\n 8\"x 8\" and 12\"x 12\" photo quality prints for your game room! (frame not included)\n$US10 / $C14 for the small print and $US15 / $C20 for the large \n 10 assorted magnets (2.5\" x 2.5\" approximately) \n $US15 / $C20 for the set \nThe shipping will be added in the pledge manager when you finalize your transaction.\nFirst of all, I want to thank the gaming community and all its members who have supported me since the beginning. Thomas Covert (BGR), I am so grateful for your friendship, your advice and support. I would not be where I'm at in the gaming industry without you. Blake Howatson, thank you for putting up with a messy game room for me to do my art and thank you for your support in this project and for tolerating my grumpy days. Marc Specter (Grand Gamers Guild), thank you for being such a good friend and for all your advice on the campaign. Daryl Andrews, Rob Byers and Steve Robertson, thank you for lending me games for components I needed but did not have. Helaina Cappel(Burnt Island Games), thank you for you help with the campaign. Thank you to all the Instagram friends I have made over the past few months who have shared my work on their social media. To those who created content to help spread the word about my work: Angelica Lazary (Married Meeples), Katia Dupras (Meeple QC), Jonathan Flike(Atomic Automaton), The Lonestar Meeple podcast, Board Game Halv, Bjorn Ottevaere, Chris Goodlet (The Charity Board Gamer), Conor McGoey (Inside Up Games), David Abadie (Patate des t\u00e9n\u00e8bres), Adam Singer (Shelf Clutter Games) and I'm sure I forgot some, I am forever grateful.  Last but not least, thank you to the 13 publishers who joined in on this project, and for also sending games to make sure I would have pieces to represent you in my work. Without you, this calendar would not have been possible. \nI will send a survey within the next 2 weeks, using the CrowdOx pledge manager system, to the email address associated with your Kickstarter account.

Players inhabit their character for the entirety of the 90-minute play session, and instead of speaking, send text messages back and forth to the other characters in a group chat, as well as individually, as though they aren\u2019t in the same place together. \nHaunting beautiful, deeply personal, and highly innovative Alice is Missing puts a strong focus on the emotional engagement between players, immersing them in a tense, dramatic mystery that unfolds organically through the text messages they send to one another. Right at home with games like Life Is Strange, Gone Home, Oxenfree, and Firewatch, it\u2019s designed to feel as much like an event-style experience as it does a role-playing game.\nAlice Is Missing runs over a single session of 2-3 hours, with 3-5 players. In the first 45 minutes, players create their characters, their relationships to Alice, and their ties with each other. The next 90 minutes are spent uncovering secrets and unearthing clues in an attempt to discover where Alice is, and who is behind her disappearance.\nThough text messages seem to be the most common mode of communication in our modern era, they are rarely utilized as a storytelling medium.\nThe integration of texting into the gameplay unlocks a brand new way to play RPGs that is unlike anything you\u2019ve likely experienced before. It\u2019s personal, immersive, and perfect for remote play.\n\nPowered by simple but unique card mechanics that give everyone equal footing in telling the story, the game runs without a GM, or gamemaster, and instead empowers the players to create the story together.\nWhile in-game time is fluid and the text messages could take place over the course of a day or more, the actual gameplay lasts a total of 90 minutes and is accompanied by a beautifully cinematic, licensed music playlist (featuring artists such as Message To Bears, This Patch of Sky, Justin LaPointe, and Be Still The Earth) which acts as both a timer and a soundtrack for the game.\nYou\u2019ll start by choosing characters, drawing a motive for how that character acts, and assigning relationships to one another. Then, using the appropriate prompts on your character card, each player will record a secret voicemail to be played at the end of the game.\nYou\u2019ll then establish some important information about your town of Silent Falls by choosing suspects and locations you think could have played a part in Alice\u2019s disappearance. Lastly, you\u2019ll receive Clue Cards that will be used during the game to generate information about the mystery you\u2019re unraveling.\nOnce the timer starts and the game begins, you\u2019ll flip your Clue Card when the number on the timer hits the number on the Clue Card\u2019s back. This will often result in you drawing a card from the Suspect or Location deck and combining it with the prompt on the Clue Card to create the information your character uncovers.\nThis clue is then worked into the text conversation between the characters organically.\n\nThese clues will continue to be revealed throughout the game, building tension and heightening the stakes until the 10-minute card flips, and the game comes to its climactic end.\n Once the timer goes off at 90 minutes, players will have the opportunity to send one last text message before the secret voicemails play over the closing music track. Once the voicemails are finished and the current song ends, the game comes to a close. \nBy putting its lens on the relationships, tensions, and story arcs between the characters looking for Alice just as much as the search for Alice itself, the game challenges players to explore aspects of emotional intimacy and personal connection in a unique and accessible way.\nAlice Is Missing inherently deals with mature themes and potentially-difficult topics such as gender, sexuality, violence, and grief. We\u2019ve been lucky enough to bring on the incredibly talented Lauren McManamon (Girl Underground, Good Society: A Jane Austen RPG, Codex) as our editor to ensure these topics are approached in a thoughtful and responsible manner. \nWe\u2019ve also included important tools to help navigate these themes at the table (and off the table) to ensure everyone has both an exhilarating and positive experience.\nThough the game has been in development for the last year, in an unintentional way, it mirrors the reality we now face during this era of social distancing; the craving for connection despite the distance that may be between us.\nAlice is Missing provides a unique way to play without the traditional hang-ups that come with trying to structure a Virtual Table Top session. Since the only time you'll need to 'go to the table' is to grab a card. The meat of gameplay exists on your mobile devices.\n We\u2019ve put a great deal of work into ensuring Alice Is Missing will be available as a marketplace item on Roll20 not long after the campaign ends. With the lack of in-person gaming opportunities given the current social distancing orders in place around the world, we hope by making the game available in this format quickly, it will allow players to share a unique roleplaying experience together from the comfort and safety of their own home.\nThe Roll20 version of the game will not replace the use of players\u2019 phones for sending text messages back and forth during the game. It will instead serve as your shared table during online play, allowing everyone to interact with the cards that drive the narrative forward.\n For those of you who would rather not use Roll20, we are offering a PDF with a Print on Demand cards via DTRPG to use with your other messaging systems of choice. It\u2019s important to emphasize, however, that the cards need to be communally accessible individually via a cloud or other software to manage remote play in this way.\nWe plan to release the digital version of Alice is Missing in July 2020. We plan to release the physical version to our backers in November 2020, with the game being made available to stores soon after through a global publishing deal with Renegade Game Studios. We will use DriveThruRPG for all of our digital fulfillment.\n For this project, we will be charging shipping as we fulfill each item.

It's time to expand the possibilities\u2026\nThe Ultimate Guide to Alchemy, Crafting, & Enchanting is the perfect addition to the world's greatest roleplaying game! This supplement introduces a brand new game mechanic for creating items, potions, and magical goods. It also provides hundreds of new, never-before-seen illustrated magic items, both in-book and available separately as magic item decks!\nThis book contains a chapter for each creative discipline, featuring various recipes for creating a wide array of different items, from the mundane to the magical.\n Alchemy: Reveal secrets hidden within the natural world, and bend them to your purposes. Brew potions of familiar and unknown effect, from the average to the otherworldly! Three alchemical specializations allow players to create destructive, restorative, and alterative potions of all kinds. Clever brewers may even be able to turn ingredients into concoctions never before seen...\n   Crafting. Set your hands to work to create clothing, armor, weapons, jewelry, trinkets, and other various oddities. Six specializations provide a wide variety of crafting options, allowing players to outfit entire parties, or even construct their own home base! Not even magic can replicate the complex creations of those that reach master rank...\n   Enchanting. Turn the average into the extraordinary by imbuing mundane items with magical power. Whether by runes, scrolls, the help of a deity, or the involvement of something more sinister, learn the craft of making some of the most coveted items in the game. But beware: enchanters toy with fickle fate to infuse items with such power, and may be risking their health, sanity, and destiny to do so...\nFollowing these chapters is a massive collection of magical and mundane items that can be both made, and used, in your games. These items vary from quirky and humorous, to legendary and deadly. The magic items are presented in a Magic Item Compendium, featuring 200+ magic items illustrated in beautiful color. These magic items can be purchased separately from the book in one of four Magic Item Decks for easy usage in-game:\nWeapons & Armor\nRods, Staffs & Wands\nRings & Wondrous Items\nPotions, Poultices & Powders\nThese decks are available both within pledge levels, and as add-ons once the project is complete!\n--- Important ---\nThe final card-count of these Magic Item Decks will depend on the ultimate number of items included in the book. While the book & decks will contain at least 200 magic items, this is always subject to increase, and may result in decks not including every single item (or may result in more decks being created, depending on funding... ;D)\nThe Ultimate Guide also introduces three fascinating new guilds known as Crafting Associations. To pursue alchemy, crafting, or enchanting, your character will join that discipline\u2019s association, which grants them certain benefits and advantages, due to the association\u2019s considerable influence. Your character will hone their craft and rank-up within the association over time, learning more varied and powerful recipes as their capabilities increase. \nBut be careful: behavior and attitude can affect an individual's standing within any association, and those who don\u2019t follow the rules could have considerable resources turned against them. When that possibility exists, is anyone foolhardy enough to take the associations on? Or would they, perhaps, continue crafting illegally, in secret..?\nWhile The Ultimate Guide to Alchemy, Crafting, & Enchanting is written primarily from this perspective, it also provides alternatives to the association system, should your group prefer simpler, or more streamlined, methods and systems of crafting.\nWe understand that your gaming budget is valuable. We appreciate every one of our backers, and would rather you spend your money on products that you see value in. So, to be certain you'll find something you like in this book, you should back this project if one or more of the following points pertain to you:\nI'm a game master, and I want to enhance my games with a new way for my players to enjoy crafting items.\nI'm a player, and I want to enhance my games with an interesting way to craft items.\nI want a rules-lite crafting system for my 5E games.\nI want new, creative items in my games.\nI love supporting 3rd party content from creators like Nord Games.\nI love collecting RPG material.\nIf you do decide to back this project, we will be honored that you have chosen to support our latest creative work, and will be so excited to bring you another great tool for your games! :)\n $40,000 - Novice Association Quests.

After nearly 20 successful campaigns and thousands of happy customers, we are confident in our ability to tackle both the creation and production of new products.\n\nHowever, after an unexpectedly eventful 2019 left us with delays on previous Kickstarter projects, we had to reassess our situation. It became very clear that our experience with Kickstarter did not equal experience with all the trials and tribulations that arise outside of it, and we were humbled by those mistakes.\n\nThus, in August 2019, Nord Games vowed to not begin another Kickstarter until all previous projects were successfully delivered, or in production. As of now, Objects of Intrigue card decks have been delivered, Spectacular Settlements is in production (with PDFs already delivered), and Treacherous Traps is in production as of February 3rd (we experienced delays with many of our overseas printers, with workers either on vacation for Lunar New Year, or affected by the recent coronavirus outbreak). Ultimate Bestiary: The Dreaded Accursed is our only exception to this promise, due to bereavement leave for our head artist. However, things are now getting nicely back on track, and we will be getting Dreaded Accursed into production as soon as the rest of the art is in; the remainder of the book is complete and in layout, so we are simply waiting for these last designs.\n\nAs far as other precautions we have taken to prevent further Kickstarter delays, we have:\n\n- Hired Marketing Manager Megan, and Project Manager Greg, to keep both this campaign, and all Nord Games efforts, on track.\n\n- Invested in new project management software to keep all employees up-to-date on all projects and efforts, across state and country lines.\n\n- Extended our estimated delivery date to account for any potential hiccups, and to ensure our creative team has ample time to work under more comfortable, less stressful conditions.\n\nIn spite of all of this, we are very aware that game development, and the production of a creatively intense product, is an unpredictable process. Complications, changes, and similar struggles are an ever-present reality, and we won\u2019t pretend otherwise. Trouble may still arise as we continue the creation of this unique new supplement. \n\nIf delays seem likely, we assure you that we will be open, honest, and swift in our communication of these delays to you. If immediate updates are not necessary, we will be sure to communicate any and all progress in our project updates made every other week.\n\nAny stated dates are goals presented, as realistically as possible, at the time they are given. Should the project change during the course of its development, dates will change accordingly. We hold very strongly to the principle that quality comes first, and a delayed game is better than a rushed one that is on time. We want you to be satisfied with every product you receive from us, and will do what is necessary to ensure the highest quality possible. Should delays or other changes ever prove necessary, we ask for your patience and understanding as you embark on another exciting adventure with us.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Novice", "descp": "Back now and upgrade your pledge later!

After much encouragement from our fans, Black Oak is proud to return to our line of dragon themed dice! We have had many requests to return to this theme as a full set of dice and, after some detailed product research, we are proud to present the full Dragon Polyhedral 7 Dice Set!\nThese dice are designed to capture the essence of the mighty dragons in all their glory. Each of the sets features a unique swirl or glitter mix that captures the coloration of a specific dragon and is inked with a bright color that represents its deadly breath weapon. The maximum value result on the die features our popular dragon design which has been well received by our fans out there!\nThe success of our Black Death project showed just how much our supporters want to see our themed dice in full sets and it also opened up new color possibilities for us. We have used some of the dice from the Black Death project to demonstrate what we can do with the Dragon polyhedral sets. Additionally, we have sampled some completely new colors to become part of this project.\nNot Your Average Dice\nIn a sea of competitors, we'd like to list out what makes these dice unique and why we believe they will hold a place of honor in your dice bag!\n Dragon Breath Swirl We're very proud of the coloration of our swirled dice. They feature a blend of two colors with an iridescent glimmer that came out fantastic! We think they are super cool and the blending method perfectly captures the billowing dragon breath attack!\n Glitterwing Dragons These glimmering dragons are infused with glitter and shine in the light. These new dragons rely on the same glitter effects from our Oblit-O-Tron and Black Death dice that have been well received with our customers. The glitter is incredibly fine and creates a lustrous shimmer.\n Larger Size Like all the dice we produce, these dice are larger and stand out on your game table. They tower over lesser dice and are easier to read.\n Draconic Design The thematic design on the maximum face of each die captures the power of the dragons!\n Choices Once funded, you will have the choice of any of the two base colors! As we unlock additional dragons, this will only add to the available options.\n Dragon Hoard Along the way through the project we will be unlocking several bonus stretch goals. If you select one of the Dragon Hoard reward levels, you can expect to receive one of each of these with your rewards shipment!\n Project Exclusives We have several items exclusive to this project. They are unique and fun and, of course, dragon themed!\n Dragons Awesome in their own right. Death from above!!\nColor Choices\nWe have sampled many new colors and selected what we feel are the most gorgeous for this project. We rejected quite a few samples, but were excited to discover some of the prettiest dice we have ever seen as well. Chief among these is Maelstrom (Sea Dragon) color mix which we have decided to make the lead dragon for the project and Silversinge (Cloud Dragon) which is a stretch goal. We brought the Maelstrom samples with us to several conventions this year and shared them with backers of our original Dragon d20 project and the response was overwhelmingly positive!\nBackers of our previous Dragon d20 project may be looking for more of the colors presented there. After consideration, we made the call to focus primarily on new colors for this project. That said, we could not present a new dragon project without a nod to the mighty Red Dragon. Further, there is every reason to think we will return to previous colors on a future project.\nYou Can Back with Confidence\nWhat you see is what you get on this and all of our projects! Black Oak Workshop always strives to show you photo samples of the actual product - not Photoshop renderings to get you excited that can then later leave you feeling let down when the product shows up. We carry an upfront investment to do this so that you can back with confidence. For this project, we have produced the molds and a full set of samples for the Sea Dragon.\nWe have an excellent track record on fulfillment and we work hard to beat delivery timelines. We have shipped on time or early on virtually every project!\nLoot the Dragon Hoard!\nWe're offering a dragon themed aspect to some our reward levels. Backers at reward levels that are flagged as being part of the Dragon Hoard will receive expanded loot direct from the Dragon's Lair! Backers who aren't interested in the added loot can save a little money and just go with the basics by selecting a reward level without the Dragon Hoard line item.\nAny unlocked item with the Dragon Hoard symbol above indicates Dragon Hoard backers will receive one copy of the item with their rewards shipment.\nProject Exclusives\nThe project exclusives from our Dragon d20 and Black Death projects were very well received and we are returning with new and cool loot for you! We have some great dragon themed exclusives lined up. These are offered as part of this project and will never be released again. The Dragon's Lair Dice Tower is not offered to International backers due to the higher risk associated with shipping international and the difficulty replacing them.\nNOTE: The project exclusives will NOT be offered in the pledge manager as quantities are strictly limited and tied directly to specific reward levels. If additional exclusives remain post fulfillment, we always offer them to our backers before releasing them for general sale.\nWe brought you the Epic Death d20 on our Black Death project and backers LOVED them. Now, we have the Epic Dragons! These huge d20s are great for making a statement! There are two options to choose from: The Epic Sea Dragon and the Epic Red Dragon.\nThese are hand assembled items using 3d printed faces and a tough rubber frame - they are light, but rugged. This mega d20 is 6.5\" from flat edge to edge and can be rolled and used in game!\nWe've partnered with an industry leader Dog Might Games to present a special Sea Dragon exclusive for you and their team stepped up with a beautiful, custom version of their Dragon Sheath dice box for us. It came out fantastic! These boxes are utterly gorgeous and Dog Might's reputation for quality speaks for itself. These will not be available again after the project has completed!\nYou can expect these great qualities:\nBeautiful all wood design with protective finish\nExclusive Sea Dragon design\nEmbedded magnets keep the lid securely in place\nHolds lots of dice - 8.5\" x 2.25\" x 2.0\"\nDog Might Quality - they will last for many years!\nAlong a rocky, remote coastline, a mighty Sea Dragon has made her lair beneath an abandoned wizard's tower. Deep in the cliff face, a wind carved cavern is home to a most fearsome dragon...beware the Dragon's Lair!\nThis one of a kind dice tower features our dragon icon on a tower that sits atop a broken cliff face. Let your dice clatter down through the bowels of the cavern beneath and spill out on the rocks below! At almost a foot tall with an 8\" base, this tower is a monster! It comes hand painted as in the photograph and will look incredible on your game shelf!\nNOTE: This custom 3d printed tower (PLA plastic) is based on designs licensed from Fat Dragon Games. Unmodified versions of the original .stl files can be purchased directly from Fat Dragon Games. Please check out their fantastic designs!\nFunding & Stretch Goals\nWe heard our backers on previous projects and we are going for it! We've got a higher funding goal than is normal for most of our projects. This is because we are driving hard to unlock the full polyhedral set and have chosen not to start with a single d6 or d20 as we have in the past. We will also be unlocking two colors which means two production runs for the sets.\nWe'll need your help to get there!\n Below is a text only summary of the project goals:\n $21,000 UNLOCKED! Funded!

Additional stretch goals are possible.\nPledge Manager & Add On Items\nLooking to expand your set? Need extra singles for your home game? No problem!\nWhat is the pledge manager? Post project, all backers will receive an email containing a link to the project survey. This will enable backers to make specific choices related to their pledge levels (set color choices etc) as well as allowing them an opportunity to make any additional purchases such as dice singles, additional polyhedral sets, dice bags or other products from our previous projects. Backers always receive a discounted rate on products related to the current project over what we will later offer them for online and at conventions. Backers will also pay for shipping costs and provide their shipping address as part of the pledge manager.\nOver-pledging by an additional amount during the funding period can help the project achieve the funding goal and unlock stretch goals. Any additional amount a backer would like to pledge over the base pledge amount will be available for purchases in the pledge manager process. Below is a general list of items/prices that will be in the pledge manager.\nItems from this project:\n$9 per Unlocked Dice Bag (normally $10)\n$12 per Unlocked 7-Dice Polyhedral Set (normally $15)\n$3 per Single Polyhedral Die from the Dragon sets (will not be for sale on our website)\n$5 per Void Dragon d20\n$7 per Unlocked Pin (normally $7.50)\nOther items from previous projects:\n$10 per Dice Bag\n$15 per Polyhedral Dice Set\n$5 per standalone d20/d6 (Black Death, original Dragons, etc)\n$7.50 per Pin\nShipping\nAll shipments will be processed through the United States Postal Service. Domestic (USA) orders will ship utilizing First-Class Mail or Priority Mail (based on reward). International orders will ship utilizing First-Class Package International Service. All rewards will be packed securely in an effort to minimize risk of damage during shipping. Tracking numbers are emailed to backers at the email address on file with Kickstarter upon printing of the respective shipping label.\nNOTE: For the Dragon's Lair reward level, we are only shipping to the USA. We cannot risk lost international shipments for these items as replacements will not be possible. All shipping fees will be collected post the campaign as part of the BackerKit pledge manager process. Please see the shipping matrix below for cost estimates.\nFor our International backers, we are adding a note that the shipping costs are reflective of what the USPS charges us. We do not have overseas distribution and likely will not for some time as we are a small shop. As we grow, we hope to be able to get those costs down for you as we know they are painful. All tariffs/taxes/fees associated with international shipments are the responsibility of the receiving party.\nRetailers\nAre you a verifiable brick and mortar retailer?

We'd love to earn your business!\nSimply back at the 'Retailer Only' level and contact us through the creator contact area of the Kickstart page or through our website here and we can go over the details. Verified brick and mortar retailers (no online retailers) receive a wholesale rate on all our products.

Abbie brings emotional connection and  soulful pop vocals. Dave is a badass genre-bending cellist and Jon pulls it all together with his fluid percussion style.\nWe've worked on one another's albums in the past, but we\u2019ve kept mostly to ourselves when writing songs. Abigail would write a song and invite Dave to contribute, or vice versa.  On this album, we\u2019ve been taking a different approach by writing and creating together, so both our voices are present lyrically as well as musically. We\u2019re amplifying each others strengths and pulling from a much broader palate as we discover new approaches which are taking us into uncharted territory.\nHere are a couple of snippets from some of our rough drafts (from Dave's basement, not the recording studio): \nWhere We're At\nWe\u2019ve already made significant progress on five or so songs in the recording studio. However, that much has taken us close to two years to complete, and we\u2019d really like to accelerate that rate to complete a full length album. Right now, our method is to play a bunch of shows to make some money... use the money to record a bit\u2026 play a bunch of shows\u2026 record a bit\u2026 At that rate, you get five songs in 2 years.\nThe way we\u2019d like to work is to involve our community to fund a Kickstarter so we can get this DONE! Record (and produce and promote) an album efficiently, and THEN play a bunch of shows to share what we\u2019ve created.\nThen we want to try something that is totally new to us: publicity. We believe our music and our message is important, and has the power to unite and heal people. But we need help from someone who knows what they\u2019re doing in order to really get it out there. This may be the biggest thing we\u2019ve left undone in many of our other projects, even though it may actually be one of the most important keys to a successful release.\nWe plan to release the album in September of 2020, allowing not only for the recording and editing across distant states, but also a 3 month publicity campaign including a single releases and music videos leading up to the official release of the album.\nAbbie and Dave\nMaking an album is time consuming and expensive, and we want to do it right.\nHere's an estimate of our expenses:\nRecording and mixing 10 days at $600/day - $6000 http://willis-sound.com/ (Jim Roll)\nMusician Fees - $2000+\nMastering - $1000\nArtwork and Design - $1650 https://www.circlesandsquaresart.com/, https://www.gnddesigngirl.com/ \nReplication -$3000\nPublicity (2 month campaign) - $2000\nIf we meet our goal, here are our stretch goals\nMusic Video - $3000 (if we reach 18k) http://www.tokoshiiki.com \nVinyl (run of 100) -$1500 (if we reach 19.5k)\nRewards\nWe love the kickstarter community, and we want our friends/fans to be as involved as possible with our creation process! We hope to get to know you better, and you us. We've put together a variety of reward options depending on how intimate you'd like to get. You could have some art (bracelets or rosin boxes) made by Abbie or Dave. You could learn something from us (cello lessons or acro yoga). You could spend time with us (creativity retreats, home cooked meals, house concerts). No matter what, you will receive SO MUCH GRATITUDE from us. THANK YOU FOR CONTRIBUTING!

It's tricky to make music your career, especially when we can't reliably count on selling CDs as much as we have in the past. This means two things: music needs patronage (You!) to flourish, and then musicians need to get out in front of more and more people so that we can make connections, sell merch, keep this ball rolling. With a successful Kickstarter, we'll have a wonderful push to get our music out into the world and put it in front of more people.\n\nThat fact that we live in two different states is tricky, but over the past two years we've developed the skills to make it work. We have weekly meetings in which we assign ourselves tasks and hold one another accountable for their completion. Then we put together 3-4 tours each year in order to have time to work on new material and maintain our fanbase. It\u2019s challenging to then find time to record\u2026 again, a successful Kickstarter will give us the cushion we need to take a couple of weeks to really sit down and focus on making a beautiful thing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Everything Helps!", "descp": "For those who just don't need more stuff.

Its cramped corridors and dark chambers are populated with androids designed by ASAMM to be so advanced that they are often indistinguishable from humans. Because of this, the factory has been blockaded by a fleet of volunteer corporate vessels who have instructions to kill anything that enters or leaves Cloudbank, otherwise known as: The Deep.\nEvery NPC you encounter is a potential friend or foe and smart players will survive by relying on their wits over their weapons. You can't shoot your way out of The Deep.\nThe Cloudbank was coined The Deep by a community of scavengers who camp on the outskirts of the blockade. They call themselves Divers, and their fascination with the strange androids and creations found inside The Deep keeps them coming back. Sometimes to their own detriment. More than one diver has fallen prey to the Bends, a terrible condition where due to the continuous exposure to The Deep's mysteries the Diver forgets whether they are human or not and abandons their friends and loved ones to live in The Deep for the rest of their lives as the android they truly believe they are. That's why the Divers have a saying, \"No matter what they say, you never leave anyone behind in The Deep.\" \nNo matter what it looks like, everything in The Deep thinks it's human.\nIn a lot of ways, Gradient Descent is a love letter to the classic megadungeon from fantasy rpgs, movies like Blade Runner, and comics like Blame!. We've done everything we can to make this massive, sprawling facility with all its nooks and crannies a fun place to explore for players, and an easy game to run for Wardens.\nGradient Descent packs a ton of content into its humble zine-sized pages, including: \n Hundreds of rooms to explore: Gradient Descent is built from the ground up to be a megadungeon zone that players can return to over many sessions or an entire campaign. They can make quick dives in to scavenge for artifacts, or they can setup camp with the Divers and try and figure out just exactly what's going on down there.\n Hordes of Ghosts: The Deep is ultimately a machine. A very complex, godlike machine, but a machine none the less. And inside this machine are ghosts, echoes and reverberations of brainscans taken by the AI in order to build its sentient androids. Players can't kill them, they'll need to be more thoughtful when they approach these beings.\n Dozens of unique artifacts: You can make it rich in The Deep if you're a little smart, a little crazy, and very lucky. Gradient Descent comes with dozens of unique artifacts to serve as rewards or objectives for Wardens to place all around The Deep.\n A host of factions: The Deep is crammed with different interests. From the Divers, obsessed humans (?) who plumb the depths of The Deep searching for rare android crafted artifacts, to the various communities of androids all living in fear of their AI overlord, or else, the kill teams and Divers who regularly invade their besieged home.\nAnd much, much more!\nWe've spent a ton of time working this module to be the most usable, well written, edited, illustrated, and designed module it possibly can be, and we can't wait to show you the finished product.\nWork in progress. Not final.\nEvery spread is bullet pointed out so that Wardens don't have to read huge blocks of text to know what's in a given area. They can simply read the bullet points and bolded entries, and if players want more information, further details are in nested lists beneath each bullet point. \nWork in progress. The room starts with a quick, one sentence description of what's going on and is then followed by bullet points. Wardens can quickly scan the bullet points to give players the most relevant information, only reading further down when they have to.\nDangers (like traps or enemies) are highlighted in red and with a unique icon (!) so that you're not five minutes into exploring a room before you find out there was a gun-toting maniac in there the whole time. Additionally, the bottom of the page has icons for whether there's artificial gravity on the page, Oxygen, or light -- with icons then used on individual rooms when they differ from the area at large. \nMothership is an ENnie award-winning (Best Game, Gen Con 2019) sci-fi horror roleplaying game that places a huge emphasis on being easy to run but difficult to beat. It uses a simple d100 roll-under system similar to Call of Cthulhu, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay and the Basic Role Playing system. It's incredibly easy to hack, so you can meet your table's needs (increasing or decreasing the difficulty as necessary to create a fun and challenging time) without a lot of effort.\nYou play as one of four classes: Teamster, Android, Scientist, or Marine, and then customize that class to your liking with a branching skill tree. \nClick the image to download the character sheet!\nWe wanted building characters to be easy so we put all the rules for character creation right there on the character sheet. With a game this deadly it's important that players are able to get right back into the action if their character dies. And why is it so deadly? Well, aside from just taking damage (from, you know, like, a scalpel wielding void raider) your characters also accumulate Stress which builds up until something terrible happens (like oh, you know, seeing your crew mate get ripped in half by the thing that just crawled its way out of the airlock), after which you'll make a Panic Check. If you roll poorly your character could be inflicted with awful conditions ranging from chronic night terrors to permanent phobias to full on psychopathic rampages!\nTrust us, it's fun.\nIf you want to check out the system the PDF of the Player's Survival Guide is Pay What You Want on itch.io or DriveThruRPG. Take a look and let us know what you think. We've also got a great Discord server with an awesome community full of people ready to answer questions and help out with anything you need.\n Gradient Descent is written, edited, and produced by an incredible award winning team:\nWritten by Luke Gearing (Fever Swamp, Broken System)\nArt by Nick Tofani (Instagram, Patreon)\nEdited by Jarrett Crader (Troika!, Mothership, Ultraviolet Grasslands)\nLayout by Sean McCoy (Mothership, Two Rooms and a Boom)\n\n\n\nWork in progress.

This is my very first kickstarter project, but not my first experience in the miniature world. I'm Arnaud Fournet from France aka KafArt Studio, 2D/3D amateur artist. I model and print 3D miniatures since 2014. in 2016, I created a small range of miniatures: https://www.sygillforge.com/\nThis project aims to share these spartan models with you, if like me you are a role-player or figurine player,  you may find a character figurine that you will like.\nThis fan movie inspired and \"hero\u00efc-fantasy\" miniature project aims for having fun, collecting, playing or painting these legendary warriors... The SPARTAN. \nMany skirmish and wargame offer a free choice of miniatures such as Iron and Honor, Song of blades and heroes or more recently SAGA in the age of magic, and more.... Here is a warband for this kind of game.\nThe miniatures are digital sculpts and 3D printed (with EnvisionTec Perfactory Micro, HD printer), then they are produced in high quality resin. All the miniatures are in multiparts, unassembled and unpainted.\nThe manufacture of resin cast miniatures will be ensured by Anakron studio. Anakron is also a talented sculptor and painter, he is just as effective in casting ! Take a look at the work of this complete artist : https://www.anakron.fr\nHere is an overview of some 3D print master and sample resin cast.\n The Core Set and Add-ons\nThe Core Set is a set of models available to my backers, according to various options :\nFor the 12 \u20ac backers (Hilote pledge), the choice of 1 miniature (and 1 textured base) in the core set, you can of course choose other miniatures, just increase your contribution by 12 \u20ac per miniature of the Core set.\nFor the 40 \u20ac backers (Citizen Pledge), the choice between the Lambda box or Kieros box (including 4 different miniatures and 4 textured bases).\nFor the 72 \u20ac backers (Hoplite Pledge) the entire core set (8 miniatures and 8 textured bases) with the Phalanx box.\nAdd-ons are avalaible for all bakers, you just have to increase your pledge amount by the amount of the chossen add on.

In Agon, you create and play these heroes, crafting their epic tale into an immortal legend.\nOn their way back home from the war, the heroes have become lost among strange islands populated by mythical creatures, dire beasts, treacherous landscapes, legendary kingdoms, and desperate people\u2014all somehow cursed or abandoned by the cruel power of the capricious gods.\nIt falls to you to seize this opportunity for greatness\u2014to set things right in these lost lands, overcome the trials of gods, monsters, and people, prove the glory of your name, and win your way back home.\nAgon is a game of fast-paced heroic adventure inspired by ancient legends. The Hero Players create heroes who wander from island to island, engaging in contests, resolving strife, appeasing the gods, and seeking their way home. The Strife Player presents each island\u2014its strife, opponents, and other characters\u2014by revealing the situation, asking leading questions, and judging contests.\nEach session contains an adventure on a dangerous island. Every island suffers from strife which the heroes fight to overcome with their strength, courage, and wits. The gods watch and judge, granting favor or wrath, depending on how the heroes resolve the situation. \nEach island takes approximately two to four hours to play through, depending on the size of the group and your desire to wax poetic or dive right into the action. When the heroes leave and continue their voyage, the gods light their way among the stars of the Vault of Heaven, leading them to the next island and closer to returning home.\nThis game is set in an ancient fantasy world of myths and legends. Here you\u2019ll find titanic monsters, vengeful spirits from the underworld, ruthless marauders, conniving kings, vicious gods\u2014and all the other elements of fables and epic poems of old. This setting is yours to play with as you wish. There is no call for historical or literary accuracy\u2014it\u2019s strongly discouraged, in fact. Let yourself be inspired by those enchanting stories, but make your mythic world your own.\nThe racism, sexism, ableism, and other bigotries of the past can be confronted head on or set aside as you see fit. A game of Agon is first and foremost an excuse for you and your friends to hang out together and have fun telling a rousing story\u2014be mindful and include the elements that everyone wants to explore; discard the rest.\nThe first edition of Agon (which we\u2019re now affectionately calling Agon 2006) was written by John Harper. It was a game of battle and competition, which pitted the antagonist against the band of heroes, and in turn the heroes against each other to win the greatest glory.\nThis new edition of Agon written by John Harper and Sean Nittner embraces the friendly competition of Agon 2006 while also rewarding heroes for the strength and compassion required to support one another, form bonds, and extol the virtues of their companions.\nNew to Agon? Here\u2019s what to expect!\nRules for creating your heroes of myth and legend, building the glory of their name, and forging their eternal legend.\nDivine favor, bonds, and pathos for each hero to call upon to reach further than a mortal could. \nIslands full of gods, monsters, and people to challenge your heroes.\nGuidance for the Strife Player, who presents the challenges on the island.\nThe Vault of Heaven to record your progress towards returning home and the ire of the gods.\nA one-roll resolution system that determines which side gets their way, who is best, and who suffers.\nContests and Battles that reveal the heroes' greatness and glory as well as what they care most about.\nPlayed Agon 2006? Here's some changes you\u2019ll notice:\nThe Antagonist is now the Strife Player, and the role is designed to be easier for anyone to pick up and start playing, without the need for prep or extensive rules mastery. \nWe\u2019ve created a variety of islands full of monsters, people, and gods, each with their own desires for the heroes. \nThe conflict system now rewards heroes based on the challenge presented. Whatever difficulty the Strife Player rolls on their dice will match the glory awarded to the hero who is best!\nBattle has been greatly streamlined and gets resolved in three contests. You engage your foe to outmaneuver them, clash to control the outcome of the contest and defend against their threats, and then enter the finale to find out who is the victor.\nThe focus has shifted from replicating the myths of old to playing fast paced adventures inspired by the legends of the ancient world.\nThe Prototype PDF: As a backer of this project, you get immediate access to the current version of the PDF before the Kickstarter campaign concludes ([[click here]], or see the link under the video up top). We want to make it easy for you to decide if this game is for you, particularly if you're new to RPGs. The prototype PDF still lacks some art and a few other finishing touches, but there's enough there for you to get started playing right now.\nThe Completed PDF(s): Backers at $15 and up will receive the final, art-complete PDF as soon as it's ready. They will also receive all digital stretch goals (see below) which are unlocked during the course of this campaign.\nThe Hardcover Book: Those backing at $25 and higher will receive one (or more, depending) copy of the 6\"x9\" formatted hardcover book with approximately 144 pages and a matte finish on the cover. At our initial funding level, this will be a black and white book\u2014but you can help us make sure it's in color (see below). The book will ship by April 2020. You can increase your pledge by $25 for each additional copy you want to receive. Backers at this level also receive PDF copies of the final book and any digital stretch goals which are unlocked. \nCode for At-Cost Print-On-Demand Softcover: We will also offer a print-on-demand softcover version of Agon, primarily for our international backers who don't want to wait for the physical book to circulate through distribution for sale at game stores local to their country. Backers at $15 and up will receive a special code to buy the print-on-demand (POD) version from DriveThruRPG at-cost (i.e., the cost of manufacturing the book) plus shipping. DriveThru has developed a number of print-on-demand partners outside the USA to help provide options that will ship locally, or at least from a country that often has more favorable shipping rates than the USA does. We've gone with this as softcover both to reduce the cost to you (it will likely still run between $11 and $12 USD not including shipping) and to make clear that the POD book is separate from the official-release hardcover version we're putting into distribution, rather than the same thing. \nFirst Look with Adam Koebel:\nAgon with John Harper, Sean Nittner, Tara Hynson, and Stras Acimovic on Actual Play: \nAgon  with Sean, Rev, Jake, Tass, and Teej on The Critshow: \nStretch Goal 1: Upgrades & More Islands ($20,000)\nOur first stretch goal is all about adding some extra bells and whistles to the book as well as show gratitude to the freelance talent working on the project!\nWhen we hit this goal at $20,000 the Path of Glory package (available to backers at $15 and up) gets its first new items:\n High-resolution digital wallpaper of the book's cover art to haunt your digital workspace\n Six more islands of adventure from the creators of Agon, to be included in the book\nAdditionally all who back at the Heroes of Legend package (available to backers at $25 and up), will receive these upgrades at no additional cost:\n Full color interior art for the physical book\n Beautiful endpapers and the signature Evil Hat spot gloss on the cover.\nStretch Goals 2 & beyond: New Islands! ($25,000+)\nBeyond our first stretch goal we'll bring in other creators to devise new islands full of strife and glory. These will be delivered digitally, at no added cost, for all Path of Glory package backers at $15 and up. \nAllison Arth ($25,000 UNLOCKED): Allison Arth is a poet and game designer who studied ancient Greco-Roman literature and language and literally kept a copy of The Odyssey in her glovebox for a decade so she could always find a way home.

When not writer for or about games, they're liking talking about language, cooking, baking, folklore, and fashion.\nWhitney Marie Delaglio ($35,000 UNLOCKED), aka @widdledragon, is a game designer, artist, and creator of the brand Little Wish Productions. Her aquatic roleplaying game, Prism ( https://www.littlewishproductions.com/games/ ), is about sensuality, relationships, and conflict resolution. As a support class in the gaming community, she is an advocator of providing a safe space for intimacy and emotional vulnerability. \nJeeyon Shim ($40,000 UNLOCKED) (she/her) is a roleplaying game designer from both coasts of the continental United States. She\u2019s lived in Oakland, California for about a decade and the greater Bay area for even longer, where she teaches wilderness survival skills and land connection through larping. Her work focuses on bridging the alienation modern urban people often feel from the land and their roots, examining the overlap of race dynamics in land access and larp access, and immersion in the sacred aspects of (re)connecting with the land.\nKira Magrann ($45,000 UNLOCKED) is a tabletop roleplaying game designer, queer nonbinary cyborg, and snake friend living in Columbus, Ohio. She is known best for her most recent games A Cozy Den (about lesbisnakes in winter time) and Something Is Wrong Here (an uncanny emotional love letter to David Lynch's work). Kira has a Patreon where she designs experimental games. She is also the creator of #Aprilttrpgmaker, and the newsletter featuring marginalized creators More Seats at the Table. Follow her current projects at @Kiranansi on twitter. \nJames Mendez Hodes ($50,000 UNLOCKED) (he/him) is a writer, cultural consultant, religion scholar, classicist, and martial artist whom you might know from 7th Sea, Thousand Arrows, some essays complaining about orcs and racism, or his rap translation of Homer\u2019s Iliad. His favorite Greek mythological figures are Atalanta and Asclepius. He lives in the greater New York metropolitan area on traditional Lenape land.\nStras Acimovic ($55,000 UNLOCKED) (he/him) is a game-designing cryptid found when rolling a 6 on a random encounter chart in Central Colorado.

You can find more about her at https://blackgirlgameworks.com/ \nAn Age of Myth and Legend, here and now!\nWe've put $10,000 of our own money into getting Agon to this point. With your help we'll cross the remaining distance and get this off to press as soon as possible.\nWe already have the preliminary layout done ([[backers can take a look at that]] right now\u2014check out the linked graphic right underneath the video, up top), which includes some of the art. We'll need a few months to finish up the rest of the art, the islands, and making any adjustments based on feedback as folks start playing the prototype edition. All of this will start once the campaign concludes in October, if not sooner. \nThen it's off to the presses for manufacture. One advantage of Kickstarting is that it allows us to size that print run like Baby Bear\u2019s porridge\u2014just right. Our printer usually takes 2-3 months to turn around a book, although that timeline\u2019s dependent on their availability. We\u2019ve added some cushion to our delivery estimates, and we\u2019re confident that we will ship this on time. We hope to beat that estimate, of course, but when it comes to book production it's best to put a buffer into your schedule.\nYou can be confident that we'll ship on or before our estimated delivery date, because that's been our consistent track record across a dozen other campaigns in the last seven years. Just ask our backers; we keep our promises. Our two most recent campaigns, Uprising: The Dystopian RPG and Tachyon Squadron, shipped within four months of conclusion. We've got a bit more to do here on the artwork front, but we're still very far along in the process, and we're confident we have all the remaining time-factors well in hand. For Evil Hat, it's not so much Kickstarter, as Kickfinisher.\nStretch goals from contributing authors have a separate production timeline. We consider them truly extra content, and that means we don't start production on the stretch goals until after they fund. We may adjust the planned goal order behind the scenes as we learn what the backers are most interested in.\nWe're excited to see what you unlock! Once the campaign concludes we'll put together a plan for getting the funded goals done. There are a lot of moving parts to coordinate (writing, system development, editing, layout, art direction, and artwork), but since these are digital-only they're not vulnerable to any manufacturing hiccups.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up their rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would. \nBased on our average shipping cost scenario in the USA, we've set up shipping costs like so:\nFor book-only shipments we're charging a flat $7 shipping fee (media mail + handling costs) for USA addresses.\nHere\u2019s the sad part: we\u2019re only able to offer shipping to the USA. Our shipping options outside of the country would cost more than the actual book in most cases (and would badly distort the funding model we're using for this campaign). However, every reward offered in this Kickstarter will be available to our international fans.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options:\nBack the KS at $15 to get the stretch goals plus a special code to purchase the print-on-demand softcover version of the game at-cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once available (see Your Rewards, above, for more details).\nBack the KS at $10 to get access to the prototype version of the game. Later, buy the physical book via your Friendly Local Game Store when it hits distribution (we sell to a variety of international distributors in Canada, the UK, Europe, and Australia). Buy any stretch goals you\u2019re interested in separately.\nWait and buy the physical book via your Friendly Local Game Store when it hits distribution. Buy any stretch goals you\u2019re interested in separately.\nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. Without this kind of communication, the chances that a store will order enough quantities for you to be able to get a copy from them go down significantly.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, use a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address and then get packages delivered to it, to you. Those costs will still likely be below what we could offer!\n Game Design, Writing, Graphic Design, Layout, and Illustration: John Harper\n Game Design, Writing, Developmental Editing, Project Management: Sean Nittner\n Consulting Designer: Jason Morningstar\n Editing: Karen Twelves\n Indexing: TBD \n Marketing Manager: Tom Lommel\n Operations and Production, Kickstarter Manager: Fred Hicks\n Kickstarter Video Animation: Ryan Dunleavy\n Kickstarter Video Music: Allison Arth\n Sensitivity Reader: TBD \n Primary Playtesters and Consultants: Allison Arth, Andi Carrison, John LeBoeuf-Little, Karen Twelves, Nadja Otikor, and Stras Acimovic.\n Additional Playtesters: Alice Grizzle, Amber Dean, Andy Munich, Arturo Rubio , Aryana Wills, Ash McAllan, Banana Chan, Ben Scerri, Blake Hutchins, Brit Weisman, Caroline Hobbs, Christian Griffen, Clayton Grey, Colin Jessup, Daniel Wood, David Gallo, DC, Doug Bartlett, Dylan Green, ET, Gabriel Ricardo Freeman, Isaac Thummell, James Mendez Hodes, James Ritter , Jeeyon Shim, Jenn Martin, Jerry Ozbun, Josh Neel, Kaitlyn Fox, Ken Davidson, Kimberley Lam, Laura Fredriksen, Luke Jordan, Matthew Gagan, Misha Bushyager, Morgan Ellis, Noella Handley, Patrick Brannick, Paul Riddle, Philip LaRose, Ross Cowman, Sam Ashwell, Sam Day, Sandy Jacobs-Tolle, Skylar Wall, Sophie Lagac\u00e9, Tara Hynson, Tomer Gurantz, Tony Dowler, Tracy O\u2019Brien, Van Magnan, Venn White, Yoshi Creelman, and many unsung heroes from Conlorado, KublaCon, Gen Con, Origins, Go Play Nortwest, The Game Academy, Secret Orbit Game Nights, and private gatherings.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have a great team on this project. Evil Hat is an experienced RPG publisher. We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years. John Harper (OneSeven) is a veteran game designer, writer, layout artist, and illustrator. He has made over a dozen games including Blades in the Dark and Agon (first edition). \n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nKickstarter Itself: Kickstarter management has recently come under fire for undermining efforts by their employees to unionize. Evil Hat unequivocally stands with the employees of Kickstarter United (the intended union) on this matter. At this time the union has not called for boycotts, and has encouraged creators to go ahead continue to run projects. If the union organizers call for a boycott prior to the conclusion of this campaign on October 25th, we will respect the boycott and immediately cancel the project. If they say now is the time for action, we will take action - even if it means leaving pledges on the table. This also applies if a majority of KS employees vote to organize and KS management refuses to recognize the union.\n\nAfter October 25th, if the fundraising concludes successfully, we will honor our commitment to produce and ship the game. You can read more about our position at https://www.evilhat.com/home/a-further-word-about-kickstarter/ \n\nThe Text: While Agon is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket. \n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2019 and 2020. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Agon to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run two or more Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 12+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively. We make space for each Kickstarter, fulfillment, and distribution release in our schedule, and we work to ensure that resources are available to take each of our projects across the finish line.\n\nIf there's any risk or challenge YOU can think of that we haven't mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.

Obediah Felkner, a prominent resident and claim owner of a nearby quicksilver mine, has recently passed away from a mysterious illness. Surprisingly, a group of complete strangers have been named as his beneficiaries. The claim to Felkner\u2019s mine could become theirs.\nHowever, Felkner\u2019s last will contains a peculiar condition: in order to claim the deed to the mine, the party must collect a holy relic known as the Hand of San Roque and deliver it to Felkner\u2019s grieving widow before dawn. The artifact is rumored to be hidden somewhere in the old Mission San Roque, abandoned by the Spanish almost 40 years ago.\nAnd should they refuse? The lawyer points out they, too, have contracted the same disease that claimed the life of Mr. Felkner, and the retrieval of the relic is their only hope if they wish to survive the mysterious deadly affliction.\nThe Last Will and Testament of Obediah Felkner - Standard Cover (FRK Pyron)\nSummary\nThe Last Will and Testament of Obediah Felkner is a horror-themed western adventure designed for 4-to-6 1st-level characters. This product is compatible with the Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game. The adventure contains pre-generated western-themed DCC RPG characters, so no additional supplements are required. That said, it has been playtested with both David Baity's upcoming Dark Trails RPG and Stormlord Publishing's Black Powder, Black Magic DCC supplement with delightful results. There is an appendix \u201cRunning this adventure with Dark Trails\u201d providing the judge ideas on how to fully leverage the Dark Trails ruleset with this adventure.\nThis full-length, standalone adventure will be between 24 to 28 pages in length. The adventure is completely written, edited, and thoroughly playtested. It currently contains art from some of your favorite DCC RPG artists including FRK Pyron, Stefan Poag, Danny Prescott, Sonya Prince, and Aaron Robinson. The adventure will be released as an 8.5 x 11 booklet with color cover and black and white interior pages.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more! A limited-edition alternate foil-cover will be released and made available for sale only to Kickstarter backers. For an example of the foil cover, check out the one released for Children of the Fallen Sun.\nAnd finally, you will have the option to receive a  Dark Trails Quick Start Guide PDF discount code! See below for details.\nSpoiler Details\nThe adventure is loaded with goodies. Filthy spoilers ahead so if you\u2019re planning on enjoying this adventure as a player you may want to skip to the next section.\nOnly judges here? OK, here\u2019s what goodies you\u2019ll get in the adventure:\nThe bulk of the adventure takes place in a fictional California Mission. Despite being a western, like many of my adventures there\u2019s a strong horror theme where the players will eventually discover there\u2019s a mystery going on at the old Spanish Mission and not everything is quite what it seems\u2026\nThe adventure has approximately 12 keyed encounters, as well as starting and ending events.\nA full-page black and white mission map illustrated by Stefan Poag.\nThe appendix includes descriptions of 3 new magic items (including the artifact The Hand of San Roque), at least 3 illustrated player handouts, and 10 pre-generated 1st-level PCs which can be used as-is or as examples on how to modify a standard DCC class into a western-themed PC.\nStefan Poag illustrates why PCs should be careful when poking around haunted grave yards\nProject Status\nThe project has already reached the following milestones:\nWriting of the adventure is complete, the core adventure has been edited, and the adventure has been playtested by multiple judges at several conventions.\nCover art and most of the interior illustrations are complete.\nA deliciously illustrated map by Stefan Poag is complete.\nThe art for the foil cover by FRK Pyron is complete.\nAmazing new interior illustrations from some of your favorite artists including FRK Pyron, Stefan Poag, Danny Prescott, Sonya Prince, and Aaron Robinson.\nThe Kickstarter funds will be used to fund the printing of the adventures, and potentially include 2-3 additional pieces of art.\nLimited Edition Foil Cover (FRK Pyron)\nStretch Goals\nGiven that the adventure is almost entirely complete, I will be keeping the stretch goals modest, as I\u2019d like to get the adventure in your hands as soon as possible. Still, I wanted to offer a little something as a thank you to Kickstarter backers.\nAt $3000: Stickers for print backers! Each print copy of the adventure will include  two 3\"x3\u201d stickers: one of the Thick Skull Adventures logo (see below), and another with a new design which will be inspired by one of the pieces of art within the adventure.\nAt $4000: Four additional pages. The adventure is currently 24 pages, but you can help make it 28! The new pages would most likely be a combination of new pieces of art as well as some more background material write ups of the prominent NPCs encountered in Los Castores.\nAt $5500: A full patron write up. Spoiler alert: within the adventure, there is an otherworldly entity meddling with humankind in nefarious ways. At this level, I will do a full write-up of this entity as a patron and include an accompanying piece of art.\nThick Skull Adventures Sticker!\nDark Trails Quick Start Guide PDF Discount Code Offer\nTo get your Weird West campaign started right, David Baity has generously agreed to provide discount codes for the PDF copy of the Dark Trails Quick Start Guide when it becomes available to backers of this Kickstarter.

You seek gold and glory, winning it with sword and spell, caked in the blood and filth of the weak, the dark, the demons, and the vanquished. There are treasures to be won deep underneath, and you shall have them.\nThe Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game returns you to the glory days of gaming, allowing you to adventure as 1974 intended you to, but with modern rules grounded in the origins of sword & sorcery.\nAbout Dark Trails\nThe forthcoming Dark Trails RPG by David Baity is a game which pays homage to the popular Weird West genre.  Dark Trails can be used as a standalone game or as the perfect complement to a growing line of products that all utilize the rules found in the Dungeon Crawl Classics RPG. While Dark Trails is not required to play The Last will and Testament of Obediah Felkner, the two go together like dust and boots.\nAbout Stephen Newton\nStephen has been publishing adventures for both Thick Skull Adventures and Goodman Games for over seven years. Stephen has garnered a bit of a reputation for his unique style of horror contained with his DCC adventures. He is the author of three of Goodman Game\u2019s Halloween (now Horror) line of adventures including They Served Brandolyn Red, The Corpse that Love Built, and Creep, Skrag, Creep! As the primary author behind Thick Skull Adventures, Stephen has authored the Best Selling Attack of the Frawgs, The Haunting of Larvik Island, Stronghold of the Wood Giant Shaman, and Children of the Fallen Sun (for the Mutant Crawl Classics RPG).\nShipping Costs\nEach adventure will ship either in a cardboard envelope or bubble pack via Media Mail.

You mean our thinking of making Poly 7 as we feel that is what customers want when it is the opposite and what we basically want to provide you as a choice. Just like I wanted a few d6 from Chessex and was told 'you can buy a brick'. No dip game store employee. I get that thanks for telling me something I already know and I can also go on Amazon and save money than buy directly from you which is what I will do as I show you my phone completing that sale in front of you, sale lost to you for that attitude you gave me'.

The choice then becomes adding more sets and taking percentile dice we don't need, verses adding dice individually that are twice as much. In the end, offering a set that is 6 dice, saves us the money and I doubt many people are going to run out and buy tons of percentile d10, but some will and for those who want multiples of dice can more easily buy those sets without getting saddled.

I'm Andrew, but you can call me \"Schmandrew\" because, let's face it, there are a lot of Andrews out there who also make art. I'm an Illustrator, Designer, and Professor who smiles a lot. Over the last three years, I've slowly transitioned from the world of pop art style alternate movie posters to the world of freelance and original art. \nBefore we get too deep and become besties, let me explain exactly what this Kickstarter is and why it\u2019s important. First and foremost, this is a campaign to create enamel pins alongside my good friend, and fellow artist, Allen Panakal. Allen and I have overlapping audiences and we\u2019ve both been toying around with the idea of doing pin Kickstarters for awhile now. The thing that makes this truly unique though is that we are running separate campaigns, BUT we are going to reward anyone who supports us both with a very limited edition metal card with both of our art on it! On top of that, we have a stretch goal planned where we\u2019ll each do an interpretation of the other person\u2019s illustration! Pretty rad, right?!\nAllen and I at C2E2\nSo now that I\u2019ve hyped you up, it\u2019s time to get real. In order to understand where these designs came from I need to explain just what the \u201cBanishment\u201d Collection is and what it means. \nBanishment\nEverything changed when the fire nation attacked\u2026\nSorry, I couldn\u2019t resist! It\u2019s hard not to jump to Avatar when you start a sentence with \u201cEverything changed.\u201d In all seriousness though, I went through a really difficult experience at the end of 2017 and into the early parts of 2018. Without going too in depth, a few very important cornerstones in my life either left or passed away. It was hard. I\u2019m usually a pretty happy, optimistic person, but during all of that, I was not myself. \nFinally in May of 2018, I remember thinking things were starting to return to normal, but I still felt like I had some pent up energy that needed a release. That\u2019s when I started on \u201cBanishment\u201d and everything actually changed. \n\u201cBanishment\u201d is about that turning point in any struggle where things start to improve. It\u2019s that moment of victory where the tides turn and good overcomes evil. It\u2019s the first of many steps out of any struggle we may have gone through or are currently in. It wasn't the whole story which eventually led to two more pieces, \u201cThe Banisher\u201d and \u201cThe Banished\u201d.\nThe Banisher & The Banished\nWhile \u201cThe Banisher\u201d represents the mix of exhaustion and relief as we let go and move on, \u201cThe Banished\u201d symbolizes the beauty we can find wherever we end up. We are all stronger than we think and whatever happens, we will get through it. That is what the \u201cBanishment\u201d Collection represents.\nHaving no prior experience doing personal work, I had no idea how it would be received. Thankfully, I was blown away by the reactions I got! So many people shared their own stories with me and how they related to \"Banishment\". Someone even got one of my pin designs tattooed! \nIt\u2019s because of that strong reaction that I decided to create these soft enamel pins designs. I think we could all use a physical reminder on our person to remind ourselves just how strong we really are.\n Check out Allen's pins, prints, mats, and metal HERE\nAnd if you only want to snag the pins, there's no need to jump between campaigns to get the metal cards. Just pick Tier 2.5 and you'll get our pins and all the crossover benefits!\nAssuming we can exceed our funding goal, I've prepared some stretch goals to unlock.   \n\n\nLast but least, all shipping costs will be added on at checkout. All shipping amounts are priced at cost via the weight of each item.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk and challenge of this kickstarter will be producing and shipping the pins. Once the campaign closes, it takes about a month to receive funds and at that point we'll place orders. Generally, the supplier takes 3-4 weeks to make and ship the pins.

Four Stretch Goals Unlocked!\nTime for some real Sweet Rolls!\nI created Ice Cream Dice to address the severe lack of nearly edible looking dice in the marketplace.

I started it because I was so tired of seeing the same dice offered on different sites, by different companies with different names. Names like 'Goblin's Blood' and 'Dragon's Blah Blah Blah'. \nWhen I got to thinking about fun and whimsical, ice cream came immediately to mind and I started on a journey to design the most ice creamy looking dice I could.\nNeo, the classic flavor we all love to hate (well a third of it anyway).\nOrange Dream, a dreamy mix of orange and cream.\nRainbow, also known as Schubert's Sherbet.\nYour Favorite, whether your favorite is chocolate, coffee or caramel, this set has you covered with just a touch of cream.\nBubble Candy, old school bubblegum and carnival cotton candy.\nKiwi, it's even got the seeds!\nThe matte set on the left and the glossy d20 on the right.\nRazzman, the Kickstarter semi-exclusive set. \nAfter this Kickstarter is done, Razzman will be offered once a year to celebrate the day this Kickstarter was fully funded.\nButterscotch: The epitome of potential. \nButterscotch will be redone in production to look like Orange Dream.

Roughly 1.5\" - 2\" high and about 2\" - 2.5\" across at the top.\nThis shot shows you how beautiful the inside is.\nSsssssssssstretch Goals\nI could easily have done what most dice companies do and locked the popular dice designs behind fake stretch goals, but I won't. I could have easily found something that was sort of related to dice and offered that as a stretch goal, I didn't.\nI'm a very small company (it's just me) and this is my first Kickstarter, so over complicating things to make it 'look' cooler seemed both dishonest and foolhardy. There's enough moving pieces already, and I'm confident I can deliver on these stretch goals.\nQUICK EDIT: If you're stoked about the D6/D10 Sets and mini D6 Bricks, please read update #17. The graphic below will be changed to reflect the updated information later today.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRight about now you're saying to yourself, well, that's great and seems like you can deliver it all, but I WANT MORE! To that, I say, take a gander.\nAdd-ons, or...more ways to give me your money!\nI have worked with small creators in our community to bring you two add-ons. These will both be available to add on to your order in Backerkit after the campaign ends.\nFlavour of the Month\nFor $5 (approx. $4 USD / \u20ac3 / \u00a33 ) You can take your kids, your friends or both on an Ice Cream Adventure written exclusively for Ice Cream Dice by Andrew Morley. The local ice cream maker has disappeared! It's up to your party to discover what happened to him. Along the way you may meet yourself some new elementals inspired by Ice Cream Dice. You'll receive a PDF copy of this sweet adventure by late June.\nHandmade d4 Dice Bag\nFor $15 CAD (approx. $12 USD / \u20ac10 / \u00a39 ) you will get a custom, handmade d4 shaped bag that holds over 100 dice! \nThese are Ice Cream Dice exclusives. I partnered with people that could create things that were special, a bit whimsical and useful. These d4 dice bags aren't likely to be produced again. If you want one, this may be the only time to get one. The inside of this dice bag will be a waffle cone pattern, rather than polka dots.\nPins\nFor $5 CAD (approx. $4 USD / \u20ac3 / \u00a33 ) You'll receive a soft enamel pin that will not only shout to the world you love dice, but also, ice cream.\nIf you love pins and just need a couple extra for every lapel you own, I got you covered! The pins are soft enamel with a rubber backing.\nIce Cream Dice Custom Dice Box\nFor $110 CAD (approx. $83 USD / \u20ac75 / \u00a365 ) you can get yourself an Ice Cream Dice exclusive dice box made by the wonderful folks over at Dog Might.\nFor $150 CAD (approx. $114 USD / \u20ac100 / \u00a385 ) you can get yourself an Ice Cream Dice box made out of stunning Wenge wood. This rare dark chocolate colored wood is stunning and sustainably sourced.\nThe folks over at Dog Might reached out to me after seeing my project and told me they had a great idea for a dice box. They weren't lying. These boxes have a lifetime warranty and are gorgeous. Dog Might only works with the best of the best in the industry. I will update this with more details and pictures once I have the prototype in my hands and have all the information.\nFrom Dog Might:  The Dog Might Ice Cream Dice Box is crafted from Flame Birch wood and features a hand applied finish. It comes with a removable foam insert cut to cradle your set of dice perfectly. Remove the foam to easily carry two full sets of polys. Like all Dog Might products, the Ice Cream Dice Box comes with a lifetime guarantee. \nThese boxes are prototypes and a couple of small changes will be happening in the final production. The edges of the D20 top will be a little crisper, and the front facing number will be a 20, because we all know that's the number we like to see the most!\nThe Blue Ice Cream Dice Box\nThis color combo is called cake by Dog Might, but I call it sno-cone!\nThe stunning Wenge wood box with Your Favorite. A match made in heaven.\nFlat Pack Ice Cream Dice Dice Tower\nFor $25 CAD (approx. $19 USD / \u20ac17 / \u00a315 ) you can get yourself an Ice Cream Dice dice tower made by the awesome folks over at Galaxy Gaming Gear.\nThe awe inspiring Ice Cream Dice Tower of Doooooooooooooooooom!\nGalaxy Gaming Gear makes a slew of flat pack minis, terrain and buildings for all your gaming needs. Their designs are particularly kid friendly and it's great to have them on board. I will continue to sell this tower after the campaign, though the price will likely be $30.\nI know, Mom said not to talk about the 'S' word, but we have to...Shipping.\nShipping is the one spell that neither creator, nor adventurer, can break. Being based out of Canada, I feel your pain. I have partnered with a Canadian company that ships straight from China. This is hugely beneficial to all of us, myself included, for a few reasons.\nWe don't have to wait three months for the dice to arrive by freight ship to North American shores, and then wait further while it's unpacked and sent to different shipping centers which then finally get it shipped to you.\nIt's reasonably affordable and delivered with tracking number and insurance to everybody.\nI save money on not having to ship it by sea, which means I pass that savings on to you.\nSo here's the shipping breakdown, it doesn't cover every possible currency, but it covers a lot.\nThere, we did it, we had the dreaded 'S' talk.\nMatte or Glossy, that is the Question:\nHere are the side by side shots of the Matte & Glossy versions of each set. Some key things to keep in mind: \nThe glossy look is achieved by tossing the dice into a rock polisher, so the matte dice are a little larger because they've haven't been polished for as long as the glossy sets. The matte Rainbow and Neo d20's are a little larger than the rest, due to being cast in resin.\nThe powdery look on the matte Neo and Rainbow will eventually wear off. The colors are still softer than gloss, but the frosty look is not permanent.\nIf you prefer your colors to be vivid and brighter, you'll want to go with the gloss.\nMatte isn't very shiny, I know this should seem obvious, but if you like your dice shiny, go with glossy.\nThey do feel different, but the difference isn't night and day like it is with matte and glossy paper.\nWith less polishing, there is occasional color bleed around some of the numbers, it is negligible when it does happen and it only happened on a couple of single numbers on a couple of individual dice in the 25 test sets I got. This may be fixed in production, but I felt it was worth noting\nLet's get to the comparison shots...\nNeo\nOrange Dream\nRainbow\nYour Favorite\nBubble Candy\nKiwi, the numbers on Kiwi will be re-inked with a golden yellow during final production.\nRazzman\nThe Final Butterscotch will look more like Orange Dream\nLet's End this on a High Note\nThank you. They're two simple words that we often toss around without really thinking about what they mean. I think about them a lot and how they relate to this company.\n'Thank' is defined as: to express gratitude to or to hold responsible.\nSo, let me say it again. Thank you. I hold you all responsible for the gratitude I felt every single day leading up to this launch, and will always feel. You cheered me on and you cheered me up, you shared my dice on your podcasts, streams, tweets, instagram, on Facebook. You made sure people knew about me and Ice Cream Dice. \nThis company was inspired by some pretty amazing kids and my desire to make D&D and other TTRPG's more accessible to schools and kids. It is my belief that the skills learned and demonstrated while playing tabletop games, of any sort, are the ones we want our next world leaders to possess. Risk taking, problem solving, learning that you can't do everything by yourself, the value of friendship, exploration, listening to multiple viewpoints, among many other things. \nI didn't get here because of a marketing budget or the right analytics or targeted ads. I got here because of my own work and your support. I didn't get here because I hired a team or had an unlimited amount of money to throw at things. I've said from the beginning, what you see is what you will get. Initially I thought I meant my dice, I soon learned I meant that about myself as well. \nThis community we're all a part of is amazing. I am proud, and humbled, to be a part of it. Here's to many sweet rolls with friends new and old!\nThank you,\nMarc Schubert, aka Ice Cream Dice\nA Really Great Facebook Group!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risk in this project is the production & shipping time required to manufacture the dice and get them to you, my backers. I have been working with my factory for a while now and they are expecting my order at the end of March. Production time is usually in the 45 - 60 working day range. So somewhere between 9 - 12 weeks. However, complications can occur, holidays happen and to be safe, I have estimated a 9 - 18 week production range into my timeline. This allows for the custom molds to be created that are required to honor the stretch goals that may become unlocked during the campaign.\n\nI have partnered with a Canadian company that has years of experience shipping dice. They ship from their warehouse space in China which allows me to ensure a lower shipping cost that I can pass on to you, the backers. By choosing to ship from China I save time on the actual mass shipping of the product to North America.\n\nTypically, shipping can take up to three months to get to North American shores, and then you still have to wait for it to pass through customs, get unloaded and then get shipped to the shipping companies who then, finally after a couple of weeks, ship to you. By shipping directly from China, using a Canadian company to do it, it'll take a few days to get to the warehouse and then the shipping to backers will start.\n\nThis is my first Kickstarter, and I've done everything I can to ensure that you receive a quality product on time and I have researched and learned from the mistakes of those that have come before me.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "I Heart Ice Cream Dice", "descp": "Can't commit to a full set and want to show your support?

Just check out this great \"How to Play\" with Becca Scott from Geek & Sundry!\nNOTE: Displayed is a prototype version of the game, and does not reflect it's final appearance (for example, the aspect cards will be smaller, and the dice will be engraved).\nOver the course of the game, players will be stacking dice to represent the growing hubris of the great city, and the failures that characters generate will contribute to the tower as their nation falters and decays. Once the dice tower itself tumbles, the city goes with it.\nIcarus invites you to build your own utopia, but also comes with a handful of setting suggestions to get your game up and running quickly. With fascinating and evocative civilizations like:\n The cradle of early mankind\n A fantasy city imbued with magic \nA booming western town along the ever-expanding railroad \nA mystical jungle city full of divine secrets \nThe first major city on Mars \nA burgeoning space colony of alien life-forms \nand more, you'll have all the details you need to get a game off the ground within minutes.\nThough the range of settings for Icarus are endless, it is important that Icarus features a tower that shall rise and a city that will fall.\n\"Icarus - Rise of the Singularity\" By Kent Davis\nBecause of this, Icarus is also the perfect tool to use during your campaign\u2019s \u2018Session 0\u2019 before hopping into the RPG of your choice. As a game designed specifically for one-shot play (once the tower falls, the game comes to an end), it can serve as both a satisfying single session and as a rich campaign starter for your group's next adventure!\nBy leading players through the sprawling, epic stories of a civilization\u2019s fight to survive against insurmountable odds, the game creates a world with memorable lore, momentous events, and tragic heroes. \nExploring a \"Retro Sci-Fi\" version of Icarus on the surface of Mars.\nFor games like Outbreak: Undead, Apocalypse World, or any other dystopian/post-apocalyptic systems, Icarus effectively puts a \"World Bible\" into your hands that can be used to immediately jump into a fully-realized and player-generated universe, where characters are intimately tied to the history and lore of the world they must now fight to stay alive in.\nWatch our Live-Play of Icarus, featured on Geek & Sundry and get an idea of how YOU can create any kind of Civilization - only to watch it fall.\nWriter: Marvel Comics, DC Comics, Dark Horse, Valiant, IDW\nRelics & Rarities, We're Alive: Frontier, Sags of Sundry, King of the Nerds\n\"Icarus - Byzantine\" By Ryan Richmond\nEach Player will be dealt a \u2018Pillar of Society\u2019 card that will represent a key element of Icarus that you will explore during the game.\nArt\nTechnology\nAgriculture\nLaw\nEnergy\nSocial Structures\nEtc\nEach of the Pillar of Society cards have the choice of either a strength or a weakness prompt to answer. Players will collectively choose only one of their Pillars to be a weakness at the beginning of the game - but that crumbling Pillar will serve as a crucial narrative force in the story to come.\nSTRENGTH: The people of Icarus feel safer here than anywhere else, why? WEAKNESS: The people of Icarus all share a common fear, what is it? And where did it come from?\nA single Pillar card will also be placed in the center, to represent the monument of Icarus.\nAfterwards, players will create characters that serve as keystones and cracks in the foundation of society.\nThese characters are usually a major player in this city's infrastructure, and are tied to their pillar and Motive they receive during character creation. While players can create archetypal relationships (such as a Marshall that represents the pillar \u2018Law\u2019 in a western city and whose motive is to \u201cProtect The Citizens\u201d) they can also explore deeper, more subtle roles that can manipulate the city in big ways (a Judge, Lawless Mercenary, Parent who has a position on city council, or a Silent Film Star who has taken a personal interest in politics).\nYour Motives will guide you into affecting the narrative in distinct, powerful ways as it unfolds. \n\"Icarus - Royal Jungles\" Art by Kent Davis (@Idrawbagmen)\nDuring gameplay, each turn a player will draw a Story Card, which will provide them with a prompt they will answer to drive forward the city's narrative. They'll record these answers on notecards as phrases or sentences called 'Aspects' and use them to create a mindmap of the city on the table in front of them.\nAn 'Aspect' might be something like \u201ccity has a fear of mutants\u201d or \u201cWe\u2019re running out of water!\u201d It can also relate to a certain character like \u201cPresident says dissenters should be executed\u201d or \u201cJacob is the only survivor of his expedition\u201d. \n\nAspects are the creative powerhouse of the game, and will be added and replaced often in order to build the narrative. . Consider each one like a 'Scene' in a TV/Movie Drama or a 'Major Event' in the history books telling the tale of this civilization's collapse. \nThis is where players can roleplay how/when they either resolve or escalate 'Aspects' in the game.\nAs characters attempt to affect the world around them in accordance with their motives, players place dice on the Aspects their characters are looking to change within the city. \nWhen resolving these dice, on a success the die returns to the pool and the player has the chance to create or modify an Aspect to reflect that success. But on a failure, the problem escalates, and the dice must be added to the ever-growing tower at the center of the table.\nUltimately, the dice tower you\u2019re building will fall. This triggers the final collapse of the civilization and the end of the game. You\u2019ll answer three questions as a group before walking away from this fallen society..\nWhat caused the tower to collapse?\nWhat happened to your character in the aftermath?\nWhat became of the civilization after its fall?\nOur Kickstarter is pretty straight forward \"all in one\" Storytelling Experience. Our standard pledge is everything you'll need to play the game. \nHowever, we do understand people like stuff.

Lovingly crafted by the find folks at Dogmight Games.\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY OPTIONS\nWe understand that this game can rely heavily on table elements, and also ask for a certain amount of dexterity in order to play.  Since we believe that EVERYONE should have a chance to play Icarus, we've included a few cool things as part of our DIGITAL tier. \nDex-Friendly Tower Resolution (for those may not have the physical capacity to stack dice, or to play online)\n An Oracle (So you can play Icarus with a standard deck of cards) \n\nAdditional products you can add to your pledge and enhance your playing experience:\n\nDelivery\nDevelopment: Icarus is currently done development wise, all that is left is to put it into layout. The final stage is to receive dice from our manufacturers to test their stackability (technical term), and balance the gameplay accordingly.\nArt: We have about 10 pieces of art completed. We're looking to have another 5-8 pieces finished before the book goes to print. Right now we're on schedule to make that happen.\nDigital \nWe will be using DTRPG to do all of our Digital Fulfillment, as well as provide our International Customers with Print and Play documents (as well as Print on Demand options, if people are interested).\nThe best place for Digital RPGs!\nShipping\nFor this project, we will be charging shipping as we fulfill each item.

These d20s are designed to capture the essence of the five mighty chromatic dragons in all their glory. Each of the five dice features a unique swirled mix that captures the coloration of a specific dragon type and is inked with a bright color that represents its deadly breath weapon. The 20 result on the die features a dragon design that lets you know that you're bringing the pain to your foes!\nWho doesn't love dragons? The awesome ranks of dragons are many: Malificent, Drogon, Rotgut, Spyro, Malystryx, Icingdeath, Singe, Smaug or the deadly Vermithrax...who's your favorite?

They feature a blend of two colors with an iridescent glimmer that came out fantastic! We think they are super cool and the blending method perfectly captures the billowing dragon breath attack!\n Larger Size Like the majority of the dice we produce, these dice are larger and stand out on your game table. They tower over lesser dice and make them run for cover! Another upside to our larger size is they are easier to read.\n Draconic Design The design on the 20 face captures the power of the dragon and roars CRITICAL HIT! \n Tiamat Special You can harness the power of the five most vile dragons in the lands - not just one or two of them.

These boxes are utterly gorgeous and Dog Might's reputation for quality speaks for itself. These are exclusive to Black Oak Workshop's Dragon d20 project and will not be available again after the project has completed!\nThere are two variations of the boxes. We have a standard version in red and a higher end variant in beautiful padauk wood. Both share these great qualities:\nBeautiful all wood design with protective finish\nExclusive dragon design\nEmbedded magnets keep the lid securely in place\nHolds lots of dice - 8.5\" x 2.25\" x 2.0\"\nDog Might Quality - they will last for many years!\nYou will find the boxes available as part of specific reward levels and they will also be available in the pledge manager so you can pick up additional boxes if you'd like.

All rewards will be packed securely in an effort  to minimize risk of damage during shipping.\nFor our International backers, we are adding a note that the shipping costs are reflective of  what the USPS charges us.

Part of the figures was able to order since spring 2018 and many of our customers highly rated the quality and sculpt level of miniatures.\nEach Set includes 4 miniatures. We have 4 Sets of Canitaurs and 1 of Felitaurs:\nGreen Set \u00abThe Rogues Gallery\u00bb:\nShiba Bard\nChow-chow Brewmaster\nChihuahua Merchant\nGreyhound Ranger \nRed Set \u00abMercs for Hirey\u00bb:\nPitbull Gladiator\nHusky Barbarian\nAkita Samurai\nPug Arbalist\nViolet Set \u00abMystical and Arcane\u00bb:\nGreat Dane Wizard  \nPoodle Warlock\nDachshund Inquisitor\nSt. Bernard Monk\nBlue Set \u00abRoyal Defenders\u00bb:\n\nCorgi Guard\nDoberman Knight\nSpaniel Admiral\nGerman Shepherd Oprichnik\nEmerald Set \u00abThe Felitaurs\u00bb is unlocked!\nMaine Coon Pirate\nSphynx Alchemist\nBlack Oriental Assassin\nOrange Tabby Fencer\nThe composition of each Set cannot be changed.

In to add felitaurs set just increase your pledge on 35 euros.\nIn this project, we have done a lot of work and made more than 20 great miniatures of Canitaurs, so that each player can choose a character for himself.\nEach Canitaur has its own pre-generated class, cards with parameters, special skills, and a short background.\nYou can choose Corgi, a brave and honest guard, or Pitbull, a brutal and strong warrior, a Greyhound, nimble and fast ranger or Chihuahua, an intelligent and little merchant. Choose your heroes!\nOur miniatures are cast by hand using silicone molds and pressure chambers. The material of the miniatures is the high-quality resin. Manual work and expensive materials allow us to make miniatures more detailed and qualitative in comparison with usual miniatures from PVC.\nMiniatures are divided on average into 3 parts, all miniatures are sent not assembled, you need to use glue for assembly (except the painted models). But we use to convenience connections, so miniatures are easy to assemble.\nCanitaurs like different breeds of dogs have different sizes, from 28 mm to 58 mm. Exact dimensions can be found in the FAQ. \n Feeling odd about creatures with six paws? That's OK, we have a solution for you! These miniatures are sculpted also in four-paws versions \u2014 just detach the backside and get the adorable humanoid dog of your favorite breed:\nCorgi Guard\nPitbull Gladiator\nChihuahua Merchant\nGreyhound Ranger\nPug Arbalist\nShiba Bard\nAkita Samurai\nHusky Barbarian\nCanitaur Samoed\nCanitaur Witcher\nMaine Coon Pirate\nCanitaur Hyena\nBulldog Butch\nSo the Red Set backers will get the full human-like \"Mercs for Hirey\" team!\nThe Deck of Many: Canitaurs has everything you need to start playing DnD in the world of the Canitaurs, whether you want to explore their world or introduce them into yours!

Loves walking with his dog and to revise the Lord of the Rings.\nIn this case, the miniature will be sent assembled.\nWhale Troll\nBig Guy was the most popular miniature in our previous campaign, so we decided to make him as an add-on with the Canitaurs!\nSnowy\nDuring the pre-sale of Canitaurs we received mail with a very sentimental story:\nThis story touched our hearts so hard so we decided to create another Canitaur for Snowy. Now Snowy is passed away. Many of us have lost our little friends, so her miniature will help to memorialize it. \n Canitaur Witcher\nBipedal option is available\n Canitaur Samoyed\nSharp harpoon but the kind heart and warm smile\u2026Adorable breed! We made this character with reference to the history of this breed. Samoyeds were originally used for hunting, herding reindeer, and hauling sleds for the Samoyede people in Siberia.

This is a world where animals have become sentient and established great civilizations and amazing cultures. There is a place for religion, economy, art, politics and even war. In this world, we find the Kingdom of Hundalia.  \nHundalia is unlike any place you have ever seen. At first, you might notice the cozy small villages, the lush forests or the wide-spread farmlands. Some aspects of this kingdom may seem familiar at first, however, you won't find many humans amongst the Hunds. \nAs you traverse the more populated areas, you will meet many canine-like creatures walking upright amongst the streets and fields. These are the Canitaur. Canitaurs are friendly, hard-working and down-to-earth folk. They enjoy little more than spending time with friends and family and meeting new people. If you are friendly and trustworthy to them, you could easily make a friend for life.\nHundalians are a proud people. They value loyalty and honesty very highly and this translates to their normal lives as well. A Canitaur would not lie (unless in a life-threatening situation) and takes it as a given that others would not lie to them. Because of this, trust is high amongst the Canitaur and people speak openly and know what to expect from each other.\n After the first Canitaurs arts posted, many pet owners have written that they want to see their little friends as Canitaurs heroes. And we understand them! We conducted an honest poll about what breeds are added to Canitaurs, more than 100 people voted, and the most 5 popular options we added to Canitaur world.\n At the moment we already have this list of breeds: Corgi, Pitbull, Chihuahua, Doberman, Greyhound, Husky, Chow-chow, Shiba-Inu, Poodle, Spaniel, Pug, Great Dane, Dachshund, German Shepherd, Saint Bernard, Akita-Inu.  \nUnfortunately, we can not create Canitaurs of all breeds. But for who want to create their own Canitaur or Felitaur, we give this opportunity and make the limited reward \"The Creator\".    \nWe will create a Canitaur with your choice for the breed/class and character name.\nNote! The miniature will be made in a SINGLE copy, all rights to the artworks and miniatures belong to backer. \nIn addition, we will start another survey, in which the most popular breed will be added to the campaign as an addon and is available to all backers.\nThe first poll will end on November 16th. Choose a new Canitaur hero! Poll link.\nThis project could never exist without artist Nikita Orlov who created the set of Battledoge characters last autumn. The conception of half dogs-half centaurs literally blew up the Internet and got sight by our studio (Punga Miniatures) and then The Deck of Many. We suggested to sculpt Canitaurs (because we love awesome concepts) and Nikita couldn't refuse. After that, The Deck of Many (who loves awesome concepts too) came up with the idea of turning our doges to DnD race.  \nWorkflow\n But what about Cats? We have them! Meet the chaotic Felitaurs \u2014 not necessarily cruel or evil, but very cunning feline creatures with all kinds of plots of their own. Also we plan to create miniatures of Monsters and Gods.\nOnce all 4 Felitaur Strech Goals are unlocked, they will be available to order as 5th Set \u2014 Emerald.\n Social Stretch Goal\nTo unlock The Chaos Cat \u2014 Felitaur God \u2014 you need only to Share and Like this post. When we'll reach 300 Share & Likes this stretch goal will be unlocked and be available to order. Also, it will be added for free to rewards level 4 and 5!\nWe ship to all the world. Shipping costs vary depending on your location and pledge levels/add-ons. Please calculate your shipping value according to the table below: \nWe plan to start sending packages in February 2019. The last estimated delivery date for the project is June 2019. Depending on the number of orders received for the project, delivery dates might vary, but we plan to send packages according to the order of backers, We ship packages using Russian Post. \nPunga Miniatures\nPunga Miniatures was created by several friends from Russia and Germany. From the very beginning, we really liked unusual concepts, so we created our first big project by our original concept Savage orcs inspired Polynesian culture. After the successful launch of this project, we have greatly improved our production, and also started working in 3D and increased the team.\nNow the studio has many talented people, sculptors, artists, animators, and mold casters.

As an avid player myself, I knew how difficult it was to find different products. And with a carpentry background I guess it was inevitable my two passions would combine.\nPainted by Rising Sun Painting Studios\nThe enthusiasm and love that people had for my products only acted as an incentive to source or manufacture more ideas. My wife\u2019s educational background is in animal science and welfare, so in the same way that gaming and carpentry had collided for me\u2026her loves collided to inspire the launch of our original Critit \u2018Spirit Of\u2019 dice line, the Kickstarter campaign that started us on this path.\nPainted by Rising Sun Painting Studios\nBut we couldn\u2019t stop there\u2026wanting to bring more of our creativity to all the awesome gamers out there, we hit upon the idea of the animal companion miniatures line when a good friend asked for help making a specialized cheetah miniature for a gaming session. We decided we needed to produce a whole line of miniatures which were totally dedicated to our beloved companions and familiars, and to make them purposefully for use in RPG gaming.\nOk\u2026..so we had this idea over 2 years ago. \u201cWhat took you so long?\u201d I hear you cry\u2026.well\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\nPutting together a range of miniatures is a WHOLE different ball game to dice, and as novices in this field, we don\u2019t mind admitting we made a lot of mistakes!\nPainted by Rising Sun Painting Studios\nIn our head it seemed pretty simple\u2026.. Hire a sculptor, get the files, get prototypes made and painted, get pricing, and voila. Yeah, that didn\u2019t happen quite so easily!\nOur first mistake was using a sculptor which didn\u2019t specialize in miniatures. It\u2019s a minefield and very specialist and requires an amazing talent. Our second mistake was using a prototyping company which didn\u2019t have any experience in miniatures. I don\u2019t even want to tell you how many times we adjusted the files and re-printed the rhino - big ones, little ones, ones with wonky legs\u2026\u2026\nOur animals along side 28mm Hero Forge models\nWe were close to putting a lid on the whole project. It is only due to the kindness and support of Daniel Melendez of Questron (they have produced a whole range of amazing miniatures for lots of well-known games) ( https://www.facebook.com/Questron-441242259255914/ ) that the project is going ahead now. He and his team did an amazing job of working with us and bringing to life what we had first envisioned. We now no longer have a horse with a cone on is head, but instead an amazing unicorn \ud83d\ude0a\nOur previous cone headed mule along with the amazing unicorn!\nOn the plus side, this means we can now confidently bring you a range that we know will be fantastic, as a company we never launch a project with just digital renders, only physical prototypes we can hold in our hand so we know we are ready to go, without the worries that any adjustments or major redesign may cause \ud83d\ude0a\nJust the right scale for your Pathfinder & Dungeons and Dragons 5e Campaigns\nAll Unlocked!\nYour Core Box will Initially include a set of 10 companions with the possibility of adding 14 more if we can unlock them along the way!\nWhen we started this journey making miniatures one of the main things we were most stunned about was the cost of moulds. To be able to unlock all the animals so we can offer you the whole set of 24 animals at this amazing price we need to cover the cost of the mould and buy bulk. By sharing and helping us let others know about this project, the more animals we can offer in your core box. Help us shout it from the rooftops :-)\nSculpt may be subject to slight change\nWe currently have 24 companions ready to go, all based on real life animals and the mythical companions I see in my dreams, The team did a great job of adding lots of detail to the models and making them as realistic as possible.\nThese Miniatures all come unpainted and are made from grey quality PVC plastic. They will be injection molded to ensure the highest possible detail.\nThe models are all based on actual DND 5e and Pathfinder size categories so no more quibbles about your companions reach and space requirements :-)\nIn order to make sure production runs as planned and all molds can viably be made this is an Add-On option only and must be purchased in conjunction with the core box pledge.\nAdd on this amazing t-rex to your existing pledge!\nYou have all already come up with some amazing suggestions and ideas. We want to do them all! For us to produce a line of animal companion and familiars which not only vary in size but also in style and stance would be amazing. This is just the start of our miniatures journey, and we are so looking forward to the next steps with you all\nShipping will be charged later in the pledge manager.\nNO MORE THAN \u00a36 FOR UK BACKERS\nNO MORE THAN \u00a312 FOR EU BACKERS\nNO MORE THAN \u00a316 FOR OTHER INTERNATIONAL BACKERS\nWe can promise we are going to investigate alternative shipping options and will make sure we get you the lowest most reliable service available.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have successfully fulfilled many other Kickstarters a few of which were actually early!

A great collectible would be prints or a wooden box. As it stands now that playmat is going to have a VERY limited print-run (only 17 backers) but even from a collector standpoint the verbiage reads that it \"may\" be the only printing so that leaves the door open for more down the road making even the collectible angle murky.

Step into the shoes of Aludra, Harper, Jaela, Thom (and hopefully some other heroes), as they take on some of Drunkeros' biggest villains. \nThe game is for 2-4 players, and takes 20 - 30 minutes to play. It is very easy to learn, even if you have had a few. The combination of heroes and bosses will make every game play differently, and give the game a lot of replayability. There is also a surprising amount of depth in the strategies you can use to take on the bosses. \nAt the core, we wanted to make a game that would be fun for anyone - you don't need to drink or listen to Drunks and Dragons to enjoy Drinks & Daggers!\n We've been Funded! In a scant 3.5 hours, we've made enough to fund the project!  There are still a ton of amazing stretch goals to hit, so we're not stopping this train until we unlock the next possible playable characters and bosses. Help us get there by spreading word to your friends and family about Drinks & Daggers!\nHere is what a typical round of Drinks & Daggers looks like:\n1) Draw a card from the boss deck, it might be an attack that directly damages the active player like Tail Sweep, or a minion that will hang around and protect the boss until you defeat him, like a Kobold.\n*card text not final\n2) Depending on what happens, all players can now play reaction cards like Drink in the Face or Battle Lust. Some cards will be able to combo off of each other, leading to even more reactions!   \n*card text not final\n3) The active player can now play an Action card like Lightning Bolt to directly attack the enemies or help in some other way, or play an Item card like Blooddrinker that will stay in play, and boost their abilities until it is canceled out.  \n*card text not final\n4) The active player then draw cards until you have a full hand, and it is on to the next player!\nOnce you have gotten the Villain's hit points to zero, you win! Be careful though, if your hit points go too low, your character will become \"smashed\" - you get a fresh set of hit points and new powers to reflect your smashed state of being. If you drop to zero hit points when smashed, you are down, and one of your team mates will need to heal you to get back in the game. Think of it as a revivify that actually works. If everyone is down, then the villain wins! The heroes end up in a tavern putting themselves back together, and the players might need to pull themselves together as well, depending on how many drinks they dealt* over the course of the game. \n*drinking is not required to enjoy this game, and if you do, please drink responsibly\nCharacters\nAludra Wyrmsbane\nAludra is the heart and soul of the team. Her strength and toughness are a great anchor, and thanks to her dwarven armor, she is the hardest hero to kill.   \n*card text not final\nTitus Harper\nHarper is the team's hot blooded leader. His magic and Haste scroll will have him cycling through cards and dealing a shocking amount of damage. \n*card text not final\nThom Vidalis\nThom is wild and unpredictable. Sometimes he gets a little over zealous and hurts everyone on the battlefield - including his friends. His sword Blooddrinker is the most coveted item in the realm.  \n*card text not final\nJaela\nJaela is a warrior-angel sent from the Gods to save the world. In Jaela's hands, her mighty halberd can do more damage in a single stroke than any other weapon in the game. \n*card text not final\nBosses\nPyre\nPyre, the iconic, ruby-devouring red dragon of Drunkeros is your main adversary. He is a well-rounded boss with plenty attacks to keep you on your toes. Players will need to maintain a balance between healing and dealing out damage to his many kobold minions that shield him against damage. \n*card text not final\nBercy Hamhands\nTake on a new challenger with the ham-fisted, orcish knuckle-puncher, Bercy Hamhands. Bercy is ring-worn which means players will need to pass a certain threshold of damage output before dropping Bercy's hit points. \n*card text not final\nRewards\nName read in the thank you video\nMarvel as Michael tries to pronounce your name in this thank you video posted to the GeeklyInc YouTube page. He will read each name - all with no edits - so you can really watch him struggle.\nDrinks & Daggers - The actual game!\nA physical copy of the game! All four hero decks, both villain decks, and up to six additional stretch goal decks! Plus, we will include an instruction manual (very kind of us), and tokens to track hit points and drinks (in case you don't want to actually imbibe). Stretch goal upgrades include a molded insert and hit point dials instead of tokens.\nPint Glass\nHave a nice frosty drink in your very own pint glass. \n*this is a mock up, design may change\nCoaster/Bottle Opener\nNot since the spork has something been both so versatile and so useful.\n*this is a mock up, design may change\nCustom Playmat\nThese playmats will make gaming even easier, and they look cool!\n*this is a mock up, design may change\nKoozie\nThe GeeklyInc charter clearly states that whenever we make stuff, we have to make a koozie. Tim won't budge on this one.\n*this is a mock up, design may change\nT-shirt\nAvailable in unisex, women\u2019s, unisex tank top, and women\u2019s tank top. Perfect for job interviews, first dates, and weddings. \n*this is a mock up, design may change\nPremium Edition of Drinks & Daggers\nAn upgraded version of Drinks & Daggers in a custom, hardwood box created by Dryad Gaming (we will also send you the regular box as well). The box is made using half inch Birch in Dryad Gaming's Northwest Arkansas workshop. The Birch is sustainably grown and harvested in the Northeastern United States. The game's keyart will be engraved on the lid via frickin' laser.  The interior will be roomier than the standard box. If we get a chance to make even more cards, you will have room for them! In addition, you'll also get exclusive foil cards of all playable characters! This premium edition is currently only planned to be available through the Kickstarter campaign, so there is a chance that this will be your only chance to get this version.\nA session of D&D online with Michael & Carly\nSupporters at this tier will get to play a session of Dungeons & Dragons with Carly and Michael! We will write a new one-off scenario set in the universe of Drunks and Dragons and play over Google Hangouts with the option to broadcast live on Twitch if all players are comfortable with it. You can be sure you will be running into plenty of beloved NPCs! \nYour Likeness in the Game\nOur amazing artist Bridgit Connell will put your likeness on a card in the game - be immortalized by having Jaela throw a drink in your face or Thom choke you out with a dog sausage! It will be a background character of Bridgit's choosing in one of the various character decks. \nPlay DnD with Drunks & Dragons \nMichael will run a special one-off session of D&D with some of the cast members of Drunks and Dragons\u2026and you! The game will be set in Drunkeros and be full of both PCs and NPCs you know and love.\nOriginal Line Art\nYou can be the proud owner of some of Bridgit Connell's original line art from the game. There are 3 sets of original artwork available, each set containing hand-drawn pieces from all decks including: Aludra/Jaela, Harper/Toby, or Thom/Roz. This tier also includes having your likeness in the game, and you will get that art as well!\nDrink Steins \nWe are going to commission a set of custom drinking steins if you and a friend want to go full viking for a round of gaming. We are still working on this one, but you can be sure it will be rad as cuss!\nDM Creative Consultation \nSit down with Michael and Carly and pick their brains about any dang thing you like! Would you like us to help you do some world building? How about fleshing out a character or some NPCs? We\u2019d also be happy to give you the low down on how to start your own podcast, or promote your show! \nReward Tiers\nNow that you have seen the rewards close up, let's break them down into which go into which tier!\nStretch goals:\nUNLOCKED - 30k - New Character Addition - Roz\nIf we meet this level we will have the budget to include a new playable character to the base game - Everyone's favorite backstabbing, French Canadian pirate! As the captain of the merchant ship, The Chum Guzzler, Roz is adept at navigating the high seas as well as sewing chaos with her sneaky deck. With the ability to put her own cards into the boss deck, she can negate boss abilities and deal damage at the same time.  \n*card text not final\nUNLOCKED - 35k - New Playable Character - Toby Treacletart\nIf we meet this level we will have the budget to include a new playable character to the base game - Everyone's favorite hyper-intelligent gnome! Toby's deck has a powerful minion in the form of his trusty raven, Arlington which allows him to rearrange the boss deck to player's advantage.  \n*card text not final\nUNLOCKED - 40k - Hard mode for Pyre and Bercy\nFor those looking for an extra challenge, at this level we will be able to spend the time balancing and testing the game to include an optional, additional ruleset, and a second set of boss stats that will make all bosses pack a harder punch to give you a run for your money!\nUNLOCKED - 50k - Upgraded Pieces\nRemovable inserts to keep pieces organized. Dials to track hit points instead of number tokens. This will help players, who may or may not be feeling a bit tipsy, keep track of their HP without worrying about smaller pieces to keep track of. \nUNLOCKED - 60k - Art Prints\nFull-color art prints of the four main characters will be added to each order! Hurrah!\nUNLOCKED - 70k - New Villain - Trant Thumble\nIf we meet this level we will have the budget to include an additional boss character as a bonus for all backers who have purchased the base game - Trant is a maniacal dictator from the early days of Drunks & Dragons, and if we reach this stretch goal you'll have a chance to meet him and his many \"children\"! Trant's deck is full of powerful minions, so you'll need to mix-up tactics in order to take him down! This bonus deck will be available in a separate pack after the kickstarter.\n80k - New Playable Character - Lahni Caplan\nTake a swig of ferret wine, because if we meet this level we will have the budget to include a new playable character as a bonus for all backers who have purchased the base game - Everyone's favorite speedy monk! Though her fists don't hit as hard as the others, the speed in which she throws them knocks bosses on their rumps. Lahni is built as a combo-breaking machine who's cards can be played back-to-back for a flurry of damage. This bonus deck will be available in a separate pack after the kickstarter.\n90k - New Playable Character - Luccan\nIf we meet this level we will have the budget to include a new playable character as a bonus for all backers who have purchased  the base game - Everyone's favorite cuss-mouthed Elf! While Luccan is an elven ranger, his true power lies with the string of expletives he can deliver to lower Boss-morale! Luccan's sailor's mouth will see him de-buff boss powers and help protect his teammates. This bonus deck will be available in a separate pack after the kickstarter.\n100k - New Playable Character - Bananas Foster, because good god we hope we never get to this point... (Prove us wrong!)\nIf we meet this level we will have the budget to include a new character (whether he is a boss or a playable character is yet to be determined, as you may have guessed by the mercurial and sometimes adversarial nature of this character) as a bonus for all backers who have purchased  the base game - Alright, fine. We get to this level and you can have Bananas Foster. ARE YOU HAPPY FOR WHAT YOU'VE REDUCED US TO?! This bonus deck will be available in a separate pack after the kickstarter.\nShipping and Fullfillment\nShipping for the base game is $5 in the US, and we are happy to ship internationally, but it costs a bit more. Domestic shipping for the \"Brew-Ha-Ha\" and above tiers is free. We believe we can have everything shipped out by August of 2019, but unforeseen delays can always happen. If it looks like there will be any delays, we will let you know. We will be shipping breakable materials in some packages, and we will do our best to replace anything that gets damaged in transit.

We have a huge amount of art to produce, and then the whole process of manufacturing and shipping the game.

Contained in each of the themed decks are 52 dungeon cards that can be configured in countless ways.\nEach deck has downloadable pdfs of full adventure modules for both 5e and Fate with new, never before seen monsters, magic items, and NPCs to help add more flavor to your game. \nBest of all, each of the pdfs is converted for these major RPG systems: Fate and D&D 5th Edition.\nThe modules can be played in their entirety or as a choose-your-own-adventure style dungeon crawl.\nWe have already successfully created and produced the first two decks Enter the Fiery Pits and Break Through the Icy Divide. We know what it takes to make them awesome and we are doing the same to the three new decks.\n Playing Break Through the Icy Divide\nWant more than one item? Pledge for the highest level you want, then add on the cost of the additional items to your pledge. Once this is all wrapped up you will receive a survey to let us know which items you want mailed to your door.\nThe physical decks are waiting on final art files and will be finished before the campaign ends. Once funded we will send over the final files to the printer to get a physical proof made. Once approved the full production will begin! The modules are currently being worked on and pdfs will be released as soon as they are ready. These may take up to the delivery of the decks. Creating these modules takes some serious work, luckily the first two in the series are done and the following three are coming along well. \nCardography is the brainchild of a great relationship that forged between Norse Foundry and Creature Curation. When we met over dinner at DragonCon many years ago, we quickly realized that with our combined talents we could create amazing experiences for our friends and for roleplayers everywhere. Cardography is not our first collaboration, and it will definitely not be our last! Our partnership utilizes the best aspects of each company\u2019s resources to produce a superior product. We\u2019ve brought together Creature Curations\u2019 ability to design and create unique content, creatures, and quests with Norse Foundry\u2019s many years of industry and manufacturing experience, and a combined art team to develop a unique product and design.\nAll shipping will be calculated and charged separately through the pledge manager option after the campaign is over. All products will ship at the same time.

We promise to be upfront about any issues that we face. We have produced two sets of Cardography on a deadline for distribution, and we were able to hit these deadlines on time. We used these timelines to help establish our Kickstarter timelines, adding a bit of padding for delays, large quantity of shipping, etc. All of these modules are being written and developed by Norse Foundry and Creature Curation. Unlike past Kickstarters Norse Foundry is more than just the publisher. We have completed and playtested the module, rules, items, etc. before launching to prevent any potential art delays or module issues. Since these modules are \u201cliving\u201d documents (not bound books) we can release the originals and make unforeseen changes if needed, which will allow instant updates. All of the resources from Norse Foundry and Creature Curation will be focused on this Kickstarter before we start any other campaigns. You can view our previous collaborative, as well as our individual Kickstarter campaigns. We provide useful updates, and feel the comments have built a community from the experience.

Drink the most lemonade and you win... but watch out! Some people have seen Little Johnny, the neighborhood rascal, sneakin\u2019 about, and you might end up drinking something... That's Not Lemonade!\nOpen Table Game: Join late, leave early, the game still works! \nEasy to Learn, Fast to Play: Takes one turn to learn and only ten minutes to play! \nMaximum Tension, Minimum Rules: Press-your-luck distilled down to its purest form. A card counter\u2019s delight!\nDesigned by the incredible Matt Fantastic with beautiful art by Kelsey Cretcher, That's Not Lemonade! is a great addition to your table. It's fast, light, and fun and we really think you'll enjoy it. The first time we ever played - we started at midnight and didn't leave the table until six in the morning. That's a lot of playing for a 10 minute game!\nThe goal of That's Not Lemonade! is to be the first player to earn three lemons. You earn a lemon by collecting the most lemonade cards in a round, but watch out! Some of the cards are That's Not Lemonade cards and if you draw one, you're out for the round. \nOverall, the gameplay is simple. All you have to do is decide whether to hit or pass. To keep it simple, there's only four kinds of cards:\nLemonade Cards: You want these. Collect the most of these and win your round.\nDOUBLE Lemonade Cards: You want these even more. They're worth two lemonades (duh).\nIce Cards: These are junk cards that help break ties, they don't do much for you, but they're way better than...\nThat's Not Lemonade! Cards: Draw one of these cards and you're out for the round!\nSounds simple, right? Well, it is simple! But don't be fooled, this game is tough! Whoever gets the most Lemonade in the round gets to keep a lemonade card (putting them one closer to winning). This means there are even fewer lemonade cards in the deck, and you're now more likely to draw a That's Not Lemonade! card. The odds have changed! Trying to keep all the cards straight in your head keeps the game challenging, while the overall rules of the game are so easy, a four year old can play (trust us, we have nieces and nephews)!\nWe worked really hard to make this little game just perfect. It fits in a tiny box (about half the size of Two Rooms and a Boom or World Championship Russian Roulette) with a nice plastic insert tray to hold the six mini-cups, the character reference tiles, and the cards. It really is gorgeous and we can't wait for you to see it.\nWe've got two easy pledge levels to make things convenient for you.\nThat's Not Lemonade! ($10): For only $10 you get the game and everything that comes with it! If you want additional copies, you'll have a chance to add those on with our pledge manager after the kickstarter has ended.\nTKG Bundle ($45): For only $45 you get one of each of our games! You'll get Two Rooms and a Boom, World Championship Russian Roulette, and That's Not Lemonade! That's $15 in savings (not to mention the shipping!).\nStay tuned! We've got a couple more pledge levels coming your way shortly.\nNope! Not this time. That's Not Lemonade! is perfect as is and we don't want to clutter it up with a bunch of useless junk. The game is light and tight and the product is too. We promise when we make a heavier minis game (Two Armies and a Boom?) we'll have *like* a bajillion stretch goals.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter is not without it's own risks and challenges.

Back with confidence that you'll get your copy!\nWelcome to Knot Dice Squared - 26 more knot dice in three new designs to combine with the original for more inspiration. Create larger and more intricate Celtic knots while playing with these amazing dice!\nAdd some new twists to your knot dice games...Include more friends...Design larger beautiful patterns...Play through an entirely new set of puzzles...Have more fun with Knot Dice Squared.\nShipping is free in the US, and low worldwide. This project is EU, Canada, Australia, and China Friendly.\nIf you're already familiar with Knot Dice, you can skip ahead to the next section. \nKnot Dice are big, beautiful dice, a forest green pearlized acrylic with indented silver lines. The designs are continuous around the entire die. They don't have numbers on the sides, but placing them side-by-side forms amazing Celtic knot patterns.\nSome enjoy just making designs with them, or leaving them out on tables and counters to play with. But they also can be used to play a large number of games and puzzles. The original Knot Dice set includes 18 awesome dice and rules to 12 games and 7 types of puzzles, with dozens of individual puzzles. There are cooperative games, competitive games, speed games, puzzle games, storytelling games... Individual descriptions of each of the games and puzzles can be found on the original Knot Dice Kickstarter page, and full rules and video instructions are on the Black Oak Games Knot Dice page.\nthe original Knot Dice, some of the new Knot Dice, and a design using both\nThe original is available separately right now on the Black Oak Games web site, or in the $29 reward level here.\nKnot Dice 2? No, this expands Knot Dice to four dice total, so it's Knot Dice Squared!\nThese new dice allow you to create a huge variety of beautiful new designs, they come with an entirely new book of puzzles, and they add some new twists to the games.\nThe four dice are: crossed (the original), squared, rounded, and bridge. Crossed dice have all paths crossing when they go over an edge; squared and rounded dice have all paths parallel when they go over an edge; and bridge dice have both parallel and crossed paths going over the edges, to connect the original knot dice to the new knot dice. (There is much more detail about this in the first update.)\nThe dice are still 20mm, much larger than normal 16mm dice:\nThey still have that great hefty weight to them. And yes, the lines are still continuous around the dice. \nOne box of Knot Dice Squared contains:  \n26 Knot Dice (20mm dice): 9 squared, 9 rounded, and 8 bridge. These combine with one set of the original (crossed) Knot Dice in the right proportions for the included puzzles and games, and many many designs.\nGame Rules on how to modify eight Knot Dice games (described below under Games) to include the new dice, plus all new games from the stretch goals.\nPuzzle Rules to five Knot Dice puzzle types (described below under Puzzles), with a large number of puzzles of each type using the new dice.\n4 Wooden Discs with silkscreened designs (two each in orange and purple for two more players). These tokens are sometimes used to track scores, sometimes used as playing pieces.\n  Knot Dice Squared includes new games from the stretch goals:\n4 Get Me Knots\n1 player, solo game\nCreate as many complete knots as you can of different sizes. It sounds easy enough, but a perfect game is incredibly difficult to achieve. There's plenty of strategy here in how you go about choosing your dice, and which knots you add to and how.\nHedgerow\n2 player, turn-based competitive\nCreate as many complete knots as you can on your side of a wall, but your side can only be at most one die further in any direction than your opponent's. Instead of using the top face of the dice, you use the sides of the dice while the hedgerow grows.\nAlso included are rules changes incorporating the new dice in these games from the original Knot Dice:\nKells, Kells: The Book, and Kells: The Abbey\n1-5 players, turn-based cooperative\nThe new dice add a bit more complexity to these cooperative games. Now you have the added choice of which type of die to add to your pool before you roll it.\nKnot So Fast\n2-5 players, real-time competitive\nKnot Dice Squared really ramps up the challenge in Knot So Fast, where you're trying to complete your knots more quickly than your opponents. You have to pull the right die out of the middle to be able to complete your designs, all while racing your opponents. Fortunately, if you really get stuck, you can swap out one of your dice for one in the middle.\nKnot So Fast Too\n2-6 players, real-time competitive\nWith this many dice, you can play two head-to-head matches of this fast-paced game at the same time. One pair uses the crossed dice, while the other pair uses the squared and rounded dice. A 5- or 6-player game pairs up each player against each other player once.\nDistance\n2-4 players, turn-based competitive\nThis very puzzly game gets quite a complexity boost from the new dice. A new setup enables up to four players to play, using all 44 dice.\nKnot the Whole Story\n1-6 players, turn-based storytelling\nThe focus of the storytelling game is now on two: choose two characters, two settings, two themes for the overall arc of the story. Playing a crossed die means advancing the story along one path; playing a rounded or squared die means advancing the story along the other; playing a bridge die brings the two parts of the story together in some way.\nMinarets\n3-6 players, turn-based competitive\nMinarets really shines with the additional dice. The vertical buildings created by the player partners can be larger, and the new connections make them more complex, adding to the architectural puzzle. \nAn entirely new puzzle book is included in Knot Dice Squared. The types of puzzles will be familiar to owners of Knot Dice, but they are changed with the addition of different dice types.\nThe completion and transformation puzzles start you out with dice in a certain arrangement, and you have to rearrange them in as few turns as possible to form a completed design. The creation puzzles present you with some dice and challenge you to create a symmetrical design out of them. The building puzzles show you a three-dimensional shape, and your task is to build it with completed knots on all of the visible faces of the building. I'll include a more detailed introduction to some of the puzzles in an update soon.\nThe expansion book includes Completion Puzzles 1, Completion Puzzles 2, Transformation Puzzles, Creation Puzzles, and Building Puzzles. With the first four types of puzzles, the number of dice of each type are provided in the setup instructions for each puzzle. The complexity of most of these puzzles is similar to the originals once you are familiar with the new dice. \nWith building puzzles, much larger shapes are possible with the expansion, leading to more difficult puzzles. And part of the puzzle is now figuring out which dice to use.\nI need your help to get these new dice made. The money raised on Kickstarter will go toward the three new molds we need, manufacturing the dice, printing and manufacturing the box and rules and tokens, graphic design, putting it all together, and shipping. If we raise enough I can print some extras and also reprint more of the original Knot Dice boxes. \nMake it happen - Without your help, these dice won't get made.\nGet your set - I don't have any distribution deals, so other than those few retail stores that work with me directly, the only way to get Knot Dice is directly from me. That will probably be even more true with this expansion.\nPlease participate with both your pledges and your voices. Social media and personal shares are greatly appreciated. Do you have a friend who loves dice games, puzzles, art, or Celtic culture? Please let them know about Knot Dice!\nEach backer level below includes a reward and will include all stretch goals. Additional copies of the rewards can be added by increasing your pledge by the appropriate amount either now or in the pledge manager after the campaign (see the Add-Ons section below).\nYou will be able to choose the original green or the new blue dice for each boxed set in a pledge manager once the campaign is over.\n$29 - KNOT DICE (original) - the boxed original Knot Dice set. Includes 18 knot dice, all the original games and puzzles, and 8 wooden tokens. Everything you need to play.

Includes 44 knot dice, all games and puzzles listed above, 12 wooden tokens, and the cloth bag.\n$70 - KNOT DICE SQUARED x2 (FOR DELUXE) - two boxed expansion sets PLUS a large embroidered cloth bag. This is intended for backers who already have Knot Dice Deluxe, because it will give you the right proportions of knot dice for a large number of designs. The additional cloth bag is necessary to hold that many dice! Includes 52 knot dice, all games and puzzles listed above, 8 wooden tokens, and the cloth bag. Original Knot Dice Deluxe required to play.\n$125 - KNOT DICE SQUARED DELUXE COMPLETE - two boxed expansion sets (52 new dice) PLUS one boxed original Knot Dice Deluxe set (36 original dice) PLUS an extra embroidered cloth bag. Includes 88 knot dice in all, all games and puzzles listed above, 12 wooden tokens, and 2 cloth bags. NOTE - if you would like to split colors, you can choose 2 original Knot Dice sets plus a bag instead of the Knot Dice Deluxe set.\nthe original Knot Dice and Knot Dice Deluxe\nthe embroidered cloth bag\nTo add more rewards to your pledge level, just add the dollar amount of any add-ons to your pledge. You will be able to choose your specific add-ons, and the original green or the new blue dice for each boxed set, in a pledge manager once the campaign is over.\n$29 - Add Knot Dice - add more boxes of the original Knot Dice with 18 crossed dice.\n$39 - Add Knot Dice Squared - add more boxes of Knot Dice Squared with 26 dice: 9 squared, 9 rounded, 8 bridge.\n$55 - Add Knot Dice Deluxe - add more boxes of Knot Dice Deluxe with 36 crossed dice and a cloth bag.\n$10 - Add Cloth Bag - add one embroidered cloth bag to any combination of rewards.

Each is hand built in their wood shop in Ann Arbor, MI, and comes with Knot Dice engraved lid, black felt, a removable wooden insert for separating tokens and dice, and nickel pedestal feet. As with every Dog Might product, the Knot Dice Chests come with a lifetime guarantee.\nRegular Size: Premium Black Walnut Hardwood. Black felt, metal nickel pedestal corners. Removable insert in Black Walnut. 9.75\" x 5.75\" x 2\" with an interior depth of 1.5\". Easily holds over 44 Knot Dice, tokens, and rule books. Add-on for $89 (+$10 outside the US)\nLarge Size: Premium Black Walnut Hardwood. Black felt, metal nickel pedestal corners. Removable insert in Black Walnut. 11.75\" x 6.75\" x 2\" with an interior depth of 1.5\". Easily holds over 88 Knot Dice, tokens, and rule books. Add-on for $119 (+$10 outside the US)\nWe achieved every stretch goal! There weren't too many this time around, because I want to make the highest quality product possible, and we achieved so many stretches in the first campaign and I wasn't going to produce anything less than that.\nThese stretch goals have more detailed descriptions in the updates. \nShipping is free in the United States. I'm not able to provide free shipping worldwide this time, but I think I've been able to provide some great worldwide shipping costs. \nThe new expansion box is going to be heavier than the original Knot Dice box (with 8 more dice in it), so it isn't cost-effective to ship them directly from China. This time, I'm using a shipping company based in the US but with regional warehouses in other countries. The US rewards will be freighted to the US to be shipped directly to backers, but there will be:\nCustoms-Friendly Shipping in the EU, Canada, Australia and China.\nI do want to support game stores by offering the items available on Kickstarter to retailers. If you're a retailer, please message me directly through Kickstarter for pricing information, and then you can make your pledge in full through Kickstarter during the campaign. \nCeltic knots are part of a rich tradition of Celtic art and culture. The looping design patterns commonly known as Celtic knots are found in art from nearly 1,400 years ago, though repeating interlacing patterns can be found even earlier. \nThe most famous examples of Celtic knotwork are the Book of Kells (ca. 800), the Lindisfarne Gospels (ca. 700), and the Book of Durrow (ca. 650). These illuminated (decorated) manuscripts were made by monks in Ireland or Britain. Many are available for viewing on the Trinity College Dublin web site in their digital collections. Other examples of Celtic knotwork can be found in manuscripts and carved stone monuments across Europe, primarily in the northwest.\nfrom a page in the Book of Kells\nThe design elements on the faces of knot dice are based on the Celtic Knot Font, created by Daniel Isdell. If you're interested in creating more Celtic knotwork, check out his font!\nCredits & Thanks\nAll photos on this page were taken by Matt Grosso.

All of the games and puzzles are ready to go. I've read up on Jamey Stegmaier's Kickstarter Lessons. There are two primary risks associated with this campaign:\n\n1. Delivery dates might change slightly. I am doing everything in my power to keep on schedule: the dice manufacturer is now a known quantity (so we won't have to change mid-production like last campaign), the rules are mostly finished, and most of the graphic design is done as well. However, the dice factory is a small shop (so they might have trouble meeting the timetable if the campaign does extremely well), and international freight shipping is one of the great mysteries of the universe (hopefully we won't get stopped in customs anywhere or have to deal with any strikes).\n\n2.

A Plague Doctor visited, promising help, but what did he truly bring?\nThe Carrier is an expansion to the original game, and introduces new characters, new abilities, and chain reactions.\nThe Carrier can play 5 to 6 people with one copy, and scales up to 7 to 12 players with 2 game copies. It takes just 10 minutes to play.\n You\u2019ve heard rumors that the Plague Doctor's path now leads to your village. Wherever he goes, his Ravens follow. And now, they carry the infection as well.\nThe Carrier is a quick, strategic, secret role, semi-cooperative social game. One of the party is a Plague Doctor, spreading the Bubonic Plague. The Villagers need to find and rid themselves of the evil doctor before they succumb to the greatest plague in history.\nYou can now grab the original game along with this expansion. It will come with all cards and components as the original (even stretch goal cards).\n The Plague Doctor's ravens inspired the name of the expansion: The Carrier.\n Now, one or more Villagers can begin with one of the Plague Doctor\u2019s ravens in their hand. The malevolent Raven carries with it an Infection. As a Villager, if you receive an Infection card of any kind from the Plague Doctor, you MUST pass your Raven card on your next turn. (The Raven now infects a villager, unless that Villager receives a vaccination).\nLet\u2019s hope your fellow Villagers are prepared.\n Check out the new characters in the The Carrier expansion:\nThe Plague Doctor's powerful new double infection.\nThe Plague Doctor's experience has made him more powerful. He carries a new infection card which infects a villager for two consecutive rounds, should the player be lucky enough to be vaccinated in the first instance.\nThis Carrier Raven carries an immediate infection.\nHis Ravens, the Carriers, also carry infections. As a Villager, if you've been passed an infection card from the Plague Doctor, you MUST now pass a Carrier card the next round! These cards infect your fellow Villagers, and have varying immediate or delayed infections.\nThis Raven carries a 1 round delayed infection to the next victim.\n There are 3 new Raven cards which can be held by Villagers, each infecting other Villagers either immediately, with a 1-round delay, or a 2-round delay. A Villager will typically hold just one Raven card in their hand.\nThis Carrier gives a delayed 2-Round infection.\nThis Raven is happy to spread the Bubonic Plague to a new victim. New raven art by the one and only Lindsey Kustusch.\nThe Huntress\nWe wouldn't leave you defenseless, however. The stealthy Huntress is exceptional, so she should be able to strike down the Plague Doctor's ravenous ravens. (If you hold this card, you are immune to the Ravens).\nThe Tough Villager\nYour Blacksmith has proven to be resilient to infection. He'll be able to live through one infection, even without a vaccination.\nThe Sinister Villager\nOne of your citizens, quite spiteful however, has turned on you and is joining forces with the traveling Plague Doctor. He wins if the Plague Doctor wins.\nA couple of villagers have also promised help with a chance of healing. They give a chance not only of infection, but also vaccination.This card introduces an additional dice into the game, giving vaccinations.\nSanctuary. Your option to roll the dice.\nAnd there remains one other who will provide sanctuary from the ravishes ahead. One way to escape: hide. (If you hold this card, you don't have to roll the dice if you don't want to).\nThe Weak Villager\nOne of the town elders is weak, so a vaccination won't help him at all.\nThe Healer. She gives a vaccination to a villager for 2 consecutive rounds.\nFinally, you've also heard rumors of a powerful new apothecary from the forest, and of her ability to vaccinate others on multiple occasions with just one visit. Will she be able to help? Only time will tell.\nYou\u2019ll also receive the new Silent Villager miniature, which moves to a new player each round. Whichever player the Silent Villager sits in front of, that player is unable to make a guess as to whom the Plague Doctor is in that round.\nWhen the miniature moves to a new player for the following round, you would finally be free to make a guess, should you so choose, and if the cards allow it.\nYou\u2019ll also have the new dice to roll. The previous die included only \u201csafe\u201d and \u201cinfected\u201d results. The new die has 3 of its 6 sides as vaccinations. So should you think a fellow villager is becoming infected from a Plague Doctor, and you are unable to save them with a vaccination, you now can give them a chance\u2026but it carries the chance of an infection as well.\nAre you new to The Carrier, or a veteran? Either way, you can grab the full game plus the expansion, or just the expansion. The full game will come with all of the original Stretch Goal cards, as you are now backing the game as well. Thank you!\nWith these new Carrier expansion cards, you\u2019ll be able to create your own decks and change players\u2019 abilities as desired. If you want only a few players to carry a Raven card, you can do that. If you want to add another Silent Villager, the Blacksmith, a Healer, an Apothecary, the Huntress, a Weak Villager, a Sinister Villager, the Priest, or any combination of any of the cards, you have the freedom to do so.\nAdd these cards to your existing Contagious Villagers, Double Dice, and other cards to make some fun new starting decks.\nHaving the freedom and ability to change the game will be exciting, and we\u2019ve created a new Facebook group just for that purpose: Share your favorite creations with others and talk about The Carrier game, including the expansion: https://www.facebook.com/groups/281524039004410/\nHave you come up with some amazing starting hands for Villagers? Are the Villagers in your game having a tough time? Manage your hands so that you can give each side a chance at winning. And see what others are doing too. It\u2019s never been this fun being Infected.\nEver seen a Plague Doctor dice rolling tray?  We're happy to announce we are partnering with Dog Might on an exclusive rolling tray, made especially for fans of Infected.\nThe rolling tray is made of Flaming Birch with Dog Might's amazing \"Demon Blood\" finish, and black felt. It's a luxurious rolling tray that you can use for any game where you need to roll the bones! - Just add on the appropriate amount shown below to your pledge, which includes shipping to your part of the world.\nThis Plague Doctor rolling tray is only available through this Kickstarter, and you won't be able to get it at Dog Might or anywhere else after that. Dog Might will personally craft and ship each of these.\nThe Carrier is a quick playing social deduction game set during the times of the Bubonic Plague.\nPlayers will try to vaccinate their fellow villagers in their quest to gather information and protect each other, while finding the Plague Doctor. If you are the Plague Doctor, you\u2019ll try to spread the disease as quickly as possible so that you are the lone victor.\nHere\u2019s the catch: no one knows who anyone else is.\nDo you have what it takes to survive the worst of the Bubonic Plague, or will you become The Carrier?\nCREDITS: Game designed by Bryan Sloan.

Card back illustration by DeviantArt's Snook-8. Additional art by Vladimir Manyukhin. Rules layout by Chris Doughman. Played in the very near future by you.\nWhy do we need you to pledge on Kickstarter?\n1. Without your pledge, the game won't exist! (That's big).\n2. When you buy the game now, we can manufacture the game in a higher print run and add more cool stuff into the game.\n3. This may be your only chance to buy the game!\n4. You can infect your friends, in a good way.\nIs this game exclusive to Kickstarter backers?\n- Yes, probably. The expansion probably won't go into retail, aside from any stores who buy the game now on Kickstarter. So this is essentially the only place where you'll be able to guarantee yourself the expansion or the base game. If there are a few copies left over when printing, there might be a few available at conventions or via Amazon USA, but I wouldn't count on it! :)\n                       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI've produced many other projects on Kickstarter, the social game Emotional IQ, and critically acclaimed playing card decks like AVES, British Monarchy, and Romeo and Juliet.

When we shared a demo of our early work (well, hobby) on Imgur and Reddit, the community response was so positive and energizing that we decided we should commit full-time. The footage you see in the video above is the result of our preliminary work, and we're dying to dig in and upgrade literally every feature you see. This Kickstarter, we're asking you to join us to help make truly fine and fun augmented reality & dragons.\nFresh and warm, straight from the egg\nTo bring augmented monsters and heroes to life, we\u2019re using token-based augmented reality. Each token you place and move around your table is transformed into beautifully animated creatures and cravens (or heroes, if you're the sort). In the final version, the QR-coded cards from the demo will be replaced with polished, professional tokens that add to your tabletop roleplaying experience.\nYour one-inch tokens will come in four varieties: print-and-cut, grayboard, ceramic, and engraved wood. To move your characters and beasties through space, you simply move the tokens through a scalable grid that AR&D will generate for you.\nPrototype ceramic tokens\nPrototype wooden inlay tokens\nHero breeding and cultivation is perhaps the best part of tabletop RPGs. Our first core feature is a comprehensive character creator. From within AR&D you'll be able to summon and customize exactly the right hero for your adventure, stick him on a token, and bring him to animated, living-and-breathing augmented life. Want an Elven archer, an Orc cleric, or a Half-demon barbarian? Pick what speaks to you, gear them up, and make them kiss we mean take them on adventures.\nA mockup of the character creator\nAR&D will let you choose from the classic mythological races like Human*, Orc, Elf, Demon-touched, Dwarf, Lizardman, Halfling, Half-giant, and Gnome. Regardless of which you choose, you can customize their natural variations, put them in clown makeup, and select from epic sets of armor and gear to complete the ensemble. (*mythical human, naturally).\nYour new character, ready to murder hobo his way into infamy\nWithin AR&D will be your very own monster farm. Summon up mesmerizing art and captivatingly sculpted monsters that can breathe fire, fly, burrow, and generally end your player characters' dreams. Most of our next months will be dedicated to building up armies of Very Bad Dudes for all of us to play with. On first pass, there will be 25 unique, animated, resizable monsters ready at launch, with more if we hit our stretch goals or find ways to extend out the day/night cycle.\nTo make the library of baddies truly endless, other stretch goals will make it possible for you to upload 3D files you create or find on your own. You could 3D scan yourself and be your own character class! One of us already turned himself into a playable lvl 13 Coward, complete with wooden cart, cabbages, and despair. It\u2019s a prestige class for Peasant, in case you'd like to roll one yourself.\nTo build the best version of AR&D that we can, we'll need you. While we've already had a ton of fun playing around with early versions, we want your help in making a lasting, rich, and robust play experience. As we finish up testable chunks of design, we'll be counting on you to play with us. Long before the final version is issued, your job will be to tell us all the ways in which it breaks, or better yet all the ways in which we can make it shine.\nOur stretch goals will help define how far you all want us to push AR&D. The more bells we ring, the better AR&D will be on release. Also the louder the bells will be.\nWe'll add the ability for you to upload any 3D file you create or download for use in your games. You can share models with friends, scan yourself, or we'll point you in the direction of some open-source libraries to dive into. By making it possible to use your own files, you'll have limitless flexibility in bringing your campaigns to life.\nWith the shared tabletop feature, you can remotely see and interact with the same table your friends are using. You could move your character behind cover in Vermont and your friends in Texas would see it happen right in front of them. You'll have to trust your DM that the Gorgon really was staring your escort in the face the whole time.\nWe'll create a fully integrated character sheet for you to use in-game. Update your stats live as you play and save your sheet session-to-session, character-to-character.\nCombat Assistant lets you toggle displays to track hit points and initiative for each character on the map. He won't *actually* assist you in combat, but at least he'll helpfully tell you how badly you're doing (or, if your DM is a pushover, that you're still alive and fully en-limbed).\nWe'll double our library of animated monsters and beasts. Rampaging LG Unicorns, here we come!\nOur milestones for this Kickstarter are already quite ambitious, so we'll only unlock further stretch goals if we hit all of our first targets.\nWe love Kickstarter, and we love the enthusiasm Kickstarter backers bring to a project. We need a big community of vocal RPG fans to help propel this project forward.\nSome of you may wonder why the funding threshold is set so high. Well, we have huge plans for AR&D, and we're setting ourselves on a course for the next year and a half. We want to make something enduring and worthy of your support. To complete a project that lives up to our hopes and dreams will take everything we've got; half-way simply won't do.\nElder Labs was started by Dan, one of the cofounders of Elderwood Academy. We've always been passionate about fantasy tabletop gaming, and when we first saw augmented reality in action our hearts stopped. Elder Labs' mission is to use the awesome promise of augmented reality to bring tabletop RPGs to life. If you ever want to reach out and say \"hello\" or an awkwardly friendly \"HELLO!\" please hit us up at info@AugmentedDungeons.com.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny Kickstarter, big or small, is at its heart a labor of love, collaboration, and madness. We're no different from any other creators in that regard; we depend on your help and shared love to bring something new to life. There are universal challenges to all Kickstarters and Dan, via Elderwood Academy, has been integral in five successful campaigns.\n\nThe biggest challenges of this project are twofold. First, we need to build a product that is seamlessly fun to use while playing tabletop RPGs. While we love playing with the demo, we're certain there are extensive opportunities to make it more fun for everyone.\n\nSecond, we're basically trying to create an MMORPG's worth of digital assets from the ground up, to be optimized for iOS and Android and serve you the most attractive digital garden of animated monsters and heroes ever. We've lined up everything we need to get it done, but it's no mean feat, and half done will probably mean undone. To help insure against that, we've set the funding level high to cover the absolute costs we expect to incur over the next year.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Elder Labs\nFirst created \u00b7 0 backed\nElder Labs was founded by Elderwood Academy co-founder Dan.

It is a game of balls, estates, sly glances, and turns about the garden. At least on the surface. Underneath this, just as in Austen's own novels, it is a game of social ambition, family obligation and breathtaking, heart-stopping longing.\nIn this game, you play the type of characters that captured your imagination in Austen's books - from a wealthy heir who falls in love with the aloof new arrival, to a charming socialite bent on ruining the reputation of their rivals. Exploit your advantages, connections, and family influence to achieve your secret desire - all while jealously guarding your good name.\nNot only that, players in Good Society hold the power to control the story itself, and change it in their favour. Take control of influential connections, create rumour and scandal, and spend tokens to orchestrate balls, carriage accidents, and even marriages.\nIt is the elegance of Austen's world, the sharpness of her wit, and the beauty of her passion that inspired us to create this system. But it is the deep and complex struggle between desire, expectation, and position that has guided its development - and we hope you will enjoy both elements.\nDesire to see Good Society in action? Watch an actual play of the game on Geek Space TV!\nClick to go the Backer's only update\nIn Good Society, you will play a character that could very well have stepped out of the pages of Austen's work.\nYou will build you character from four components: your character role, your family background, your relationship and of course your secret desire.\nYou could for instance, play a socialite in the militia, with the secret desire to come into substantial wealth - while also being childhood rivals with another player (Wickham perhaps?)\nOr, you could play a wealthy heiress from old money, with a secret desire to marry off two of your closest acquaintances - while also dealing with a long-term uncertain romance of your own (um, Emma?)\nWhatever you choose, drama, romance, and tense ballroom scenes are sure to follow.\nGood Society comes with nine character roles to chose from, as well as seven different family backgrounds, to capture the full range of regency gentry.\nGood Society will be a full colour hardcover book, packed with over 150 pages of thematic material and beautiful art. Our aim is to create a beautiful book worthy of even Pemberley's library.\nThe game comes with 20 Secret Desire and Relationship cards to keep Good Society replayable and customisable. It also includes all the rules you need to create original desires and relationships of your own.\nPlus, 16 additional cards have already been unlocked from stretch goals.\nOn top of all this, thanks to stretch goal unlocks, backers at All the PDFs and above will also receive a PDF LARP VERSION of the game, perfect for play on a single occasion - and of course, in regency dress.\nAnd, if you were thinking to yourself that the regency era would be better if it was just a little magical, backers have also unlocked a PDF re-theme of the game, Pride, Prejudice, and Practical Magics, that is included in every tier containing the stretch goals. You can read more about this expansion in our update here.\nIn Good Society, supporting characters hold tremendous influence over the lives, situations, and hearts of the protagonists. Not only that, but players actually take on the role of such characters during the game, to inject more drama (and romance!) into the story.\nTo help you create vivid supporting characters quickly and easily, we've created the Deck of Non-Player Gentry. Each (double-sided) card contains two different intriguing regency characters, along with vital information such as their wealth, marital status, and less importantly, their personality. \nThere are now 30 cards in the deck, which will be fully illustrated by Aviv Or (avivor.com). Thanks to a stretch goal unlock we were able to add 10 more cards!\nThere is now also an additional Expansion Deck of Re-theme cards, containing20 unique NPGs, 10 Secret Desire Cards, and 10 Relationship Cards, created especially for Pride, Prejudice, and Practical Magics and Sense, Sensibility and Swordsmanship. You can add a physical version of this deck to your pledge for $25aud.\nWant your regency character immortalised in the deck? Back at the Gentry of Note, or Gentry of Consequence level and work with us to create a member of the regency gentry for inclusion in all copies of the deck of NPGs. \nYour character will be illustrated in full colour by Aviv. This illustration can be based on a written description, or inspired by your likeness, or the likeness of someone you love (with permission!)\nWe don't make any extra profit on the Gentry of Note tier - all additional funds go directly to the artist. We just want to fill our game with beautiful art.\nPlease note, these pledges do not include a physical version of the Expansion Deck of Re-theme Cards. If you would like a physical copy of the deck, simply add $25aud to your pledge (physical tiers only).\nGood Society is a collaborative tabletop roleplaying game, where you and your friends take on the role of regency characters, AND the forces that complicate their lives, to create a truly Austen story. One person takes on the role of the Facilitator, who helps the players to create the game's fiction, and plays supporting characters as needed.\nThe game is quick to teach and easy to learn, whether or not you've played a roleplaying game before.\nNew to roleplaying? Not a problem. The New To Roleplaying Guide has already been unlocked in our stretch goals, so if you want to give roleplaying a go for the first time, now is your chance!\nTo create a game that plays like an Austen novel, we've created a completely original system, with game mechanics that mirror the actual mechanics of Austen's world.\nReputation, family background, rumour and scandal, and of course, the writing of letters, are all important rules of the game. These mechanics are all geared towards narrative and collaborative play, allowing players to work together to shape the story they want to tell.\nAt the core of Good Society is the trade of resolve tokens that grant story shaping powers to players and the Facilitator alike. These tokens let players take actions as diverse as:\nCausing an event, conversation, or circumstance to occur\nManipulating or changing a character's feelings\nProcuring favours or discovering secrets\nCreating details about the past, or even flashbacks \nTo mirror the ebb and flow of an Austen novel, Good Society is played in five phases.\nTo learn more about how the game works, back the game and grab the Quickstart, or view one of the actual plays below.\nGeekSpace TV - recommended!\nUs!\nA minor caution - the end of this Actual Play reveals some of the Secret Desires which appear in the Quickstart (spoilers!)\nAs part of this campaign, backers unlocked and voted for a re-theme of Good Society. The winner was Pride, Prejudice and Practical Magics, inspired by fiction such as Jonathon Strange and Mr Norrell, Shades of Milk and Honey, and Sorcery and Cecelia.\nThis re-theme will be included as a PDF for backers of \"All the PDFs\" and above. In it, characters will take on new roles, desires, and relationships as they struggle with prophecies, glamour and incantations, all while maintaining an impeccable reputation, and finding a suitable match.\nWe've now unlocked a second re-theme of Good Society, Sense, Sensibility and Swordsmanship, inspired by the high number of votes we received for the Scarlet Pimpernel. This re-theme also pays homage to works such as Zorro, and Sovay.\nThe key focus of the theme is on double lives \u2013 with each character having their regular Good Society play materials and concerns, as well as additional play materials that represent their secret bad-ass persona.\nMaterials from Good Society and both re-themes are completely compatible, which means, if you want sword fighting AND magic AND advantageous marriages now you can!\nWe are NOT using a pledge manager for this campaign. Should you be after the Expansion Deck of Re-theme Cards, or additional copies of one of the fine products below, please adjust your Kickstarter pledge by the appropriate amount.\nAdd-ons are only available for physical reward tiers. If you have pledged at All the PDFs and you would like the physical cards, there is now a tier for that, All the PDFs + Physical Cards.\nStorybrewers Roleplaying is made up of Hayley Gordon (twitter: @storybrewers), and Vee Hendro (twitter: @rocketeer_vee).

The Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master uses the experiences of thousands of GMs to help us focus on how we prepare our games, how we run our games, and how we think about our games. It includes practical steps for focusing our preparation activities on those things that will bring the biggest impact to our game.\nFive years ago, the Lazy Dungeon Master offered a simplifed approach for preparing fantasy RPGs with one clear directive: prepare only what most benefits our games. This focus on lightweight preparation and improvisational preparation resonated with many GMs over the past five years.\nBut during that time and with the release of the fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons, the world of fantasy roleplaying has changed and expanded. With five years of new systems and new ideas, all GMs have a wealth of experiences to share and explore to help us prepare and run great RPGs. Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master builds off of the concepts of the well-received GM's guidebook Lazy Dungeon Master, updating that book with five years of new experiences, new approaches, and new observations of the way people prepare and run RPGs. This new book is a completely self-contained work, which does not require anyone to have previously read The Lazy Dungeon Master.\nReturn of the Lazy Dungeon Master offers a new focused approach for preparing and running our roleplaying games. The book includes an eight-step guide for lightweight game preparation and is focused on how we prepare for our games, how we run our games, and how we think about our games.\nYou can check out the PDF preview of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master or check out the table of contents below to see if it's the right book for you.\n   Based on research involving hundreds of books, videos, articles, and interviews with top Gamemasters, as well as thousands of results from Gamemaster surveys, Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master helps us understand the best tips and tricks used by GMs all over the world to bring the most fun to our games.\nPrepare what benefits your game.\nAbout This Kickstarter\nThe full text of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master is complete. Your funding towards this Kickstarter will go towards the editing of the book by veteran RPG editor Scott Fitzgerald Gray, and the layout and art direction of the book by veteran RPG art director Marc Radle. The book will also include internal art by Pedro Potier. Here's an example of the art.\nThe Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook\nAs this Kickstarter grows, we will put together a Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook. This workbook will include a wide range of tools, maps, and reference sheets to help you run your 5e roleplaying game. It will have a brand-new cover by Jack Kaiser and is intended to be used right at the table. All backers will get the PDF of this workbook and digital versions of the maps. Backers at the $13 level will be able to order print copies of the workbook for the cost of printing (about $6) and shipping (about $6 in US and UK).\nHere are some example worksheets we will include:\nLazy DM Reference Sheet \nSession Preparation Worksheet \nCharacter Tracker Campaign Worksheet \n5e Cheat Sheet \nRandom NPC Names \nRandom Traps \nRandom Single-Use Magic Items \nRandom Dungeon Encounters \nRandom Fantastic Features\nBelow you'll see some example draft reference sheets. Note that these sheets have not yet gone through formatting or design.\n5e Quick Reference\n Trap Generator\nLazy Lairs\nThe Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook will also now include ten \"Lazy Lairs\" including full-color maps of commonly-used dungeons and one-page write-ups with descriptions, read-aloud text, and area aspects. They're designed so you can easily use them in your game with little to no preparation needed. These Lazy Lairs will be included in the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook and all backers will receive digital versions of these maps with fully-annotated DM versions and unannotated versions for use in virtual tabletops like Roll20 and Fantasy Grounds.\nHere are two example maps by Derek Ruiz and Daniel Walthall.\n  Stretch Goals\nLazy Dungeon Master Workbook PDF ($5000 - Unlocked!). All backers will receive the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook PDF. \nInternal Artwork ($6,000\u2014UNLOCKED). We'll commission internal artwork to make the book even more beautiful.\nEPUB E-book Version ($8,000\u2014UNLOCKED) Every backer will now receive Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master as an EPUB e-book as well. This format is perfect for reading the book on a phone, tablet, or e-reader.\nHardback Version At Cost for $13 Pledges ($10,000\u2014UNLOCKED). Those who back at the $13 level will be able to buy the book in a deluxe hardback edition. This collector's edition will be available from RPG Now for the cost of printing, about $15, and is perfect or sitting in a comfortable chair, drinking a favorite beverage, and pondering how to make your next game awesome. You do not need to increase your pledge above $13 to have this option. You will receive a link to order the book at the cost of printing and shipping when the book is ready.\nFive Lazy Lairs ($15,000\u2014UNLOCKED). The Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook will contain five full color maps of common locations we use in our D&D games including Caves, Temple, Castle, Sewers, and Dungeon. These maps will be done by Daniel Walthall, Derek, Ruiz, and Miska Fredman.\nFive More Lazy Lairs and a Print Version of the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook ($20,000\u2014UNLOCKED). We'll add five more Lazy Lairs to the Lazy Dungeon Master Workbook including the Cellars, Tower, Docks, Mines, and Catacombs. We will also commission a new cover for the workbook by Jack Kaiser and create a print-on-demand version of the workbook for those at the $13 tier. We expect the cost of printing to be roughly $6.\nHigh Resolution Cover Artwork (2,000 backers\u2014UNLOCKED). Every backer will receive high-resolution JPEGs of Jack Kaiser's covers for each of the books suitable for printing or using as a background for a phone or tablet.\nLazy Lair Descriptions ($30,000\u2014UNLOCKED). All ten Lazy Lairs will include a one-page lair description with general notes about the lair and read-aloud text for each of the lair's rooms or chambers. These lair descriptions will make it easy to use these lairs right at the table with very little preparation ahead of time.\nDiscounted Original Lazy Dungeon Master ($50,000\u2014UNLOCKED). For those who don't have the original Lazy Dungeon Master, all backers will be able to buy the original Lazy Dungeon Master PDF for half price ($3) and $13 backers will also be able to buy the softcover version of the book for three bucks off ($7) from Lulu.com.\nA Note on Print Delivery\nAs we have with Fantastic Locations and Fantastic Adventures, we will be fulfilling print copies of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master for the Print Option tier through RPGNow. This means you will be able to purchase a copy of Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master directly from RPGNow at the cost of printing and shipping. We expect this cost to come to roughly $6 for the softcover book and $15 for the hardcover book plus $6 for shipping in Europe and the US. This cost is not included in your pledge and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to receive them. When the books are ready, you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from RPG Now.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe full text of the main book is complete, and both the editor (Scott Fitzgerald Gray) and the art director (Marc Radle) are on board to build it into a full book. \n\nPersonal catastrophes can always get in the way of the production of a book like this, but the risk is low.

We\u2019re Quentin and Dan from Elderwood Academy, and this Kickstarter we\u2019re inviting you to live our dream together: staying home with tiny dice in tiny wood-carved boxes. Never again need you be the fool at the party without an emergency set of dice contained within a vanity dice holder. Also, free advice: don\u2019t go to parties. Wear PJs and make your friends come to you.\nLike their prodigious progenitors, Hex Chest Minis are crafted in a spectacular array of wood options, delicately appointed with engraved art, and finished by hand. They offer a pleasing permutation of personalization, precision, and polish packed into a precious parcel, prepared to portably protect your playthings.\nThis Kickstarter we\u2019re partnering up with Norse Foundry to make Pebble dice exclusively available along with your Mini Hex Chest. Pebble dice are brand-new miniature zinc-alloy cast masterpieces you could (but absolutely should not) eat like jellybeans and come in a wide range of finishes and themes. If micro precision machined aluminum is more your speed, that's an option, too.\nDoes it *seriously* have to get this cold? Stay inside, people. Also, it's Purpleheart with Gnomish Copper dice.\n  Start off by selecting a wood choice that speaks to you. Choose between the Classic line, which includes Walnut, Cherry, or Mahogany, and the Exotic line which expands your options to include Purpleheart, Lacewood, or Padauk. All Minis are hand-sanded until they're river-stone smooth, tasted for vintage, then brushed with oil for a lasting finish.\nClassic wood options\nThe Classic selection lets you choose between Walnut, Mahogany, and Cherry options. Open and Beehive interiors available with all rewards.\nExotic wood options\nThe Exotic selection lets you choose between Padauk, Purpleheart, and Lacewood. Open and Beehive interiors available with all rewards.\n  Upon an un-warmed rock we espied Padauk with Nightmare Black and Purpleheart with Gnomish Copper. Then we wised up and went home. #Indoors4Life\n  All Hex Chest Minis come with engraved art. The Classic line have the Elderwood phoenix etched upon them while the Exotic line opens up your choice of Signature art.\n  When pledging for an Exotic Hex Chest Mini, get your choice of Signature art. Classic line all include complementary Elder Phoenix art\n  Oh, is it still cold outside? Get wrecked, mother nature. PS Mahogany with Nightmare Black dice.\n    The best kind of dice tower\nA dice box with dice is a harp playing Crazy Train (hauntingly gratifying). Since we\u2019re partied with Norse Foundry\u2019s minstrels we\u2019re thrilled to be able to offer Pebbles, their new mini metal dice, to accompany you on your quests. Pebbles are forged using zinc-alloy and cast with your choice of six different finishes.\nPebble Dice\nPsst. Wanna get low after class?\nMiniature Aluminum Dice\nIf Pebbles aren't getting your rocks off, may we suggest these solid machined aluminum minis? Each set is precision cut to give you the truest rolling in the smallest package possible.\nThey come in purple, green, black, red, and blue anodized finishes\nMiniature Plastic Dice\nIf you've already got yourself a chunk of randomized metal, you'll also have the option of our Rare Earth Superplastic dice in blue, red, and black. We should note for legal and also common sense reasons that \"Rare Earth Superplastic\" is remarkably similar to \"regular plastic\" in that it is regular plastic.\n  We had to lean out a window to take this shot. #Courageous. Mahogany and Purpleheart with blue plastic mini polys.\nWhen the campaign closes you\u2019ll be able to further customize your Hex Chest Mini so it can serve you best. Determine your interior design with either Beehive or Open styles. Beehive captures each mini die in its own micro-tomb while Open is more emotionally approachable.\nNext, you\u2019ll want to choose whether you want a loop adapter on your Mini Hex Chest (never open your front door diceless ever again) or if you\u2019d rather go with the symmetric all-smooth-sided style. The loop lets you mount your Mini on a keyring, a pocket chain, or a necklace while the all-smooth-sided style slides blindly into a pocket without a hitch.\nOpen to the left of me, Beehive to the right, here I am, stuck in the middle with you\n  This time around we changed things up. Because we hit our stretch goal for the campaign we'll be planting 500 trees! That's enough to cover approximately half a million small wooden projects! Planting will begin near the end of the campaign :D\n  Well let\u2019s just say that Minis are 2.1 inches by 2.8 inches whereas other objects can be as large as 11 by 83 inches. Notable! Pebbles are 8.5mm to 13mm (10mm standard scale).\n  Quentindo Switch and Danton Abbey are two nerdy boys with big eyes for tiny wood projects. When Q isn\u2019t lounging in the tropics, he spends his time immersed in historical fanfiction and fanfiction reenactments. D likes turtles. You can reach out to and bop either of us any time at info@elderwoodacademy.com, @elderwoodboxes on Twitter, at our Facebook page, or on our waterwheel-powered website.\nNorse Foundry is a precision dice and RPG accessory forge founded (...foundried?) on the belief that tabletop gaming can be more fun with the addition of quality gaming gear. Their expert smiths have been fashioning metal dice and coins for adventurers for years. You can digitally stick your hands in their fires here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe\u2019re Kickstarting Minis and Pebbles because they\u2019re brand new to us and we want the opportunity to create a refined, lasting process around crafting them. We'd like Minis and Pebbles to grow old together and we hope you'll be a part of their origin story. If you join us on our Mini journey you\u2019ll get a first-row seat as together we make micro history.\n\nHex Chest Minis are our smallest project to date by an order of magnitude.

I tell stories of the creatures through my sculptures, many of which were his original idea.\nI named the world Revilo because it is Wyatt's middle name backwards, and Ttayw just didn't have a nice ring to it. As a kid I constantly found myself drifting from reality by immersing myself in someone else's world. The settings felt like a realm that I could explore when I didn't feel like I fit in with other kids. By creating Revilo, I wanted to build a place where the creatures would know Wyatt as a champion of their world, and where he would always be protected.\nI have sculpted over 50 different species that inhabit the 12 major regions of Revilo. Each has a backstory to explain how they all intertwine within the world.\n      Click the image to see bigger images\n             Sample Pages\n       A short documentary about me:\n  PLEDGE LEVEL DETAILS\nCoins of Revilo \u2013 Each Coin set will contain ten coins, two of each, so that you can display the front and back at the same time. The four coins with the \"C\" icon on them represent different values of Cree and each have a unique texture behind the icon. The Murk's Hollow coin is the newest currency introduced to Revilo. These are 35mm wide, 3mm thick, and have a nickel finish.\nCreature Collection \u2013 The book will be 120 pages, hardcover, and 8.5\" x 11\". It will have a short history of Revilo, the pantheon of gods, a map of Revilo inside the covers, and then the species will be broken down by regions. Each species will have a photo, illustration, and story about them.\nCollector Combo \u2013 This collects the Creature Collection book, the Coins of Revilo, and a unique sketch card of a creature from Revilo.\nExplorer Level \u2013 At this level you want to help discover a new species. You truly want to travel to Revilo! \n\nWe will collaborate on an idea for a creature together. Once the concept is finalized I will sculpt, paint, and create the narrative for the critter. It will be added to the Creature Collection Volume 1, and the final sculpture will be delivered to you! You\u2019ll also receive all of the items from the Collector Combo pledge level.\nMix & Match\nWant more than one item? Pledge for the highest level you want, then add on the cost of the additional items to your pledge. Once this is all wrapped up you will receive a survey to let me know which items you want mailed to your door.\nKickstarter Live\nI will be streaming live:\nThursday 1/18 at 8:00 pm EST \nThursday 1/25 at 8:30 pm EST\nWhat's the Plan\nThe book is 90% designed with press-ready files. The last 10% will be finished with new creatures from the Explorer pledge level and if we will meet a stretch goal include additional pages. Once funded I will send over the existing file to the printer to get a physical proof made of the majority of the book. I want to have these books in hand for a bunch of conventions this year, so I launched the Kickstarter with this as close to finished as I could.\nShipping\nAll shipping will be calculated and charged separately through the pledge manager option after the campaign is over.

G\u00f6tterd\u00e4mmerung. Ragnar\u00f6k. It goes by many names, but in the end there are only ashes. The heavens have fallen and in their wake a void beckons to be filled. Mythic Arcana is an epic card and dice game about the creation of a new pantheon from the remains of shattered ones. Choose your gods wisely and use them to battle the opposition. Only one pantheon can reign supreme.\nIn Mythic Arcana 2-4 players will take turns summoning gods through the roll of dice. Recruit gods to do your bidding: alter dice results, destroy enemy gods, and unite the ultimate pantheon.  \nThe first player to obtain a god in each domain: Heavens, Life, Wisdom, War, and Death, will reign over the heavens victorious.\n    prototype pictures\n Mythic Arcana was designed way back in 2014, however, due to the sheer volume of artwork required for the game to resonate, it ended up on the backlog. In it's current iteration, we've brought the artwork and visuals to the forefront by printing them on large tarot-sized cards. We think this adds to the premium feel and gives the artwork the resplendent space it needs. But we didn't stop there; the whole game is wrapped in tightly competitive yet approachable gameplay mechanics that anyone can pick up and enjoy. A typical game of Mythic Arcana lasts between 15 and 25 minutes depending on the number of players. \nWhat's in the Box?\nEach box contains more than 70 individually illustrated tarot-sized cards (70mm x 120mm) and a set of twelve (16mm) dice in 4 different player colors. \nexample of dice\n  Gameplay is deceptively simple. Deity cards are displayed on the table, you summon them based on what you roll, and collect one of each type to win. The challenge comes from choosing the right gods and goddesses to not only prevent your opponent from completing the set, but also protecting your own pantheon and manipulating your dice rolls. \nAthena & Fujin\nDeities have various abilities that will influence the game. Arrival abilities occur as soon as a god is summoned. Presence abilities are constantly in-effect and can do anything from increasing your dice total, to protecting your gods from destruction. Feats are unique abilities that require a god to be exhausted in order to use. Finally, Destruction abilities take place when a god is destroyed- they'll make you think twice before attacking!\nFor Mythic Arcana we drew from famous classical mythologies to populate the world. You'll discover gods and goddesses from Greek, Norse, Hindu, Egypt, and Shinto mythologies and folklore. \nCheck out some gameplay videos to see more!\nHow To Play\nYou can also find a video of a playthrough in our developer update.\nCurious for more?

I love the concept of randomness with the dice and deck but the strategy is great! I went to the dropbox page where you have the rules and a prototype of the deck and I do have some suggestions though and hopefully they're helpful. They're not mechanical things that I'm pointing out; it's more about flavor. For instance: Heracles is not really a god. Enyalius is the ancient Greek god of battle. I feel that'd be a better choice? The other points I'm going to make are just details: Eris is the goddess of discord, not wisdom (that would be Athena); Nike is the goddess of victory, not speed (that would be Hermes); Fujin is misspelled, it's actually Fuujin (two u's); Skadi is the Norse goddess of winter (I'm assuming she's the card with the missing name at the end of the sheet). I may seem pedantic pointing these things out but the idea is so good and the art so amazing that I would really like this to be as good as it is promising (and maybe you guys still have time to fix anything). I also have other suggestions: from what I gather, there are other card types besides the gods. That's pretty cool. However, with keeping to the pantheon theme, maybe those non-god cards could be minor gods? Per the rules they wouldn't count towards building your pantheon (winning the game) but they're still part of it (instead of having characters or monsters). I read in one of the updates that you did consider gods like Dionysus but didn't because it didn't follow with the main mechanics. However, maybe the inclusion of gods like this could be in place of the non-god cards. They wouldn't be death, life, etc. like the main pantheon. So they'd still function like the other cards.

We are hoping for a great response, but demand beyond our expectations could be the main risk for delays. Our last Kickstarter was very manageable in terms of scale and we have the ability to cater to a larger response. There is of course a point where production levels could influence the time of delivery.\nThis is our smallest Kickstarter yet. Our previous campaign is well into production and comfortable for our outlined shipping date.\n\nFrom the experience of 2 kickstarters under our belt, we have ironed out our pipeline and improved the production process. We aim to cater our kickstarters accordingly, to be a comfortable size to ensure we hit our goals.\n\nWe have allowed a 11 month period for production which is potentially more than we need if the project is inline with our previous project, but we'd rather be early as opposed to late. Our previous campaign was over twice the size in terms of mini quantity and is on track for the same time period. Our biggest goal is to break the Kickstarter trend and be early on this campaign. We hope we can achieve that but we'd be happy to fulfil the orders on time.\n\nEach campaign comes with it's own challenges and it's own risks. We always have to take into account unforeseen circumstances. We feel very prepared but are not capable of foreseeing any future hurdles.

Roll high enough in perception, and you can see that it's actually a precision-crafted, compact, durable, magnetic transforming caddy for all your tabletop game gear.\nReady to play? Take off the straps, dice vaults, and pen cases from the top of the chest. Snap the two halves of the coaster together, then turn the sides of the Mimic Chest into a dice tower. Turn over the dice vaults and pen cases to use them as card stands, then unload all the tablets, hero vaults, hundreds of dice, and whatever else you carried in there, and you're ready to play!\nHero Vaults are available, plus free dice!\nNow you've done it. Hero Vaults are available as add-ons to any pledge! They will fit up into the space under the dome of a Mimic Chest and they'll fit snugly inside a Tankard.\nTo add a Hero Vault (or two or three), simply increase your pledge amount! You'll be able to choose Hero Vaults as an add-on in our post-campaign survey. Three Hero Vaults will fit stacked inside a Tankard or nestled in the top of a Mimic Chest. Basic/Standard Hero Vaults are $15, and Premium Hero Vaults are $25. There is no shipping charge for Hero Vaults, when they are added on to a Mimic Chest or Tankard pledge.\nNow every Mimic Chest comes with three sets of dice to fill your dice vaults! Keep telling your friends, family, foes and FLGSs about us, and we could easily reach the LASER ENGRAVING goal at $80,000.\nThe Mimic Chest is easy to take apart and re-assemble, and it carries all your tabletop gaming gear!\n  Stretch Goals!\nFirst Look At Hero Vaults\nHow We Started\nPolymorph Crafts began in December 2016 when Matt put his engineering and woodworking skills to work to create a portable, affordable, simple wooden chest that would hold everything he needed to play Dungeons & Dragons. But that wasn\u2019t enough. What if he could figure out a way to turn it into a dice tower and rolling tray, too?\nWe even bought a tiny treasure chest to make sure the scale was correct.\nMatt went right to work on the computer, and soon we were looking at a 3D model of a Mimic Chest and all its components. He took measurements out to the shop, and made our original prototype by hand. It wasn't perfect, but it was functional, and we knew we had something special. In order to share Mimic Chests with you, we knew that we would need to be more efficient and precise. \nWith our very first prototype, we could tell we were onto something, but it needed to be perfect!\nWe purchased a CNC router, and Matt created prototypes two and three. He made custom jigs and toolpaths, and we found local magnet, leather and wood suppliers, and we decided the time was right to launch our Kickstarter.\nPrecision tools like CNC routers help us make sure that every magnet lines up perfectly!\nHow Your Mimic Chest Is Created\nAfter every piece is cut to size and the holes are drilled, we carefully glue in the magnets, apply stain and clear-coat, and glue down the felt or suede rolling tray surface.\nEvery magnet is placed by hand to make sure its polarity is correct.\nOver two hundred magnets keep the Mimic Chest sturdy while allowing for quick and simple transformation. Then we add rivets and clasps to the leather straps, sew the nylon straps together, do one last quality check, and send the Mimic Chests out the door!\nBasic, Standard, and Premium\nBasic Mimic Chest\nOur Basic tier was designed for the budget-conscious gamer. We kept costs down by using high-grade plywood, nylon straps, and wool felt.\nStandard Mimic Chest\nThe Standard tier is a bit fancier, made from the same wood but upgraded to leather straps and suede. \nPremium Mimic Chest\nIf you really want to make a statement, choose a Premium tier reward; they're made from solid wood and include leather straps and a suede-lined rolling tray.\nChoose Your Own Mimic Chest\nWhen our campaign ends, we will send a survey to all backers so you can choose your rewards. This includes choosing the color for your wood and rolling tray lining, and the colors for your free dice sets! You can also choose a vegan-friendly option: a $0 add-on at checkout to change Premium leather straps and suede lining to nylon and felt.\nDice Tray Linings\nBasic Mimic Chests have wool felt color options:\nPurple, Blue, Red, Black\nUnlocked Felt Colors!\nPink, Green, Orange, Brown\n Standard and Premium Mimic Chests are available in four suede colors:\nPurple, Blue, Red, Black\nUnlocked Suede Colors!\nOrange, pink, teal, and brown suede unlocked!\nNote: we are on the lookout for a more foresty-green suede to add as well. More info to come soon.\nStains and Woods\nBasic and Standard Mimic Chests are available in five stains:  \nRed, Oak, Natural, Purple, Espresso\nPremium Mimic Chests are available in four woods:\nWalnut, Maple, Padauk, Purpleheart\nDice Vaults and Tankards\nTankard\nIf you don't need a dice tower and rolling tray, consider backing us for a Dice Vault or Tankard reward level! We have taken the Dice Vaults from the Mimic Chest and are offering them separately or as a set of ten, combined into a Tankard. Tankards are made from seven dice vaults, three pen cases, and two coasters, and include straps for easy carrying.\nTankards do not include a dice tower or rolling tray.\nFrom Our Friends\nDid you back the Deck of Many? We are proud to have partnered with them in creating a special card for those who backed their campaign at $49+ and ours at $99+! \nDo you live outside of North America? You'll get a coupon code good for 25% off a set of dice from DnDice, a wonderful dice vendor in the UK.\nIf you pledge for a Basic Mimic Chest, you'll get a 15% off coupon for a set of dice from the guys at Settling Geek!\nDid you pledge for our Standard Mimic Chest? You're going to get a coupon for 50% off a set of dice from our friends at Tabletop Loot!\nIf you pledge for a Premium Mimic Chest or Tankard, you'll get a set of 7 polyhedral dice free with your reward, courtesy of Critical Hit Collectibles!\nRelevant coupon codes will be sent out after our campaign is closed.\nAlready Backed Us? Tell Your Friends!\nTweet: \"I just backed @polymorphcrafts on @kickstarter because I'm an awesome person! http://bit.ly/MimicChest\"\nShare on Facebook\nHow Will We Use Your Funds?\nOne set of dice and pen vaults takes about three hours in the CNC, so our wish list starts with a few more CNC routers to make everything more efficient. Our goal will also allow Matt to work for Polymorph Crafts full time until the rewards are completed.\nLess Interesting, But Still Important\nAfter the end of our Kickstarter, we will email you a survey where you can finalize your reward options. This includes stain, felt and suede colors, and wood type. It is also your chance to make sure that we have the correct mailing address for you.\nA note on shipping: If you want us to ship to you but your country isn't listed, please let us know! Also, Premium rewards weigh more than Basic and Standard ones, so that's why they have higher shipping costs. And of course, if anything arrives damaged, please let us know and we will do our best to make it right!\nFor our backers outside of North America: please note, we are not liable for customs fees or taxes. This is why we are happy to provide Standard and Premium backers with a 25% off coupon code at UK dice vendor, DnDice. Hopefully that helps soften the blow when your rewards arrive.\nAlso, we now have a distributor in Germany, which should cut down on any customs fees or taxes you'd have to pay when your reward arrives. We are also adding countries to our ship-to list as requested, so if you don't see your country listed, send us a message!\nWhen will my rewards arrive?\nIf we reach our funding goal, the first products will likely ship in Spring of 2018 (other than the December rewards). This will give us a chance to get the funds from Kickstarter, purchase material and machines, and create all your rewards! We will be shipping rewards as soon as they're ready to go, so not everyone will have the same shipping date. We plan on letting you know when your reward begins production and when it ships, but volume may make this tricky.\nPlease contact us with any questions or concerns throughout the campaign and fulfillment - we know how exciting and nerve-wracking it can be to have to wait for your rewards!\nImportant Note About Magnets\nYour Mimic Chest, Tankard, and Dice Vaults are held together by 1/8\" x 1/8\" neodymium magnets. Each magnet has almost a pound of strength. We have done everything we can to make sure that the magnets do not come out of your Mimic Chest, Tankard, or Dice Vault. If any do come loose, please keep them away from children and animals!\nGuarantee\nWe take pride in the things we create, but we also understand that wood is sometimes imperfect. If your rewards arrive damaged or if they break through regular use, please let us know! We are happy to replace or repair damaged pieces. You can always find us on Facebook or Twitter, or at info@polymorphcrafts.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are always hurdles during the transition from small-batch to full-scale, high-end production, many of which can be overcome with better tooling and more time. In order to address any issues with our tools, we will purchase carbide saw blades and router bits for precision cuts, a miter saw for improved consistency, and a small-gauge pneumatic nail gun to eliminate the risk of splitting wood during assembly. We need better tools to work with the leather straps and rivets, too. \n\nOther improvements will be realized via improved processes. Your pledge will enable us to dip stain instead of brushing, which provides deeper, more uniform color. We will also have a spray booth for clear-coat application, which provides uniformity and efficiency. Perhaps most importantly, we will manufacture better jigs to ensure that cuts and holes are precise to within thousandths of an inch.\n\nPolymorph Crafts is committed to producing the best product possible, and we will continue to share updates in the shop and during assembly, showcasing these improved tools and processes and their results.\n\nWe have a working prototype; we have relationships with vendors for wood, magnets and leather; design and production processes are set; shipping has been calculated. We are confident that the boost we will get from your pledges is all we need to make Polymorph Crafts a grand success.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "You Like Us!", "descp": "A pledge at this level tells us that you think we're pretty cool, and you'll get our backer updates.\nINCLUDES:\nOur undying love and affection", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Nov 2017"}], "stat": ["36 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 19 or more", "title": "Standard Dice Vault", "descp": "This is the same dice vault as can be found on the Basic Mimic Chest.

Short of a major catastrophe, we expect a very successful Lexicon 2018. The real question is how big will it be? \nAmong the things we have learned is to get the contracts in place as soon as possible to make sure individual events and convention enhancements happen successfully. Of course we have no control over the hotel if they make an error and there is a problem with the space; we apologize if a GM or a special guest does not show up for an event, we will do our best to find someone to take their place. Some events will become full, since we focus so much on having a large variety of events, rather than multiple versions of the same event, if this happens early, we will try to schedule additional sessions, but can not guarantee entry into any events.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 2 or more", "title": "Jester", "descp": "Many Thanks for humoring us!

It's not only been recognized by NATO generals for its take on trench warfare, it's also been featured in the Mind Sports Olympiad and is taught at Universities, and now, you can own it too!\nThe 8x8 grid board is diamond-shaped; each player sets up his army on opposing sides of the \"trench\", which divides the board into two. As hostilities between the armies commanded by the players grow, each attempts to seize control over the trench in order to take full advantage of its strategic potential, hoping thus to breach the opponent's defenses and capture the most valuable and important pieces.\nFrom the Soldiers to the General, each piece being subject to specific maneuvers all will have to cooperate in order to occupy the trench, invade the enemy's territory, and vanquish the foe. The army that manages to survive after two battles wins the game!\nTRENCH Rules\nThe TRENCH rules are available to download in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese, Russian and we'll soon be adding Italian!\nDownload the rules here.\n  Why TRENCH?\nWith its innovative algorithm, TRENCH realistically reproduces the movements of each military rank, making the game scalable in its degree of difficulty and making it almost impossible for the game to end in a draw.\nWith the synchronicity between the game rules and the war theme, the game is intuitive and easy to grasp, making it a useful and valuable tool in education and training environments.\nThe TRENCH (Premium) pieces are innovative. There is no other board game anywhere in the world with plastic injection in 2 colors and bi-matter, making its components exclusive from any other game.\nThe game itself is 100% language independent.\nTRENCH Premium is made in Portugal with the highest quality and attention to detail.\nThe black and white represent the dichotomy between light and darkness, good and evil, sound and silence, life and death.\n  TRENCH has managed to link beautiful design, a rigorous mechanism, the evocation of history, and the challenge of strategy to the addictive pleasure of creative leisure!\n    TRENCH is more than just a game, it is also a timeless piece of art as well as a tribute to an important moment in human history, all of which are a representation of the TRENCH brand. To compliment the brand, we want to offer you an exclusive selection of TRENCH merchandise.\nTo add-on additional copies of the game or any of the following items, simply add the amount to your pledge. You'll be able to select the items you want in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. Please note: there will be a small shipping charge per item if ordered without a game. Items ordered without a game will be delivered April 2018.\nThis hardcover Strategy Guide features over 100 pages and provides the road map for the best strategies in the opening, middle, and end of the game, contains a history of the game, and more. The preface was written by General Loureiro dos Santos - full Professor and recognized Specialist in Strategy.\nBe one of the first to own it, and learn the secrets of TRENCH!\nA game of TRENCH goes best with a glass of Port wine - though if you prefer another type of drink we won't hold it against you! The TRENCH coasters come as a set of 2, to utilize for you and your opponent's gaming drink of choice. Choose between glossy acrylic and black acrylic.\nThe TRENCH dice (which is included in the General pledge level) is used to decide who starts the game by playing the black pieces, however it also makes a great add-on for dice collectors with its unique design.\n  We want to support game stores around the world by offering the Kickstarter versions of TRENCH to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Mike at info@outerlimitgames.com during the campaign for pricing information.\n  The basics of TRENCH\n1. Each player takes his turn moving 1 piece.\n2. Each piece has a rank, which has restrictions on its movements, and on the number of squares it can advance each move (as highlighted in the animation below).\nThe trench adds another layer of strategy and depth, where each piece that occupies the trench has two advantages and two restrictions.\n3. The player ends his turn after moving a piece, or when that piece captures an opposing piece. When capturing an enemy piece, place that piece in the square the enemy occupied.\n4. The first player to capture opponent's pieces worth 25 points wins.\n  The next two videos are in Portuguese, with English subtitles.\n  TRENCH is available on Google Play and Tabletop Simulator/Steam. We encourage you to try it out in digital form! \n  Each edition of TRENCH is already fully upgraded using the highest quality materials and includes everything you need for the full game, which is why we do not have stretch goals.\nClick here to visit the BGG page and become a TRENCH fan!\nShare this post on Facebook to unlock the Movement Tracking Sheet.\nGive a thumbs up to this BGG image.\n    Shipping is VAT-free, as we absorb those costs for you. Backers in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia will receive games shipped from fulfillment centers within those regions.\nAll About Shipping\nShipping is FREE to the US, Canada, UK & Germany if you pledge for the Soldier, Captain or General reward level.\nSoon after the campaign is over, you will receive an email from Backerkit that directs you to a pledge manager where you can confirm or upgrade your pledge, and add games, or other \u201cadd-ons.\u201d If you are in a country other than the US, Canada, UK or Germany, your shipping will automatically be calculated at that time. Backerkit turns overpledges into a credit that you may use in the pledge manager.\nShipping Estimates\nThe rates below are good faith estimates of 2018 carrier rates plus freight.\nPurchase up to three copies of the game (any version or combination) and only pay shipping once (or free shipping if in the US, CA, UK, DE). For example, if you live in Brazil and order three copies of the General, you would only pay a total of $11 for shipping.\n*Add-ons include: Coasters and TRENCH dice\n*Add-ons and Strategy Guide include FREE shipping if purchased with a game.\n        Golden Geek Nominee for Best Abstract Game\n      Wargame Reviewer video review in Spanish (below)\nCidade Curiosa video review in Portuguese (below)\n  Over the past few years, TRENCH has been taught in schools and Universities, and played in National Tournaments.\nTRENCH can be an excellent didactic and pedagogic tool for use in the classroom, sharpening memory, activating concentration, stimulating logical reasoning, increasing self-confidence, exercising patience, promoting imagination and mental discipline, and developing good judgment in decision-making.\nUniversity of Minho and Instituto Superior T\u00e9cnico in Portugal.\n  Photo credit: David Lowry\nTRENCH has been included in the Mind Sports Olympiad in London for the past few years, which also hosts international tournaments for games such as Agricola, Carcassone, Chess and GO!\nTRENCH Champions at the Mind Sports Olympiad\n    Though TRENCH has already been well received by many, its first production run was limited, and it was primarily marketed in its country of origin, Portugal, by the designer Rui Al\u00edpio Monteiro and his wife Maria. They have done an amazing job for the past few years, but they took it as far as they could. As the new publishers, our goal is to make TRENCH more accessible to the board game community and give it the exposure it deserves.\nManufacturing is expensive, and we need Kickstarter in order to produce the new edition of TRENCH as well as Rui's Strategy Guide. Through Kickstarter we can also raise more awareness for TRENCH. We would like to be able to organize and run international TRENCH tournaments in the future, and eventually develop a full tournament-style website similar to Chess.com. We have very high expectations and faith in TRENCH, and your support will allow us to take it to the next level.\nTRENCH - Play With Art!\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have experience running Kickstarters, and through that experience we have gained a better understanding of the complexities involved in this process, and all the unexpected road bumps along the way that can cause delays.\n\nMost of our manufacturing will be done in Portugal, and the factories there have already proven their ability to deliver high quality games on time. They already have experience producing TRENCH, and the molds and tooling are ready to go. Our production manager, Jos\u00e9 Dias, understands the complex design of TRENCH better than anyone, and will oversee the production and QA.\n\nWe have established partnerships with freight and fulfillment companies around the world that we trust. Through our past experience, we have had the opportunity to learn and understand their processes, and they understand our expectations, both of which are paramount for navigating the complexity of international logistics.\n\nIt is our highest priority to deliver your reward to you on time and in perfect condition, and if we run into any issues during production or shipment, will we let you know right away. Most of all, you can expect free-flowing transparency and communication from us, and of course, lots of positive energy!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "SOLDIER", "descp": "TRENCH - includes a tri-fold board with notation, 32 wood game pieces, and two movement reference sheets, all in a compact box.

We are restructuring a few things and will relaunch with a more streamlined campaign on September 26th at 10:00am EDT.  The link to the new TRENCH campaign is below. We look forward to seeing you there!\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/outerlimitgames/140869766?ref=355302&token=37e11539\nTRENCH is an abstract strategy board game based on the trench wars of WWI. Unlike most games, in TRENCH the 8x8 grid board is diamond-shaped; each player sets up his army on opposing sides of the \"trench\", which divides the board into two. As hostilities between the armies commanded by the players grow, each attempts to seize control over the trench in order to take full advantage of its strategic potential, hoping thus to breach the opponent's defenses and capture the most valuable and important pieces.\nFrom the Soldiers to the General, each piece being subject to specific maneuvers all will have to cooperate in order to occupy the trench, invade the enemy's territory, and vanquish the foe. The army that manages to survive after two battles wins the game!\nVersailles 1919 Edition\nWhy TRENCH?\nWith its innovative algorithm, TRENCH realistically reproduces the movements of each military rank, making the game scalable in its degree of difficulty and making it almost impossible for the game to end in a draw.\nWith the synchronicity between the game rules and the war theme, the game is intuitive and easy to grasp, making it a useful and valuable tool in education and training environments.\nThe TRENCH (Premium) pieces are innovative. There is no other board game anywhere in the world with plastic injection in 2 colors and bi-matter, making its components exclusive from any other game.\nThe game itself is 100% language independent.\nTRENCH Premium and Minimalista Edition are made in Portugal with the highest quality and attention to detail.\n  TRENCH has managed to link beautiful design, a rigorous mechanism, the evocation of history, and the challenge of strategy to the addictive pleasure of creative leisure!\nTRENCH Rules\nThe TRENCH rules are available to download in English, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese and Russian. However, the game itself is 100% language independent.\nDownload the rules here.\n    Premium TRENCH is an upgrade from the standard version that will be distributed to retail, schools and tournaments. The upgrades are highlighted below:\nMade in Portugal\nFeatures the exclusive and innovative bi-color/bi-matter injection ABS plastic pieces with arrows on the bottom.\nUpgraded ABS plastic serigraphed game board with notation.\nThe Premium edition box is made with 1st quality compact cardboard for a sturdy and solid feel. It is also recyclable and biodegradable, making it environmentally friendly.\n*The limited 1st Edition (ADVANCE) copies ($89 pledge level) features a black box instead of a white box, the board does not include the algebraic notation, and there are some minor rules differences. Includes FREE SHIPPING but does not include unlocked Stretch Goals.\n  TRENCH Minimalista Edition is made in Portugal, comes in a luxury box with foil printing, and convenient storage space to keep the acrylic game pieces protected. It is perfect for permanent display on a cocktail table!\nThis luxury heirloom-quality box set of TRENCH is hand-made with exotic selections of wood, by skilled artisans. Its design is inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles, and is a reminder of The Treaty of Versailles (signed in the Hall of Mirrors, Palace of Versailles, 28 June, 1919), which was the most important of the peace treaties that brought World War I to an end.\nMade from exotic woods, including: Peruvian Walnut, Wenge, and Masseur Birch.\n  TRENCH - Versailles 1919 Edition - Box Layout\n  We want to support game stores around the world by offering the Kickstarter versions of TRENCH to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution.\nIf you're a retailer, please contact Mike at info@outerlimitgames.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nTRENCH is more than just a game, it is also a piece of art as well as a tribute to an important moment in world history, all of which are a representation of the TRENCH brand.  To compliment the brand, we bring you an exclusive selection of TRENCH merchandise.\nTo add-on additional copies of the game or any of the following items, simply add the amount to your pledge. You'll be able to select the items you want in the pledge manager after the campaign ends. Please note: there will be a small shipping charge per item if ordered without a game.\nThis hardcover Strategy Guide features over 100 pages and provides the road map for the best strategies in the opening, middle, and end of the game, contains a history of the game, and more. Be one of the first to own it, and learn the secrets of TRENCH!\nA game of TRENCH goes best with a glass of Port wine - though if you prefer another type of drink we won't hold it against you!  The TRENCH coasters come as a set of 2, to utilize for you and your opponent's gaming drink of choice. Choose between glossy acrylic, black acrylic, and wood.\nThe wood TRENCH coaster goes well with any edition of the game!\n  Available for TRENCH Minimalista only, we will engrave a personalized message or name of your choice into the game board for you!  Limit 6 words.\n  Note: the first two videos are in Portuguese, with English subtitles.\n      \"This game is very fun and has a ton of replay value. Most new games are re-skins or tweaked versions of something I\u2019m already bored with. It\u2019s nice to see someone put out a solid, old-fashioned strategy game. No gimmicks, no expansions, just a big box of compressed elegance.\" - Stephen Gulik (Everything Board Games)\n\"Trench has an art-deco look that will stand out in any decor, and the pieces and board are of a quality that you\u2019ll be proud to exhibit. It truly is an art piece disguised as a game. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate at any price, this game is sure to be a classic.\" - Scott Brady (SAHM Reviews)\n\"Every game of TRENCH that I played was both interesting and deep. There is a lot to like about this game and the more you play it, the more it reveals its strategic depth... TRENCH is an excellent game that could be grouped with the likes of Chess and Go.\" - Serge Pierro, Editor in Chief of GameNite\n\"I love TRENCH. Your concept of focusing upon the center line of the game board is a very unique concept. And the way you tie it up so tightly with a WWI theme is perfect. Congratulations for creating such a masterpiece of aesthetics!\" - Rollie Tesh, Pente World Champion\nBelow is a Spanish video review by Wargame Reviewer\n  MSO London Pentaminds\n\"Trench has the feel of being a game that is simple to learn but takes a lifetime to master. The simple rules belie a depth of game play and strategy, whilst the skilled aesthetic design make this game a joy to play.\" - Happy Otter Games\n\"The titular trench really defines this game. The same pieces on the same board, sans trench, might still provide a decent battle of wits; however, the protection from frontal assaults, allowance of brutal charges, vulnerability to rear attack, and trenchwalkers' immunity from one another turn this into an agonizing grapple for domination, and allow its stark, lovely, abstract presentation to evoke its World War I commemoration quite effectively.\" - Nathan Morse, BoardGameGeek\n\"Fantastic first World War trench game, very technical, very tactical, wonderful and much easier to present to a new player in relation to Chess.\" - Alessandro Pagani, Ludopedia (Brazil)\nLEGO TRENCH (not for sale)\n\"I find it beautiful and from the moment I saw it, I had this wish of translating it into LEGO form.\" - Marcos Bessa, Senior Designer for LEGO\nLEGO TRENCH (not for sale)\n\"Trench is a game rich in challenging moves and with deceiving body.

It may even rival Chess because games are shorter.\u201d - Darrin Ball, TRENCH Ambassador (USA)\n\"The experience was very good, the mechanics of the Trench are unique, it is a highly strategic, deep game that makes you feel (at least in my case) as playing a game in the Tron world.\" - Daniel Solis, Level Up Magazine (Costa Rica)\n\"It took only few minutes to learn, but how long will it take to master?

That same year it was nominated for the Golden Geek Award for Best Abstract Strategy Game.  Over the past few years, TRENCH has been taught in schools and Universities, played in National Tournaments including the Mind Sports Olympiad in London, and has been recognized by the military Generals, including members of NATO.\n  TRENCH in Military School\nSynopsis of the Creation of TRENCH, by designer Rui Al\u00edpio Monteiro:\n\"The First World War always interested me because it was a defining moment in humanity\u2019s history, the first global conflict and the most decisive event in the modern era up to that date. It was the war that changed the world and it continues to be one of the biggest nightmares in the history of humanity.\nDesigner Rui Al\u00edpio Monteiro and his wife Maria.\nIt was in the trenches that the direction of events was decided, in a drama lived out by millions of men who literally dug their own graves. A tribute to the solders of the trenches of the Great War is a hymn to strength and humanity, as well as to the capacity to adapt to inhospitable and challenging environments. This is the mission that TRENCH seeks to accomplish, at the same time as it condemns this humbling moment in human history, attempting to inform and alert people to the tragedies that occurred.\nTRENCH Memorial dedicated to those of the Great War, along Portuguese sidewalk\nHowever, TRENCH itself is a purely abstract strategy game, and although its theme is linked to these events, the trench battles are used only in the naming of the pieces, and, of course, in the Trench at the center of play. It is worth underlining the fact that victory is not a lottery, that luck is not a factor, because the life of the game comes from knowing how to exploit each mistake that is provoked due to the distraction of the opponent.\nThe rules of the moves are integral to the game\u2019s algorithm, and allude to the march of battle units in the theater of operations. Their mechanism evokes the war of movement and trenches dug in World War I, with their dynamics very evident in the strategies marked out and duly implemented on the ground as the battle wears on.\nBasing the rules of play, in part, on \u201cThe Art of War of Sun Tzu\u201d, in addition to making a fusion of the cultures of West and East, situates TRENCH, as a body of work, in its appropriate ideological and philosophical landscape.\n\"TRENCH MEMORIAL\", by Rui Al\u00edpio Monteiro, at \u201cSala S.Mamede, in Museum, Lisbon\nBelow is a Spanish overview of the history of TRENCH by Wargame Reviewer.\nThe Origins of the Design of TRENCH\nThe board is rich in geometric abstraction, simulating a battlefield, divided into two opposing territories and separated by two lines along the diagonal of the lozenge that symbolize the trenches and mark out the so-called \u201cno-man\u2019s land\u201d.\nThe pieces, made in the purest cubist style, represent in a figurative way the ranks of an infantry or cavalry of an army, with its well-defined hierarchy, from the soldier to the general at the top of the pyramid of power.\nThe geometric design, in black and white \u2013 \u201cOp Art\u201d \u2013 is a humble homage to the classic Portuguese pavement, called \u201cCal\u00e7ada\u201d, and it is also an integral part of the game concept.\n\u2022 The optical illusion is intentional, creating a deliberate camouflage for the pieces on the board, simulating the camouflaged soldiers in their battlefield. Interestingly, the strategy of visual dissimulation was developed during World War I.\n\u2022 The black and white represent the dichotomy between light and darkness, good and evil, sound and silence, life and death.\nWell beyond its historic inspiration, the attractive, innovative and bold designs have sparked curiosity by being conspicuously different \u2013nobody can remain indifferent to it.\n\"TRENCH has a different, clean and yet impactful design. The quality of the pieces and their design grabs attention. It is a game of light and shadow, black and white, revealing a symmetry and chaos, producing optical illusions, capturing the despair and the unsettling calm between the battles, while the generals study their best movements.\u201d - Clube de Tabuleiro de Campinas (the Campinas Board Game Club, Brazil)\nTRENCH is available on Google Play & Tabletop Simulator/Steam.\n    VAT-Free Shipping\nShipping is VAT-free, as we absorb those costs for you. Backers in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia will receive games shipped from fulfillment centers within those regions.\nHow is Shipping Calculated?\nSoon after the campaign is over, you will receive an email from Backerkit that directs you to a pledge manager where you can confirm or upgrade your pledge, and add games, or other \u201cadd-ons.\u201d  Your shipping will automatically be calculated at that time based on the total weight of your order. Backerkit turns overpledges into a credit that you may use in the pledge manager.\nShipping Estimates\nThe rates below are good faith estimates of 2018 carrier rates plus freight. \nPurchase up to three copies of the same game edition and only pay shipping once. For example, if you live in Brazil and order three copies of the Premium edition, you would only pay a total of $22 for shipping.\nShipping is FREE for the Minimalista and Versailles 1919 editions.\n*Add-ons include: Coasters\n*Add-ons and Strategy Guide include FREE shipping if purchased with a game.\n  Though TRENCH has already been well received by many, its first production run was limited, and it was primarily marketed in its country of origin, Portugal, by Rui and Maria Monteiro. They have done an amazing job for the past few years, but they took it as far as they could. So we acquired the license, in an effort to make TRENCH more accessible to the world and give it the global exposure it deserves.\nManufacturing is expensive, and we need Kickstarter in order to produce the new editions of TRENCH and make them accessible to you. We also want to raise more awareness for TRENCH, in an effort to organize and run TRENCH tournaments in the future, and eventually develop a full tournament-style website similar to Chess.com.  We have very high expectations and faith in TRENCH, and your support will allow us to take it to the next level. \nKids love TRENCH too!\n     ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have experience running Kickstarters, and through that experience we have gained a better understanding of the complexities involved in this process, and all the unexpected road bumps along the way that can cause delays. \n\nMost of our manufacturing will be done in Portugal, and the factories there have already proven their ability to deliver high quality games on time. They already have experience producing TRENCH, and the molds and tooling are ready to go. Our production manager, Jos\u00e9 Dias, understands the complex design of TRENCH better than anyone, and will oversee the production and QA.\n\nWe have established partnerships with freight and fulfillment companies around the world that we trust.

My only concern is having those two sets instead of four of the same coasters! Like I said I wanted to support the OLG team and their efforts... So the coasters, which look real cool, are a nice addition. Unlike custom dice from Tau Ceti, these coasters are more \"functional\" and can be used when entertaining...
