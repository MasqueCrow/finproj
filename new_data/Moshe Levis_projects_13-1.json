Ou alors des visages, des expressions faciales, des corps tendus... Ou encore des instruments de musique, avec ou sans musiciens. Il semblerait que rien de nouveau ne puisse exister dans la relation entre musique et photographie. Mais malgr\u00e9 cela, une question demeure sans r\u00e9ponse : qu'est-ce que ces musiciens sont en train de jouer? Est-il possible de prendre en compte, en photographie, la nature la plus profonde de la musique, son \u00e9criture?\nEn 2007, Jacopo Baboni Schilingi commence un nouveau projet, qui cherche \u00e0 donner une r\u00e9ponse possible \u00e0 cette question. Comment mettre en photographie la nature la plus profonde de la musique qui, pour Baboni Schilingi, est la partition \u00e9crite.\nLa partition, en musique, est ind\u00e9chiffrable pour les non-musiciens, mais en m\u00eame temps, elle est tout de suite reconnaissable comme \u00e9tant de la musique, par tout le monde, y compris ceux qui ne savent pas lire. La partition est le m\u00e9dium privil\u00e9gi\u00e9 entre compositeur et interpr\u00e8te. Un lien codifi\u00e9, \u00e9crit \u00e0 la main, qui indique comment donner corps aux \u00e9motions que le compositeur exprime \u00e0 travers sa cr\u00e9ation. Dans son imaginaire possible. Dans sa vie. Dans sa possibilit\u00e9 utopique d'existence : la communication. Mais en m\u00eame temps, \u00e0 travers la seule r\u00e9alit\u00e9 concr\u00e8te d'existence : la musique.\nBody Scores est un projet qui r\u00e9unit musique et photographie. Partition sur corps ! Tatouage \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8re. Calligraphie exacte, authentique, de compositions \u00e9crites par Baboni Schilingi ces derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es. Extraits des partitions d\u00e9j\u00e0 jou\u00e9es en concert, ou de cr\u00e9ations \u00e0 venir tr\u00e8s prochainement. Des vraies partitions sur des vrais corps. Entre la performance, le body art, le body painting et la musique \u00e9crite, ce projet veut d\u00e9voiler l'intimit\u00e9 implicite entre compositeur et partition, mais aussi celle qui unit l'interpr\u00e8te \u00e0 la partition.\nLa partition est le support sur lequel l'interpr\u00e8te peut lire les \u00e9motions codifi\u00e9es par le compositeur, l'artiste, sous forme d'\u00e9criture musicale. Les \u00e9motions du compositeur sont ainsi confi\u00e9es \u00e0 l'interpr\u00e8te, afin que ce dernier puisse les retransmettre au public \u00e0 travers ses gestes ; \u00e0 travers ses gestes sur son instrument musical. Et sur une partition, bien entendu on \u00e9crit des notes, et beaucoup d'autres symboles, et ceux-ci traduisent les instructions pour les musiciens.\nMais la partition est encore plus. C'est le corps physique sur lequel le compositeur \u00e9crit \u00e0 la main, corrige, souligne, efface, en laissant toutes sortes de traces. En m\u00eame temps, la partition doit \u00eatre suffisamment incompl\u00e8te afin que les interpr\u00e8tes puissent la compl\u00e9ter avec leurs propres intentions. Et chaque interpr\u00e8te, sur la m\u00eame partition, ajoute des signes, d'autres signes, des nouveaux signes et symboles qui vont l'aider \u00e0 s'approprier des intentions du compositeur.\nCe lien de sensualit\u00e9 est ind\u00e9niable. Et c'est bien cette forme de sensualit\u00e9, inh\u00e9rente \u00e0 la partition musicale, dont le projet Body Scores s'inspire. Quand la photographie valorise le microscopique, alors le macroscopique respire.\nEn s'inspirant de certains chefs-d'\u0153uvre de la cin\u00e9matographie comme Cinq femmes autour d'Utamaro de Kenji Mizoguchi, ou The Pillow Book de Peter Greenaway, le projet Body Scores retrace la relation entre corps, \u00e9criture et geste. Sous forme de tatouages \u00e9ph\u00e9m\u00e8res, destin\u00e9s \u00e0 dispara\u00eetre, la seule fa\u00e7on d'en sauver une trace est la photographie. Le projet Body Scores veut donner corps par la photographie \u00e0 ce qu'en musique on ne voit g\u00e9n\u00e9ralement pas, car on l'\u00e9coute, c'est-\u00e0-dire la partition et toute son intimit\u00e9.\nLe projet Body Scores ne repr\u00e9sente pas seulement la volont\u00e9 de replacer \u00ab la corpor\u00e9it\u00e9 \u00bb dans la musique \u00e9crite. Pour Baboni Schilingi, il s\u2019agit bien d\u2019une nouvelle pratique pour \u00e9crire la totalit\u00e9 des esquisses de ses cr\u00e9ations. Depuis l\u2019apparition du num\u00e9rique pour l\u2019\u00e9dition des partitions musicales, un ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne aussi simple que superficiel s\u2019est instaur\u00e9 : l\u2019abus de la fonction \u00ab cmd-Z \u00bb, qui permet d'\u00ab annuler \u00bb une op\u00e9ration, soit en anglais \u00ab undo \u00bb ou le fameux raccourcis Macintosh \u00ab \uf8ffZ \u00bb.\nL\u2019opportunit\u00e9 de corriger, \u00e0 tout moment, un passage qui vient juste d\u2019\u00eatre \u00e9crit, banalise l\u2019instant pr\u00e9sent. Si l\u2019\u00e9criture \u00e0 travers des logiciels d\u2019\u00e9dition musicale est indispensable pour l\u2019impression et la diffusion des partitions, l\u2019acte de l\u2019\u00e9criture a perdu sa fonction unique et irrempla\u00e7able de signer son propre pr\u00e9sent. Body Scores est donc une nouvelle pratique de r\u00e9daction des partitions qui ne laisse de place ni \u00e0 la distraction ni \u00e0 la d\u00e9concentration. Tout est pr\u00e9sent.\nLa correction est bannie. L\u2019accident doit \u00eatre pris en compte. Le pr\u00e9sent de l\u2019\u00e9criture est pr\u00e9serv\u00e9 par l\u2019impossibilit\u00e9 de corriger, par la sacralit\u00e9 de la pr\u00e9sence des mod\u00e8les ainsi que par le photographe. En ce sens, toutes les cr\u00e9ations de Baboni Schilingi n\u2019existent qu'\u00e0 travers des esquisses \u00e9crites sur le corps d\u2019hommes et de femmes, dont les seules traces sont les photos qui serviront pour la transcription d\u00e9finitive de la partition.\n-- Body Scores aura diff\u00e9rents modes de monstration, sous forme de livres de photographies, sous forme d'expositions dans des galeries ou des centres d'arts, sous forme de performances pendant lesquelles les partitions sont peintes en live, sous forme de concerts qui r\u00e9unissent partitions sur corps et musiciens sur sc\u00e8ne, mais aussi sous forme de vid\u00e9os qui restituent la phase d'\u00e9criture de la partition.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nApr\u00e8s le financement int\u00e9gral du projet, \u00e0 priori, il ne devrait pas y il y avoir des risques.

This labels me as a forgetful, distracted, preoccupied, inattentive, vague, absorbed, abstracted, unheeding, oblivious, distrait, lost in thought, pensive, scatter brained, miles away, an absent-minded boffin and as a head in the cloud type of individual. \nBut...\nThere is a silver lining.\nCombine this with me not actually seeing very well (see the glasses), and having a heavily visually orientated mind.\nThe result is that I live in a world of wanders.

Second, because it is also supposed to lack narrative, because they are pieces of my mind, my feelings, my moods.

Other times I had hours of waiting. \nAs I showed these images to friends and family, I was surprised by how strongly they reacted. This was a contributing factor that made me want to create a book.

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMany of the challenges involved in creating this book are already behind us. The photographs have all been taken and edited, most of the design of the book is in place. Because these are complete and because I did a lot of homework, I feel the risk is relatively low. \nThe biggest remaining challenge to get the book printed is just meeting our funding goal. Raising enough money to make the printing and shipping possible is the hardest part.\nOne challenge that could remain is potential production delays. This is unlikely but I have added a little extra time into the delivery schedule just in case.

I\u2019m a photographer based in Orient Point, New York. I have been working for several years on a major book of my photographs, NEW\u2008YORK / LOS ANGELES: Photographs 1967-2014. This book is now finished! The design is completed. The type is set, and the black & white and the color separations are done. My publishers, Mike Warlow and Kiersten Armstrong of KMW\u2008Studio, have lined up a great distributor, ACC, for North America and Europe, so my fear of having a garage full of unsold books is over.\nThere is just one thing left to do to make this book a reality:\nRAISE\u2008THE\u2008MONEY\u2008TO\u2008PRINT\u2008IT!\nYour pledge will help fund the printing, binding costs and slipcase.\nThis is not as impossible as it sounds. Mike and Kiersten and I would like you to know that with your help we can do this.\nBecome a part of our team by pledging your support and purchasing one or more of our editions.\nTo your right and below is a list of incentives and rewards for contributions at several levels, from my deepest thanks, to the opportunity to have me photograph a portrait of you and/or your family .\n To be frank, who would have known Lloyd would be a master in the light touch. Real open and breezy, lots of room for people to get lost. When I look at them, I feel warm. They make me want to go home.\n\u2013 Diane Keaton, Actress, Director, Author, Photographer\n About the Book:\nAs you can see, the book is actually 2 volumes that are boxed in a hard cardboard slipcover. If perhaps you are only interested in either the New York or the Los Angeles volume, of course you have the option of choosing one or the other.\nHighlights from New York\n Highlights from Los Angeles\nBrilliant!!!! Honestly, it is the best photography I have seen in a long, long time. I am knocked out. Both volumes take my breath away. And, how well they work together: West Coast/East Coast, left and right, red and blue, black and white. This an incredible body of work, perfectly presented.\n\u2013 Gail Buckland, Author, Educator, Curator of Photography\nThe Details:\nBoth books are hard covers, 9\u201d x 12\u201d, 104 pages of 100 photographs, the more vintage in black and white, the most recent in color. Sir Harold Evans and Paul Ruscha have graciously written wonderful introductions, Harry: New York, Paul: L.A.\nWhen the books are printed, we will mail the signed copies to all those who have requested them, AND we have lined up various book signing events in both cities. It will be terrific to see you there.\nAbout Lloyd Ziff:\n Since 2000, Lloyd Ziff has made photography the sole focus of his career. He has had one man shows at Danziger Gallery and Robin Rice Gallery in New York City, and Earl McGrath Gallery in Los Angeles. His book, Near North, Photographs of Alaska and The Yukon, was published in 2010, and his photographs have been included in Patti Smith\u2019s autobiography, Just Kids, the anthologies American Photography and The Spirit of Family, by Al and Tipper Gore, and are in the permanent collections of The Palm Springs Art Museum, Palm Springs, CA, CU Art Museum, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO, and The International Center of Photography, New York, NY. Blind Spot, The New York Times Magazine, Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, Interview, Kid\u2019s Wear (Germany), New York, Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair, and Wired are among the magazines that have published his work. Before he became known as a photographer, Ziff was an award-winning art director/design director of several national magazines, including Vanity Fair, House & Garden, Cond\u00e9 Nast Traveler, and Rolling Stone. Ziff taught magazine design, photography, and illustration at Art Center College in Pasadena, CA, The School of Visual Arts in New York City, and for 13 years at Parsons School of Design in New York City. In 1999, he was elected to the Board of Trustees of Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, NY, his alma mater.\nLloyd Ziff\u2019s New York is an intriguingly idiosyncratic portrait of the city he has photographed over four decades. He ranges freely. Unconfined by time or subject, he randomly enriches our idea of what the city represents.\n\u2013 Sir Harold Evans, Journalist, Writer, Editor\nAbout KMW studio:\nKMW studio is an independent publisher and packager of fine art and photographic books.\nWe have a number of thank you incentives at different price levels for you to choose:\n$15 \u2013 SIGNED THANK YOU POSTCARD\nA THANK YOU postcard from Lloyd.\n$50 \u2013 BOOK - NEW YORK or LOS ANGELES\nA copy of the New York OR Los Angeles hardcover edition.\n$75 \u2013 SIGNED BOOK - NEW YORK or LOS ANGELES + BOOK LAUNCH INVITE\nA signed copy of the New York or Los Angeles hardcover edition AND an invitation to a book launch event in New York or Los Angeles.\n$125 \u2013 SIGNED LIMITED EDITION 2 VOLUME BOX SET + BOOK LAUNCH INVITE\nA signed copy of the limited edition (500) 2 volume box set AND an invitation to a book launch event in New York or Los Angeles.\n$200 \u2013 SIGNED LIMITED EDITION 2 VOLUME BOX SET + NY PRINT or LA PRINT + INVITE\nA signed copy of the limited edition (200) 2 volume box set AND an 8\" x 10\" limited edition digital print on water color paper, stamped and initialed (choose New York or Los Angeles) AND an invitation to a book launch event in New York or Los Angeles.\n$300 \u2013 SIGNED LIMITED EDITION 2 VOLUME BOX SET + BOTH PRINTS + INVITE\nA signed copy of the limited edition (200) 2 volume box set AND both 8\" x 10\" limited edition digital prints on water color paper, stamped and initialed AND an invitation to a book launch event in New York or Los Angeles.\n$5,000 \u2013 PRIVATE PORTRAIT SESSION with LLOYD ZIFF!\nLloyd will shoot a portrait of you, alone or with whomever you choose, in either NYC or L.A., and you will receive a signed, unique archival classic black & white 20\" x 24\" silver-gelatin print made from the original, unretouched negative, and a copy of the contact sheets.
