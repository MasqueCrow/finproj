Also, some big last day news!!! ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs a seasoned business owner, I understand how things do not always go as planned. 2020 was definitely an example of that! There are some factors which are out of one's control, and human error must always be factored in. When this happens, problem solving and a commitment to make things right is paramount. I always endeavor to give the customer more than they expect with no gotchas. My experience has prepared me for this and my commitment to honoring my word is my main priority. Our backers will attest to the quality of response and service we provide. \n\nManufacturing and supply chain difficulties are the biggest risk to this project. We have taken several steps to minimize this risk:\n\nFirst, I have been involved significantly in every step of this project from inception; prototyping, working with qualified engineers, costing and quality control of manufacturing. I went so far as to personally finance, at significant expense, an initial low volume run of tables to make sure these tables did what I said they would, and to ensure that we could manufacture these with the quality I expect. The result was a product I am very proud of. This knowledge and being so active in the \"day to day processes\" allows me to personally oversee this project.\n\nSecondly, our Game Toppers are made in the USA. I am working with a manufacture that is based in my home town. They have many large accounts like Target, Best Buy and others, in a 90,000 square ft. facility, that has equipped them to handle the quality and the capacity this project demands. It also provides us many key advantages as far as quality control, problem solving, supply chain and mitigating problems that can happen versus manufacturing overseas.\n\nThirdly, shipping is always a challenge. We have purchased a 5000 Sq ft facility in our home town to manage inventory and the pick and pull process of our topper orders which we have been running on our own since Feb of 2019. Our Game Toppers are somewhat heavy packages. Considerable time and effort has gone into making sure our fulfillment partner in the EU can handle the shipping in a timely manner. We also have been testing our packaging to ensure our Toppers arrive in pristine condition. Because of this I have made significant upgrades in our packaging to ensure a quality delivery. our second delivered campaign has seen lower shipping failure and improved response time due to our implementations.\n\nWe are charging for shipping. I am making sound business decisions so I have enough funds to pay to get them to you. Our Toppers are over sized for the shipping category. The world is currently upside down in this segment or economy, and it's a worldwide problem. We see it easing in the future, but have prepared for the worst to ensure we can stand by our commitments. Our improvements in package engineering have proven well worth it! While we realize it costs a bit more to ship, this was an intentional design decision to provide the best quality, comfort and functionality that gamers desire. We could have made a smaller Topper with 2 inch rails and not offered the versatility that our design offers, but I refused to compromise on this. The small amount of extra shipping, I feel is worth it in the long run.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nComponents are extremely well designed and durable goods\nReusability and recyclability\nbuilt to stand test of time.

It is a card game that comes with 108 poker-sized cards and involves card drafting, hand management, resource management, and some secret scoring. The theme is the discovery of new land during the middle ages.\nIt can be played with 1-6 players (solo mode, or 2 to 6 competing players), in 30 to 60 minutes.\nA $29 pledge earns you a copy of the game, including shipping within the U.S. There are a couple of fun \"put your face in the game\" pledge tiers available as well.\nDelivery is expected by November.\nNow EU-Friendly!! I have found a Germany-based fulfillment partner to ship games through for our EU-based backers!\nThe game consists entirely of cards -- 6 Sponsors, plus 102 multi-use People cards, totaling 27 unique characters.\nThe object of the game is to score the most points while completing a voyage to the Land of Danger. To get there, players will step through the 3 Acts of the story: \nFor more details on how the game works, check out the Google Docs of the full rules:\nMulti-Player Rules: [Google Doc]\nSolo-Play Rules: [Google Doc]\nFor even more details, and to give the game a try, download the full grayscale print-and-play (13MB ZIP file): [download]  \nHow-to-Play (multi-player) Video ...\nPLAY\n\nSolo-Game Play-Through Video by Liz Davidson of Beyond Solitaire ... \nLost from our history books, Portuguese sailor Raimundo Peres da Costa discovered a new land in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean at the cusp of the 14th century. Merely planning and gaining support for such a risk-filled journey proved a difficult path. Yet, with the sponsorship of beloved Queen Isabel of Portugal, Raimundo secured the supplies and crew needed to accomplish his dream.\nPerhaps Raimundo\u2019s story was lost for a reason. What if the first person to successfully lead a voyage to the fabled Land of Danger was \u2026 you? Let\u2019s go back to the start -- Lisbon, Portugal in the year 1290 -- and see how things play out.\nDays of Discovery is the first game in the \"Tales of Danger\" series. These games will tell the stories of the legendary Land of Danger -- a cluster of islands that used to be located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.\nThis first game covers the opening of the story, and the games that follow will continue down the 180-year timeline, having players explore how the first settlements were established, see how magic was revealed, and experience the conflicts that sprung up along the way.\nThe games will cover a range of different objectives and play styles, but will have a number of things in common:\nThey will be competitive multi-player games\nThey will each have a solo mode, designed with a small footprint\nThey will each follow a 3-Act story arc through the game\nThey will each come in the same sized box, with a similar book-like design, to look good when stacked together on a shelf\nThe game is packaged in a thick-walled, fully-wrapped, telescoping setup box that is designed to look like a leather-bound book.  It measures 5-1/2 x 3-1/2 x 2 inches, and is constructed from 70pt chipboard and covered in full-color printed heavy stock.\nThe box contains:\n6 Jumbo-sized Player Reference cards\n108 Poker-sized cards: 6 Sponsors, 102 People\n2 Rule Books: Multiplayer, Solo-Play\n3 extra zipping plastic baggies (for organizing cards)\nThe cards are made from 12pt 305gsm black-core card stock, and will have a semi-glossy UV-protective coating.\nThe box is big enough to hold all of the cards when they are sleeved.\nThere will be no stretch goals to unlock for this project. \nA number of preview copies of the game were sent out to various reviewers and other folks in the indie board gaming space. As their reviews are posted, I'll list them here ...\nFrom Jason Glover, Grey Gnome Games, on BGG: \"Each act uses different mechanics and feels quite different from the next, while binding well to the theme. All of this is done with one set of multipurpose cards. This is an incredible design feat.\"\nFrom AJ Porfirio, Van Ryder Games, designer of Hostage Negotiator, on Twitter: \"The solo play is great! I am a backer and supporter.\"\nFrom Glenn Flaherty, Board Games & Bourbon, on Twitter and YouTube: \"Days of Discovery is on KS and has a nice story arc: Gain a benefactor, assemble a crew, then survive your journey. It plays like Splendor, Friday, with a hit of The Grizzled. I like it.\"\nFrom the TIGR review by Fairway: \"Days of Discovery is a fantastic little mashup of three different card games ... If you like card games and are looking for one that plays quickly, is easily learned and can play six, this game should definitely be on your list.\"\nFrom the Gameosity Review:\"There's something unique about Days of Discovery - the way the three phases of the game interlock means that every decision you make has multiple consequences, and learning the ins and outs of that interplay is the heart of the game. I really enjoy the layered strategy at work here, and it's definitely the most ambitious of Matt Worden's projects so far.\"\nFrom the Father Geek Review: \"Matt Worden has created a wonderful game that uses simple mechanics, but feels and plays very differently through each of the three acts. Even better, each act is both a separate game and a prelude to the finale.\"\nFrom the Everything Board Games Review: \"The unique multi-use cards will keep us coming back to Days of Discovery. These cards combined with the three-act structure allow a lot of game to be packed in a little box.\"\nFrom Tom Gurganus, Go Forth and Game: \"The story being developed, both within this game and for this series, really has me hooked. And this first game in the series is a perfect way to get it started! I like the three act paradigm. It is different and each act builds into the next. That's pretty cool!\"\nFrom LizDavidson, Beyond Solitaire: \"Days of Discovery is a small game, but an ambitious one. The game is definitely engaging, and I have played and enjoyed it.\"\nThere are only 4 backer pledge levels, and all have some of the shipping costs included:\nPledge $9 or more to receive a link to a full-color, 300 dpi print-and-play PDF (electronic delivery = no shipping costs here)\nPledge $29 to receive a copy of the game.

I have been designing board games as a hobby for nearly 20 years, and had my biggest success with the 2011 Games Magazine Game of the Year -- Jump Gate ... which was also published in Europe as Space Mission.\nI have been working on Days of Discovery for about 3-1/2 years, playtesting it at many Protospiel events and with independent playtesters along the way. It started out as a solo-only game, but continued to develop into the 1-6 player game it is today. To get more background on this design, read the blogs about it on my website.\nPodcast Interviews: I've recently been interviewed on a couple of podcasts ...\nThe Game Crafter Official Podcast\nGo Forth and Game\nAs with most of my games, I will be using The Game Crafter to produce Days of Discovery.\nWith their Small Stout Box and excellent playing card and rule booklet production, I am able to make the game exactly what I want it to be.  Add in their U.S. location and Bulk-Order-Fulfillment service, and the logistics of fulfillment become a lot easier.\nBecause of this, I consider a November 2018 delivery to be a conservative estimate.\nEU-Friendly Shipping: I have found a Germany-based fulfillment partner to ship games through for our Europe-based backers!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWith any creative project that needs to be manufactured and shipped to backers, a number of things can go wrong.\n\nHowever, I have done the following things to mitigate the risks ...\n\nThe game design and artwork (except for the 2 \"add my face\" items) are complete. The rule books have been written and gone through an initial editing pass. I am not using stretch goals to add anything new to the game during the project. I will be using an established manufacturer who will both print my games and send them directly to backers.\n\nIt is possible that unexpected delays may still occur in the final preparation of the print images -- especially related to the two \"add my face\" items -- or in the manufacturing and fulfillment of the orders. If anything like this occurs, I will do my best to communicate quickly and completely with all of the backers.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 9 or more", "title": "Frugal Adventurer - Full Color PnP", "descp": "With a pledge of $9, receive a link for the full-color high-resolution Print-and-Play PDF of all cards and rules.\nINCLUDES:\nLink to download the full-color high-resolution Print-and-Play", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2018"}], "stat": ["21 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 29 or more", "title": "Daring Adventurer - 1 copy of the Game", "descp": "With a pledge of $29, receive 1 physical copy of the game, and a link to download the print-and-play PDF.\nShipping is included for U.S. backers. $5 for Canada. $10 for all other locations.\nTo add extra copies of the game, add an extra $25/copy to your pledge.

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "When Cutie Met Patootie is a tabletop game from a rich storyline brought to you via a fun, narrative Kickstarter campaign. A narrative campaign just means that throughout this campaign, we will learn the story of the game characters through time-released animations. In fact, the first video is right above! If you are only here for the game, that's fine too! There are plenty of fun things for you to check out below. Thank you for your support and welcome to the When Cutie Met Patootie Kickstarter campaign!\nChapter 2\nPLAY\n\nIn Chapter 1, we learn of how the Visitors arrived on Earth and what their mission is, outlined by the gameplay.\nIn Chapter 2, we are introduced to the Citizens of Kodiak Harbor and how Cutie gets mixed up in all of this.\nIn Chapter 3, we discover just how Rewind managed to make it to Earth in the first place.\nIn Chapter 4, we find out if our heroes succeed or succumb to Rewind's flood!\nWhen Cutie Met Patootie is a turn-based resource and hand management game. In the box, you'll find 162 cards, 150 acrylic gems, and 10 Visitor Pawns.\nYour goal in the game is to collect and spend gems to move the Visitor Pawns to the top of the map while making sure the Visitors end the game carrying the specific gems which earn you points.\nSetup\nA lifetime of map variation replayability!\nGameplay\nOn your turn, you have two options: You can advance one of the Visitor Pawns or distribute gems onto Visitor Cards by playing Path Cards from your hand.\nAmelia advances for free, Beryl makes a \"quick\" advance, and Gillies makes a \"slow\" advance.\nAdvance: Using the gems from their respective Visitor Card which match their route requirement, or any two gems in place of a required color, a Visitor Pawn may advance along the path. Sometimes a Pawn may move for free if the Visitor is depicted on the Path Card in the space ahead. Only two pawns are allowed on each space.\nA Gillies card was played, and Gillies collected quickly the gems from the card. However, another card was played afterward to collect slowly.\nCollect Gems: To collect gems, simply play a path card from your hand to disperse the gems shown on that card to the Visitor Card(s) of your choosing. When collecting gems, players can do so slowly or quickly. Quickly means that all gems from a played Path Card depicting the Visitor are given to that same Visitor. Slowly means gems are dispersed however the player wishes otherwise. Collecting gems slowly comes at a risk!\nLooks like Gillies and Amelia made it to the next level safely, but there are too many Rewind Cards! Beryl has been swallowed by the flood!\nFlood Timer: Rewind is a nasty character who is currently flooding the map! Here's how that works. Every time a player collects gems slowly, a Rewind Card is added to the timer. When the Rewind Card count matches the lowest unflooded row of Path Cards, that row will flood and all Visitors on or below that level will be captured!\nWhen the Visitors cleared the row, the flood came from the Rewind deck. Now one Rewind Card will flood the next level!\nAutomatic Floods: If ever all Visitors clear a row, that row is flooded by pulling directly from the Rewind Deck instead of the timer counter of cards. In this way, the pressure is always on to beat the flood!\nGame End: When the last row has been flooded (Row 4 in 1-2 Player game, Row 3 in 3-4 player game), the game ends. Gems are collected from the surviving Visitor Cards and starting Gems from each surviving Visitor are added to the point groupings. Players reveal their Citizen Cards and score points based on the count of gems!\nUse these free tools below to start playing today!\n             Test the game for free on Tabletopia\nAs a backer of this campaign, you are signing up for a guarantee that the components will be of the best quality from the start.

I would not be where I am today were it not for their guidance.\nIn the year I have worked for LongPack Games, my work family has taken a vested interest in my professional development, teaching me all there is to know about manufacturing and logistics.

Lost in thought, you remember the first time you came across a Spanish Galleon. Few of you managed to escape that mess with your lives, but that marked the moment when you began forging your destiny as a pirate. Now, your reputation precedes you wherever you go, instilling fear among your enemies. Nothing will get in your way of becoming the most infamous pirate to ever sail the high seas\u2026\nMake your own destiny and become the terror of the seas in Skull Tales: Full Sail!\nSkull Tales: Full Sail! is a pirate adventures board game with miniatures. Set sail on the Southern Lady and explore the beautiful Caribbean sea, ripe with fearsome enemies and amazing treasures. Fame and fortune await you!\nChoose among twelve starting characters, each one with its own unique miniature, to be used on the different boards as you play through the game. Find all the information you need to start playing on their character sheets.\nIn Skull Tales: Full Sail! You\u2019ll be able to play individual scenarios or embark upon an immersive campaign that threads several different scenarios together into one captivating storyline.\nSkull Tales, created by David Illescas, is a semi-cooperative game for 1-5 players aged 14 and up. The approximate playing time in Campaign Mode is between 60-90 minutes for one scenario and about 150 minutes for a complete chapter (Voyage, Adventure and Port). The game also includes 52 miniatures - not counting stretch goals!\nDuring the Voyage Phase, which simulates being on a pirate ship, we\u2019ll be managing the crew that makes up our ship while we explore the map on the way towards our objective...or objectives! But, the Captain might have a hidden agenda that he/she is keeping from the rest of the crew\u2026\nThroughout this phase, characters will take on different jobs: steering the ship, managing boarding actions, cleaning up, or even fighting sea creatures. The idea is to gain the confidence of the crew, which will depend on where you place your character and how good he/she is at dealing with all the dangerous events you\u2019ll be facing together. The Captain will be able to assign different tasks to the crewmembers, but watch out - the other pirates can conspire against him/her!\nUnfortunately, but not surprisingly, there are a lot of things that can negatively affect crew's morale: hunger, losing battles, unexpected events, etc. If morale suffers too much, another pirate can organize a mutiny to take over the captaincy and benefit from its many privileges\u2026\nCharacters will earn Trust Points as they carry out duties on the ship, and these points will turn into Prestige Points once the Voyage phase comes to an end. This way, your pirate will start to gain a fearsome reputation!\nIn the Adventure Phase you\u2019ll explore mysterious islands, dangerous caves, and abandoned temples. You\u2019ll also have the chance to pillage colonial villas and find legendary objects. However, there are frightening creatures and challenging enemies to face along the way.\nThe Adventure map develops as terrain tiles appear randomly according to the specifications of the scenario, making each game different!\nOn the Adventure board you\u2019ll be able to see how much time you have left to carry out the mission, as well as the current danger level\u2026\nEnemies have cards that outline their characteristics and a corresponding miniature. Also, every opponent you face will have a behavior or AI that generates reactions at unpredictable times, making each adventure a challenge.\nIn the Port Phase your character can acquire new abilities and equipment by interacting with the residents of Tortuga Island and visiting its different locations. But be careful, this place hides secrets that can make a pirate\u2019s fate take a turn for the worst.\nEach player will have time units they\u2019ll use to carry out actions, while making sure they are ready to go when the ship sets sail: heal wounds, learn abilities, make bets, listen out for rumors, equip and improve the ship, etc. Each location has an Event Deck, and there are also independent decks for Rumors and Captain Assignments.\nThe following list has everything initially included in the base game, not counting components that may have been unlocked during the Kickstarter campaign.\nThe base game box also comes with a quick-start 10 chapter campaign (Campaign I) and a couple of special scenarios.\nThe new Skull Tales miniatures have been completely remodeled and will be made with a high quality plastic that is flexible, easy to paint, and allows for more clearly detailed figures. We have already started testing and the results are spectacular.\nThe scale of the miniatures is approximately 30-32mm up to the eye-line and not including the base.\n (Images courtesy from Icue)\nPIRATE contest!

We came ashore in the midst of a frightful fog \u2013 you could barely see your hand in front of your face. The vast mounds of seaweed were beyond anything natural, suggesting that the tide in this area was stronger and pulled any marine life from the depths of the sea onto the beaches. When the seaweed began to move, I felt as though someone was strangling me to death. Fear overcame me, especially when I saw our pistols did little damage against the shapes covered in seaweed.

This time, we\u2019re adding an enemy that brings new game mechanics with enemies that take up four spaces. The Tarantula Anansi is represented by a miniature the size of 4 spaces, and comes with her corresponding enemy card.\n$494000 (Unlocked, Base Game): 5 Port Events.

Each player directs the forces of the conservative Provisional Government or the socialist activists of the Petrograd Soviet in a struggle for power and influence that will shape Russia\u2019s future and either launch or suppress the impending civil war.\nIn Dual Powers: Revolution 1917, each game round is divided into 5 phases --  the Draw Phase, the Objective Phase, the Action Phase, the Scoring Phase, and the Cleanup Phase. \nDRAW PHASE - Each player draws 5 command cards. \nOBJECTIVE PHASE - Each player selects a secret objective, placing it face down on the game board. \nACTION PHASE - Taking turns, each player plays 4 command cards to recruit units, move units, refresh units, or take a leader's special ability. With each card played, the date on the calendar advances, and players will sometimes earn a bonus action. \nSCORING PHASE - Up to 3 regions of the board are scored based on which player has the greatest strength, including the region of unrest, and each of the players' secret objectives. Tokens in the scored regions are exhausted. \nCLEANUP PHASE - The region of unrest and the placement of the blockade token changes. All played cards and the players' secret objectives are discarded. \nIf either player moves the marker on the support track to the \"victory\" space on their side of the board, they immediately win. Otherwise, at the end of the round in which the month marker is on the October space or later, the game ends and the player with the most support is the winner!\nWant to take a closer look to how the game works?

A lot of interesting decisions in the game.\" -- Jeremy Salinas, Man vs. Meeple\n\"Dual Powers is easy to learn, and difficult to master. Players will continually explore layers of deep strategy every time it hits the table!\" -- Derek Funkhouser, Boardgame Spotlight\n\"Super Dynamic.... creates for really fun head-to-head play.... It plays pretty quickly and works well. \" -- Eduardo Baraf, Pencil First Games\n \"It\u2019s a card-driven game. It\u2019s an engine I like very much, a mechanic I like very much when it comes to historical games....This is a fun game that I find quite enjoyable.\u201d - Marco \"Wargamer\" Arnaudo, Game Reviewer\n\"This is the highest rating I've ever given a Kickstarter preview, and the game totally deserves it!... Honestly, I don't have any criticisms of the game. It's easy to learn, fast to play, balanced, exciting, fun, and even a bit educational. There's nothing here not to like.\" - George Jaros, Game Reviewer at GJJ Games\n\u201cI played Dual Powers as a prototype more than a year ago during development, and I wished I could buy it on the spot! The game has a high degree of strategic depth and subterfuge that cleverly emulates the time period and events it represents.\u201d - Scott Bogen, Game Reviewer for the Boardgame Show\n\"Dual Powers has all the elements of a classic card game and the feeling of a tight 2 player war game. Lots of double thinking your opponent and hoping your long term strategy pays off. Can't wait to see this in print!\" - Jeph Stahl, co-designer of Academy Games' Birth of America series\n\"I'm a Kickstarter curmudgeon. Despite hanging out and running campaigns on Kickstarter for years, I have yet to back a single game. That's changing when Dual Powers goes live. I love everything about it: the viscerally beautiful art, the original mechanics (OH THE CALENDAR MECHANIC), the fact that it's tuned like a fine Stradivarius for one and two players, and most of all, the way a few simple rules magically conspire to thrust me into the middle of the Russian Revolution. I'm beyond smitten.\" -- Nick Bentley, designer/developer/marketer at North Star Games (Evolution, Happy Salmon)\n\"Dual Powers is a smart, engaging mix of modern and traditional gameplay. Cleverly invoking what\u2019s fun \u2014 and familiar \u2014 about cribbage, it goes on to deliver a completely new experience set against a flavorful historical backdrop. The first time I played Dual Powers, when the game ended, I demanded that we immediately play again. If you enjoy games like Twilight Struggle, you owe it to yourself to try Dual Powers.\" - Jeff Tidball, designer/writer (Horus Heresy, Pieces of Eight, Dragon Age RPG)\n\"I actually like how the game feels, plays and looks. I do get that feeling of being immersed in the political upheaval but in a light, slightly removed, almost passive way...

Over the years we have expanded to 5 full length podcasts per month covering board games, role playing games and miniatures gaming. We've also produced audio dramas, video blogs and more. This fundraiser will ensure that the Cabal continues to produce all of this content and more over the next year! \nThese are the items that you will receive in the reward bundles.\nPart of the fun of creating things and also creating stuff!

All of the other goodies listed below are individually listed within the backer levels.\nWHAT ABOUT SHIPPING?\nShipping is the most difficult part of running any Kickstarter. We are running this project to facilitate making as much content as we can and too many campaigns have been sunk by botched shipping. Each pledge including physical rewards will have a shipping and handling cost added to it. \nUS Shipping: $5 ($3 for just the promos) \nCanadian Shipping: $12 ($10 for just the promos)\nEverywhere Else: $15 ($13 for just the promos)\nShipping for Grand Adventures Print version adds $2 for Canadian and international pledges.\nShipping For Add Ons\nShipping will be added per add-on based on the item and it's destination via a pledge manager after the campaign closes.\nWe very much appreciate your understanding as we are attempting to minimize our risk and make sure you get all your goodies! \nNOTE ABOUT BACKER LIMITS: So you may notice that there are actually limits on a the backer levels. The reason this is is that the reward promos are donated by publishers and they only have the ability to provide a certain number of them to us - roughly 1500. We cant exceed those limits. So we have those limits imposed on all the levels that receive promos. If by some strange and amazing circumstance we completely run out of the 1500ish promos during this campaign, will will continue with backer levels sans-promos.

After more than a year of hard work, we are thrilled to announce: Fireball Island is back!\nIf this is your first time checking out the campaign, good to see you! You'll be thrilled to know that our amazing backers have already unlocked tons of stretch goals (and more still to come). As you check out the page, keep in mind that your pledge will also include all of this amazing stuff.\nOn the other hand, if you know you want it all and you want it now, we've got you covered.\nSo what are you waiting for? Come on and join the fun!\nFireball Island: The Curse of Vul-Kar improves on the art, components, and game play of the original. If you loved the game as a child, you'll see we turned that \"delightful chaos\" up to the max. If you never played it before, you'll appreciate it as a fun, exciting game for kids, families, and gamers alike.\nWe found a way to make the new island bigger, taller, faster, and cooler -- all while fitting in a smaller box.\nTom Vasel and the Dice Tower crew sat down with Justin Jacobson, the president of Restoration Games for a full, live playthrough of the base game, which should give you a good idea of how the game plays.\nSometimes, you may face Vul-Kar the way you want...\n... but even then you can't be sure which way it will come out.\nEven as the marble careens down the mountain, the paths and trees can divert it one way or another.\nA tree might even save your life.\nWhile the fireballs are unpredictable, we made sure that players have more control over their actions and more meaningful choices.\nOn your turn, play one of your two action cards to move your pawn and perform a special action.\nGrab a snapshot from each part of the island and get back to the helipad.\nEarn points for collecting sets of treasure.\nIf you get knocked down, you'll lose a treasure but gain a useful souvenir.\nIf you draw a Cataclysm, Vul-Kar gets to take a turn.\nIn all, the game remains fast, fun, and light, but offers meaningful choices.\nWe've also made arrangements with Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! to do a rules video at the time of release. \nNOTE: The board in the images above is a hand-painted prototype and does not reflect final art for the island. Here is the near-final art for the island and some renders showing off the detail that will show up on the finished board.\nBlades of grass and cracked stones ease your path.\nA lonely crab woos visitors at Skeleton Head Beach.\nThere are four expansions available in this campaign, and they are fully interchangeable with the base game and each other. We've also added some amazing new components, through hitting stretch goals, with no additional charge to backers.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       The view from the poop deck.\nHope you got that snapshot, Saul.\n                                                                                                                                                                                        If this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easy to get involved, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun. All you have to do is:\nClick on the pledge level you want to back.\nEnter your email address and \u201cContinue as guest\u201d.\nEnter your payment information.\nClick the big green \u201cPledge\u201d button \nTo keep things simple, there are only two tiers for regular backers.\n(You can order additional copies or optional buys by increasing your pledge amount. See Shipping and Fulfillment below for more details.)\nFor verified brick-and-mortar stores: We also have a special pledge level that is just for you. You pledge only $20 during the campaign. When we are ready to ship the games, after the campaign closes, you will use our pledge manager to finalize your order and pay the remaining balance due. If you have any question about your status, please message us, and we will confirm before pledging. All the terms and other information about this pledge level can be found in this special update.\nWe've blown through dozens of stretch goals, like a fireball through a rickety bridge, and unlocked tons of great additional content. Backers get the Treasure Trove expansion pack for free, and it's already full of new souvenirs, injury cards, and more.\nUnlocked sleeves (optional buy, manually add $15 to your pledge).\nPainted minis (optional buy, manually add $10 to your pledge).\nMaker Kit (optional buy, manually add $40 to your pledge)\nNot much time left to hit those stretch goals!\nGiven the unique design of the game, we only have one prototype and couldn't send out review copies. We wanted a fun way to let a bunch of people play the game, so we took the show on the road! J.R. Honeycutt, our Tinker-in-Chief, set off on a 30-day, 13-state road trip, including a stop in Canada! We met up with some of the most amazing game stores, cafes, conventions, and content creators to bring you a chance to play the game in person. And, of course, we got to meet our amazing fans and backers. It was truly a special happening. Below are some videos from the trip. (Note: These videos are of the hand-painted prototype board; the final version of the board will have printed art and won't be as shiny.)\nOne of our backers, MAJBrown22 was able to make it to the Secret Cabal Meetup at Beermongers and wrote up his impressions in this Board Game Geek forum post. \nChris has apparently been ensorcelled by Vul-Kar.\n Check out some epic skill shots in this supercut:\nPLAY\n\nWe are using key fulfillment partners within each shipping region. There are no additional customs fees, VAT, or similar charges.\nThere is only one shipping charge per region regardless of what reward you get -- we're subsidizing the rest.\nFor the US, Canada, and the EU, we are proud to partner with Quartermaster Logistics, the premier provider of Kickstarter fulfillment in the gaming industry. Your games will be safely packed by their professional team, and you\u2019ll be emailed a tracking number when your package ships. For Australian backers, we'll be using Aetherworks, who we used on our Stop Thief! campaign and who did a great job.\nIf you would like to order a second copy, just increase your pledge amount by the cost of that pledge. You do not need to add anything for additional shipping. If you want more than two copies, add the shipping charge for each additional set of one or two. For example, if you wanted to get three copies of the base game sent to Canada, you would pledge a total of $220.\nWe are using BackerKit, a third-party service that lets us manage ordering and shipping. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll have the chance add items to your pledge at that time. Importantly, though, there will be no additional fees due after the campaign. When you pledge, it will automatically calculate and add all shipping charges. The only additional charge is if you decide to get more stuff. Both pledge levels will be available in BackerKit. You can back the campaign now at any amount and choose your pledge later, or you can back at the Feel the Burn level and upgrade to the Full Vul-Kar.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the limitations of our license, we are only able to offer the game in English and in the US, Canada, EU, and Australia. Please see the FAQ for more information.\nAs we head into the final hours of this campaign, every point of contact and bit of buzz can help. Send the message out far and wide on social media. Use these social media avatars to show your love for the game. And, remember, sometimes the best way is a direct, personal email to that one person you just know will get a kick out of it. Every little bit helps.\nRestoration Games was founded by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We knew there were a lot of great treasures hidden beneath the sands of time. When we announced our plans, the response was overwhelming. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory, bringing the fun to those with fond memories, and publishing great games for demanding gamers.\nWe must acknowledge the rest of the team who put in an unblelievable effort to make this a reality. Jason Taylor is our Visual Restoration Wizard, who is the reason everything we do looks so good. Lindsay Daviau is our Production Superhero, who ensures the finished products look amazing. JR Honeycutt is our Tinker-in-Chief; he helps get a game from the idea to a finished design. Suzanne Sheldon, our Master-of-Fireworks, makes sure everyone knows what we're up to.\nWe had lots of talented help with the art and design of the game. George Doutsiopoulos did the fantastic cover illustrations for the base game and the three main expansions. Card art is by Victor Perez Corbella. David Kegg did the retro art that appears in various places in the game, branding, and this campaign. Jean-Louis Sirois helped with some extra foliage illustration you see on this page and on the gameboard. Additional thanks to Matijos Gebreselassie and Bill Tiller for early concept illustrations. 3D sculpting for the miniatures and island features is by Chad Hoverter. Noah Adelman of Game Trayz, LLC did the initial design work on the island trays. Design Innovation, Inc. finalized the island trays. The video work was done by Josh McDowell, and the voiceover was performed by Graham Rowat. Rulebook editing was done by the Meeple Lady. Our thanks to all of them for their unbelievable effort in bringing this project to fruition.\nAnd, of course, we would be remiss not to mention the original masterminds behind the game, Bruce Lund and Chuck Kennedy.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our second Kickstarter and fourth game overall.

We figured out which things work best and what people like the most. What's fun, and what's too fiddly.

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Test your survival skills in the dark fantasy world of Unbroken. You are the only one left alive after your group was ambushed by monsters - now you must avenge your friends and reclaim your freedom. Quick to learn, easy to set up and playable in a brief 20-30 minutes, the game will challenge you to make the right decisions or fall victim to the many dangers of the monster-infested caverns.\nPlan wisely and take calculated risks - you do not have much and must use every resource at your disposal to prevail. Each journey in the dark is unique as you play as one of four different characters and face a variety of monsters and encounters. Your character gets better with experience and so will you - Unbroken is a game that encourages and rewards repeated plays to refine your strategies. \n                                                           Hanging on by a thread. You snuck past a giant spider along the way but now want to arm yourself, hearing monsters ahead. You need some wood for a sturdy club.\nYou could gather your strength at a shrine or distract the feasting goblinoids to steal their food. No wood that you wanted, but you\u2019ll use the shrine \u2013 hunger isn\u2019t the biggest threat to your survival now.\nStill a bit of time left - you push on, looking for another encounter.\nFinally, some wood! You could fashion a weapon from these branches. But you are weak \u2013 gathering the wood, then crafting the club would tire you out. Instead you decide to rest up and to face the upcoming monster with your bare hands.\nYou are short on time \u2013 another encounter could yield resources, but if time gets to 0 the monster would ambush you. You decide not to risk it and face the monster.\nYou face your foe. The unfortunate wretch trapped in these caverns has long gone mad with despair.\nYour gamble not making a weapon paid off! The Survivor\u2019s Special effect would disarm you, wasting all resources you would have spent on the weapon.\nYou didn\u2019t have to go into the fight blindly \u2013 you could Scout the monster and knew what to expect. It would cost resources but would provide certainty.\nIn Combat you will spend effort to wound your enemy. Good thing you feel strong after stopping at that shrine!\n\nYou would be in trouble encountering an armoured monster - dealing with that using just your fists would lead to a quick defeat.\nYour victory is rewarded! Which weapon upgrade tree will you choose? Which skills will aid your struggles? There are two more truly dangerous monsters to defeat before you are free of this accursed place!\nUnbroken has been designed to be played regardless of how strapped for time or company you might be. All you need to get it to the table is a small space, 20-30 minutes of free time and just one player - YOU. \nSome games have add-on solo modes. Some allow you to play versus a virtual opponent. Unbroken doesn\u2019t settle for the fact that you\u2019re playing solo - it celebrates it. The survival story you\u2019re telling is that of individual triumph in the face of adversity, and it has been crafted to be enjoyed in exactly this way.\nUnbroken is won by careful planning and calculated risk. There are several strategies you can go for including a focus on skills, trickery or different weapon upgrade trees. Your approach will determine your success much more than the limited luck element. Every game you will learn how to best prepare for the challenges of the dungeon. Every next game you will be a little better at surviving. \nDo you spend your resources to find out more about the coming dangers or do you hedge your bets and go in blind? Do you risk looking for food to not starve even if you might be ambushed by a monster? There are many difficult decisions in Unbroken and these will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering if you made the right one. \nUnbroken is built on a flexible system that is centered around a variety of characters to play and monsters to combat. We already have great designs in mind for expansions that we will start working on in full after the campaign. We can\u2019t wait to have the community\u2019s input on the new content! \nWe are so certain that you will like Unbroken that we are happy to offer an unconditional full refund (including shipping) within 30 days of you receiving the game.

I reported the damages to the manufacturer and after they denied the issues and blamed it on the shippers they finally checked the shipment that the still had not sent (still no answer why it was still there). They found 30% of these were damaged as well. I finally got the shipment off to VFI for the 3rd shipment and they are packing the shipments up. I email VFI every day asking for updates. They report that they are packing but have not shipped yet. In addition to all of this, the manufacturer has sent fewer products to each location than were ordered. They are refusing to produce replacement cases for the damaged all-weather cases so I have been forced to find another manufacturer to produce replacement waterproof cases in a pinch. The original manufacturer is also refusing to refund me for the damaged products. I am still trying to resolve these issues with them. Needless to say, I will not be working with that manufacturer in the future.

During the game, players will use their action pool to move around the evocative maps, investigate mysteries, interact with their environment, and unleash powerful attacks and abilities unique to each character. Once selected, however, these abilities will be unavailable until that character\u2019s action pool has emptied \u2014 a process that becomes more challenging as that character gains fear.\nStory maps for Chapters 1 & 2 - Click to enlarge\n  Players live the adventure of Legends of Sleepy Hollow over eight chapters filled with mystery, suspense, and a deeply rich story. Each chapter is kept separate from the others so players will discover the secrets of Sleepy Hollow as they play. There are seven distinct maps in the game and each chapter unfolds and plays different than the last, so playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow feels much like playing eight different board games!\nNow that we've achieved our base funding goal we will be able to publish Legends of Sleepy Hollow at the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of Legends of Sleepy Hollow is priced according to our initial funding goal; if we are able to exceed that then we can afford to upgrade some game components and add in a lot of other really cool stuff, like a stand-alone scenario and more Chapter game mats!\nThe mats will introduce the Heroic and Legendary difficulty levels so that players who have completed the game can try again with beastlier baddies and special conditions! The mats will be produced at the same factory as the base game, and on the same stock as the base game Standard mats. We've now unlocked enough of them so we will produce a whole mini-expansion that Kickstarter backers will get for free!\nBackers at the \"Defender of Sleepy Hollow\" pledge level receive the core game of Legends of Sleepy Hollow, complete with 39 custom sculpted miniatures, nearly 200 cards, dozens of wooden tokens, premium player boards and maps, and more!

Inside this book you'll find a ton of behind-the-scenes information on the art production process, including preliminary sketches and final pieces for the Heroes, Foes, miniatures and more. Also, American Gothic will include the original short story by Washington Irving with special illustrations!\n      Three days after the disappearance of Ichabod Crane, four Tarry Town residents with strange ties to the supernatural venture into an ever-darkening Sleepy Hollow to uncover its mysteries.\nAs our story begins, the townsfolk of Sleepy Hollow have grown increasingly frightened by tales of dark creatures and ghouls haunting the hillsides. Some of the newer residents scoffed, calling it myth and superstition, but older settlers felt that something was out there lurking. Elijah Kappel could feel it, and he knew the elders were wise; he'd spent the past decade studying the old ways and customs, and could now interpret the hushed whispers of Old World folklore.\nElijah feared that Ichabod's disappearance was only the beginning of something sinister. He knew that even if it was old Brom Bones cavorting around the forest on horseback, his head tucked into his vest, that Elijah might need more than his faith and a trusty walking staff to confront such headstrong opposition. What he needed was someone more imposing than the town bully - perhaps someone who walked softly and carried a big shovel...\n  The Legends of Sleepy Hollow is an adventure game for 1 to 4 players featuring cooperative tactical missions and some \"legacy\" elements.\nChapter 1 set-up - Click to enlarge\n  Watch our rules video for an overview of gameplay:\nOr download our \"print and play\" version of Chapter 1, and try it out for yourself!

While players who have experienced the full story will know the surprise twists throughout the game, each Chapter is designed to be a variable experience each time you play. \nFor instance, during set-up in Chapter 1 the Discovery tokens are randomized so players may find the journals in different places each game. Each Chapter's game mat also has variable conditions such as unpredictable creature spawns, or random event actions.\nFinally, we have created advanced \"Heroic\" (hard) and \"Legendary\" (very hard) versions of each map! We will be offering PDFs of those maps after the game is produced, and sending professionally printed hard copies to each backer for free if we unlock those stretch goals!\nLegends of Sleepy Hollow comes with 7 different Chapter game maps, custom screen-printed dice, thick, layered player boards, tons of cards, 39 gorgeous miniatures, and more! Here\u2019s a complete run-down:\n16 thick, interlocking punchboard map tiles \n4 sculpted plastic Hero miniatures \n10 sculpted plastic Gobkins \n10 sculpted plastic Schrikroots \n15 sculpted plastic other miniatures (shhhh, it\u2019s a secret!)\n Over 140 Euro mini-sized cards with linen finish (for the Legends story deck, character Skills, Skill upgrades, Foe cards, more)\n Over 50 bridge-sized cards with linen finish (character equipment and proficiency upgrade cards) \n4 thick, layered player mats with wells for Action/Fear tokens and equipment/proficiency upgrade cards \n20 wooden Action tokens \n25 custom wooden Fear tokens \n6 custom screen-printed dice \n1 regular six-sided die \n40 thick punchboard Damage rings (attach to bottom of the miniature bases to track damage) \n12-page full color glossy rulebook \n24-page Storybook with thick card stock pages (contains Chapter details, story elements, and game mats) \n1 amazing box - check it out!\nAs a story-driven game, theme and atmosphere are key elements in the experience of playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow. We want you to feel as though you're a part of the world from the moment you pull the box off the shelf. We created this box to replicate an 1800s Dutch-style dresser chest, but with the unique whimsy and beauty that Abigail's art brings to the game. It's as if this relic was lifted directly from the in-game world to your game table. The box lid lifts open to reveal the game contents inside - just as if you were in the game unlocking Ichabod's chest to see what mysteries it holds. The box lid hinges with support from ribbons connecting the inside of the lid to the base. Double-walled interior elements make the box extra sturdy and create a smooth, tight seal when the lid is dropped down. We even included artistic details such as hinges and a front lock!\nSamples of Legend deck, Foes, and starting Hero Skills - Click to enlarge\n  Legends of Sleepy Hollow will have more awesome features inside the box - and we can't even show you all of them... that'd spoil the story and half the fun!\nFirst up, the game will include 39 highly-detailed miniatures designed by Francesco Orr\u00fa and based on character artist Abigail Larsen's concepts. You can check out the four main Hero sculpts below, and get a closer look at the Gobkins and Schrikroots that will be battling our heroes - at least in Chapter 1!\nHero mini samples - click to enlarge\n            Each Hero and Foe miniature has a punchboard ring that attaches to the bottom of the figure and is secured by a plastic base. Tracking health is as simple as turning the ring to the appropriate amount. Some Foes may have special damage track rings that activate abilities - but you'll have to wait and find that out on your own!\nAnother great feature is the Hero player boards. These are made of layered punchboard with recessed wells for Action/Fear tokens, equipment and weapon proficiency upgrades, and a raised surface with room to tuck Skill and Item cards underneath!\n   All backers of Legends of Sleepy Hollow will get some awesome extras!\nFirst off, backers at both pledge levels will also receive the fully-produced solo card game Lost in the Woods, designed by Robert Johnson! The game will retail for $9.95 after the campaign, but it will be sent for free to all backers!\nLost in the Woods is set on the eve of Ichabod Crane's fateful ride home at the end of the original story of Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Players must guide Ichabod from the Van Tassel mansion through the forest to the covered bridge before time runs out and the Headless Horseman chases him down. Players will need to push their luck, avoid frights, and keep their wits to get Ichabod safely home!\nIf you'd like to try Lost in the Woods yourself, you can download the print-and-play files right here!\nHere's an overview of how Lost in the Woods plays!\nNext, every backer will receive a set of personal Totem cards that will not be available in the retail version of Legends of Sleepy Hollow. \nPromotional personal Totem cards - Click to enlarge\n  If the players wish, each character may start the game with their personal Totem card in Inventory. The card may be played from Inventory at any time to resuscitate the character if they have been incapacitated, returning them to full Health and with 2 Fear on the next turn. These cards are useful for lowering the difficulty of the game for more casual groups, or for when things get really heated around Chapter 4!\nKevin and Melissa Delp of Tantrum House took a look at Legends of Sleepy Hollow, and they loved it!\nBeasts of War plays the first chapter of Legends of Sleepy Hollow in Legendary mode! Beware, there are SPOILERS!\nJonathan and Will from Roll For Crit produced an excellent preview video and gave Legends of Sleepy Hollow their official seal of approval!\nBell of Lost Souls did a live runthrough of Chapter 1 on Twitch, and they had a great time!\nBoard Game Gumbo interviewed game developer & lead storyteller Chris Kirkman about the game, the story, stretch goals, and more!\nLinks to Media & quotes about Legends of Sleepy Hollow:\n\"Like classic cooperative and dungeon crawl games, you\u2019ll find yourself trying to use your actions efficiently and working with your teammates to optimize your turns. With its goth horror storytelling and the tension created by the game\u2019s turns, your group will soon be overwhelmed by creatures who move with zombie-like relentlessness. You may not complete your quest on your first attempt, but like any good game, you\u2019ll be quick to try again.\" - Ruel Gaviola, Geek & Sundry \n\"The Legend is real! Story-based gameplay and replayability combine into one mythical gaming experience in the Legends of Sleepy Hollow. Your gaming table will thank you for this one... it definitely earned a spot on my game shelf!\" - Becca Kaufeld, Game Trade Magazine\nHaving played Chapter 1: \u201cAsymmetrical powers? A story to uncover? Secret envelopes to open? And a dude dropping baddies with a shovel!?! What's there not to be excited about???\" - Rob and Christina Rouse, Blue Peg Pink Peg podcast\n\"If you like classic horror, if you like intrigue, and if you have been looking for a well-done campaign game that doesn\u2019t pull any punches and keeps you engaged throughout the entire story, then you want to go look at their Kickstarter page and back it.\" - Marti Wormuth, Open Seat Gaming\n\"When I played solo, however, the game felt like a turn-based tactical video game, such as Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem, where I was the tactician, in control of the actions of all of the heroes. Despite controlling multiple characters, playing Legends of Sleepy Hollow solo gave me a similar feeling that I had playing Arkham Horror: The Card Game, and I feel it will likely appeal to those that play AH:CG solo for its story-driven, exploratory horror experience.\" - Eric Buscemi, The Cardboard Hoard\n\"I won't spoil the events that take place after completing the team's objective, but if it's anything close to the events of the other seven missions, I expect Legends of Sleepy Hollow will provide ample opportunities for twists and exciting storytelling. Another thing driving story and replayability is once a mission is accomplished, players can choose an additional skill or upgrade their equipment to progress their character and make them more valuable for future missions. I love this inclusion, and I think it will add a lot to keep players engaged, ready to test their new skills on new foes.\" - Chris Hecox, Geeks Under Grace \n\"By the end of our play through, I was genuinely impressed with how well Sleepy Hollow seems to add new content and challenges, and will continue to do so into later chapters.\" - Wyatt Krause, Sprites + Dice\n\"I like how the players have to make their choices with limits, forcing each player to carefully consider possible outcomes. I also like that you can see doom approaching. This helped me and the rest of the players make better choices, while not ever feeling like the game was going easy on us.\" - Father Geek Approved!\n  More to come!\nFor US and Canadian backers, we are offering free shipping.

It\u2019s also, thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers, one of the biggest board game worlds ever created!\nThe game became a reality thanks to over 12,000 backers, but the cost of making such a game is so high that a retail version is almost unfeasible. However, we wanted to give you another opportunity to get your hands on it: your last chance\u2026 to get cursed.\nThe Expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d invites you to come and discover, or perhaps return to, The 7th Continent for some fresh adventures! Two new curses are waiting, each with their own unique gameplay elements, for you to discover.\nIn \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d you\u2019ll find yourself aboard a Hot Air Balloon, in search of salvation and in \u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d you will delve deep below the Continent in order to triumph over the Evil consuming you.\n\u201cEasily one of my favourite games of the year. This is an amazing game and possibly the best adventure board game ever designed. Excellent!\u201d\nTom Vasel \u2013 The Dice Tower\n\u201cThe 7th Continent is the best exploration game I\u2019ve ever played. Every decision is interesting, the sense of cooperation and collaboration is strong, the freedom to roam is liberating, and the mystery is fascinating. This is a must-buy!\u201d\nJamey Stegmaier \u2013 Stonemaier Games\n\"The 7th Continent is quite simply a watershed moment in enthusiast gaming. Encapsulating all that was great from the LucasArts adventure games of the past, Serious Poulp has crafted an analog experience that continually inspires exploration and invokes a constant sense of wonder. The ripple effect of this game will be felt for years to come in the Boardgame Industry and should most definitely be enjoyed by all.\"\nJeremy Salinas \u2013 Man VS Meeple\n\u201cThis is the ultimate survival/exploration board game. Nothing else comes close to touching it in terms of its raw, epic scope, ambition and design.\u201d\nRichard Ham \u2013 Rahdo Runs Through\n\"I have over 50 hours of gameplay logged with 7th Continent and I feel like I have just scratched the surface. This is easily the best game of the year, and one of the best I have ever played in my life.\"\nLance Myxter \u2013 Undead Viking\nPlay solo or in a team of up to 4 players.\n30 seconds to set-up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure in a single game.\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where \u201cyou are the hero\u201d that thrilled so many of us in our childhood.\nNo dice rolls! Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\nAlmost 1,000 cards for the base box alone with hundreds of pieces of original artwork.\nJoin the expedition any time, even if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died during it.\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for each individually numbered card.\nThere are consequences to your actions. If you kill an NPC, they will remain dead for the rest of the game and any options or alternatives that you might have had by letting them live will be gone\u2026forever. Let them live and they might help you later. Then again, they might not.\nAn expansion with two brand new curses, each with their own unique gameplay mechanics!\nThis expansion, which requires the base box, is compatible with all previous expansions.\nIt includes over 250 new cards, including two new curses, which you will have to overcome if you hope to leave the 7th Continent alive. Each one will provide a unique experience, pushing the survival skills of both novice and veteran explorers to the limit.\nThis new expansion has its own \u201ccollector\u2019s\u201d box that \u2013 combined with the base box \u2013 can store all of the cards of the base box as well as all of the expansions (even if everything is sleeved) and other materials. It includes:\n3 Storage trays\n250+ cards\n1 Hot Air Balloon miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n1 Barge miniature (+ alternative cardboard standee)\n7 new Dividers\n1 rule sheet\nThe curse, \u201cA Prison of Clouds\u201d, will send you on a whirling adventure OVER the 7th Continent!\nAboard your hot air balloon, you\u2019ll soar over the continent thanks to an innovative wind management system, which will lead you to new, unexplored tracts of land\u2026\nYou can land at any time by taking the Terrain card with the same number as your current Sky card, allowing you to continue exploring on foot. When you wish to take off again, simply make your way back to the card where you landed and your aerial adventure continues.\nTake care though, as each trip will tax you. Hunger, confinement and violent winds will test your nerves.\nMake short trips and improve your piloting abilities if you want to stand a chance of lifting the curse that keeps you trapped in this hopeless land.\n\u201cThe Veins of the Earth\u201d will drag you down into the bowels of the earth where an underground network of serpentine waterways spans the entire length of the continent.\nAboard a barge of aboriginal design, your actions will be limited as the current draws you ever deeper. Make the right choices at the right time or you\u2019ll end up lost and doomed in the pitch black.\nAs insane and suicidal as it may seem, you have no choice but to forge ever onwards into the darkness. What manner of horrors await you? It matters not, as long as you can free yourself from this curse!\n\"Satchel & Journal\" Binder\nThis new accessory will allow you to store all the \u201cQuest Item\u201d cards that you\u2019ll acquire during your adventures, just as if you were jotting them down in your journal!\n1907. A renowned explorer, you have just returned from the first expedition on the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and is very likely the last Terra Incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the daily newspaper, you realize that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons.\nCoincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it difficult to get out of bed. A cold shiver runs down your spine and you are in a constant state of depression and malaise.\nYou are going to have to face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. When night falls, you slip into a restless sleep unaware that, for you, this is only the beginning...\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the available characters. Each one comes with their own set of Skill cards that represent their abilities and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nKeelan: an explorer and keen Botanist. One of the explorers available to you with an example of her Skill cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cAn Offering to The Guardians\u201d, \u201cThe Bloody Hunt\u201d, \"The Dark Chest of the Damned\" - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you from those included in the base box (4) or those in the expansions (5).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very unique adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain the unobtainable, discover that which is forever hidden, and strive against the impossible.\nDo you have what it takes?\nA Curse that you can attempt to lift and its clue.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains - you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventures as well as encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card your miniature is standing on, the Event cards attached to it, and the Character, Skill, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Items in your inventory.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your Skills and simultaneously serves as your life force.\nEvery action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing when performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, and consequently reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will likely get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more successes. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted, so are you. From now on, every action could be your last!\nThankfully, the Skill cards that you may add to your hand when performing actions, your Bonus and Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. This is especially true when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of success.\nA faithful companion and a precious item.\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations.\nYou will have to use your best survival skills to overcome the varied threats you will face in this land, so that you can eventually lift your curses:\nFind or craft items to help you escape risky situations or access locations that would normally be unreachable without them.\nGather food, by hunting or fishing, in order to regain some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck. Make a fire and cook it and you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment. It contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you uncover the Continent\u2019s many secret locations.\nThere are countless surprises for you to experience along your journey!\nA page from your journal that now allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nYou can download the rules (.pdf \u2013 56 Mo) or check this video (26\u2019) to learn how to play The 7th Continent!\n\nEdit: cards from The Past must be returned between two game sessions.\nAll the expansions and optional purchases from the original Kickstarter will be available during the course of the second campaign.\nHow to add optional buys to my pledge?\n1. Click on the \u201cManage your pledge\u201d green button at the top of the page\n2. On the next screen, click on the \u201cChange your pledge\u201d blue button\n3. Then, in the current reward box you\u2019ve chosen, increase the pledge amount by the value of the optional buy then click on the \u201cContinue\u201d green button\n4. On the window that appears, click on the \u201cConfirm\u201d blue button.\n5. It\u2019s done!\n6. A few weeks after the Kickstarter campaign ends, we will open the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d (PM) and invite you to fill it by telling us which optional buys you\u2019d like to purchase and in which language (English or French).\n \nIf you want to sleeve the ENTIRE game, including the Stretch Goals and any other content made available during the campaign, then you have to add both optional buys for a total of $79 which includes over 1600+ card sleeves (the \u201c+\u201d is additional sleeves included \u201cfor free\u201d for the upcoming Stretch Goals and optional buys).\nWhat would a Kickstarter campaign be without some Stretch Goats?\nAfter 4 years of work, The 7th Continent became a reality thanks to the support of over 12,000 backers. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t be here today.\nThe cost of making this game is high, notably due to the quality of its components. Due to this a retail version of the game is almost unfeasible.\nHowever, we want the game to live and continue growing as well as allowing those that missed out on the first campaign and/or some of its contents to acquire them.\nThis campaign is no doubt one of your last chances to take part in The 7th Continent adventure...\nThis new campaign will allow you to expand upon the adventure we all began back in 2015. With new curses and mechanics, a whole new experience awaits you! It will also allow you to acquire any elements you may have missed from the first campaign.\nFor those of you only interested by the \u201cupgrade pack\u201d: you will be able to procure it (at production cost) at our online store at www.seriouspoulp.com when it becomes available in 2018.\nFree Upgrade pack\nThis pack contains cards that will allow those of you possessing the first edition of the game to upgrade it to the second edition and 4 additional dividers to help you search for cards more easily (Characters' Skills, \"004\", \"051\", \"109\"). It includes any cards that may have been changed or corrected after the first campaign.\nNOTE: This pack is included in the Veteran pledge (which is specifically for those with a copy of The 7th Continent from the first Kickstarter campaign)\nNew Content\nIf you purchased all available content from the previous campaign and wish to complete your collection, then all you\u2019re missing is:\nThe expansion \u201cWhat Goes Up, Must Come Down\u201d: this expansion includes two new curses along with new ways to explore the continent.\nSatchel & Notebook binder: this game accessory will allow you to store all the cards that would normally be placed under the Satchel & Journal card.\nAll unlocked Stretch goals that become available during the campaign.\nThese items are included in the Veteran pledge.\nAlso, new \u201coptional purchases\u201d will become available during the campaign (see \"Optional buys\" section). \nThe USA, European Union, Canada and Australia will all be \u201cShipping Friendly\u201d. This means that backers from these countries will not incur any import taxes.\nAfter our experience with the first campaign, we are planning on two waves of shipping for this new project.\nThe First Wave will include the new \"Second edition\" base box and non-cards optional purchases (such as bone dice & dice bag, sleeves, etc.). This wave is slated for March 2018.\nThe Second Wave, due in October 2018, will include the new expansion \"What Goes Up, Must Come Down\", all optional buys with cards (old and new) as well as Stretch Goals from this campaign.\nShipping will be paid AFTER THE END OF THE CAMPAIGN, during the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase. Below, you will find an estimation of shipping costs per shipping area. Despite this, we are committed to these prices being the maximum amount you will have to pay.\nDuring the \u201cPledge Manager\u201d phase, you can ask to receive everything, including the Base Box, in Wave 2 (due in October 2018) in order to reduce shipping costs significantly when compared to the cost of both waves (although still more expensive than the wave 2 shipping shown below).\n*You can choose to have this optional buys shipped on wave 2 \u2013 instead of wave 1 \u2013 to avoid paying for the shipping fee associated.\n**Europe (A): Germany, United-Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland and Austria.\n**Europe (B): Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic.\n**Europe (C): Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, Finland, Iceland, Montenegro, Norway, Serbia, Turkey, Ukraine (Note: the lower part of the estimate).\nNote: recently updated for GREECE, ROMANIA and SWEDEN.\nAlso, South Korea is in Area 4 \u2013 lower part of the estimate\nWould you like to pledge for multiple copies?\nEach copy purchased includes all unlocked Stretch Goals. For areas 1, 2 and 3, shipping costs after the first pledge (up to a maximum of 7) are halved! We are still looking for solutions to get some discount for multiple copies for areas 4 and 5 as well (hopefully by the end of the campaign).\nWe\u2019re two friends that love playing and making games. Also, one of us is pretty handy with a pencil.\nFounded in 2010, Serious Poulp was all about seeing the games we designed come to life.\nSerious Poulp Inc. is the name of the North American branch of Serious Poulp. It was created in 2017 to help us develop our business in North America.\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The 7th Continent was successfully funded back in October 2015 thanks to the support of 12,103 daring explorers! Two years later, with a lot of experience from this first adventure under our belts, we\u2019re back with some new ideas that we just couldn\u2019t keep to ourselves!\nLudovic Roudy and Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends passionate about all things gaming! We\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp, which we founded in 2010, when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludovic was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives, whether from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all of these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent - Ludovic also creates all of the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno, apart from writing cards and rulebooks, supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpslayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the Community Manager for The 7th Continent and the scourge of small draconic beings. Rolling dice, pushing toy soldiers and trading sheep for many a moon now, Jamie is, just like you guys, a gamer at heart. He\u2019s also a publisher himself with his own company, Holy Grail Games. Some of you may recognize him from the first Kickstarter campaign.\nTo our families and friends for their incredible support and patience as we created the cursed land of the 7th Continent.\nTo our proofreaders and translators who did an outstanding job!\nTo Olivier Nkweti for his great work on miniatures.\nTo the amazing Gary Chalk, Joe Dever, Didier Guiserix, Gary Gygax, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone for their inspirational work.\nTo all the backers of the first campaign who helped us make this dream a reality.\nTo you, previous and first-time backers, who will allow us to keep on dreaming!\nThank you all!\nWe wish you a not too gruesome demise in the land of The 7th Continent!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe re-printing of the base box does not pose any issues. \n\nWork on the new expansion has already begun and we are confident in our ability to meet the announced deadlines.\n\nWe will, of course, be keeping you updated about the state of the project through each and every stage. \n\nREFUNDS\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf the refund is requested more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAll prices shown in \u20ac (Euros) are based on the conversion rate in effect at the start of the campaign (09-25-2017) which is $1 = \u20ac0.84\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information, and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Tolkein and Terry Pratchett, and the amazing and varied scenery near my home on the South West coast of England.\nMy goal was to make roleplaying games more accessible by stripping back almost all the conventional elements, revealing a strong procedural storytelling experience that is:\nEasy to grasp and \"safe\" for new players\nSelf-contained, and quick to play\nEndlessly replayable\nI hope I've succeeded!\nForest of Fate uses nothing but a storybook and high-quality cards for its unique brand of survival storytelling. It's compact enough to take anywhere, and has no small parts to lose!\nCheck out some of the gorgeous character art by the brilliant Milly Hanson:\nThe Thief\nThe Bard\nThe Ranger\nThe Warrior\nHere's a simplified interaction between a Character and an Encounter, to demonstrate the anatomy of the most important cards.\nThe Story Book is the heart and soul of Forest of Fate. It contains 1,164 paragraphs to spark your imagination, describing the encounters you'll face and the actions you'll take.\nA computer rendering of the Deluxe Story Book (Hero tier and above)\nYou have three choices when it comes to using the Story Book:\nThe content and gameplay for all three versions is identical, though I recommend the digital version - it can be updated later if we spot mistakes, and more importantly helps to save the forests we love!\nI've tried to make all rewards simple and fair. Please note that this campaign will not be using a pledge manager. Once it's over, it's over. If you've got your eye on something you should grab it while you can!\nForest of Fate is the debut game from Cards of Fate. As a startup publisher without a great deal of capital to invest or a name in the industry, I view Kickstarter as an exciting opportunity to help build a small community around my games and reward those who share my vision.\nPlaytesting (all components pictured are early prototypes, not final)\nThank you for reading, and I hope I've inspired you to try Forest of Fate.\nThanks also to the fine folk at Tabletop Audio for the ambient forest sounds used in my videos. They're highly recommended if you want to really immerse yourself in the game!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThough this is my first Kickstarter, as a professional Project Manager I understand risk and have taken all steps necessary to ensure the successful delivery of your rewards.\n\n-- Design & Content\nThe only elements of the game outstanding at this stage are the naming rights made available as rewards and the finalised stretch goal content. All other content is complete and all designs have been finalised and formatted, ready for manufacturing.\n\n-- Manufacturing\nForest of Fate uses standard components, and will be printed and packaged by a proven Chinese board and card game manufacturer. All components will be subject to a thorough review by Cards of Fate prior to mass production.\n\n-- Shipping\nFulfilment will be handled by Gamesquest, a well-known and experienced partner in Kickstarted board games. Backers with the EU will have their rewards sent from within the EU, so there should be no additional VAT or customs charges.\n\n-- Stretch Goals\nAll stretch goals have been carefully pre-planned and pre-budgeted.

A series of city-wide neural implant programs, dubbed \"the harvests,\" enabled data gathering directly from a person\u2019s cerebral cortex. Becoming increasingly empowered by the collective thoughts of a city, Mother soon became her own master, not just reading minds, but controlling them.\nOnly the few that avoided the harvests remained untouched by Mother\u2019s influence. Among those hardened criminals and frightened refugees, the \"Renegades\" fight back.\nRenegade is a solo/co-operative cyberpunk deck-building game for 1 to 5 players. You hack into a server network operated by one of four SMCs. Each has their own AI with increasing complexity to defeat. You must puzzle through and survive their Countermeasures before the network is overrun by the SMC's Spark and Guardian defenses. Employing informational, destructive, deceptive, and cognitive attacks in your hacker's toolbox, you and your team must outsmart \"the system\" and take down the SMC to save humanity!\n                                                     Play as one of five Renegade hackers, each with unique abilities.\nConstruct and improve your hand of Command cards by purchasing new ones from the Hack Shack.\nEach SMC provides different challenges and increasing difficulty.\nCooperative gameplay really requires you out-thinking (the SMC) together to win!\nExamine the Renegade Rulebook here!\nNOTE: This is a beta version! The actual Rulebook is complete, but layout, proofing, and other corrections are still being finalized.\nYou are the hackers, Renegades in a dystopian future, where humanity is on the brink of disaster. Each Renegade has a unique ability that can thwart the SMC's efforts.\nContaminants are small programs that you upload to the servers. Each different color serves a specific purpose: For example, Viruses allow you to remove Sparks and Guardians, while Replicants can convert Sparks into a Contaminant of your choice.\nRootkits have been unlocked, and are now available! Read this update for more information!\nWhen three like-colored Contaminants are at the same position, you can combine them to form an Installation, which provides a more powerful ability than their smaller counterparts.\nEvery player starts the game with a hand of Basic Command cards, which generate Commands that you use to conduct your turn. Use one or more Command cards to generate enough Commands of the proper color to perform a single, specific Action.\nMore powerful Commands (Advanced Command cards) can be purchased at the Hack Shack, offering a variety of additional Commands as well as uber-hacker Execute functions and Events.\nSuper-Massive Computers (SMCs) are what you and your team of hackers are fighting against. Each SMC card has its own set of operating instructions, special setup rules, and provides its own level of difficulty.\nThe SMC you face will attempt to use a variety of Countermeasure cards to thwart you which are sorted by difficulty level. Every Countermeasure has a Goal that Renegades must achieve before the end of a game turn, or suffer the SMC's consequences.\nSparks are another Countermeasure that can remove your Contaminants if left unchecked! If there are ever three Sparks in a space, they will become a Guardian, an immobile Countermeasure which can spawn even more Sparks!\nOn the reverse side of Sparks and Guardians are Flares and Firewalls. A Flare neutralizes a Contaminant at its position, and Firewalls block your movement!\nIf you are required to place a Spark or Guardian into play and none remain in the stock, you immediately lose the game!\nVideo References\nWatch the Rahdo Runs Through playlist for Renegade:\nYou can also watch Ricky Royal's playthrough videos of Renegade:\n You can also watch Ricky's playlist for all the specific rules for Renegade:\nCheckout the playthrough playlist of Rolling Solo!\nWatch Doug Herring play through Renegade!\n One Stop Co-op Shop also did a playthrough of the game:\n  One 8.25\" x 8.25\" x 3\" Game Box\n125 Cards:\n\u00bb 60 Basic Command cards (15 per player color) + 15 purple Basic Command cards\n\u00bb 36 Advanced Command cards\n\u00bb 5 tarot-sized SMC cards (4 SMCs and 1 Simulator)\n\u00bb 24 Countermeasure cards (8 each of Copper, Silver, and Gold)\n4 Renegade Profile sheets + 1 purple Renegade Profile sheet\n6 Countersheets, which include:\n\u00bb 5 Server Tiles (with Fragmented Servers on the back)\n\u00bb 15 Red/Yellow circular tokens\n\u00bb 15 Blue/Green circular tokens\n\u00bb 25 Black/Gray circular tokens\n\u00bb 25 Square tokens (5 each of Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, and\n   Black/Gray)\n\u00bb 7 Purple circular tokens\n\u00bb 3 Countermeasure Scoring tokens (one each of Copper, Silver,\n   and Gold)\n\u00bb 4 Avatar standees + 1 purple Avatar standee + 5 Alternate Avatar standees\n2 custom etched Infection Dice (one red, one black)\n3 ICE Dice (one each of Copper, Silver, and Gold)\n1 heat transfer Partition Die\n1 heat transfer Server Die\n1 Rulebook\n7 KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE Custom Deck Tuck Boxes\n  Exclusive to Kickstarter backers!

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Hi, I'm Rahdo!  \nFive years ago, on a whim, I grabbed my iPhone one afternoon and started recording gameplay runthroughs of my favorite board and card games, and uploading them to YouTube. And now I'm about to start my 6th year of filming! WOOHOO!!!  \nYou can check out my series at  \nYOUTUBE.COM/RAHDO  \nAs a sampler, here's a playlist of some recent runthroughs I've done (click \"playlist\" in the top left to see a long list of video choices):  \nI make these videos primarily as a way of sharing my enthusiasm and passion for the boardgaming hobby, and helping like-minded board game geeks choose which of the myriad games on the market are right for them.  \nBut as it happens, as of 2013, I've retired from full-time employment, and now, to be able to continue to produce runthrough videos, I need to raise funds to cover my operating expenses (game purchases, travel expenses to game conventions, and a salary to be able to stay devoted 100% to the show).  \nFan Support Makes it all Possible  \nThat's where you come in, because I receive no direct income for Rahdo Runs Through except for fan support in these yearly fund raising drives. I accept no payments from game developers for any game (retail or Kickstarter prototype) that I run through, and I don't turn on YouTube ads (because they're awful), so you folks are truly what keeps Rahdo running through! :)  \nBy backing this, my fifth RAHDO RUNS THROUGH Kickstarter campaign, you're funding my ability to continue to produce videos of all the latest, hottest games, ranging from the big games of the moment like Arkham Horror the Card Game and Gloomhaven, to the soon to be released hits like Pandemic Legacy Season 2 and Charterstone. \nJust a few of the many games that could be coming soon, with your help...\nIn return for your donation, you have access to a variety of rewards. What are they, you might be wondering? I'm glad you asked... \nTHE BACKER REWARDS \nRahdo Runs Through VOTING! Exclusive microbadges!\n  Custom signed stickers & game bags crocheted with love!\n  Lucky dip markers and waterjet meeples galore!\n  WITWAT? They're keeping an eye out for you!\n  Supersize your meeples!\n  Co-host or direct the show!\n  Secret Council Membership!\nSo what's all this then? Lucky Dips? Secret Councils? Directors? WITWAT? Don't worry, I've got you covered. Check out this video, which walks you through all the different options, including how the WILDCARD backing system works! :)\nTHE STRETCH GOALS \nOkay, so the target goal for this year basically covers all the new games I'll be acquiring to film, another trip to Essen for more convention coverage and a basic salary for me and Paulo Renato (the fine fellow who fact checks and annotates all my vids... Paulo is l'awesome and keeps me honest!). But, if we go above and beyond the target, below is some additional content that can be provided over the next 12 months! \nStretch Goal #1: Rahdo Talks Through, the Podcast ($35,000)  \nHitting this stretch goal means I'll continue my twice-Golden Geek Award-nominated podcast series where I talk about exciting upcoming games, revisit top10 topics to delve further, and answer plenty of questions (joined each month by Jen).\nYou can subscribe to the series here: http://podcast.rahdo.com\nStretch Goal #2: Jen Runs Through ($40,000) \nRahdo Runs Through is mostly a one-man show, but people do love it when my lovely wife Jen makes appearances to help me play and demonstrate the games (rather than my normal \"virtual\" Jen gaming partner!) \nOf course, it's time consuming to film runthroughs, and that takes her away from her actual career of making beautiful glass art. But, if we hit this 2nd stretch goal, Jen will commit to appearing in 12 runthroughs over the course of the year (roughly once each month), and I can tell you right now, the shows she's in are always the most fun to watch! \nTo give you an idea of what a Jen-enhanced video is like, here's a playlist of all the videos she's been in to date: http://jen.rahdo.com \nStretch Goal #3: Rahdo Runs Through LIVE! ($50,000) \nThis stretch goal is all about filming live game runthroughs (plus Q&A) every other month. Last year my schedule for these was a bit off, and I'm getting them all done this very month! So tune in on any given Saturday in April to join the fun.\nHere's a playlist of all the live events done so far to see what they're like! \nStretch Goal #4: Rahdo & Jen's top100!!! ($55,000)\nFolks have been asking for this literally for years now, and if we hit this stretch, Jen and I will finally buckle down and make a series of videos where we discuss both of our top 100 games of all time!  \n  \"Thanks for watching, talk to you later, so long, buh bye!\"\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI'm not really anticipating any particular challenges or risks - other than maybe laryngitis!

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Secret Cabal Gaming Podcast has been rolling full steam ahead for five and a half years releasing high quality and thoughtfully produced tabletop gaming reviews, discussion and entertainment. With this campaign, the plan is not only to continue producing the shows you've come to expect, but to redouble our efforts, push the boundaries of quality and give listeners/viewers more of what they've come to love about The Cabal. \nWhy We Need Your Help\nDoing the Secret Cabal Gaming Podcast for five and a half years has been the most rewarding and fulfilling experience of our lives. To us it has become more than just a hobby, it is a beloved fixture of our lives. We need to see it grow to its fullest potential by gaining the time required to create more and better quality content for our listeners and viewers. Jamie is our lead content creator, editor and producer, and this campaign's ultimate goal is to move him to a full-time media producer to continue growing out media group.\n  The studio we've been using for some time now is... well basically it's an unfinished room in my basement. I built that gray wall in the back there to shoot video in front of and we clear all of that out and cover it with moving blankets and sound absorption when we recording the podcasts.  The floors are bare cement and the ceiling is bare wood and rafters. We would love to spend some of this money to really make that space a real recording studio for both the podcasts and video production. This would take a serious load off my production shoulders and free up even more time while producing the show. \nThe Chris level will bring you some more personal content about Chris. I would like to develop some behind the scenes content so you can get into the mind of Chris. This will include the promised tour of Chris' gaming closet were games disappear never to be found again. \n MORE STEVE. That's what everyone keeps asking for, so I'd like to produce Steve's Joke of the Week video series. Steve is full of them so either they'll be great... or bad... and both are acceptable. Also I'd like to produce a stand-up comedy special featuring Steve. I have some crazy ideas for this one so lets make it happen!\nA note about the stretch goals.\nObviously producing videos about Chris and Steve aren't going to cost us much money but what that money will really do is help us achieve even better quality overall. I put the Super Studio goal in there first but the higher we go the more we can do with making our space, equipment and software the best it can be so all of the productions can be top quality - and that includes productions like out ARG, Agents of the Cabal. \n    The Founders LOVE Ryan Laukat's games, and we're thrilled to be immortalized as character tiles in Red Raven's upcoming title, Near and Far. \nAnd not only that, the reverse will include alternate characters to be played in either Above and Below or Islebound.\n  One of our favorite Game Designers, Jamey Stegmaier has generously provided us with an encounter card for the hottest game of 2016, Scythe. And check out those airships...those beautiful, beautiful airships. Maybe we'll be seeing those in a future expansion? Maaaaaybe.\nAnd, of course, we couldn't get away with not including one of our best friends in the industry, and the most generous sponsor a podcast could ask for, Mr. Stephen Buonocore of Stronghold Games. He's giving us a great promo card for his amazing game, Terraforming Mars.\nIgnacy from Portal Games is, in my opinion, one of our generation's greatest game designers and 51st State is proof of that. Ignacy generously went to work creating an awesome mini expansion that emulates neighboring towns adjacent to the player's empires.\nOh my goodness, The Founders are up to no good plotting the downfall of one of their rival theme parks. Good Games Publishing has been so kind as to create these fantastic promos for their hit game, Unfair!\n        It all started with the BoardGameGeek.com microbadge war between The Secret Cabal and The Dice Tower (which we won, of course) in which our good friend Bernard issued all the participants challenge coins. Then in 2015 we gave our first official Challenge Coin out at our GenCon meetup. Now they're back with the 2017 edition!\nWe've wanted to make lapel pins for years, and we're finally doing it as a reward in this fundraiser! There are two versions that are available, our logo 'War Cobra' and the 'Agents of the Cabal' insignia. These are a must-have for the true Cabalist to brandish to show their support!\nBumper stickers are cool. I put them on my car and on my miniatures carrying case. We also have a Cabalist Badge ribbon at every convention, and now you can get yours as part of the fundraiser. Be ready to show everyone your support of the Cabal!\nThe dinner will be hosted by Stephen Buonocore and the brewmaster. We will first take a tour of the brewing facilities and then come back to a table to have dinner together. All attendees will also receive the limited edition GenCon Block Party glass.\n    Every year, at both GenCon in Indianapolis and Origins Game Fair in Columbus, The Secret Cabal Gaming Podcast hosts an enormous, come-one-come-all, blowout party. This party includes Cabalists, media creators, designers and publishers alike coming together to blow off some steam at the best gaming conventions in the US.\nAt each party we have a humongous games raffle with hundreds of games to be given out and a swag bag with all kinds of goodies inside!\nWith this Kickstarter we can make those meetups better than they've ever been, add more and cooler swag in those goodie sacks and generally upgrade the experience for attendees.\nWhether you back the Kickstarter or not, you're 100% welcome to come and hang with the Founders and friends.\nOrigins Meetup: Friday June 16th at 8pm\nGordon Biersch Brewery 401 N Front St #120 Columbus, OH 43215\nGenCon Meetup: Saturday August 19th at 8pm\nTow Yard Brewing 501 Madison Ave Indianapolis, IN 46225\nCheck out the video from our Gen Con meetup in 2016. We held it at the Alexander Hotel and had over 500 people in attendance.\n \nWHAT ABOUT SHIPPING?\nSo shipping is the hardest thing to determine for these projects. You have to figure for everyone around the world so you can be inclusive. To minimize our risk in all of this we have added shipping costs to each backer level that receive physical rewards.\nUS Shipping: $5\nCanadian Shipping: $12\nEverywhere Else: $15\nI really hope that you all understand why we're instituting these shipping costs on top of the standard pledge level. Too many projects have been ruined by shipping and I (Jamie) have to minimize my risk as much as possible with this endeavor.\nNOTE ABOUT BACKER LIMITS: So you may notice that there are actually limits on a the backer levels. The reason this is is that the reward promos are donated by publishers and they only have the ability to provide a certain number of them to us - roughly 2000. We cant exceed those limits. So we have those limits imposed on all the levels that receive promos. If by some strange and amazing circumstance we completely run out of the 2000ish promos during this campaign, will will continue with backer levels sans-promos. It's a good problem to have I suppose.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nReally the only risk involved with any of this are your normal every day risks of life.

The game will be widely available in retail this August/September, so you can pick it up there!\nIt's time to join the adventure! Whether you are a veteran mercenary or this is your first foray into the wilds of Gloomhaven, I am happy to have you on board.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge to receive a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven, complete with new health and experience trackers and a revised rule book and scenario book. Your game will come with miniatures for all the character classes, but you can also purchase extra sets of miniatures and standees.\nIf you already own the game, you can pledge to receive just the upgraded trackers and revised books. In addition, there is also an all-new mini expansion of 17 solo scenarios available.\n If you want to learn how to play Gloomhaven, these two Gaming Rules! videos are all you need.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards to determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nPhoto courtesy of Jinha Yoon\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time, this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up, which will also give them access to more powerful, higher level ability cards.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase useful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nAs players interact with the town through events and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing personal quests. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter, and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like to learn more about the game play, you can find a PDF of the rule book here, or you can watch another overview video:\nOr a game play video:\nAre you ready to start the adventure? Becausewe have started a community-driven expedition that I would love you to participate in.\nJust head on over to the first update to find out what it is all about and join in on the adventure. You won't regret it!\nIf you don't have the physical game in front of you, that's not a problem. There are still plenty of ways to participate. If you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, each scenario in the community-driven campaign is available as a separate workshop file. (Scenario 1) (Scenario 2) (Scenario 3) (Scenario 4) (Scenario 5) (Scenario 6) (Scenario 7) (Scenario 8) (Scenario 9)\nOr you can follow along and watch as the following groups play through the scenarios every third day.\nMike Bennett's YouTube stream is scheduled for 3pm EDT (19:00 GMT).\nAlucard's Twitch stream is scheduled for 7pm EDT (23:00 GMT).\nIf you're just joining us and want to get caught up on the story, you can find everything you need to know here.\nEither way, the important thing is that, when you are ready, I want you to vote on what happens next. This campaign is being run by and for you, and I'm just excited to see where it goes!\nBut the extra adventures don't end when the Kickstarter ends! Starting in November of this year, after everyone has had time to receive their games and enjoy them for a while, we will starting a brand new community driven expedition.\nThe number of scenarios in the new expedition will be directly tied to this Kickstarter's funding goal. Every $100,000 past $2 million will add a new scenario to the expedition. It's going to be huge!\n\n\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board. Becoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps: \\\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nImmediately after I was finished working on Gloomhaven, I realized I wasn't done with the world. I wanted to make a set of scenarios specifically designed for strategic solo play - scenarios that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each class and force players to really get under the hood and learn to play each class masterfully.\nPDFs of these scenarios and the accompanying item rewards are already available online, but now you can pledge $10 to receive a printed version. This includes a 24-page scenario book of 17 all-new solo scenarios and a deck of 17 item cards - rewards for completing each of the missions.\nThe solo scenarios are not included in the base box, but you can add $10 to you pledge to receive them in addition.\nStrictly for those who already own the game, we are offering four health and experience trackers and revised rule and scenario books. These are already included in the reprint pledge, but are upgrades from the original version.\nYou can get the four dials for $7, the upgraded books for $15, and if you'd like the solo scenarios as well, you can bundle all three offers for $25.\nPDFs of the new rule book and scenario book are also available online.\nAnd if you are interested, you can order some cool third-party stuff like removable stickers from Sinister Fish Games and a nice wooden insert from Meeple Realty.\nThe second printing of Gloomhaven comes with a full set of miniatures for each of the 17 character classes. These add-ons are not needed, but if, for whatever reason, you want additional sets of miniatures or standees, you can add $20 to your pledge for additional sets of minis and $5 for additional sets of standees.\nBe forewarned that while the miniatures box comes spoiler-free, the standees will be delivered as a single bare punch-board and may ruin the surprise of some of the unlocked character images.\nGloomhaven is a big, heavy game, so you will need to pay shipping on every copy that you order. The good news is that the cost of shipping to the US is already included and subsidized elsewhere. The price for shipping in other regions per game box is listed in the first column.\nThe second column is the price of shipping when ordering up to six other items (this includes sets of HP/XP dials, the book upgrades, the solo scenarios, sets of miniatures, or sets of standees). The upgrade combo pack is considered three items. If you pledge for more than six items, you will need to pay the second column shipping price again.\nThere's more good news, though. If you order a copy of Gloomhaven and want to add to your pledge the solo scenarios and/or a set of standees, those items are small enough to fit into the game's shipping box, so you won't have to pay any additional shipping on them - just the one shipping price for the main box itself.\nAll of these shipping costs are added automatically when you pledge, but if you add more onto you pledge for additional items, you will have to add the additional shipping costs yourself.\nUnfortunately, I made some mistakes when setting up the initial pledge levels. If you live in the following countries, please use the alternate pledge levels (labeled DE and SG) to get the correct shipping price: Germany, Singapore, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Sorry for the confusion!\nPlease note! Shipping is US, Canada, China, and EU-friendly! You will not have to pay customs if you are in these regions.\nWhile pledging $1 won't get your name into every copy of Gloomhaven, it will get you into my personal copy of Gloomhaven.\nThat's right, I am going to take a sharpie to as many of my components as necessary to commemorate the names of everyone who pledges $1 or adds $1 to their pledge. Not only that, but I'll shoot a video of the whole sordid, game-defacing thing.

The goal is to create thematic gameplay with a limited and known card base.\nThe future of Sigil: Powers of War (if you all are willing and kind enough to support us) is NOT to become a collectible card game where the player with more valuable cards is more likely to win. Instead our goal is to become a game of deep thematic strategy where all players are equal on a level of custom deck construction but easily accessible for new players and all types of gamers. With this in mind every expansion for Sigil will be thematically based and feature two opposing factions with included cards listed. (i.e. Elves vs Goblins, Dragons vs Angels, etc.)\nPlease check out the full rulebook below and see how Sigil: Powers of War blends the movement and dice combat system of popular miniatures games with the turn structure and familiar mechanics of a collectible card game to create something new, unique, and almost impossible to predict. *Base Game comes with 4 decks for 4 players but it is expandable up to 6 with the expansions. \n  Each player selects a faction Sigil and a Warlord to fight for their Sigil. Each Warlord is represented on the board by a matching standee.\n  Using their powerful Warlord and a pre-built custom deck of cards, players can play powerful spells, stunt their opponent with crippling auras, and summon units to fight for their Sigil.\n  Players advance their frontline by placing mana generators adjacent to their Warlord allowing them to generate more mana per turn and spawn units at these generators. This creates a strategic tug of war between the players.\n  The units on the board engage in combat resolved by dice rolls based on each unit's attributes and abilities. Only when a player has destroyed their opponent's Sigil may they glory in the triumph of Victory.\n  Example Summon Card & Mana Generator\nAll pledges must be made in full by April 18th at 9:59 pm CST.

The game is inspired by the classic novel Dune, written by Frank Herbert. Players represent factions vying for control of an interstellar empire. Both bold play and subtlety will be needed to navigate the \"wheels within wheels\" intrigue of this homage to Herbert's universe.\nPlayers draft Assassins, Diplomats, Legions, and other cards belonging to their faction or their opponents'. Then, players take turns dispatching these cards face down to the Planets, revealing key pieces of information when they do so. \nPlayers must successfully navigate this tangled web of limited information to succeed. Solstice has been in development since November of 2015. Now, it's ready for someone like you to play it!\n\"Solstice taps straight into my love of blind-bid and bluffing games, with smoothly asymmetrical factions and plenty of options for both strategic and tactical surprises.

It\u2019s a great and profitable scheme, but be careful: When the authorities find out and cancel the program, you might get more than you bargained for... \nThe historical anecdote that inspired this game is known among economists as the \u201cCobra Effect,\" referring to a solution to a problem that backfires spectacularly and actually makes things worse.\nCobras is a trick-taking game for 1-5 players where knowing when to win a trick is key to winning. Players must lose tricks to collect cobras, then win a trick to exchange them for points. Timing things just right is the game's core challenge, and if you push your luck too far, you might get bit!\nEach trick, the losing players divvy up the cobras shown on the cards played that trick and place cobra tokens on their basket. The winning player empties their basket for points, according to a scale that rewards more points for more cobras\u2014then drops off steeply if you've pushed your luck too far!\nCobras also features a King Cobra card that allows players to either share the win or share the loss for one trick each hand. Use it wisely!\nOf special note, Cobras is a rarity among trick-taking games in that it comes with a one-player mode for solo gaming. Check out the rulebook and print-and-play file to find out more.\n  52 cards (4 suits of 13) \n5 King Cobra cards \n5 Basket cards \n42 Cobra tokens\n5 Scoring cards with scoring rings\n1 Solo token\nRules\nCobras will have a suggested retail price of $20, so our Kickstarter backers will receive a 20% discount. \nAlso, every Kickstarter backer will receive $3 off their shipping charge!

A US quarter is just under 1\" (24 mm)\nThe design for the 1 Player Guild's coin was a collaborative effort discussed on the guild's forums and the design for the front of the coin was created by one of our own guild members.\nSample image of coin\nThe back of the coin was put together to show a few of the various aspects of the guild.  The top quadrant shows the logo for the 1 Player podcast.  The guild was started as a place for listeners of the podcast to talk about the show and solitaire gaming in general. However, the guild has outgrown the podcast and not all members listen to the podcast or may even be aware of this connection.\nThe left side of the back has the letters SGoYT.  This stands for Solitaire Games on Your Table.  On BGG, there is a geeklist based thread (SGoYT) in which folks discuss what games they are playing every month.  The monthly thread is a great way to learn about games that support solitaire play and what folks think of them.  It is arguably the heart of the 1 Player guild.  The current months list can be found here.\nThe right side shows Challenge Accepted.  Another popular aspect of the guild is the lively challenges that pop up all the time.  In these challenges, folks are able to compete against each other in various solitaire games, usually trying to get the highest score.  The challenges are a fun way to interact with others and \"game alone together\".\nFinally, the bottom quadrant shows the dates the guild was founded.\nA unique feature of this coin it that it is being made with a 3D die on the front face.  The die image should actually stick out above the surface of the coin.  What makes this neat, if it works, is that you'l be able to use the die as a spinner.  The back of the coin features a bright yellow arrow which will be the pointer.  Check out the inspiration for this spinner...\nPLAY\n\nAs mentioned this is the 1st annual 1 Player Guild coin.  If the Kickstarter is a success, future coins are sure to be made.  Each annual coin will have a distinct design.  It is probable that future coins will not have the 3D die effect and will not work as a spinner.  However, I reserve the right not to do this again if the task turns out to be overly challenging.\nBut wait!  There's more...\nThat's right.. there aren't just coins.  We are also making dice!  Well, Chessex is making us dice.  Either way, you can get 16mm dice with a variant of the 1 Player Guild logo.  The actual logo can't be made on a die because of the small size of a die and fine detail of the logo.\nHere's a sample die that Chessex created.\n You have a total of four color choices which you can mix and match as you like.\nOpaque Black / White\nScarab Scarlet / Gold\nGemini Black-Purple / Gold\nVortex Teal / Gold\nSo what is all this going to set me back?\nThe price of the coins is as reasonable as I can make it.  My intent is not to turn a profit, but because I can't predict all the costs well, I do have to pad the price a tiny bit.\nThe 1st coin is $7.00.  I was going to make it 6.75, but KS doesn't let me.  So I rounded to $7.00 and made the shipping cost lower.  It all balances out.\nEach additional coin is $6.75.  Dice are $0.75 each.\nYou can refer to the handy price chart below to figure out how much you want to back for.\nPrice chart. Just add up the costs based on how many you want.\nUS Shipping\nThe shipping cost is in addition to the pledge level, but it is relatively reasonable.  For US shipping, the cost will be $3.00 for a small pacakge.  See the chart below for what you can fit in a small package.\nFlat Rate Domestic Shipping Quantities\nInternational Shipping\nInternational shipping is more expensive and currently $13.50 for a small package.  International shipping has a similar cost structure, but the number of items that can be included is a bit lower.\nFlat Rate International Shipping Quantities\nLarge Quantities\nIf for whatever reason you want more items than the numbers mentioned above.  Let me know and I can make an appropriate pledge level  with the correct shipping costs.  Bulk orders, especially for international backers are welcome and encouraged if it will help reduce costs for you.\nSpecial Thanks\nI would like to give special thanks to A.J. Porfirio and Van Ryder Games.  Their support has helped keep the cost of the coins low.  Check out their fine games including their current games Tessen (BGG, VRG) and the award winning Hostage Negotiator (BGG, VRG), as well as the upcoming Kickstarted games Salvation Road (BGG) & Saloon Tycoon (BGG).\nwww.VanRyderGames.com", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest concerns with this project is that there is a strong emphasis on keeping the cost down over making a financial profit. I have carefully calculated costs, including shipping, but unforeseen issues could impact my ability to ship in a timely manner.\n\nI have never tried to purchase challenge coins in bulk, but there are quite a few vendors of such coins and production is not complex. The 1 possible issue is that the ability to use the coin as a spinner is untested and a final product may not spin well. However, that will not keep it from being an attractive keepsake.\n\nI have worked with the dice manufacturer on previous occasions and do not foresee any issues with those getting made.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #22", "update_userinfo": "All Kickstarter rewards have shipped!", "update_content": "Shipping Complete\nI am happy to say that I have now sent out every KS package I expect to send.

Please make sure to follow our progress in the updates. \nVillages of Valeria is a village-building card game in which players establish resources, construct buildings, and attract adventurers to become the next capital city of Valeria. Take on the role of a Duke in the vast and beautiful kingdom of Valeria and, on your turn, lead the table by selecting an Action - Harvest, Develop, Build, Recruit, or Tax - for everyone to perform while you get a slight advantage for being the Active Player.\nVillages of Valeria is a stand alone game set in the world of Valeria and takes place just before the hordes of monsters invade the kingdom in Valeria: Card Kingdoms. \nUpdated Once Per Day - ~6000 Deluxe Copies Pledged and climbing!\nIn Villages of Valeria, 1 to 5 players compete to build the best village in the kingdom in about 45-60 minutes.\nCard Anatomy\nThere are two main cards in Villages of Valeria: Building cards and Adventurer cards. \nSurprising strategic decisions with just 2 types of cards!\nBuilding Cards can be used in two different ways: \nYou can pay the Resources listed on the left to build the Building and use its power during the game. \nYou can Develop it as a Resource by flipping it upside down and placing it under your Castle. \nAdventurer cards are attracted to your village by certain Building types listed on the left of the card. Pay Gold to add them to your village to use their power or reap Victory Points at the end of the game. \nGame Flow\nThe game is played over several rounds where players take turns being the Active Player. The Active Player chooses an Action and, in turn order, all other players may follow and do the same Action but at a slight disadvantage.  \nActions\nHARVEST: Draw 3 Cards. \n   Follow: Draw 1 Card. \nDEVELOP: Discard 1 card to add a Card to your Castle as a Resource.\n   Follow: You may discard 2 cards to add a Card to your Castle as a Resource. \nBUILD: Place Gold on Resources to add a building to your village and draw 1 card.\n   Follow: You may place Gold on Resources to add a building to your village. \nRECRUIT: Pay 1 Gold to add an Adventurer to your village.    Follow: Pay 2 Gold to add an Adventurer to your village. \nTAX: Collect 1 Gold and draw 1 Card.\n   Follow: None.\nVictory!\nThe game ends after the turn in which any player's Village contains the target number of Buildings and/or Adventurers. This can happen either because the Active Player has built a Building or recruited an Adventurer, or because another player following the action has done so. The entire Action is played out, so even if the Active Player has triggered the end of the game, all other players still get a chance to follow the Action and add to their own Villages.\nCount up your Victory Points and see who's village will become the next capital city of Valeria!\nWatch the play through video by Rahdo Runs Through: \nUpdated with Unlocked Stretch Goals.\n Game Contents \n72 Building Cards \n10 Adventurer Cards \n5 Castle Cards \n5 Player Reference Cards \n30 Screen Printed Wood Gold Coins\n1 Screen Printed Wood Active Player Token \n1 Rulebook \n1 Beautifully Illustrated Box \nAdded to Game via Stretch Goals Thanks to Our Backers\n1 Cleric Adventurer Card\n1 Warlord Adventurer Card\n1 Blacksmith Adventurer Card\n1 Rogue Adventurer Card\n1 Summoner Adventurer Card\n1 Necromancer Adventurer Card\n3 Fountain Building Cards\n3 Tannery Building Cards\n3 Forger's Den Building Cards\n3 Archery Range Building Cards\n1 Solo Variant Reference Card\n1 Action-Selection Card\nAll card will be 320gsm Blackcore stock with a Linen Finish thanks to our backers!

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": " Part 1\n Part 2\n Part 3\n*Feel free to skip this section if you are a previous CTG game owner. \nMore than a few of you are SHOCKED as you search in vain for what you guessed would be a $50-65 base backer level only to find out things start at $98! Allow us to build some appreciation for the VALUE found in this $98 backer level. \nFirst, a little about Chip Theory Games. If you are actually reading this than you are probably fairly new to our games. Those that have backed us before, own something in our Hoplo series, or have played our games at conventions, automatically understand what's up. So first, let us give you a chance to hear from some of those people who, like you, may wince at the $98 price tag but also know its worth every penny. Check them out here.    \nIf that didn't convince you, lets take a look at what is actually in this game. \n5 Die-cut Neoprene Play mats - Some may think neoprene is all the same...those \"some\" would be very wrong. Print quality, fabric type, neoprene composition, and thickness can all make or break the outcome. Print quality is an obvious one due to the fact that poor quality on neoprene results in dark, muddy images. Fabric type wasn't so important for Hoplo but is extremely important for Bones because you have dice rubbing on the fabric edges every time you lock or use a die. Composition is what determines elasticity and will help keep the dice in place. So what is a good, 10\" x 9\" die-cut mat worth? $10? $12? X5?\n34 11.5g Unit chips and 65 Health chips - Neoprene and chips go together like bread and butter. This duo is what makes CTG special. Each chip has a weight plug set inside it to give it that substantial feel. The sticker is actually a 2-part foil and hard plastic overlay that makes the images pop yet protects it from water drops or spills (if you want to see a funny video series on our Hoplo mats - check it out here). Our health chips are lighter and are all one mold imprinted with our logo. Much more elaborate in comparison to other game tokens. All your Baddie stats are right there on the chip. Value? Tons!\n83 Game Cards (Encounters, Loot, Troves, Bosses) - Even now as I list all of this I feel the need to go back and make sure we factored certain things into our game price! ;) Cards are a new one for us but you can be sure we won't disappoint! \n130 Custom-sided Dice (100+ unique) - I feel like this kind of speaks for itself, but in case it doesn't, then here are a few things to  keep in mind. Dice size, imaging process, and cornering/tumbling process can all affect the quality outcome. We have an insane amount of dice art that includes very small numbers and multiple colors. The need for a quality process that can give us all of these things, can really affect the price of these dice! \nEverything else - I'll spare you the rest of the details on our box, our dice tray molds, high-quality rulebook printing, etc. But just ask a Hoplo owner and they will confirm that we try to think of everything including what else might go in the box, what trays could be used outside the box and so on. \nOk, our VALUE pitch is over! :) If you are still not convinced, its ok! Thank you for getting this far and for checking out the campaign to begin with. For those who remain...we aim to impress and dare not disappoint! \nToo Many Bones is a 1-4 player Solo/Co-op RPG Adventure using dice to shape and implement your battle strategies. Game length is decided by the Boss tyrant you choose to confront and can range from 60-90 mins.\nSample Boss Card\nYou start your journey as a Gearloc in the town of Obendar, fighting one battle a day as you progress north toward the tyrant you are trying to take out. The goal is earn enough Progress points by completing Encounters/Daily Battles to reach the Boss Tyrant and trigger the final battle. You must achieve this within a set number of days shown on that tyrant. \nEach day provides you with a new Encounter that will affect your next battle. Based on what you choose, you may gain very specific rewards or you may have to forfeit them to allow your party a better chance of success. Every Encounter card and the choices within can change from one game to the next due to how enemies are introduced into your battles. \nSample Encounter 1\nSample Encounter 2\nSample Encounter 3\nBattles scale with your day counter and party size and is where all the action happens! A battle consists of determining and drawing enemies based on your total Baddie Strength. Your party then faces off against these opponents in an awesome dice-rolling battle! For example, if your party size is 2 and it is day 4, you multiply those together to get your Baddie Strength for that day's battle. However, before drawing those enemies, you must also check to see if your Encounter card alters those points. If not, you would be drawing, a 5-point Baddie, and 3 1-point Baddies. \nIf your total ends up filling more than 4 slots, the other Baddies are staged next to the Battle mat and fill empty spots immediately (but start at 1 initiative).\n8 Baddie Strength Points\nBattle Mat with Initiative Meter \nUsing your neoprene Character Mats and your unlocked stat and skills, you will decide which attack, defense, and skill dice to roll each round. Based on those rolls, you will then execute attacks, perform blocks, utilize your backup plan, or save dice for the next round.\nBoomer's Character Mat with unlocked Skill Dice\nCharacter Skill Dice (16 skill dice and 1 initiative die)\nBasic Defense Dice\n*The Attack and Defense dice shown in the full component list as well as our videos are prototype. The actual Atk and Def dice will have different color backgrounds so you can quickly tell them apart. This is true of both our White dice (for the Gearlocs) and Black dice (for the Baddies).   \nCharacter Skill Dice\nWhen the dust settles and you are on top, you will gain progress points, increase your stat and skill trees, and often you are able to loot your enemies to better equip yourselves for your next encounter.\nAs you continue to complete encounters, your skill dice pool grows and eventually you will have earned enough Encounter points to trigger the Boss Tyrant battle! Defeating him will win you the game! \n Find out more about our Award-winning Hoplo Series HERE!\nSo how do our Add-ons work? Just total up the items you would like to add and tack that amount on to your pledge for now. We will clarify everything in the survey after the campaign ends! *NOTE: Tink and Ghillie are both included in the BONES - FULL PARTY pledge level. Also, in order to pledge for Add-ons, you need to be pledging for the game itself.\nAdd-on Shipping: Each Add-on increases the weight and cost to ship (we also must pay an extra fee for each SKU we add to an order). We have set the shipping cost at $2 per Add-on. However, to encourage Add-on purchases AND to give people a further break on shipping, Adam and I are willing to subsidize (fully cover) the extra shipping for Add-ons if you order 3 or more. There are a total of 5 Add-ons you can choose from below (not counting Tink or Ghillie). *The BONES - FULL PARTY level already grants a discount for Tink and Ghillie and are not considered \"Add-ons\" at the FULL PARTY level.\nNote on Premium Health - this is added to your game. You will still receive the original 65 logo-molded health chips. \nNote on the Liberation Logbook: Some of the details are still being worked out with this book since we want it to contain images of every one of our Baddies, Tyrants, and Gearlocs! Because this number is growing quickly...the book is getting more and more expen...valuable! :) The cost will stay at $25 but the details on printing material, binding, etc, need to be left open-ended due to these constant changes. \nHere is what we know for sure each book will contain: \nArtwork in various sizes of all completed Baddies and Tyrants (like you see in the example).\nArtwork and concept/development art for all 7 Gearlocs (like you see in the example above). \nA series of 7 (but probably more) short stories from the perspective of our Gearlocs, while on their adventure to the north. \nSignatures from both Jim (writer), Anthony (artist), as well as Adam and myself.\nBeyond that, our intention was to give this a very loose feel, as if they were page singles written in haste, constantly gathered, and transported in a binder of sorts. This part we cannot commit to just yet. We need to see what comes of how much art and story we are fitting in this thing! I'm sure you understand! \nNote on the Adventure Map: There are 2 counters to this mat. The first is a glass bead that comes with the mat. This follows the paths on your map to track progress. The other counter is the Day Counter Chip (at 200k funding). This chip fits easily into the die-cut area in the bottom right corner of your map and tracks your days. \nWhen you draw a Tyrant and set it next to the mat, this card will show the days and progress this adventure must be completed in. This will correspond with one of the 3 destinations on the map (each destination is a set amount of progress points away from Obendar and our Tyrants all adhere to one of those amounts). So, for instance, The Goblin King is an 8 progress Tyrant, which means he has taken up residence at Warspire. This location is on the map at 8 progress points from Obendar and is now your destination for this adventure. \nAll 3 locations must cross the Sibron river which is reached at 3 Encounters into any adventure. The map shows this very clearly and is a nice visual reminder that battles are now going to get harder. \nAlso, this mat makes Extended Campaigns much easier. An Extended Campaign is one where you attempt to clear not just one region but two or three! Once you complete your first location, it will grant you X progress to your second destination and you must backtrack to a split that will take you further north. An extended campaign can easily be done without this map, its just not quite as immersive.\nTo be clear, this map is not necessary to play TMB. Drawing the Tyrant card and step-stacking completed Encounter cards showing earned progress underneath - works great. That being said, this map really gives you a FEEL for where you are headed and helps you visualize the encounters you are facing and where they are happening within the story.  \nGhillie is included in the BONES - FULL PARTY pledge!\nTink is included in the BONES - FULL PARTY pledge!\n***Ricky's Preview moved near the top***\nOther Videos\nBoomer - 1-Turn Overview\nPatches - 1-Turn Overview\nMat Grip Test \n Tray Sample (Add-on) - Rolling\nIn Too Many Bones, you are playing as an unusual race of adventurers headed into a land overrun by all sorts of hostile creatures. Your race has lived hidden in the Deepwood for centuries and only recently, your kin have been forced to emerge to the south and take shelter within the walls of Obendar. \nDue to your reclusive lifestyle, many in town are encountering your race for the very first time. Some in town believe you to be an elf, due to your distinct facial features; others, would say a goblin, from your size and build. Others still, would insist your high technological aptitude proves you a gnome! Only those most intimate with the Deepwood, know your true kind and kin as: Gearlocs. Big-eared, thin-bodied creatures with a conflicting love of nature and machine, and overall, an insatiable thirst for adventure! \nThe elder Gearlocs, know all too well that this growing danger to the north is the work of the Ebon, a melting pot of lawless creatures ruled by tyrants, each with a firm grasp on all the northern regions of Daelore. Because each of these regions has little to no communication with the next, it is the elders belief that a smaller party will be most effective and will draw the least attention. They have selected your party of adventurers and have tasked them with venturing northward to silence the Ebon one tyrant at a time. \nThis was never to be your task alone! Others were sequestered, but the Obendar militia is thin in ranks and any sellswords worth hiring, have already been swayed by the promise of plundering rights to aid the enemy. But no matter! For you are Gearlocs! And being the resourceful and fearless race that you are, your party has happily accepted this adventure! You will be among the first to travel north in many decades and your adventure begins today!\nWhy is International shipping so much!?\nMany of you may be shocked by our international shipping costs for the project (especially those who are new to our heavy CTG projects). First of all, this is par for the course when shipping 11.5 gram chips, thick neoprene mats, and 130 (currently) custom dice! As we have mentioned, this box is over 8 lbs! If you reference our last project and scroll to the bottom, we posted a shipping breakdown. Hoplo: Origins is about half the weight of Bones and you can see that as the rest of our lineup is added, prices go up significantly. Its the nature of the beast with shipping heavy boxes. After all of that, we still took a hit on shipping internationally!\nThe HUGE difference is that in our Origins campaign, international backers were getting hit hard by VAT/Customs fees on top of our shipping rates. Our goal for this project was to wipe those out by covering the VAT fees ourselves for EU and Canada through bulk shipments to those countries. \nBecause its our first time dealing with EU and Canada-Friendly shipping, the \"Friendly\" part is strictly a savings on those customs and VAT fees. We are continually getting quotes and trying to reduce international shipping FURTHER for our backers.\nHow can your shipping be considered EU and Canada \"Friendly\"?\nAs stated earlier, EU and Canada Friendly means the products are shipped to you directly from those countries. It doesn't mean shipping is automatically free or greatly discounted (though those things often accompany such a claim). What it DOES mean: What you pay for shipping now, is it. There is nothing tacked on later, no hidden extra fees. *Handling things up front also means that we are using those shipping fees paid to increase our total pledge amount - thus getting to Stretch Rewards for you significantly faster. \nCovering the customs and VAT fees is a major step for us. Adam and I have spent a lot of time getting our feet wet in this area and it was a big decision to go this route at all as it means securing international fulfillment and bulk transport when up to this point Adam and I have been rolling up our sleeves and relying primarily on each other to make all of this magic happen. Don't get me wrong, we are not slouches! Hoplo is proof of that! But with all your support, you are helping CTG grow up! This is one of the growing pains. So while we'd love to subsidize huge amounts of the shipping like projects that have 1000+ backers...please understand our best project had 333. It makes these types of deals a bit more tricky/costly to work though.\nYou are buying a PREMIUM GAME from us. For $100+ it sure as heck better be! So besides trying to add another layer of QC, there are components slated for this game that are done locally along with much of the game assembly, thus making it virtually impossible to ship these to their destinations directly from Asia. This is still being worked through and obviously we hope to improve on things. \nSo, given those constraints, our goals remain: 1) We wipe out VAT and customs fees - done. 2) We drop the game cost as low as we possibly can ($120 MRSP for $98 on KS) - done. 3) We quote and requote as many International shipping options as we can, using people and campaigns that have done it successfully in the past (not just appearing to have done it by subsidizing a ton and losing their shirts)! And hopefully, by the end of the campaign, we can improve on the posted rates. But if we can't, at least you will know why. \nAnyone can \"offer\" free or greatly reduced shipping. But you know its not...\"free\"...someone is paying for it. You will often find it worked right back into the cost of the game itself or tacked on later. If it is actually free or discounted to YOU, then the margin or backer count on that game must be quite impressive. Sadly, with our commitment to no less than the best components, that impressive margin doesn't exist for us. We are ok with that as long as we can show that quality to our backers and produce amazing games in the process.\nTo those who feel shipping is still too much of a hurdle, we completely understand! Hopefully you can get in on things after we have some inventory established internationally (another great benefit of going the \"Friendly\" route for us = excess inventory already staged in those countries after KS fulfillment). \nThanks for all the feedback thus far! We WILL update everyone before the campaign ends if there are any changes or reductions! \nGet your Backer Badge!\n Join us on Facebook and BGG!\nIt's time to get this FAQ going (thanks for the push Michael)!

We plan to add value by upgrading some components and increasing replayability with added game content.\nWe have several stretch goals in mind and we hope to hit them all! But know that just as with our previous campaigns, we won't likely be adding more just to add more. We believe that more isn't always better, especially if it holds up production and delays delivery. \nThat being said, we'll be listening closely to your feedback and ideas and will carefully consider all the ideas that comes our way.\nSee Update #2 for more info!\nSee Update #6 for more info!\nSee update #7 for info!\n If you've checked out the videos and read the reviews and still want more info, you can check out the First Edition Rules PDF RIGHT HERE! The rules are currently being edited and reformatted for clarity and to match the updated graphic design.\nThe rules are hosted on BoardGameGeek and will require a free account to download. But if you like games, BGG is the place to be so head over there now to get plugged into the world-wide gaming community!\nOkay, so there isn't actually a print and play version of Wok on Fire available. Making a homemade version of the game on paper or cardstock in card sleeves just doesn't cut it. We don't want to provide a version of the game that won't play as well as the real deal! You need real cards with some real snap! \nBut we do understand that some folks like to try the game before they buy the game. So check out this video I made of a little game called \"Schlock on Fire\" that uses a standard deck of playing cards. Have some fun flipping and chopping to get a feel for the basic concepts of Wok on Fire. Give it a try and come back and lend your support to the campaign!\nWok On Fire is available world-wide and all copies will ship from within the US! International Shipping fees will be added to your pledge level when you select your home location. \nAdded Shipping: US-Free!, Canada-$6, Everywhere Else-$15\nNote: International Backers will be responsible for any import fees, brokerage or delivery surcharges, or applicable taxes that may be levied after we have shipped your package. However, this campaign is CUSTOMS FRIENDLY. The low price point and small box for this game should not cause any customs fees for backers pledging for 1-2 copies. We have learned that shipping is a costly endeavor, especially with the recent rate increase in the US Postal Service,  and we must try to keep our costs as low as possible to keep our games at an appropriate price point for when they hit retail. We are saying THANK YOU to our early adopters on Kickstarter by offering the game at MSRP while covering the first $5 of shipping costs for all backers. We'll also be adding some extra content at no extra charge (when we reach STRETCH GOALS, of course).\nPoki Chen is a game designer from Taiwan. He is a member of the Taiwan Board Game Design Group. He is also the illustrator of all of the adorable foods in Wok on Fire. \nAdam McIver is a gamer, artist, and game designer living in Cincinnati. His art and graphic design can be seen in projects from Crash Games, Dice Hate Me Games, Eagle-Gryphon Games, Tasty Minstrel Games, and more. Adam also lent his graphic design and illustration skills to Green Couch Games' Best Treehouse Ever and Avalanche at Yeti Mountain. In 2014, Adam launched into the gaming industry full time with his new company, The Cre8tive Dept. Poki made all the cute illustrations and Adam updated all of the graphic design for Green Couch Games' edition of Wok on Fire. \n Green Couch Games is a new company founded by Jason Kotarski to release great little games that make great big connections like our first few titles Fidelitas, Best Treehouse Ever, JurassAttack!, and Avalanche at Yeti Mountain. Jason is also a game designer and co-host of 20 Minutes of Filler, a Dice Tower Network podcast.  \nWe know that you have lots of games to choose from and there aren't enough ways that we can express our gratitude to all of our supporters. It's backers like you that are helping to make this new company a reality. It's backers like you that are bringing this dream to life. And for that, we say thanks.

And so far I have been able to avoid delays (I'm 3 for 3 delivering projects ON TIME with the 4th being loaded onto a boat with plenty of time to spare) and common pitfalls by paying special attention to the following areas and building on previous experience:\n\nArt and Design. The art and design for the game is nearly complete so we'll be ready to print shortly after the close of the campaign. I always like to show you I mean business by paying for the art and design upfront!\n\nPlaytesting and Reviewing. Wok on Fire has been tested by many different playtesters and even a bunch of game designers. I have sent a bunch of prototypes to a variety of reviewers. I want to earn your trust by providing you with a solid product that has been thoroughly tested and reviewed by folks from varying backgrounds and perspectives.\n\nPast Experience. This is the fifth Kickstarter project I've run for Green Couch Games and I have helped with several other successful campaigns. Also, having spent many years working in retail and customer service, I understand the importance of treating backers with respect and following through with projects.\n\nOf course, there are always unexpected circumstances that pop up, but I PROMISE to communicate every step of the way and do my best to use creative problem solving meet the challenges head on.\n\nThank you so much for giving Green Couch Games a chance. As a small company, I truly can't do this without you.

All players will roll their dice behind the screen and than make bids based on actions they wish take. The actions will control influence and position of the Cardinals in the Conclave.\nBribe - Move one of the Cardinal Mats to the very top or the very bottom of the ladder. A Cardinal has to be moved, so one at the top cannot \u201cmove\u201d to the top.\n Poison - Remove 2 Influence Token from a Cardinal Mat(s) and place them back in the influence pile. This may be 2 tokens from one Cardinal, or 1 token from two different Cardinals.\nJudgement - Move 2 Influence Tokens between Cardinal Mats. You may move 2 cubes from one Cardinal to another or 1 cube from two different Cardinals to two other Cardinals, BUT not a combination of both. However, a Cardinal who lost Influence during an action cannot regain Influence on that same action.\nAccusation - Accuse a Cardinal of being the \u201cAntipope.\u201d Place the Antipope Marker on a Cardinal Mat. This Cardinal cannot gain or lose Influence. However, they may still be moved in a \u201cBribe.\u201d\nRumor - Start a rumor about a player\u2019s motives. Place or move a Rumor card in front of another player. A player may only have one Rumor in front of them. If you place a Rumor in front of a character that already has one, return the old one to the center. A player may also never remove a Rumor in front of themselves, nor give themself a Rumor.\nPlay will continue in a clockwise direction until a bid is not accepted and dice are revealed. Once a die is lost by the player making the bid or the player that called the bluff, a pay out occurs.\nPlay will continue and the game will end when one player is out of dice. \nSocial Media Stretch Goal! \nIt is as easy as following Talon Strikes Studios on Twitter\n Funding Stretch Goals\n      More Stretch Goals will be released as they are unlocked!\n PDF of the rules Here.\nPlay through Video by Jason Hancock of PNCN.rocks\nFull Review by Hai Kulture Here\nFull Review by Moe Fantasci Here\nSpoke about House of Borgia in their BGGcon Wrap up Episode listen to it here (50:30)\n Check out the full podcast here\nPlease use one of the Social Media Badges here to show your support of our project.

Gamelyn Games brings years of experience to this project and has overseen all of our planning and arrangements to ensure House of Borgia will be delivered to all backers in a timely manner just like all of their previous projects. Every backer is important to us, regardless of location, just as much every pledge makes a difference, regardless of amount. Unfortunately shipping costs are something we all have to face, but that does not mean we cannot be transparent about this challenge and tackle it responsibly. The learning experiences Gamelyn Games has overcome with shipping have come to this campaign in full, and we aim to manage our (and your) risk in a responsible and professional manner.\nShipping costs are a very real factor. They can be volatile and are never trivial. Further, I do not feel that claiming to offer \"Free Shipping\" only to hide that very real & significant cost somewhere else is the best way of doing things and our backers deserve better. We have decided to offer affordable FLAT-RATE shipping to various regions, but at the same time offer CUSTOMS-FRIENDLY shipping available to ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD through our friends at Ship Naked to offer the best overall value we can for your pledge.  \nTalon Strikes Studios is a small publishing house in Surprise AZ, that is excited to bring new and interesting games to the board gaming community.

It is prone to many mistakes and that does not exclude experienced publishers.\n\nWe at Talon Strikes Studios are new to publishing, but not to the industry; and with Gamelyn Games as our publishing partner, we're proud to say that we are prepared for the task at hand and have years of experience in our corner with successful fulfillment of board game projects.\n\nHere are the steps we are taking to prepare and reduce the likelihood of mistakes and delays:\n\n1. We have done significant pre-production. This includes having all the art for the game completed and the graphic design completed. The production quote is in hand and ready to be initiated. All we need now is your pledges to make it happen!\n\n2. We are proud to be working with Panda Game Manufacturing, the same manufacturer Gamelyn Games has used to create all of their previous projects. Gamelyn Games and Talon Strikes Studios both have a great relationship with their team, we are very familiar with their production requirements, timelines, payment schedules, communication methods and Chinese freight arrangements. House of Borgia will fall right in line and should be produced with minimum delays and on time.\n\n3. Professional distribution is already in place, and we are proud to say it will be handled by Ship Naked. They have been responsible for the fulfillment of previous Gamelyn Games titles. All of which were delivered on schedule reliably and professionally. Ship Naked has proven to be communicative, punctual and customer service minded when dealing with Gamelyn Games' customers and they have extended the same level of service and expertise to Talon Strikes Studios publications as well.\n\nAgain, this isn't to say that this project is immune to the possible mishap, they can happen to anyone but we want to show that this road is familiar to all parties involved and we are confident in our ability to deliver our products to our backers and fans. Thank you for your confidence and support!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAbove all, We are 100% dedicated to backer communication. We will be transparent with our process, and involve our backers as much as possible.\n\nWe will be present daily during the project to answer any questions or read any comments and we will provide regular updates and supply photos of the progress when possible.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll Gamelyn Games projects have completed fulfillment successfully. Some backers even received their games and figures early!

The game funded, it was manufactured, and shipped to the backers within the promised timeframe specified on the campaign.  Since then, they have been working on two new releases, one being The Opulent, and another called Nawakwa.  They are a two-person team with the ability to design games all the way from the mechanics, to the graphic design / illustration.  They also created their own website, all the videos, and even their mobile convention booth and signage made out of wood (photo below).  They take pride in what they have accomplished as a two-person team, but of course, BLG could not be what it is today without the help and support of their fans and families though, especially their wives!  \n                                    ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe Opulent is a finished, polished game with all the digital print files ready to be sent to the printers as soon as the project is funded.

With that being said, we are working with a great manufacturing company that has shipped successful Kickstarter projects in the past and we have full confidence that we can deliver the game to you in time.

What's clear is, I am really looking forward to taking that journey.\u201d RICKY ROYAL - Box of Delights\n\u201cAs a child, I read and played every Fighting Fantasy book I could get my hands on. The child like grin on my face as I played 7th Continent reminded me of just how much fun it can be to disappear into the wonder of my own imagination. Absolutely the best solo game experience I have had in a long, long time, and possibly ever.\u201d LANCE MYXTER \u2013 Undead Viking\n\"There are many adventure game books in which you become a hero. But there is only one Table Top adventure game where you become a cursed, lost, survivalist hero.\" BARRY DOUBLET - Dice Tower\n\u201cThis will be my second Kickstarter (The first one wasn\u2019t really a KS, I just lent 100 bucks to a friend - Steve Jackson - in exchange for a box that doesn\u2019t fit on any shelving unit known to man).\u201d CROC \u2013 Space Cowboys\nPlay solo or in a team of up to 4 players,\nRelive the sensation of the adventure books where \u201cyou are the hero\u201d that thrilled so many of us in our childhood,\nNo dice rolls! Make difficult choices and face the consequences thanks to the game's innovative mechanics that determine success or failure!\n1000+ 8cmx8cm cards with hundreds of original artworks,\n1000+ minutes of thrilling adventure in a single game,\n30 seconds to set-up the game, 30 seconds to save it!\nJoin the expedition partway through if you missed the beginning of the adventure or died prematurely,\nLive a different adventure every time! There are dozens of random events and several alternatives for a single numbered card.\nThe game remembers your actions. If you kill a NPC, he will remain dead for the rest of the game and any option that you would have had by letting him live will be gone\u2026 forever!\n1907 - You, a famous explorer, have just returned from the first expedition to the seventh continent, a mysterious land that was recently discovered off the coast of Antarctica and probably the very last terra incognita in the world.\nYou are recovering from your adventure when, whilst reading the day\u2019s newspaper, you realise that several other members of the expedition have disappeared suddenly, for unknown reasons. Coincidentally, you have been lethargic for a few days, feeling feverish and finding it very hard to manage even simple tasks. You must face the facts: an evil is consuming you from within. Your body is wracked with convulsions as you contemplate what mysterious ailment is overtaking you.\nAt nightfall, you fall into a restless sleep without knowing that, for you, another adventure is about to begin.\nYou start each new game by choosing one of the characters available to you. Each one comes with his own set of Idea cards that represent his skills and personality (adventurer, herbalist, doctor, mercenary, etc.).\nFerdinand: a French explorer you can play and one of his special Idea cards.\n\u201cThe Voracious Goddess\u201d, \u201cThe Icy Maze\u201d, \u201cSwamp of Madness\u201d - Choose which curse (or curses!) has been put on you among those included in the base box (3) or those in the expansions (3).\nYour goal? Find out how to lift the curses you have chosen and then purge your soul of them. Each curse offers a very different adventure and will take you to different places. Obtain what cannot be reached, find that which is forever hidden, achieve what cannot be achieved, etc.\nDo you have what it takes?\nTwo of the curses you can attempt to lift.\nYou are now ready to begin your unexpected adventure. Similar to the books where \"you are the hero\u201d, you will explore the continent by putting numbered Terrain and Permanent event cards into play, which will gradually form the game board.\nForests, deserts, caves and mountains, you will visit dozens of different locations during your adventure and encounter random events that coincide with your location.\nA random event hidden by the \u201cfog of war\u201c.\nTo progress through the game, you will perform the actions available on the Terrain card you are standing on, the Event cards attached to it, the Character, Idea, State and Bonus cards in your hand and the Item cards in your inventory.\nSome actions you can perform along your journey.\nIn order to perform these actions, you will use the Action Deck that contains your ideas and abilities and serves as your life force. Every action makes you draw a certain number of cards from the Action Deck. These cards provide a variable amount of successes and you must obtain a specified number of them in order to succeed.\nFight action: draw 2 or more cards from the Action Deck to perform the action. Get 1 or more achievements to succeed.\nFailing at performing an action may have terrible consequences and cause you to get negative State cards, forcing you to discard cards from the Action Deck, therefore reducing your life force.\nFall off this peak and you will get injured.\nWant to stack the odds in your favour? You may choose to draw more cards from the Action Deck to get more achievements. However, every card in the Action Deck is a bit of your life force, so when the Action Deck is exhausted every action could be your last!\nThankfully, you may add Idea cards to your hand when performing actions. Your Bonus, Item cards, and the help from your companions will make things easier for you. Especially when it comes to decreasing the number of cards you must draw to perform an action or by increasing your chances of succeeding.\nThe right idea cards at the right time can make all the difference!\nThe 7th Continent is a strange land with many paranormal events, hostile creatures and inhospitable locations. You will have to use your best survival skills to live through the many threats you will face in this land, and eventually lift your curses.\nFind or craft items to help you make it through risky situations or access locations that would be unreachable without them.\nFind an empty can. Craft a club.\nFind food, by hunting or fishing, in order to get back some life force, returning Action cards from the discard pile to your Action deck.\nMake a fire and cook it, you\u2019ll find that you\u2019ll get even more cards back!\nLook carefully at your environment, it contains many clues and hidden numbers that can help you discover the Continent\u2019s secret locations.\nA page from your journal that allows you to use this plant when you see it on your Terrain card.\nBoost your Action Deck with Advanced idea cards you can gain by spending the precious Experience points you have earned by the sweat of your brow.\nBuy Advanced Idea cards thanks to your Experience points.\n And discover many other surprises along your journey!\nTo purchase an optional buy simply click on the \"manage my pledge\" button in the top right hand corner of the Kickstarter page.

And one of us happens to be pretty handy with a crayon too ;)\nSerious Poulp\nWe founded Serious Poulp in 2010 so we could persue our dreams of publishing the games we designed.\nWe started with Steam Torpedo, a tactical Submarine combat game for 2 players with quite a significant metagame potential and combo mechanic.\nNext up was 8 Masters' Revenge, a martial arts game for 1 to 4 players that revamps the standard combat game genre.\nNow, it's time for The 7th Continent, our third game, the one we've been working full-time on for the past 2 years.\nLudovic Roudy & Bruno Sautter\nTwo friends since childhood, we love all kinds of games!\nWe\u2019ve been working together for almost 15 years in the digital communication agency we created in 2002, then as Serious Poulp which we founded in 2010 when the temptation to publish games became too strong to resist.\nRole-playing games and gamebooks played a significant part in both our childhoods. Bruno was 5 when \u201cThe Warlock of Firetop Mountain\u201d was published. Ludo was 11 and already had a few prototypes on the go (one of which would eventually become The 7th Continent!).\nWe've been inspired by many great works during our lives whether they be from board games, role-playing games or video games. When we started out in the board gaming industry, we naturally brought all these elements with us.\nWe are not only the designers of the 7th Continent: Ludovic also creates all the illustrations and visual elements for our games and Bruno supervises production.\nJamie \u201cWhelpSlayer\u201d Johnson\nJamie is the community manager for The 7th Continent.\nA passionate gamer and journalist and far too English for his own good. He currently works for the French-based board gaming site Tric Trac. He is an aficionado of any tabletop game featuring toy soldiers. You may have already heard of him from his work on the incredibly successful CONAN board game by Monolith.\nThe chat with Mr Jamie\nAs passionate gamers, we imagined a game that didn\u2019t exist, as far as we were aware, and that we would love to play.\nThis game is The 7th Continent: an exploration and adventure game offering many hours of solo or cooperative fun with friends.\nHowever, we wouldn\u2019t have started working on The 7th Continent without the prospect of launching it on Kickstarter.\nWhy?\nBECAUSE of the investment that this game implies. Be it in terms of time spent on its conception, design or illustrations. It can\u2019t be supported by a small company like Serious Poulp without a successful Kickstarter campaign.\nBECAUSE after 2 years of work on this project we cannot, unlike with our other games, continue without ensuring a certain degree of success through Kickstarter first.\nBECAUSE our goal is to not publish a standard run-of-the-mill board game. We want The 7th Continent to be an adventure of epic proportions with the largest game board ever created! We can do this with your support and all the stretch goals that we hope to unlock during the campaign.\nWe\u2019ve invested over 2 years of our lives and a significant part of our savings into this project, the first \"choose-your-own-path\" exploration board game. Now we need to know if all this work is going to bear fruit. If this campaign is not successful then The 7th Continent game will never see the light of day. Any possible commercial release will also depend on the level of the campaign\u2019s success.\nWe\u2019ve done all we can to make this dream come true, now the rest is up to you!\nWe are aiming to deliver the game in October 2016.\nNo extra customs charges for EU, USA and Canada.\nWe will be charging shipping after the campaign ends, which will be managed through the Pledge Manager.\nHere is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (between 2 and 3 kg). Please acknowledge that these are just estimates and that we\u2019ll do our best to get you the best shipping deal possible.\nArea 1 - Mainland USA, Western Europe (France, UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Portugal): Between \u20ac10 and \u20ac15\nArea 2 - Canada, Australia, Rest of EU countries: Between \u20ac15 and \u20ac23 [update]\nArea 3 - Russia, Israel, Norway, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, North Africa, Maghreb, New Zealand, Vietnam, India: Between \u20ac28 and \u20ac33\nArea 4 - Rest of the world: Between \u20ac33 and \u20ac38\nMORE PLEDGES ?\nIf you want more than one pledge (including All Applicable Stretch Goals), the shipping cost for each additional reward - from the 2nd and up to the 7th and last - will be divided by 2!\nGame mechanics : 99%\nGame conception (terrain, events, characters) : 85%\nNarration (flavor and event texts, descriptions, etc) : 50%\nArtwork* : 45%\nProof reading and translation : 5%\nIf the project is funded, we will start production in summer 2016. Once all of these tasks are complete. We are aiming to deliver the game in October to coincide with the Essen game convention.\nWe will regularly let you know how the project is going and what remains to be done.\n*There are hundreds of original artworks, and Ludovic will be working full-time on this task over the coming months.\nTo our families and friends for their incredible support and patience as we created the cursed land of the 7th Continent.\nTo our proofreaders and translators who, if everything goes well, are going to be very busy, very soon.\nTo Olivier Nkweti for the great miniatures he created for the campaign.\nTo all the players who took part in a demo, for their advice and enthusiasm.\nTo the amazing Gary Chalk, Joe Dever, Didier Guiserix, Gary Gygax, Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone for their inspirational work.\nAnd finally, to you, the backers, who are helping us make this dream a reality.\nThank you all! We wish you a not too gruesome demise in the land of The 7th Continent!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTHIS IS OUR FIRST CAMPAIGN BUT NOT OUR FIRST BOARD GAME.\n\nWe have been in the gaming industry for several years now and have already published games that are available in many countries and languages (USA, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, Russia, etc.).\n\nSMALL TEAM, HIGH MOTIVATION.\n\nWe are the authors, illustrator and publishers of all our games. We have been dedicated to The 7th Continent for over 2 years now. We will be concentrating on what we know and outsourcing other skills with industry professionals.\n\nZERO RISK DOESN\u2019T EXIST. BUT IT\u2019S STILL A LOT SIMPLER WITH CARDS.\n\nCards being the main component of The 7th Continent means that this project has a lower level of risk than others, particularly those with lots of miniatures.\n\nThat being said, outside of making sure that the game is properly prepared and choosing our partners wisely (printers, logistics, etc.), it is not impossible that we face delays from uncontrollable sources (curses, rafting accidents, attacks from giant bears, killer bees, etc). This may cause some delay in the delivery date but rest assured that, if this were to happen, we will keep you informed about the situation.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nAll pledges can be refunded up to the completion of the Pledge Manager, no questions asked.\n\nIf the refund is asked more than 60 days after the end of the Kickstarter campaign, 10% will be deducted from the amount (corresponding to the charges incurred by Kickstarter and Stripe, since we will not be refunded of them at that point), and the refund will have to be done via PayPal instead of the Credit Card you used on Stripe.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nAny costs shown in $ are based on the exchange rate in effect during the first day of the campaign.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final appearance, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.\n\nYou agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

Board games also need their own platform. So here we are! Tabletopia consists of: \nthe most advanced virtual table for gaming on PC, Mac, iOS and Android; \na database for matching players, public and private game tables, players ratings and reputation system etc.; \nthe workshop - a special editor to build your own games from scratch or port from standard graphics (no programming skills are required); \ntools for publishers and authors to playtest, demonstrate, promote and monetize their games.\nTabletopia is a sandbox. Players should know the rules of the game to play it. There is no AI or rules enforcement, but at the same time it has the freedom to play the game your way - exactly as if you were playing at a real table. However, we have done a lot to make each play for you a good experience: \nautomatic game setups, card dealing, drafting etc. \nplayer\u2019s turn control, timers, game phases indication \ninteractive zones on the table with predefined automatic actions \nintelligent counters for tracking victory points and many other in-game parameters \ncustom surfaces, game room wallpapers, sound effects advanced camera controls \u2026 and many other useful features!\nTabletopia is accessible from all perspectives. The basic version is free and is currently available for PC and MAC (browser based).

Artem and Dmitry are the creators of Playtox and have a lot of experience in the gaming business. Tim is known in Russia for different projects in the digital field (Promo Interactive, Next Media Group), but also actively participates in a board game business (Igrology game studio and Tesera.ru main boardgame portal in Russia).\nBy spring 2014 Artem, Dmitry and Tim created a company named Tabletopia Inc USA and started the development. The team was quickly assembled, and the project has been moving rapidly since. The main development team is located in Novosibirsk, Russia, but there are more people working on the project from Russia, Ukraine, USA and Germany.\nWe have a lot of plans for Tabletopia, and we are constantly strengthening our team. Until now, it has all been financed by the founders directly. And now we need the support from the gaming community to make the project better, and to prepare for the international public launch (December 2015). We have a lot of plans - like advanced game tutorials, PBEM and Hotseat play enhancements, customizable visual effects for game objects and many other features. Your help is essential to make our dream come true.

Welcome back, please stay for the adventure and help us share this wonderful resource!\nTwo years ago, Ignacy Trzewiczek had a dream. He had been writing stories and essays on his blog for years and wanted more than anything to have a collection of those stories sitting in his library. With the help of Kickstarter, and backers like you, that dream came true. Now we're back to do it all again!\nIgnacy has picked some of the best essays which he published on his Boardgames That Tell Stories blog from 2013 to 2014. Volume 2 will also include new essays which were written exclusively for the book. As with volume 1, this book will feature unique photos and pictures of prototypes of Ignacy's games! \nIgnacy Trzewiczek writes a new post every Wednesday about his adventures in the board game industry. His aim is to entertain everyone who follows with candid tales of designing, publishing, exhibiting... and sometimes even playing games. His blog is featured on Boardgamegeek.com and has become one of the most followed blogs on the site. Ignacy also publishes additional content on a site dedicated to the blog, boardgamesthattellstories.com\nWe've hand-picked 23 of the best stories to include in this volume. Each article has been re-edited by a professional editor. Learn about the development of Stronghold 2nd Edition. Read about the many months of hard development involved in designing Rattle Battle. Learn how his children helped design the Award Winning Imperial Settlers. Step behind the scenes to learn how Ignacy develops some of the most popular board games on the market today.

My first full game of Hocus was played with my immediate family... parents, sister, biker guy... and it was a HUGE hit. I would have never suggested we play poker, but Hocus is so new and refreshing, no one wanted to stop playing.\" - Chevee Dodd, designer of Scallywags, Pull!, and tester for Hocus\nHocus is a card game for 2-5 players that plays in 30 minutes. The origin of the idea was: \"what would poker be like with spells?\" Hocus is about using your unique spells, carefully managing the cards in your hands, and scoring big when your opponents aren't watching.\nHocus is deeply interactive, as you must observe and react to the play of opponents, judge the pace of the round, and make the most of your limited turns. The game is extensively tested and has been in constant development for 18 months. It has simple mechanisms, but requires thoughtful strategy. It is a highly replayable mix of skillful play and luck.\n\"You may be skeptical of a game that\u2019s based around making poker hands, but Hocus is a great new take.\" - Matthew Gravelyn\nWhat's in the Box!?\nGet a copy of Hocus for $15 plus the cost of shipping. Shipping is free for backers in the US and subsidized for other destinations.\nPrototype cards\nThe game's components include:\n101 high-quality, linen-finish cards \n1 Rule Sheet \n1 two-piece box\nThere are 60 beautifully illustrated playing cards, 24 unique and colorful Spell cards, 5 Reference cards, 2 Jokers, and 10 Score Tracking cards, all with a high quality linen finish. \nThe Score Cards\nIn addition to all of these, to thank backers for making Hocus so successful, we're also including a wooden first player token with every copy of the game purchased. \nWooden first player token\nHow to Play the Game\n\"Played Hocus over lunch. Thinkier than I would have thought. Very cool.\" - Jonathan Schindler\nThe video above features Grant explaining how to play the Classic version of Hocus. This is the simplest place to start. The video below features Josh explaining the full version of Hocus, including Advanced Spells and Owls.\n\u201cIt has kinda a pokery beginning, but you can tell it has wandered very far away from Texas Hold \u2018Em as an overall idea.\u201d - Jonathan Cox of JonGetsGames\nThe game is played in rounds until at least one player earns enough points. At the start of each round, every player is dealt a number of cards. Each card has a Suit, a Strength, and a Point value.\nThe Owl Wizard cards also have special abilities. \nPrototype cards\nOn your turn, you choose a single spell to use. Every player has three common Basic Spells. \nThe first lets you play cards to the Community. All players share the cards in the Community. \nFor the second, you play cards to the Community's Pot. The total Point value of the cards in the Pot are the prize for winning the Community. \nFinally, players can build a personal Pocket of up to 2 cards. The player who can form the best poker hand by combining the Community with their Pocket wins all points in the Pot.\nThere's a twist! There are multiple Communities, each with a Pot, and players can have multiple Pockets. What emerges is a unique experience where having the best hand isn't enough. The best players are those who see opportunities with their hand of cards, build a set that's just good enough to win, and stuff the Pot full of Points. \nA sampling of Spells\nThere are also 8 Spell Books, each with 3 unique Spells that provide a different way to play and gain the upper hand over your opponents. With all of this, you have a rich and fascinating game that fits in your backpack and is perfect for a picnic, a lunch game, or as the opener to game night.\nRules and Print and Play\nWe want you to try the game for yourself!

The gameplay is tight, compelling, and packed with interesting decisions.\" - Mike Mullins, tester and co-designer of Bottom of the 9th\n\"The advanced spells really make this game for me. Each set is unique and offers a different approach to gameplay. You have to balance pulling off your own combos while keeping an eye on your opponents. The theme, artwork and spells turn a familiar game into a great game.\" - Brian Suhre, tester and designer of Paradox\n\"My wife is very selective in her gaming and not what I would call a \"gamer\" in any sense of the word. But here we have a card game that most people will understand the fundamentals of right off the bat with the use of poker. The community building and spells add enough complexity to scratch my gaming itch while still being accessible for her. And the community building gives us a nice mechanic for competition and tension. All together, these make this game a great choice for any gaming couple, especially where the tastes vary widely.\" - Matthew Tate, tester and devilish Carcassonne player\n\"A really fun game that was easy to carry, teach to folks quickly & went over well with a wide range of ages (8-55). I loved the theme. It was fun & added some great twists to a classic game!\" - Dave Gordon, tester\nWe have written extensively about the development of Hocus (previously Hocus Poker). You can read our articles here. \nAdd Ons\nFor each Add On, simply increase your Pledge by the amount indicated and we'll obtain the details from you at the end of the campaign via the survey.\nAdditional Copies: US backers may add additional copies for $13 apiece. You do not pay additional shipping! The game will likely MSRP for $18 (plus shipping if purchased online), so we think this is a great deal!\nCustom Box and Tokens: We love the work of Daft Concepts and consulted to see if they had ideas for adding a hand-crafted touch to Hocus. We're offering a box that holds all 99 cards (sleeved), the rules, and 45 custom wooden tokens for keeping score.\nTokens are approximately the size of Quarters\nAdd $30 to your Pledge for the Custom Box and Tokens. This is available for US backers only.\nIf you have questions about any of the Add Ons, do not hesitate to Contact Me!\nWhy Back Now?\n\"Hocus combines all the strategy of Poker with a fantasy flair. The spells aspect really opens up an entirely new level of strategy. The artwork is awesome! I will definitely be backing Hocus.\" - Eric Batchelder, tester\nHocus has been tested hundreds of times locally and with over a dozen blind test groups in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It's been at multiple UnPubs/Protospiel events, BGG Con, and more.\nWe're positive this is a great game and a wonderful value for our backers. Here is why you should back now instead of waiting.\nGrant and Josh testing\nDiscount: We're giving Kickstarter backers a discount off MSRP. We know you're taking a risk with us. Therefore, we want to give you a great deal.\nMoney Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like Hocus within 1 month of receiving it, you can return it and receive a full pledge refund, which includes shipping. Try the game at least twice to learn it and see the fun. If it's not for you, send it back.\nGet it First: Kickstarter backers will receive their copies of Hocus before others. \nYou're helping us get our start. We need to know if Hocus is viable. Furthermore, in order to prove ourselves and get into distribution and onto retail shelves, we need to demonstrate there is demand. You can be instrumental in that. \nWhat Things Cost\nPublishing a card game, even one as simple as Hocus, is expensive. Below is a chart that breaks down our costs, approximately, against the notion of just hitting our funding level.  \nGaining additional backers and selling additional copies helps us further offset our fixed costs, like manufacturing and art, and greatly increases our chances of getting into distribution. That is where we hope to earn additional revenue to make this entire project viable in the long run.\nAbout the Team\nJoshua Buergel is a 20 year veteran of software development based in Seattle, Washington.

To eliminate all delays within our control, all art, graphic design, and file preparation will be finished before the conclusion of this campaign. We're 90% there already! Hocus will be ready to go to the printer the day this campaign ends. \n\nManufacturing Partner: To ensure the highest quality product and to aid us in our efforts as new publishers, we're working with Panda Manufacturing. Panda is known for remarkable quality and project management. We have been preparing Hocus with them for a year now, and they have been phenomenal partners.\n\nReserve Funds: Unexpected costs can and will arise. We specifically chose Hocus as our first project because it is a small, low cost, low risk product that is fun! We have set aside more than ample funds to cover any unexpected costs.\n\nNo Stretch Goals: We've been watching and supporting Kickstarters for years. One common cause for many problems and delays are Stretch Goals. By skipping Stretch Goals, we can stabilize our costs, better manage delays, and maintain focus on making our initial offering the best offering. The cards have a high quality linen finish, we support 5 players, there are 8 different Spell Books, and a rule sheet. We could have made them Stretch Goals, but we decided to make them the default offering.\n\nShipping: To ensure the game arrives safely from China, we're sparing no expense to utilize the simplest method of shipping. Fewer hand offs means fewer opportunities for mistakes.\n\nFinally, we will act transparently and thoughtfully. If we make a mistake, we'll do our best to correct it as quickly as possible. We want this to be a great experience for every backer.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 555, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1312152563/hocus-a-magical-card-game", "project_name": "Hocus: A magical card game"}}, {"backer": "A.J.

You barely had time to pick up the baby and your favorite fishing pole before they started the burning and pillaging. You wandered over a cruel desert, braved frozen peaks, and even paddled a log across a rough sea, kicking at the sharks whenever they got too close, the baby strapped tightly to your back.   \nThen you found it! The perfect place to make your new home. But as soon as you had the first hut built, you discovered a vast network of caverns underground, brimming with shiny treasures, rare resources, and untold adventure. How could you limit your new village to the surface? You immediately start organizing expeditions and building houses underground as well as on the surface.\nWith any luck, you'll build a village even stronger than your last-- strong enough, even, to turn away the barbarians the next time they come knocking. \nGameplay\nAbove and Below is a mashup of town-building and storytelling where you and up to three friends compete to build the best village above and below ground. In the game, you send your villagers to perform jobs like exploring the cave, harvesting resources, and constructing houses. Each villager has unique skills and abilities, and you must decide how to best use them. You have your own personal village board, and you slide the villagers on this board to various areas to indicate that they've been given jobs to do. Will you send Hanna along on the expedition to the cave? Or should she instead spend her time teaching important skills to one of the young villagers?  \nA great cavern lies below the surface, ready for you to explore-- this is where the storytelling comes in. When you send a group of villagers to explore the depths, one of your friends reads what happens to you from a book of paragraphs. You'll be given a choice of how to react, and a lot will depend on which villagers you brought on the expedition, and who you're willing to sacrifice to succeed. The book of paragraphs is packed with encounters of amazing adventure, randomly chosen each time you visit the cavern.  \nAt the end of the game, the player with the most well-developed village wins!\nThe Expanded Edition of the game will include extra content that will not be in the standard retail version!  Expanded Edition copies will be available at conventions but in limited quantities.  All stretch goals are meant to enhance the Expanded Edition and will not be included in the standard retail version. \nExpanded Edition Stretch Goals\n                            Hi, I'm Ryan Laukat. I designed and illustrated Above and Below. I love designing games and creating new worlds. I started Red Raven Games 3 years ago so I could share my creations with others. Because of all the amazing support of backers on Kickstarter, I was able to print and produce my other game designs, including:  \nEmpires of the Void  \nCity of Iron  \nEight-Minute Empire  \nEight-Minute Empire: Legends  \nCity of Iron: Experts and Engines  \nThe Ancient World  \nEight-Minute Empire: Lost Lands\nArtifacts, Inc.\nAbove and Below includes a book of encounters packed with amazing adventure and wondrous tales.  Read excerpts from the contributing writers!\nAlf Seegert\nWe're extremely excited that Alf Seegert has decided to lend his writing talents to Above and Below.  Alf is an internationally published designer of Euro-style strategy games. His board games have been featured on BBC America's The Nerdist, in WIRED Magazine, The New Yorker, The Chronicle of Higher Education, The Guardian UK, MTV Geek, The Onion AV Club, The Huffington Post, GAMES Magazine, and TheOneRing.net.

So in total, the maximum amount of copies per backer would be 4 copies.\nShipping\nInternational Shipping: As per Customs law, we cannot label the game as a gift for shipping.\n +$12 to Canada\n Europe (check new Europe backer level) \n+$30 everywhere else outside the USA\nWill this be shipped to European backers from within the EU?\nInternational shipments will be subject to customs charges depending on the country to which you are shipping.\nIf you select the new EUROPE backer level, your copy of the game will be shipped from within the EU.\nIt is likely that Above and Below will be printed later by local publishers in French, German, and possibly other European languages.

Above and Below has been tested and tweaked to get the balance right. Much of the art is finished and the game is ready, but it won't see the light of day without the funds needed to see that the game is printed.\n\nThere are many other challenges to making sure this project is successful. Because of occasional unforeseen events, it is common for board game production to be delayed. I've done all I can to ensure that this game will be delivered on time if funded. Of course, delays can happen, but most of my projects have been delivered early.\n\nAnother challenge is making sure that all the files and rules are correct when sent to the printer. I've done the graphic design and artwork for many games. My experience helps me ensure a smooth pre-production process.\n\nWith your help, we can have the funds to print the game, overcome the various obstacles that are in the way, and make sure you are delivered a quality product.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Underforest and Desert Labyrinth Encounters", "update_content": "Hello everyone!\nIslebound\nI'm excited to let you know about our new Kickstarter campaign for my latest game design!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "New Kickstarter Project", "update_content": "Hello all!\nGreat News\nThe remainder of the games (to non-EU addresses) are shipping out this week!

A game of Bottom of the 9th can easily be played in 5 to 15 minutes.\nBottom of the 9th will feature 20 player cards with beautiful custom art from artist Adam McIver that capture the look of classic baseball trading cards. These cards will even feel like classic trading cards since they will be printed on 1mm punchboard, just like vintage cards.  \nEach player card features abilities that can be used when they gain an upper hand on the opponent, allowing them to manipulate dice. Pitchers have an ace pitch that will activate when they choose to throw it as long as the batter doesn't predict both of the pitch variables (High, Low, Inside, Outside).Batters will have a unique MVP ability that activates whenever the player is able to accurately predict the type of pitch thrown. Most players also have a latent trait that can affect the game, alter their play style - or even give an advantage to the opponent!\nWith myriad customizable line-ups, the possibility of two added expansion packs in the stretch goals, and rules for advanced league and solo play, Bottom of the 9th will keep gamers wanting to play ball time and time again.\nBottom of the 9th will offer the same hallmark replay value as other Dice Hate Me Games titles, with high-quality components, thick punchboard bits, and lots of wood. Here's a list of what you'll find inside the box:\n20 punchboard player cards, full-color front and one-color back, in a foil-wrapped pack\n2 reference cards\n2 playing field pieces in card stock\n1 custom silk-screened Pitch Die\n1 Pitching Control Die\n1 Swing Die \n4 wooden base-runners\n4 wooden Pitch Tokens (2 red, 2 white)\n3 wooden Out markers\n2 wooden Strike markers\n3 wooden Ball markers\n2 wooden Fatigue markers\nPunchboard \"stick of gum\" batter ball and strike count tracker\n15 Event & Scenario mini cards for solo play\nFull-color rulebook\nSticker sheet (for Pitch Tokens and Fatigue Markers)\nBottom of the 9th will come in the Dice Hate Me Games \"Monkey\"-sized box - the same size as The Great Heartland Hauling Co., Belle of the Ball, and Carnival. What's this crazy talk? Take a look here for more information on our box sizes and game categories!\nBottom of the 9th is a distinguished alum of the Unpub program - a series of public and private playtest events held each year to help designers present, hone and polish their game designs with the gaming public, as well as board game production professionals.\nHow to play Bottom of the 9th, from Rodney Smith of Watch it Played!\nWatch a full game of Bottom of the 9th! \nWant to try out Bottom of the 9th for yourself? You can download the print-and-play files right here! You'll need to provide a few components of your own (like some tokens and three dice), but we'll give you the board, the rules, and a sampling of enough pitchers and batters to really get a feel for the game.\nFor those wanting a video how-to-play, here's a great overview of game play by Steve Tower of After Further Review.\nRodney Smith of Watch It Played is also preparing one of his excellent gameplay videos that should be available later this week. Stay tuned, and we'll post as soon as it's ready!\nAnd for those wanting to know more about the development of the game and a discussion on gameplay, you can listen to designer Darrell Louder talk all about it on Ep. 80 of The State of Games podcast! It's a great episode, all about the Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games merger, but for those just wanting jump straight into the Bottom of the 9th action, that starts at the 1hr 11min mark!\nBottom of the 9th was originally designed as a head-to-head competition between two players - that is, until veteran game designer Richard Launius (Defenders of the Realm; Arkham Horror; Run, Fight or Die)  caught baseball fever after playing the game. \nRichard has been a fan for much of his life - the Chicago White Sox adopted his uniform design for the ball club back in 1981, after all - so when the veteran game designer dropped us a line and said he had an idea for solo play? We were all ears.\nThe man, the myth, the legend - Richard Launius, ace fielder.\nRichard's design concept pits one player, controlling the batting lineup, against a randomly-controlled ace pitcher. Scenario and event cards control the game state, creating managing decisions during the game for the player-controlled team. Mike Mullins has been developing and refining Richard's core concept through tweaks and tests, and we are very excited to offer this solo play option inside the box.\nStay tuned to future updates for a link to the refined solo rules!\nAchieving our base funding goal ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish Bottom of the 9th with the quality that we all have come to expect. The base game of Bottom of the 9th is priced according to our initial funding goal; however, if we exceed that funding goal we will be able to add more to the game!\nHere is a list of potential stretch goals that would allow us to upgrade components and help us add expansion decks to the game!\nACHIEVED! Folding Playing Field game board - One goal we're super excited about, which is why we put it first! We can now upgrade the Playing Field from cardstock to a thick, dual-fold game board!\nACHIEVED! Laser-etched Pitching Die - We can now afford to upgrade the custom Pitch Control Die from silk-screened to laser-etched.\nACHIEVED! Big League Support expansion pack - This stretch goal introduces 12 new player cards to the game in an expansion pack outside the box (some of which you can see above). There'll be some new pitchers and batters, but with this pack we'll also introduce support personnel such as general managers, a trainer, and even mascots. It'll even be foil-wrapped like baseball cards! The retail value of the expansion pack will be $4.95, but each backer will receive the Big League Support pack for free as part of their pledge!\nACHIEVED! Silk-screened Pitching Tokens - We can now do away with the sticker sheet and silk screen the information right onto the wooden Pitching Tokens!\nACHIEVED! Custom Base Runner Meeples - With this stretch goal, the base runners will be wearing little hats and sprinting for the next base!\nACHIEVED! Sentinels of the 9th expansion pack - In case you missed the news, Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games (makers of the awesome Sentinels of the Multiverse line of card games) have merged! That means we can easily combine resources and do crazy things like put superheroes in our baseball games! In this expansion, you'll be able to bring some familiar Multiverse heroes and characters like Legacy, Haka, Tempest and Mr. Chomps to the field. This would be another expansion pack added outside of the box and retailing for $4.95 - but, of course, backers will receive it for free, adding even more value to your pledge!\nACHIEVED! Custom Pitcher Meeple - This stretch goal will be a little meeple for the mound! It serves no in-game purpose, but it's still amazingly cool. This will be a Kickstarter promotional not included in the regular retail version of the game, and will only be initially available as convention or contest promotionals.\nPlease help spread the word of Bottom of the 9th to family, friends and anyone else you think would enjoy the game so that we can reach our funding goal and roll out those stretch goals!\n\u201cBottom of the 9th is the best baseball simulation I have ever played.\u201d - Mike Fitzgerald, veteran designer of Wyvern, Mystery Rummy, Hooyah, and Baseball Highlights: 2045 (and not to take anything away from Mike's own Baseball Highlights: 2045 which is one of the best baseball games we've ever played)\n\u201cNot since APBA have I enjoyed a baseball game as much as Bottom of the 9th. Suspense, strategy, getting into your opponents head, and dice make this a game that is a Must Buy on the Rolling Dice & Taking Names game scale.\u201d - Tony McRee, Rolling Dice & Taking Names podcast \n\u201cBottom of the 9th is exactly what I wanted it to be - a tense and exciting showdown between pitcher and batter with everything on the line.\u201d - Ben Pinchback, co-designer of Fleet and Eggs & Empires\n\"I could give you a longer review \u2013 yes, but this is a meeple-sized one. And in the end, it really boils down to this \u2013 Bottom of the 9th feels like a game that Dice Hate Me Games would put out, not just in its classic Americana theme, but also in its gameplay. Games published by Dice Hate Me seem to have their own rhythm and cadence in their gameplay, and Bottom of the 9th fits that \u201cDice Hate Me Games feel\u201d to a tee. If you are a fan of baseball or even a fan of games published by Dice Hate Me Games, Bottom of the 9th really should be a game you take a closer look at.\" - Ryan Sanders, The Inquisitive Meeple \n\"Bottom of the 9th is reminiscent of the old, pure, luck-based dice-rolling baseball games. It adds strategy and replayability while retaining enough of a luck mechanic to keep you twitching for your d6 when that pesky batter manages to catch a piece of a pitch and you need to throw him out at first. Quick, fun, and addicting. Best sports game you don't play with a ball.\" - Brian Gerdwagen\n\"This game is tons of fun. It offers up the same feeling of tension as you would while playing (or watching) a real game when it is all on the line. Each game you play will tell a different story.\" - Steebin, The League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"Love how much tension was crammed into such a small game. The selection of pitch location and then the die roll really had you on edge. I also really enjoyed the nostalgia you incorporated with the layout/design.\u201d - Dan Halstad, League of Nonsensical Gamers\n\"Loved this game. Instant backer when it hits Kickstarter!\u201d - Steve Seebode, Unpub designer and playtester\nFor those true ball fans who want the very best, we're proud to offer a limited amount of ALL-STAR GAME pledge levels. When you pledge for this level, you'll receive one full copy of Bottom of the 9th signed by Darrell and Mike with all applicable stretch goals, as well as a special clipboard field, signed and numbered, complete with several sheets of box score tracking pads to record your games and league play! You'll also receive a limited promotional Bl\u00fcdle the Noodle mascot card - the official mascot of the Unpub Network! Bl\u00fcdle was given away as a promotional at Unpub 5 in Baltimore, so only attendees of that convention own an official Bl\u00fcdle.\nThese promotional items will only be available for purchase during this Kickstarter campaign. However, you may still be able to find Bl\u00fcdle through certain convention giveaways, or by using Sentinels Points at the Greater Than Games booth at conventions. The clipboards will be given out as prizes for winners of upcoming Bottom of the 9th tournaments at conventions. So if you don't grab the ALL-STAR GAME pledge level here, keep an eye out for these possible promotions at conventions throughout the year!\nAnd if you still really, really want Bl\u00fcdle and can't get an ALL-STAR GAME pledge level, you can add on a promotional Bl\u00fcdle card to any pledge for an additional $5! This card is slightly different than the limited card given out at Unpub 5, but it'll still enable you to easily add Bl\u00fcdle to your games of Bottom of the 9th!\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of Bottom of the 9th will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes. We love staying in touch with all of our supporters, so please never hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.\nGreetings ball gamers!\nIt\u2019s officially spring training time and I am super excited for this Kickstarter campaign! Since we started developing and showing off Bottom of the 9th a year ago, so many board game and baseball fans have been expressing enthusiasm and support for the game. Honestly, I can\u2019t remember a game that we\u2019ve announced that has generated more buzz and excitement than Bottom of the 9th, and that is humbling and amazing!\nIt\u2019s also an exciting time for Dice Hate Me Games, as we recently announced our merger with Greater Than Games, which you can read all about here and listen to us talk about here. Some of you who have been supporters of Dice Hate Me Games for a few years now have asked if this will change anything about what DHMG is known for or what we love to do. The emphatic answer is absolutely not - this can only make things better! Dice Hate Me Games and Greater Than Games will be able to work together to bring you the absolute best games out there, guaranteed. This is an amazing opportunity for us - and an incredible time to be a fan of both companies!\nAs always, I appreciate the continued love and support from our Kickstarter family. You\u2019re the absolute best in the game!\nHappy ballgaming!\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with our overseas manufacturer and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and have worked through - and learned from - kinks we may have encountered in our past projects.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. Sometimes even personal life events can blindside you.

Happy Mitten and Matt have playtested and blind playtested at several events including: \nGenCon \nOrigins \nProtospiel Ann Arbor\nProtospiel Milwaukee\nGrandCon \nWe\u2019ve tapped into gaming groups like West Michigan Tabletop Gamers as well as hosted multiple playtesting sessions ourselves. \nTesters include: Chris Bradley, Josh Bricker, Rob Couch, Josh DeBruyn, Mike English, Melissa English, Drew Gerken, Heather Gerken, Jason Glover, Joe Graves, Joel Hobbs, Jeff King, Aaron Krueger, Nikole Krueger, Jamie Lewis, Courtney Martin, Paul Martin, Andrew Montpetit, Allison Ogrodzinski, Elizabeth Ogrodzinski, Brian Richards, Neil Roberts, Jason Slingerland,  JT Smith, Marc Specter, Kody Starlin, Amber Stout, Molly Tiesma. \nHere\u2019s what people are saying: \n\u201cBartering the reagents you need to cast spells is elegant, smooth, and fun. Another great game by Matt Worden.\u201d -JT Smith, The Game Crafter \n\"I had a fantastic time playing Aether Magic. Plotting and sneaking against the whole group while knowing they were doing the same was a riot.\" -Topher DeRosia, web developer / playtester\n\"The Happy Mitten team have developed Matt's design into a game both engaging and fun. You won't believe this is their first title. It's been fun to watch the evolution.\" -Marc Specter, GrandCon & The Grand Gaming Academy\n\u201cVery quick to learn and I like that you sometimes have to pass up better deals in to keep your opponents from getting too far ahead.\u201d -Jamey Lewis, GGA Demoer\n\"Too bad this game didn't have anymore Pumas\" - Josh Bricker, The Flux Capacity and The Cardboard Cafe \n\"When I sat down to play Aether Magic for the first time, I was pleased with how elegantly the theme and mechanics coexisted together. What blew me away was the extremely high level of player interaction. This game is a blast!\" -Jason Glover, Grey Gnome Games\n\"This is a highly accessible game that is fun to play. The rules of play are deceptively simple, and your strategy can become more complex with each game. The game also made it easy to talk to other players during gameplay, so you can get to know new people if you're playing during a game night.\" -Paul Martin, entrepreneur / playtester\n\"Aether Magic transforms the gamer into a mage on a quest to cast the most marvelous spells. Constant interaction with other players and the need to balance resources make this game stand out. It's not too complicated but does require strategy. Replayability is endless because of the interactive nature of the game.\" -Nikole Krueger, mother / playtester\n\"I had an opportunity to play Aether Magic just as it reached the end of its playtesting. There were just enough things to keep track of that I couldn't get a read on everyone's strategy or score, which kept me interested and on my toes the whole way through. I specifically liked the dynamic of the built-in end-game trigger of the \"closing Aether Portal\" because it forced everyone to keep moving forward with their strategy, rather than sitting back and hoarding resources. I'm really looking forward to seeing this game in production so that I can play it again with all the beautiful artwork!\" - Brian Richards, coder / playtester\nPodcast & Blog Links\nWhile it would be simple for us to write about how much we appreciate you, shipping is a great opportunity for us to spend time proving our appreciation through action. We spent a great deal of time coordinating with fulfillment companies in the United States, Canada, Europe, and China to ensure backers get the lowest price possible. Then we decided to give free shipping to US backers and equally reduce shipping to backers in all other countries. \nBy shipping from all over the world, we are able to send games to backers from warehouses closer to them. Shipping to that many locations does increase what we pay for freight, but the more we're able to send out to those areas, the more cost effective it becomes. Below is our shipping chart, which we decided to leave in it's excel format because we appreciate the invigorating rectangle-ness of its cells.\nShipping Chart\nIf you are a retailer and interested in purchasing copies for resale, please contact Happy Mitten directly to discuss details- info@happymitten.com. \nWe need you!

Research- We have researched what it takes to produce a board game over the past two years.

Needless to say, we're ready.\n\n2.

Readiness- The majority of the work on this game is already finished- art, graphics, fun-ness, necessary relationships, etc. We are fully prepared and have every intention of delivering on schedule. \n\nWe are as ready as can be for this process and committed to making a quality product for our backers.

Lanterns: The Harvest Festival is a tile-placement game set in imperial China. Players act as artisans decorating the palace lake with floating lanterns. The artisan who earns the most honor before the festival arrives wins the game.\nOn your turn, you can take these three actions one time each:\nPlace a lake tile, which gives every player (even your opponents!) a lantern card based on the orientation of the tile. (It also could give the active player bonus lantern cards or favor tokens, depending on the placement.)\nSpend favor tokens to trade one lantern card for another.\nDedicate sets of lantern cards to gain the honor you need to win the game.\nFor more details, you can download and read a draft version of the full rulebook. (Translation: French.)\nIf you want to play Lanterns to see if it's a good fit for you, you can use our print-and-play (PnP) files to make a prototype.

Lanterns is easy to play and even easier to learn.

This gives them a more impressive, durable feel.\nAt $15,685, we started the artwork for three new platforms. Instead of 11 platform tiles with flowers, the game now includes only 2 flower platforms plus 3 tiles each of the new backer-voted platforms: koi fish platforms, dragon platforms, and panda platforms.

(These will have the same imperial seal from the cardboard tokens screen-printed on them.)\nAt $29,885, we included a custom starting-player token in the shape of a Chinese fishing boat.\nFor the ARTISAN pledge level (one copy of the game), we contribute $7 towards shipping costs for all backers. For backers in the United States, China, and Hong Kong, this covers all shipping costs. Backers in other countries must add an additional amount to their pledge.\nFor more than one copy of the game, backers should use the DOUBLE ARTISAN pledge level.

Scientists will have to keep a close eye on the Geiger counter, because as productivity in the lab increases, so does the chance for radioactivity levels to soar dangerously high.\nThe Geiger Expansion introduces a new, interactive paradigm to the base game of Compounded, as players will now sometimes have to work together to eliminate or reduce the threat of radioactivity. Of course, those players with a propensity for causing chaos will have even more methods at their disposal, ensuring that each game will be exciting and dynamic.\nThe Geiger Expansion will be chock full of new things to add to the level of fun - and danger - in your lab.\nFirst off, there are three new elements that will affect the game in different ways. \nRadium is a rare element that is pulled from the elements bag like the six base elements. It can be stored on a scientist's work bench and used to complete radioactive compounds, or processed into Lead that is used in completing other valuable compounds. Finally, Polonium is an extremely radioactive element that, when pulled from the element bag, increases the radioactivity levels in the lab. More Polonium is added to the bag as scientists make progress in completing elements moving along the score track. \nNext, the Geiger counter is used to track the lab's radioactivity levels. As the levels progress, elements are tainted by the radioactivity every round and a few are removed from the elements bag. When radioactivity reaches a certain level, lab fires break out \u2013 and if radioactivity levels grow too high, it is too dangerous for scientists to work and the lab is shut down. Scientists may work together during the game to help manage the radioactivity levels, or create a bit of mayhem by selectively completing compounds that raise the radioactivity.\nThe Geiger Expansion also includes new compounds that may grant scientists additional tools - like Calcium Hydride and Ethenone - or require Radium and Lead to complete - like Radium Nitride or Lead Sulfide. Stay tuned for project updates that will show off new cards with new Chemical Reactions and new abilities!\nFinally, scientists will receive a work bench extension with room to store the new tools they may acquire during the game. Scientists can track the decay chain of any Radium that they are decaying into Lead. At one point in the process Helium is released, which scientists may use as a Wild Element during the game. \nWhat's included:\n- 47 new Compound Cards\n- Thick punchboard Geiger counter\n- 12 Helium tokens\n- 8 Radiation tokens\n- 2 new Lab Tools (total of 8 new punchboard tokens)\n- 25 Elements (12 Radium, 8 Lead, 5 Polonium)\n- 5 Work Bench extensions\nAnd, yes, everything inside the Geiger Expansion will fit inside the main Compounded box!\nIn case you're not familiar with the original base game of Compounded, it was successfully funded on Kickstarter in February of 2013. Because of the help of wonderful Kickstarter backers, we at Dice Hate Me Games were able to produce 5,000 units. Compounded was released for retail sale in November of 2013, and sold out in April of 2014 (except for a few personal copies which are available in the ALL THE THINGS RIGHT NOW pledge level). With your help and support of this Kickstarter campaign, we can afford to print a second edition of the game, ensuring that even more gamers will be able to bring Compounded to their lab table.\nCompounded is a game about building chemical compounds through careful management of elements, a fair bit of social play and trading, and just a bit of luck. In Compounded, players take on the roles of lab managers, hastily competing to complete the most compounds before they are completed by others \u2013 or destroyed in an explosion. Some compounds are flammable and will grow more and more volatile over time; take too long to gather the necessary elements for those compounds and a lot of hard work will soon be scattered across the lab.\nAlthough Compounded does involve a fair share of press-your-luck tension and certainly some strategic planning, the most successful scientists will often be those who strike a good trade with their fellow lab mates. Players are able to freely trade elements, laboratory tools and even favors \u2013 if there is truly honor among chemists!\nIf you'd like to know more about Compounded you can check out a gameplay video, rules and more at dicehatemegames.com.\nThis mini-expansion for Compounded that introduced a bit more chaotic fun to the lab was a promotional for backers of the original Compounded Kickstarter project. We have since sold or given them away as convention promos, and recently made the mini-expansion available for purchase online. For every pledge that includes a copy of the base game of Compounded, we'll include a copy of Chemical Chaos, as well!\nAchieving our base funding goal now ensures that Dice Hate Me Games will be able to publish the Geiger Expansion and the second edition of Compounded with the quality that we all have come to expect. Now that we've exceed that goal, we can bring out stretch goals!\nStretch goal number one has been passed! We'll now add 10 wooden Flame Cubes to every Geiger Expansion box! A lot of you were clamoring for a flame token upgrade in the first campaign, and it was always our intent to revisit the idea. But with so many other great stretch goals we never managed to find the time for these cubes to come back around. \nFlame Cubes were in the very first prototype for Compounded, and they\u2019ve always been a bit of a sentimental component for us. By putting them in the Geiger box it will allow us to upgrade components for the base game for both old and new owners of Compounded. \nWe've reached stretch goal #2! Since we've reached $55K, we'll make sure the wooden Flame Cubes have a companion piece - wooden Radiation Tokens! \n These tokens are used to mark radioactive compounds when they get a hot spike, much like when volatile compounds are exposed to a lab fire. Unlike when volatile compounds explode, when radioactive compounds get two Radiation Tokens, they are flipped upside down to create \"dead zones\" in the Research Field, limiting the amount of compounds that are available for completion. \nIn addition to the Radiation Tokens, we'll also add one new compound to the Geiger Expansion - Calcium Nitride. \n It's a tough little compound to complete, but when you do you receive 7 points and activate the Magnet Chemical Reaction which allows you to select any available tool from the tool section on the scoreboard. It can prove to be a pretty powerful and flexible reaction after you invest all that Calcium.\nWe've also reached our next milestone! \nSince we reached $65K, we can kick Radium and Polonium up a notch. How? Well, since they\u2019re radioactive, it\u2019s only fitting that they would glow in the dark! That\u2019s right, we\u2019ve checked with our manufacturer, Panda Games, and they can make those gems truly radioactive. It doesn\u2019t exactly add to gameplay, but it sure does pour on the theme.\nWe've reached our next stretch goal of $70K! We can now give every backer that pledges for GEIGER and above the promotional Methamphetamine Lab Partner card. This might explain our mysterious reference to something Heisenbergian in our stretch goal teasers.\nThis card will be a Kickstarter promotional that each backer may opt to receive as an extra, in addition to the expansion and game. That means that gamers who would rather not include Methamphetamine in their pledges will be asked if they\u2019d like to receive it in the survey that will be sent out after funding. This card will NOT be included in the base game or the Geiger Expansion - it is simply a promotional item for those that would like it.\nOur next stretch goal is super cool - and we've reached it! We can now create a Geiger counter with fully-movable dial!\nThe Geiger counter will now be comprised of four parts - the main Geiger counter punchboard, a dial made of punchboard, and a plastic connector that snaps the punchboard parts together. Scientists will now be able to move the dial instead of a token whenever the radiation levels rise in the lab! This is something we always wished we could add, and with this new stretch goal, we can finally do it.\nWe're pretty excited for our next stretch goal, as we have been toying with the idea of this since the Kickstarter campaign for the base game last year. We have always wanted to highlight some of the chemistry heroes throughout history, so since we reached $90K, we'll produce a pack of 5 Scientist cards for the Geiger Expansion box! These cards will be the same size as the Lab Partners cards, only oriented vertically. \nIn this variant, each player will randomly receive a scientist at the beginning of the game. Each scientist has a special ability that will benefit that particular player, as well as a global ability that affects the entire lab. We've shown you two of the scientists and their abilities above, and we'll be highlighting the other scientists over the next few days in updates. For the time being, we'll just tease to the other scientists in the expansion: Michael Faraday (invented the Bunsen Burner), Joseph Priestley (credited with the discovery of Oxygen), and John Dalton (pioneer of atomic theory and chemical reactions). Feel free to speculate on their powers and global abilities in the comments! Also, please bear in mind that the portrait art above is just placeholder art, for now. If we pass the stretch goal, we'll be contracting an artist for custom portraits of the scientists.\nSince we posted the last stretch goal, everyone has been super excited about the Scientist cards, and clamoring for more. We aim to please; If we pass $100K by the end of the campaign, we\u2019ll give everyone five more scientists! \nIn addition to Geiger and Mendeleev above, we\u2019ll also include cards for Rosalind Franklin (discovered molecular structures of DNA and viruses), George Washington Carver (revolutionized agricultural chemistry), and Emil Erlenmeyer (contributor to theory of structure and inventor of the Erlenmeyer flask). We\u2019ve enjoyed reading everyone\u2019s speculations as to the powers of the last scientists, so feel free to discuss what you think these other three might contribute to the game!\nWe have more stretch goals planned so keep spreading the news and let\u2019s keep the lab growing!\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a complex game. You don\u2019t need to know anything about chemistry to play it, at all. And I think it really fits a niche in which there are not enough games being put out there\u2026 This is a good game. I very much recommend it.\u201d - Tom Vasel (The Dice Tower)\n\u201cI love it! I haven\u2019t thought positively about chemistry since\u2026 high school.\u201d Eric Dow, Critical Plays (Crits Happen)\n\u201cYes, kids, high school chemistry can be fun\u2026 we like Compounded so much we\u2019re ranking it all the way up to the #2 spot (on their Top Ten Games list).\u201d Emily Duhigg (Getting Higgy With It)\n\"Compounded is a medium weight game full of scientific brilliance. The tag line on the box, \"Better gaming through Chemistry,\" sums it up beautifully. I couldn't have said it better myself. This game is fun for scientist of almost every age. I highly recommend it.\"Gaming Bits \n\"This has to be one of the most thematic games I have ever played. You really feel like a scientist gathering elements and creating compounds to complete experiments.\"J. Chris Miller\n\"The end result is a game that appeals to fans of lightweight resource management, families looking for a new game night addition, or even a game to potentially assist in educating students about science in a fun way. It focuses less on deeply complex moves and more on showing that Euros can be thematically rich with widespread appeal. (Especially if that focus is on something as awesome as science.)\" Cardboard Republic\nWell, here we are again - at the precipice of another great adventure together. I am so excited to present the first, official, \"big box\" expansion for one of our Dice Hate Me Games titles. Especially so since Compounded has been so well-received since its general release late last year. \nThe past three years with everyone on Kickstarter and in the board gaming hobby have been absolutely amazing, and there is so much more in store as long as you all continue to come along for the ride. The Geiger Expansion not only expands on a great game \u2013 it also expands on the dream that is Dice Hate Me Games in so many ways, and I cannot wait to share it all with you. It has been an incredible journey because of all of our wonderful backers, and I appreciate each and every one of you, both old and new.\nLet's go make some magic - or science. I'm good either way.\nAll the best,\nChris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with three of our overseas manufacturers and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies.\n\nWe won't lie, though - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #27", "update_userinfo": "Compounded and Geiger are shipping!", "update_content": "Hey, chemistry fans!\nWe have some really exciting news for you.

I\u2019ve been holding off on updating until I received confirmation that everything is solid - the good news is, we\u2019ve worked it all out. The bad news is that, because the file issue went unresolved until factories closed for Chinese New Years, things have fallen behind. There are other factors at work here, such as a large influx of printing business to Panda Games, longer pre-production times since our original quote, and a recent hiring expansion that has required some transition time for training.

Thank You!\nSee Update #12 for more info!\nUnlocked: Everyone who pledged $19+ gets a FREE Print and Play of \"Santa's Summer Break\", the kids game by Jason Kotarski that inspired Fidelitas.\nSee update #10 for more info!\nUnlocked: The $32K funding level every backer who pledged at the $19+ levels will get 2 new promos!\n This time, we're adding a couple Missio cards, new goals to add some variety by transforming the Tavern locations into opportunities for scoring! The Barkeep isn't a part of a Guild so there is no Virtus Card for this character. But crafty folks in the city can gain his trust by keeping his bar stool filled with thirsty patrons. And you can hold sway over the Tavern by making sure it's standing room only!\nLike the other promos, these cards will initially only be made available through this Kickstarter until a future time when they may become available at conventions or through other outlets. But before all that, they are for you first! Let's make the last few days count! Please keep sharing the project far and wide!\nSee update #8 for more info!\nUnlocked: The Party Pack Promos will now include 5 cards with two new versions of The Chiseler and The Herald with art by Jaqcui Davis! And the photo cards will still be included, too!\nThe Bloody Butcher removes 3 cards to the discard pile and will probably give you nightmares! The Chiseler looks vaguely familiar and will chisel away at other player's hands. And The Heralds? They must be some sort of messengers, gathering lots of folks at the Tavern to share the latest news and get new information flowing. The one on the right sure is handsome!\nLike the Candlestick Maker Promos, these promo cards will not be included in the retail version and will initially will only be made available to Kickstarter backers. To be clear, this is not a Kickstarter Exclusive as these cards may be made available in the future at conventions or through other channels but not for a while.\nSee Update #6 for more info!\nUnlocked! All backers at the $19+ tiers will receive the Candlestick Maker Promo Cards; a new Virtus Card and a new Missio Card! \nThese promo cards will not be included in the retail version and will initially will only be made available to Kickstarter backers. To be clear, this is not a Kickstarter Exclusive as these cards may be made available in the future at conventions or through other channels but not for a while.\nSee update #5 for more info!\nUnlocked- Every copy of the production version of the game will come with a Wooden Start Player marker. \nWhile we don't have the final art yet, it will look a little something like that grey shield pictured above. This marker will be given to the first player so that when ever the game end is triggered all others players are given one more turn to prove their worthiness in the cause against the corrupt crown!\nUnlocked- We have great playtesters and backers and we heard your request loud and clear! Some of the Virtus Cards refer to the \"Castle\" and \"Harbor\" locations which are indicated on the locations cards by small signs pointing to the space next to the play area. For some people these signs were difficult to see and keep track of so we've decided to add two new cards to Fidelitas that can be placed to help these locations to be more clear. While players won't actually play to these locations but rather at locations next to these cards, we thought it would be helpful to make them stand out a bit more than they do in the current format. See the variant possible with these new cards herehttp://www.phantasiogames.net/2014/08/fidelitas-stretch-goal-2.html. This goal is unlocked and every copy of the game will include these cards right in the box!\n\nUnlocked- Meet the Brute, the Commander, the Scribe, and the Monk! Manu Forti is Latin for \"with a strong hand\" and these cards add new actions, new missions, new members of the least represented Guilds, and new ways to score. These new Virtus Cards can be played as an action or scored by gathering specific types of cards into your hand! These advanced cards provide an added layer that sows confusion and mistrust while providing another route to gain points that pave the way to victory as the leader of the revolution! This goal is unlocked and every copy of the game will include this expansion right in the box!\nIn Fidelitas, players take on the role of faithful citizens in a medieval city exerting influence in order to gain the credibility needed to lead the charge against the corrupt crown. Players play character cards to various locations that make up the city in order to meet conditions of hidden objectives. Each type of character card is associated with a unique action that manipulates cards in the game; use the Butcher to bully other characters to new locations, use the Student to gain more cards, use the Soldier to keep the peasants from loitering too long.\nIn this game where keen maneuvering is key, attentiveness to the opposition may uncover hidden motives that seek to foil your bid for power. The first player to gain a certain number points depending on the number of players is determined worthy to lead the revolt, and also wins the game.\nFidelitas is a game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up and plays in 20-30 minutes. The game is designed by Jason Kotarski (The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) and Philip duBarry (Revolution!, Courtier, Canalis, Kingdom of Solomon).\nWatch Rahdo's Gameplay Runthrough here:\nWelcome to Fidelitas! In a city you\u2019ve never heard of that\u2019s far too difficult to locate on a map, during a time long before you or anyone you know were born, a cohort of faithful citizens gathered to put plans in motion to take the power back from the political elite whose so-called \u201cleadership\u201d led to nothing more than inequity and discontent among the people. But instead of formulating a plan for revolution, they drank too much ale and forgot what they were gathering for in the first place.\nBut thanks to their digression, now it\u2019s your turn to pick up where they left off\u2026before the over-indulgence, of course!\nPhoto by Scott King (ScottKing.info)\nFidelitas is a card game with a small footprint that packs a big punch!\nFidelitas will include:\n50 Virtus Cards (characters)\n20 Missio Cards (hidden goals)\n5 Location Cards \nFull-color rulesheet with illustrations and examples\nAll this will fit in a small, rigid two-part box for maximum portability!

They thought it would be cool to work on a game together. Neither of these stand-up-fellas had ever designed a game in collaboration with another designer before. And even though it can be difficult to give up some control in order work with another human being, it seemed like a good idea at the time. They probably learned something in the process. It may have even been kinda fun. Fidelitas is the result of more than a year of emailing, developing, and playtesting. They'd love it if you'd pledge your support for the fruit of their labors.\nJaqui Davis is an illustrator from the U.K. who's done beautiful work in the tabletop game space that includes contributions to: Belle of the Ball, Euphoria, Epic Resort, and Skyway Robbery.\nDarrell Louder is a graphic designer living in Delaware.

One final hope before the last of their race would flow like the river into the ocean of history, gone and forgotten. It was the sages of the Order of Gamelyn who answered their prayers. They provided a new perspective on unity, and a way of life that would welcome peaceful members of any faction. A utopia for all. With very few options and a will to survive, this world alliance became an inevitable truth in the eyes of many of the factions\u2019 leaders. Even factions who hated one another had nothing left but each other. Under the guidance of the Order of Gamelyn, a Capital City was chosen and factions from all over the world came to call this city their new home. At last, the world was at peace\u2026 but not for long. A great storm is coming and in the darkness of the mist, there be demons.\nPlayers are going to be working together, managing threat and attempting to keep up with the evolving Turn Deck. Defending the Capital City is of the utmost importance!\nStart by selecting a Hero!\nEach Hero brings unique benefits to the party.\nThen design your World!\nUsing THIS pattern, players choose the placement of the Outer Regions!\nNext, select your preferred difficulty and prepare your Turn & Horde Decks accordingly.\nBoth Enemy turns and Hero turns are thrown into the Turn Deck. SHUFFLE and UNLEASH!\n ...now get PLAYING!\nThe Horde Deck acts like a timer as it feeds cards into the Turn Deck each round. As the Turn Deck evolves each round, it will be up to players to adapt with it. Learn your deck, win the game!\nAs the game continues, each round is getting harder and harder!\nAs Enemy Cards are drawn, Region threat is increased. Without progressive turn-management they will begin to burn, exposing the Capital City.\nThe game will continue to evolve as Dire Enemies are introduced.\nDire Enemies bring threatening powers into play but offer great rewards to the Heroes tough enough to defend them!\nAcquire Artifacts and you may survive long enough to see the Epic Foe!\nDefending a Dire Enemy yields a powerful one-time-use item that can shift the tides of battle in your favor!\nSo, you've made it! Enter the EPIC FOE!\nYou made it this far, but do you have anything left!? Now the REAL pain begins!\nIf you are able to do enough damage to the Epic Foe and kill it, you've just won the game!

Kickstarter has a very supportive and enthusiastic community that we've grown to love.\nOur experience with Kickstarter began as a project creators. I, personally, had not backed a project prior to making my own, that quickly changed. The philanthropy demonstrated by the backers that so generously supported our projects became contagious. We're not just project creators anymore, we are backers now and we love it! Backing a project is a little bit like being Santa Claus in helping make dreams come true! Then getting it in the mail later is a lot like being a kid on Christmas day! It's a win, win.\nThere's more than one way to fund the publication of a board game and even within the crowd-funding concept there are several options but none that compare to Kickstarter. Without the wonderful community of Kickstarter we would not be where we are today. That is why we feel it is important to give back. Kickstarter has changed our business and our lives in a big way and if we can play a small part in changing someone else's life in a big way we will!\nWe have worked very hard to bring Tiny Epic Defenders to this point. Many people have put a lot of hard work into this game but entering production is very expensive and unfortunately outside the limitations of our resources. The game has been enjoyed by so many and some awesome memories have been made. With your help, we can make this game a reality and share the unique experience within with a lot of people.\nThank you Kickstarter and thank you backers!

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Founded in 2010, The Unpublished Games Network, called Unpub, is a growing community of game designers, publishers, players, retailers and artists working towards the creation of new and unique table top games that will keep people entertained for generations to come. The nucleus of this community is the Mid-Atlantic Region, but our reach and membership is steadily growing across the country. \nWe support the game design and development community by organizing events designed to help unpublished games and their designers receive public play-tests and feedback. These events are open to anyone who wishes to attend and play these games. Players are asked evaluate the games based on their tastes and provide constructive criticism in the form of verbal and written feedback.\nUnpub is a low cost/no cost program that relies on participant support to grow. There is no fee to join, no fee to maintain, and no fee to participate at most events. All we ask of our participants is that they help the program to grow. It is through passionate support of the Unpub ideals that we have gotten this far, and with your support we will continue to grow further.\nThe attendance of Unpub 4 proved that the event has outgrown its roots in the home state of Delaware; therefore, a large move had to happen. With the amazing assistance of Unpub aide Stephanie Straw, Unpub is now in one of the best places imaginable, the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, MD.\nRunning 3 days, instead of the previous 2, Unpub 5 is growing to focus even more on helping designers get the absolute best versions of their games onto tables.\nFriday, February 6 - Designer Day\nThis day we will hold seminars and classes directed to the designers. Seminars such as:\nGame/Protoype Graphic Design\nPublishers Panel \nKickStarter Panel \nSelf-Publishers Panel\nSpecial Guest Q&A\nThis day will wrap with a Designer/Publisher dinner event, with free food and soft drinks, much like Unpub 4 did.\nSaturday, February 7 - Playtesting\nSaturday is the official start of playtesting festivities. Designers will showcase their games to the public from 10am-8pm. Here the designers will gain valuable feedback and get to mingle with their target audiences.\nPlaytesters filling out feedback forms will be entered into an hourly raffle to win board games and other prizes.\nOpen Gaming\nAfter 8pm on Saturday the venue will roll over to open gaming. Allowing everyone to 'take a break' from the prototype world and play whatever they see fit. This gives a chance for designers to play each others protos- or the newest game released.\nSunday, February 8 - Last Call\nThe last day of Unpub is also a bittersweet day, and this year will prove to be no different. Playtesting will begin at 10am but will end at 6pm to allow everyone to depart and head home, to face the reality of work and non-gaming responsibilities.\nMany people know that Unpub has traditionally been funded, in part, by sales of tables at previous Unpub functions and sponsorships by various businesses or publishers. Unfortunately, while helpful, these were not enough to completely fund the event and the large majority of the expenses were paid from the personal pockets of those running it. By moving to a larger venue (The Baltimore Convention Center) that is also close in proximity to Baltimore, Washington DC and BWI International airport, Unpub will have the opportunity for more playtesters, designers and even more publisher participation. With a great location also comes the great responsibility of ensuring that the event venue is completely taken care of for our designers and playtesters.\nIn an attempt to help Unpub break even, the main goal is to fund Unpub 5 and to pay for the venue, but also to include a secondary goal to help fund Unpub appearances at major cons such as PAX, BGG Con, GenCon, GrandCon, and more. The main goal of Unpub is to ensure designers receive our support, but many of the invitations to these major cons were regretfully declined due to a lack of funds to send an Unpub representative or designer there. Unpub\u2019s goal is to make sure our designers are at the forefront of these cons by ensuring the presence of the Unpub organization in order to run a smooth event.\nThe goal is of this campaign is to cover costs for the Unpub 5 venue, event insurance, marketing and materials. Each additional dollar contributed will help ensure Unpub can travel to conventions that have extended an official invitation.\n\"Unpub is, quite simply, indispensable to board game designers. Where else are you going to find a community of smart fellow designers, eager playtesters and publishers on the lookout for their next release? We have Unpub to thank for getting our first game publisher-ready and signed in a single weekend. If you're thinking about attending Unpub 5 and haven't yet decided, you're thinking too hard--it's worth it.\"\n- Chris & Suzanne Zinsli (Cardboard Edison)\n\"As a game publisher, UnPub 4 was an excellent opportunity to meet an impressive array of game designers in a format where we had the time and opportunity to really connect over their games. UnPub is an outstanding opportunity for both game designers and game publishers.\"\n-RALPH ANDERSON (Eagle & Gryphon Games)\n\"The Unpub program is an amazing resource. I've learned more about game design and the board game industry through Unpub than I have anywhere else. I've made connections with fellow designers that I could not have made elsewhere. I can't even calculate how valuable Unpub has been to me. The Unpub 4 event was a surge of game design adrenaline straight into my heart. It was a no-brainer that I would be attending Unpub 5 and I'm ecstatic to support the Unpub program in any way I can.\"\n-MATT WOLFE (Game Designer)\n\"Easily my favorite convention of the year.\"\n-Bryan Fischer (Nevermore Games)\n\"For me, being part of the UnPub network has been like attending a design university with a co-op program. I entered as a freshman and I can proudly say I am now in the middle of my sophomore year, learning and growing every step of the way.\"\n-BONNIE NEUBAUER (Game Designer)\n $1 THANK YOU!\nFor as low as $1 you can help support the Unpub Network.

We're figuring out the best way to make sure that you can get the game, so click the above image or click here to find out more information.\nTired of hiding in the city\u2019s shadows, strange and terrifying creatures of legend come to your door looking to be cured of their conditions...\nIn Gothic Doctor, a standalone card game for 2-4 players, you take on the role of physician in a practice that caters to the monsters and miscreants of Victorian literature. Play cards from your hand to treat patients and affect gameplay. Choose your patients wisely to maximize your profits. But beware - your fellow physicians are out for themselves and will sabotage your best efforts to ensure their own success. Can you make these patients\u2019 misfortune your opportunity - and earn more than your competition?\nIn Gothic Doctor, players will take turns using sets of Treatment cards from their hands, collecting money for the patients they treat. Any patient in the waiting room (the seven face-up cards visible to all players) is fair game. Treatment cards correspond to icons on Patient cards, as shown here:\nEach Patient card contains information about the patient relevant to the game - and some flavor text telling you a bit more about the pictured patient, as shown here:\nIn addition to treatment cards, doctors can draw and play Action cards, which can affect gameplay in different ways, from allowing doctors to draw more cards to changing how patients are treated to interfering with other players' efforts.\nUltimately, the goal is to earn the most money in a single night in order to make partner in London's least-reputable - but most profitable - medical practice.\nIf you'd like to see the mechanics in action, check out the two videos below. The first runs through the basics of the game, and the second shows a few sample turns.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\nAlso, here are some sample patient cards and sample treatment cards. The art on these is final, so these are some of the cards that you'll get when you back!\nAll Us Geeks: Megan said, \"I enjoyed it! It's a quick game, which everybody knows I like. I loved the theme, ... it was quick to learn, and I thought it was good!\" Jeff said, \u201cIt still plays really, really well, we still really enjoy it. We hope they get their funding this time because this is a great game that deserves to be made.\u201d\nBoard Game Quest: \"What you get is a very thematic game that is perfect for a pick up and play session. Since it\u2019s so easy to learn and the game flows fairly quickly, Gothic Doctor will be right at home to open a longer night of gaming or as a quick game when you don\u2019t have a lot of free time.\"\nChris & Suzanne Zinsli of Cardboard Edison: \"We play many prototypes and Gothic Doctor is one of the best & one of our favorite games! From the moment we saw the cards, we fell in love with the game...the artwork & flavor text are amazing. The game is easy enough for casual gamers but also has enough strategy to keep serious gamers invested...it's just great all around!\"\nCardboard Republic: \"At the end of the evening, Gothic Doctor is a fun, light, filler card game. While some of the mechanics may feel like familiar territory, it is certainly not a clone of an existing product. (There are surprisingly zero clones in this game actually.) Rather, it is very much its own entity, providing a creative new spin on the classic monster epochs. Where else can you treat the Headless Horseman, Dracula, and a swath of mad scientists in the same night \u2013 all while getting paid for it? Just hope Dracula and his Brides aren\u2019t showing up for couples therapy.\"\nIndie Cardboard: \"Gothic Doctor remains a solid introduction to games featuring both hand management and set collection. It's not overly deep or involved, and presents solid mechanics with a lighthearted theme alongside gorgeous, if at times gruesome artwork. The more involved variant rules help make this game even easier to recommend, offering a chance for players to experience something a bit more challenging should they decide to scrub up and operate on heavier games down the road.\"\nStrangeland Games: \"Gothic Doctor is a hand-management/set-collection card game with an engaging theme for those times when you want something you can sink your teeth into (HA!), but that won't take all night. [...] It's got a heavy emphasis on style and theme with a broad appeal to both novices and the more experienced.\"\nCharlie Ecenbarger for Today in Board Games: \"All in all, Gothic Doctor is that game I carry with me. It\u2019s small enough to keep in a bag or in my car, and it\u2019s simple enough to break out whenever a bunch of friends are around even if our intention is not to play games. The most memorable experience I had playing Gothic Doctor was at a bar a couple weeks back. I had the game in my backpack, because that\u2019s where it always is, and eventually the conversation died down between the people there. So I busted out the game. Five minutes of explanation and we were rolling. Most of these friends do not play table top games outside of Monopoly or Pictionary, but not one of them asked to sit out of the second game. Perhaps Gothic Doctor never intended to be a pub game or a gateway game, or perhaps it did. Either way, it has found its home as the game that I\u2019m certain anyone can enjoy in any situation. Not only is it a conversation piece due to the theme but it is a fun, engaging, and deceptively strategic game that player can get into.\"\nZero Fortitude: \"It is a quick game to learn but that doesn\u2019t mean the game play suffers any.  There is enough here to keep the game interesting each and every time.  It\u2019s perfect to play while waiting for a bigger game to get set up such as Arkham Horror or to end a long night of gaming.\"\nBut if you're the kind of person who likes to check things out rather than take reviewers' advice - or if you just like free stuff - check out a free PnP version of the game. Most of the art in this version isn't final - but all of the mechanics are set! Check it out, share it with friends, and let us know what you think!\nCheck out the free PnP deck here!\nOr, if you'd rather meet up in person and check the game out that way, here's a schedule of all the places we're planning on taking Gothic Doctor during the Kickstarter! Don't see your friendly local game store on there and think they'd be interested in having us demo the game there? Send us a message and we'll look into it!\nJuly 3, 5 & 6 DexCon (Morristown, NJ) - all day\nJuly 8 The UnCommons (NYC) - 7 pm to 10 pm\nJuly 11-13 MetroCon (Tampa, FL) - all day [with Indie Game Alliance]\nJuly 19 The UnCommons (NYC) - 1 pm to 3 pm\nAdditional copy of the main game:\nUS: add $21\nCanada: add $24\nElsewhere: add $27\nAdditional copy of the main game + deluxe expansion:\nUS: add $34\nCanada: add $39\nElsewhere: add $47\nEarly edition to pick up at GenCon:\nAdd $30.\nPlease note, there is no shipping for this Add-On. If you are not attending GenCon, please do not choose this Add-On.\nAlso, please note that the version that will be available for pick-up and for limited sale at GenCon will not include any stretch goals, bonus patients, or anything of the sort. It will be the most basic version of the game - but that's how we'll be able to print it so quickly!\nOne additional add-on that we aren't able to offer ourselves due to Kickstarter's restrictions on third-party items is an accessibility kit for visually-impaired gamers.  Our friends over at 64 Ounce Games will be working on braille sleeves for the game in order to allow visually-impaired gamers to enjoy Gothic Doctor, too! If you'd like to check their website out for more information, you can get there by clicking here. Their store isn't going to be up and running until after they deliver the rewards to their backers - but if you're interested, let us know. We can notify you as soon as the sleeves are available!\nAlong with component upgrades, we'll be adding free bonus cards to our backers' rewards as we reach higher and higher levels of funding. These cards will not be sold in either the main version of the game or the deluxe expansion. To start, we've thrown in two copies of alternate Revenant art and the Bogeyman - but what we add next will be up to you.\nWe had a lot of ideas for patients for the game, but some weren't literature-based enough - like the Bogeyman, the Countess of Bath, or Krampus. Others just didn't work out for balancing issues - like the Red Death or Lucy Westenra. But each time we hit one of these kinds of stretch goals, we'll hold a poll for backers only to vote on the next Kickstarter-exclusive patient. Check out the possible options here and let us know which you're most excited to unlock - or suggest a few new ones. And back early so you can vote often!\nAnd, because we care, we're starting out by giving a copy of the Bogeyman (you can see him in the header of this section) and two copies of a variant illustration of the Revenant to all levels that include stretch goals!\nIn addition to the traditional funding-based stretch goals, we\u2019ll also be including social stretch goals for fans who help us to get the word out there about Gothic Doctor on Facebook and Twitter.\nFor every 100 shares (up to 1000) on Facebook and Twitter combined, we\u2019ll add two copies of a new Action card to the game...permanently! You have the chance to make Gothic Doctor even better for the years to come! And the best part? You\u2019ll get to vote on what those Action cards are! All you have to do to share is tweet a link to the Kickstarter or share the link we posted in our Facebook group for Gothic Doctor!\nCheck out our list of Action cards here and see what the options are - or, see what we\u2019re missing and let us know what you\u2019d like to see as an option! When we hit each of these social stretch goals, we\u2019ll post a backer-only update where you\u2019ll have 24 hours to vote via comments, and then we\u2019ll add the most popular card to the game!\nIf we hit 1000 combined shares, we\u2019ll figure out how many it\u2019ll take to get to the next social stretch goal - but if you share our game 1000 times, we\u2019ll probably be feeling very generous!\nAnd remember, these are going to be permanently added to the game - so you have the chance to help us increase this game by at least 20 cards in exchange for helping us get the word out about Gothic Doctor!\nThanks for checking out our Kickstarter and helping us to make Gothic Doctor a reality! We'd love to know what you think in the comments here, on Facebook, or on Twitter.\nAlso, any thumbs you're willing to share on Board Game Geek for the game, the art, or the like would be much appreciated. Or, you can become a fan of Gothic Doctor on Board Game Geek by clicking here.\nAnd speaking of Board Game Geek, we sponsored June's 24-hour contest. You can check out the original thread of the contest here - but now that the contest is over, you can help decide the winner here. After the voting's over, we'll work with the popular winner and our favorite (or our second favorite if our favorite wins) to tweak the game and then share the free PnPs with all of our backers!\nIf you want to check out some interviews that Doug (one of Gothic Doctor's co-designers) did with Jeff King from All Us Geeks chronicling the \"road to relaunch,\" you can check out all of those interviews here. Or, if you're curious about the differences between this campaign and Gothic Doctor's first attempt at Kickstarter, you can check out a short post on our website here about how we lowered our funding goal or a longer post here about what we learned from our first Kickstarter.\nLastly, Meltdown Games is a proud member of the Indie Game Alliance, a network of designers and demoers dedicated to helping independent studios get their games to parts of the country that they themselves can't get to.

All of the art that can be completed has been; we're only waiting on the 5 illustrations from the Medical License level and any stretch goals we hit - and once we have those, we'll be ready to get our game to our printer. The game's mechanics are final, so that won't cause a second's delay.\n\nIn terms of printing, we're working with AdMagic, which has a proven track record of streamlining the printing process and helping designers turn files into printed games. Of course, no matter how careful we are, there could be production or shipping problems. But with AdMagic's logistical experience, we're confident that they'll be able to help us overcome any complications that may arise.\n\nOnce the game is printed, we'll be working with Ship Naked to get the game to you, and they too have a proven track record of quickly getting games to the right place.\n\nIn addition, our previous - and unfortunately unsuccessful - Kickstarter campaign for Gothic Doctor taught us a lot about the process. Through careful analysis of that effort, we were able to see some of the places where we went wrong the first time and find ways to lower the overall funding required without sacrificing quality or our ability to fulfill the promised rewards. We wrote a detailed post-mortem after the first campaign, in which we discussed what we learned from the experience and what we could have done better. And if you're curious about how we were able to lower our funding needs, you can find links to both of those pages in our \"Connecting With Us\" section - since we can't post links in this section.\n\nSo, bottom line: we're dedicated to this project, we've learned a lot since our last campaign, and we're working with people who have a lot of experience.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #39", "update_userinfo": "Long Time, No Consultation...", "update_content": "Hey amazing backers!\nRemember us?

Click here to see that forum once it launches.\nIf you'd like to follow updates specific to this project or order some dice for yourself, this link will bet set up to bring you to the right place.\n----------\nHelp us provide the gaming community with customized 16mm (standard size) D6 dice - with more colors, shapes, and sizes available when we reach higher funding levels!\nNote: Remember, your reward can be divided into multiple designs and even multiple shipments. When splitting it into multiple shipments, you just pay the shipping charges on any shipment after the first.\n\nExample: If you pledge for two dozen dice, you can get 24 of the same design OR 4 each of 6 different designs OR 24 completely different designs (or anything in between). And your reward can be split into as many shipments as you like.\nThese add-ons are available to anyone with a pledge level of $6 or more (anyone actually receiving a shipment). You can include as many add-ons with your pledge as you like.\n\nShipping: No additional shipping charges required for add-ons.\n\n\nRight now, if you want to make custom dice for a game prototype, print-n-play game, or just to customize your old Yahtzee! game, it'll cost you several dollars per die - before shipping.\nWe see a way to provide the same quality engraved custom dice at a fraction of the cost. But we can't do it without your help, we need funds to purchase the necessary supplies and equipment (primarily meaning thousands of dice and a Trotec laser engraver)!\nHere are some examples of people we've teamed up with so far to bring you cool designs:\nWe've teamed up with Potluck Games, the creators of Dungeon Dice, and have some exciting news as a result! They are designing an official die for Dungeon Dice that will be available exclusively through CGL.\nPlus they have agreed to allow us to use a bunch of the official art from Dungeon Dice. The art will be available on our website so you can design your own custom mods, expansions, and house rules for Dungeon Dice and the icons on your custom dice will match those on the originals!\n\nWe've also teamed up with Common Man Games to create a custom dice pack for their award winning game Police Precinct. And if enough people are interested in that pack, they'll receive a mystery die for SNITCH Free of charge! That die will also become available for others to claim with their pledge rewards once it's unlocked. More details on Update #8. Both Police Precinct and SNITCH are available through their current KS project.\nWith the announcement of full-color printing, we also announced a collaboration with Nick Hayes to bring his game Chunky Fighters to the masses.\nTesh of Project Khopesh ran a successful Kickstarter project several months ago for metal Tinker Dice and would like to see those designs made reality in plastic as well. So he has shared with us the designs for d6 Tinker Dice as well as Fudge Tinker Dice. Here's what the design looks like as well as a picture of the finished product in metal.\nWe've teamed up with Sarcastic Robot to make Firewall, a strategy dice game, available.\nP.D. Magnus is working with us to produce dice featuring the suits of his award winning six suit deck of cards, the Decktet.\nCheck out Update #11 for a much fuller list of collaborations.\nThese are just a handful of those that have shown us their designs. And there are many more of our 1,000+ backers with design ideas they haven't shown us.\nThese designs will all be available when the project gets funded, but what should be even more exciting is not the designs I've created, but the opportunity for ANYONE to create their own custom design and make it available to the world. There are literally infinite possibilities. I hope the few I've posted here can help inspire some ideas.\nShipping: Shipping to the US is included with all reward levels, additional $7 required for international shipping.\nSharing is caring! One of the most critical aspects of making this project a success is getting the word out to everyone that might be interested. But we need your help to do it.\n\nIf you help us out by sharing the project URL on Facebook or including it in one of your Tweets, we'll reward all of our backers by unlocking new colors of paint to fill the designs with. We figure this is better than paying for advertising because it allows us to reward even more for your support!\n\nWhile you're at it, feel free to follow us on Twitter @CustomGameLab and like our fanpage on Facebook:\nJust for clarification, these are not new colors of dice, but new colors of paint to fill the engraved designs with. New colors of dice will be unlocked through monetary stretch goals.\nDesigns we can promise to be available upon success of this project, include the following themes: Promo dice, Elvish script, weapons, winner's dice, loser's dice, tetrominoes, moon phases, standard d6, dragon dice, chess dice, ninja dice, card suit dice, crown and anchor dice, fudge dice (standard and outline), text based dice, cheater's dice, binary dice, weather dice, Mayan dice, Emoticon dice, Chinese dice, Roman numeral dice, hexadecimal color choosing dice, RGB color choosing dice, and math constants dice. The Myst based D'ni numeral dice have also received approval for commercial licensing from Cyan Worlds Inc and will be available.\n\nWe also fully expect hundreds if not thousands of other designs to be made available soon after our website launches as our backers begin to create their own designs and make them available for others to order. Rest assured you will have plenty of great options to choose from!\nIn fact during the course of this project, we have already begun working with some designers to announce designs they will be making available on our site. We've been sharing these in our updates, but also plan to add some of them to our main project page. There's some exciting new partnerships forming - go check out the updates to see some of the cool designs you'll be able to choose from!\n\nCredits: Music for the video, \"Please Listen Carefully\" by Jahzaar available on FreeMusicArchive.org under Creative Commons licensing, and some of the graphics on this page came from various contributors on Game-Icons.net There will be more specific attributions for the graphics on our site once it is launched, if you would like more info feel free to contact me.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe will be working with multiple manufacturers to source all of our equipment and supplies from lasers to dice to paints. There's always a potential risk of delay or other issues when working with companies you have no control over. However, I have already been in contact with each of these companies to ask questions and receive samples. Each of them is a reputable company and has been very responsive so far.\n\nI've been asked what I will do if this project is wildly successful - will I still be able to deliver? Not only will I still be able to create your dice, but the process get's streamlined even further the more it scales. If it does well enough, I will be able to buy an even faster laser with a larger engraving area allowing me to engrave more dice at once. If necessary, I have room in my shop to add more than one laser as well (plus available help as necessary).\n\nIn short: Overfunding is a good thing, it would allow us to get better equipment, potentially more equipment (which will both speed things up), and more dice options for you!\n\nAs with any Kickstarter, this will be a large time investment not only in creating dice but also in delivering them.\n\nI have worked from home for the past couple of years, and am prepared to dedicate the time needed to deliver your rewards for this project!

On each turn, all players will select one card from their hand and play it simultaneously in an attempt to collect Good Eggs that are worth VP while avoiding the nasty Exploding Eggs that lose VP!\nTypically, the player who played the highest Adventurer chooses an Egg first, then the player with the second highest Adventurer picks an Egg, and so on until all revealed Eggs are collected. Ah, but it's not that simple! Each Adventurer has a unique power that can affect the order in which Eggs are selected. The powers interact in strategic and awesome ways so that every hand is exciting and different.\nOutwit your opponents to collect as many Dragon Eggs as possible \u2014 while avoiding those wicked Exploding Eggs!\nStory\nEggs from the dragons of Ridback Mountain are valuable \u2014 not quite as valuable as gold following the last market fluctuation, but still TOTALLY worth the hassle, especially since it's not like YOU are climbing the mountain and searching through dragon caves. That's what peasants are for...\nAll the empires have sent their intrepid Adventurers out to collect Eggs, but not all will succeed! It gets crowded on Ridback Mountain, and there are only so many dragon Eggs to go around \u2014 not to mention that the dragons have started mixing Exploding Eggs into their nests, and those hurt.\nPledge Info\nWe wanted to keep this campaign very simple.

The team that can shoot down more targets may be the better shot, but the team that scores the most points is obviously the winner\u2026 be careful to not shoot the wildlife or it could cost you!\nUpdate:  Foul Tokens!\n Backers at the SHOOTERS BOX tier will now receive 16 custom acrylic tokens perfect for tracking Fouls! They are laser cut acrylic and measure 1.25\" across and will come in a sturdy velvet pouch large enough to store both the tokens and the game. Tokens are also available as an add-on for only $5 at any pledge level!\nPULL! - A Trap Shooting Card Game is a partnership style card game that draws inspiration from classic trick-taking games such as spades, whist, and euchre. Unlike these traditional games:\nThere is no trump suit\nThere are two active tricks each round\nPlayers cannot \"win\" the lead \nAt the start of each hand, the dealer deals each player 10 cards from the Shot Deck and flips over the top two cards of the Target Deck. Each Target is worth a number of points and players take turns playing one Shot card on each Target. The team that plays the highest valued Shot wins the Target and scores the points, but you must play carefully, because shooting the wildlife will cost you! Additionally, if a team scores both Targets, they may receive bonus points. \nA hand lasts five rounds then points are tallied and recorded. The deal is passed to the left and play continues in this fashion until one team scores a set number of points.\nRules are also included to play the game as individuals with 2, 3 or 4 players.\nRead the Rules \nGoogle Docs\nFull Color PDF\nI write extensively about my game designs from concept through finished product. I share a ton of my work on Twitter in a sort of live-tweet fashion, but I write full articles on my page detailing the design process. I have been actively developing and testing PULL! for over five months and I've written many articles about the changes I've made and the reasons for making them. You can find all the PULL! articles by following this link to my website, cheveedodd.com.\nYou will need to provide a method to keep score. Pencil and paper works great.\nAlso, available is a companion app for Android and soon iOS. This app will help you keep score, track Fouls, and also has a reference set of rules. Get the app now on the Google Play store!\nThanks to over a dozen print and play test groups from all over the globe, PULL! went from a game that was strictly playable to a game that is actually fun to play. I owe this design to everyone that helped me along the way... and there's still time to help!\nPULL! is available right now for print and play. I believe fully in this game and welcome you to give it a try before you pledge. The card backs vary slightly in design from the Kickstarter rewards, but only to make them a more printer friendly. Otherwise, the art and graphic design remains unchanged and is provided at full resolution.\nDownload the files!\nThe promotional card will be 2.75x4.75 inches and will feature a special message to all backers on one side, and original art on the front chosen by the Backers. All levels above the THANK YOU tier will also receive access to the Backers Edition print and play files.\nPlease select your GET THE GAME! pledge level carefully as there are separate levels for Canadian and International backers!\nYou must be at Gen Con 2014 to receive your SIGNATURE EDITION reward.\nThe Shooters Box is the result of a collaboration between myself and Daft Concepts. Their specialized lasers will cut the boxes and engrave the PULL! logo on the sliding lid and I will hand-finish and assemble the boxes myself. I will have a significant amount of time in finishing and assembling these boxes, so quantities are limited. \nAll SHOOTERS BOX pledges will now also include 16 custom Foul tokens!

Finding publishers to bring my games to market takes up a significant amount of my time and money. Scallywags is doing well, but it doesn't offset my costs alone. I've decided it\u2019s time to start getting more serious. I want to take control of some of my own projects so that I can continue to focus on providing valuable content and fresh games. I regularly release free print and play games on my website, cheveedodd.com, along with articles and tutorials centered around board games and design and I would like to continue providing this content without monetizing the site with advertisements and subscription fees.\nThis year, I formed Chevee Dodd, LLC so I could spend more time on this adventure. I am offering my graphic design skills to help offset the expense of designing games and pursuing publication. I will continue to pursue traditional publication for many of my projects, but I also have quite a few more unique games that I\u2019d love launch with your support!\nPULL! is a non-standard game with a quirky theme and underused mechanics. Publishers continue to tell me that there is no market for trick-taking games. I disagree with them. I think players enjoy these types of games and I\u2019m here hoping that you\u2019ll show me some support in bringing my game to life. Backing this game not only supports my efforts with PULL! but will help launch my newly formed company!\nI am working with multiple manufacturers to make PULL! the best it can be. Meeting the funding goal will allow me to fulfill the game through thegamecrafter.com and receive their maximum discount. This option is the best I can find for short run printing. The Game Crafter cards are printed on 270gsm wax-coated card stock and will be packed in a tuck box printed from the same stock. I have used their services for two years now and I am very satisfied with the quality of their product and service. \nIf we exceed the project goal, I will be able to scale up production with a larger-run manufacturer which will allow me to print on higher quality card stock and provide sturdier  packaging options. It is difficult to put a dollar figure on this sort of production scaling, so here is my pledge to do what is best for the game. I am dedicated to using only US manufacturers and printing small runs domestically is very expensive... but I'm not here to line my pockets and increase my profit margins. I'm here to make a great game the best it can be!\nThank you for checking out my first Kickstarter project!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe game has been thoroughly playtested thanks to many print and play testers. The rules and packaging have been proofed and edited. All the art and graphic design for the game has been completed barring any additional work from unlocking stretch rewards. What this means for you is that there should be little to no delay in getting this game to the printers shortly after the campaign funding is transferred to me. \n\nSo, what could hold things up?\n * Unexpected legal issues.\n * Natural disasters.\n * Postal workers strike.\n * Personal injury or disease.\n * Awesome ideas from Kickstarter backers.\n\nThis is my first Kickstarter project, but I\u2019m confident in my own abilities to bring PULL! to market. I've produced many of my own games through print on demand services as well as print and play files through my personal sites and boardgamegeek.com.

With these cards, great stories and exciting quests begin with a simple flip of a card.  From medieval castles and bustling towns to dark forests and even darker dungeons, Storyteller Cards will bring your fantasy stories to life.\nEach card contains so many narrative elements and gaming mechanisms that you can't help but start imagining games and stories that you would create.  These elements act as a kind of toolkit that allows people of any age to tell stories, to modify their gaming experiences, or even to write and design completely new games.\nARE YOU A WRITER who needs a location for a scene or a character to spark a new adventure? Flip a card and you've got one! \nARE YOU A DUNGEON MASTER running a role playing game and you need a special item for your party? Flip a card and you've got one! \nARE YOU A TEACHER trying to encourage your students' writing skills? Pass out a card to each student and let their imagination finish the story. \nARE YOU JUST LOOKING FOR SOME CREATIVE FUN? Flip 5 cards and craft a scenario using an element from each card. Pass the cards to the next player to continue the story. Keep passing, it's a blast!\nStoryteller Cards: Fantasy feature the following unique RPG-inspired elements on every card: a CHARACTER made up of a RACE and CLASS, interacting with an ITEM and a WEAPON, completing an ACTION, in one of four LOCATIONS. Each of these elements can be individually used to help create something new, get you out of a mid-project slump, or just to have some creative fun with family and friends.\nThe cards also feature additional icons in the corners to help you dig a little deeper into storytelling, creating, and gaming. The icons represent a RANK, SUIT, COIN, 20-SIDED DIE and a COMBAT RESOLUTION icon. There are a few more surprises within those icons, but we'll get into all of that later.\nWhile we encourage you to make your own games, stories, and adventures with the Storyteller Fantasy deck, we've also enlisted some of today's best designers to make awesome games that you can play with the deck. Everyone will receive the PDF rules to all of these at no additional cost as part of the Storyteller Fantasy Manual. We also have a physical version of the manual available as an add-on. See below for details.\nGame Rules:\nScapegoat / Divvy In The Dungeon / Party On! / Dueling Djinn / Make It Up /  Scroll, Shield, Swords /  Medieval Social Network / Maze of Lies / Swords & Storytellers / Crummy Story Rummy / Tomb of Horrors / Warwickus: Hunt For The Throne / Party Trek / Iron Stroyteller\nREWARD DETAILS\nAdd the Storyteller Manual: Fantasy Edition for $10 US / $12 International (or choose one of the pledge levels that includes it).\nAdd the original Storyteller Manual for $10 US / $12 International.\nAdd the original Storyteller Cards for $10 US / $12 International, or if you want them to ship separately, immediately upon the close of the campaign, add $13 US / $20 International.\nAdd the Swords & Storytellers bonus cards. 11 cards that can be used with the Swords & Storytellers game or with the Storyteller Cards in general. $5 everywhere.\nAdd the AMAZING Storyteller Screen. It's 16\" by 4.5\" and beautifully illustrated by Campbell Whyte. The back is loaded with tables featuring stats and storytelling / gaming tools. $10 for one and $20 for 3, everywhere.\nThe original Storyteller Cards were successfully funded on Kickstarter in 2013 and have been making a huge impact ever since.\nFrom Blogcritics.org: \n\"Storyteller Cards is a great, versatile, deck for anyone looking for fast and furious inspiration. It may be used for storytelling games at parties, serve as random elements for creative writing programs, or deal out parameters for an improv scene. Game-masters in role-playing games might want to keep a deck handy to quickly conjure background characters to fill that shadowy tavern. Of course, the deck could always be used for a quick game of poker, because everyone needs a break sometime, even witches carrying pirate treasure.\"\n\"My daughter found my Storyteller Cards where I had left them on the counter, and she asked what they were. I told her to look through them and tell me what she saw on each card, and then I told her to deal both of us some cards. Five minutes later, we were playing a game that we had created on the spot, and we were laughing and joking about the quirky and fun story that we were telling to gather points using the elements on the cards. I love playing games with my kids, but these cards allow us to collaborate on game and story creation even while we are playing competitively. I love these cards, and I recommend them to anyone who likes games, stories, and the fantasy genre.\"\n-Ilan Mitchell-Smith, former actor (Weird Science), professor of Medieval Literature, and Nerdy Dad.\nMore press coverage and reviews:\nhttp://entropymag.org/storyteller-cards-by-jason-tagmire-and-campbell-whyte/\nhttp://www.geeknative.com/45158/storyteller-cards-fantasy-inspiration-takes-kickstarter/\nhttp://www.nerdspan.com/preview-jason-tagmires-storyteller-cards-and-sc-fantasy/\nhttp://www.geekadelphia.com/2014/04/14/storyteller-cards-a-playing-card-deck-to-inspire-creativity/\nTHE DESIGNER:\nJason Tagmire is a game designer from South Jersey.

I've learned from that experience in the delays you might encounter as well as how to quickly handle errors at the printer. \n\nWith shipping, I have experienced many setbacks with the USPS local offices and switched to a full digital postage setup.

But beware of dangerous sharks, who are ready to devour your fish at the drop of a die!\nLOOKING FOR A QUICK, YET STRATEGIC, FAMILY GAME?\nLet Them Eat Shrimp is a quick and easy tile placement game with strategic elements that make it fun for gamers and non-gamers alike.  Players start with 4 \"fish tiles\" (which come in 4 geometric shapes: triangles, diamonds, trapezoids, and hexagons) and with 3 egg tokens. On a turn, a player places 1 of these fish tiles onto the game board, which has images of fish eggs, shrimp, starfish, and sharks on it.  If the fish tile covers a fish egg, \"spawning\" occurs and the player collects more fish tiles.  If the tile covers a starfish, the die is rolled to determine either a positive or negative result (e.g., taking a new fish tile or losing one). If a tile covers a shrimp, the player collects a shrimp token.  Fish tiles covering sharks usually result in a player losing a fish tile or an egg token. At the end of the game, players score victory points for sets of fish tiles and for shrimp collected.  If a player loses all 3 egg tokens during the game, the player is knocked out and does not make it to game end to score.\nThe game rules are easy to understand and can be taught in minutes. Playing time ranges from 15 minutes (for 2 players) to 30 minutes (for 5 players). \n DIFFERENT AGES WILL BE HOOKED\nLet Them Eat Shrimp is Dr. Finn's first intentionally designed family game with easy rules and an accessible theme, yet not lacking in strategic and tactical decision-making.  It is always my hope in designing games that players will be confronted with interesting challenges on each turn. Based on many reviews of my games (see below), I have been successful in this regard. Let Them Eat Shrimp, I believe, is similar in this way to my other games.\nThe game includes both beginner and advanced rules. The beginner's game is suitable for younger players, while the advanced version adds more strategy and depth, but increases the challenge.  The game includes multiple game boards, which can be mixed and matched for variety and for various skill levels. Some boards have only a few sharks, while others have more.  If you want to play a game where mere survival is the main goal, then use boards with more sharks. If you want all players to survive to game end, then use boards with fewer sharks. You can decide what kind of game you want it to be.\nA VIDEO REVIEW FOR YOU TO VIEW\nFor a good overview of Let Them Eat Shrimp watch the following video from This Board Game Life. You can also download the rulebook, which is a lower-resolution and almost complete rulebook.\nNote:  The video shows only prototype components. The \"fish tiles\" in the video are simply geometric shapes; scroll down to see what the fish tiles actually look like. All of the game components shown in the video have been updated with professional art (see below).\nWRITTEN REVIEWS FOR YOU TO READ\nWANT TO WATCH REVIEWS OF OTHER DR.

FINN'S GAMES?\nThe goal of Dr. Finn's Games is to produce \"filler\" games that are quick, have straightforward rules, involve some strategic planning, contain a limited element of luck, and whose outcome is rarely determined early in the game.  All of Dr. Finn's Games are available as rewards for this project, though the supply of Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game is very low and is available only on one level.  Scroll down to \"Customize Your Backer Level\" to find out how to pick individual games or combinations that are not listed. \nHere's what some people are saying about Dr. Finn's Games:\nAbout Let Them Eat Shrimp\n\"I\u2019m a really big fan of Let Them Eat Shrimp! Surprisingly, I think this could be one of my favorite games from Dr. Finn\u2019s to date. The game play is simple, yet incredibly engaging. Turns go by very quickly and the strategic options make for some hard decisions on your turn. If you are looking for a filler game that\u2019s both family friendly and can also appeal to your gaming group, then check out Let Them Eat Shrimp!, this simple game will have you coming back for more again and again.\" - Tony at Board Game Quest\nAbout Biblios\n\"This game is a blast. I need to go play it right now.\" - Impr3ssion (bgg user)\n\"After a handful of 2-player plays, I'm in love. The tension, the touch choices about which colors to keep, which colors to dump on, how much to bid, how to signal opponents to throw them off the scent of what you're doing...there's just so much good stuff going on here, and it all happens inside about 15 minutes. Wow.\" - Mr Nuts (bgg user)\n\"This is the best card game of 2008, and my all-round favorite self-published game. It's a brilliant auction/bluffing game in a small package, with one of the most singular card-drafting mechanics I've ever seen. Strongly recommended.\" - tommynomad (bgg user)\nAbout Scripts and Scribes: The Dice Game\n\"This is an excellent filler! Very simple rules, a lot of fun, and it has agonizing decisions. Very well constructed dice game.\" - Thyrlos (bgg user)\n\"One of the best two player dice games I've ever played.\" - Travvller (bgg user)\n\"More superb filler from Dr. Finn\" - eekamouse (bgg user)\nAbout Gunrunners\n\"Kickstarter games have been fairly knocked for not being finished or polished. I promise you that this game is Finnished and ready for play!\"- Jonathan Franklin, Opinionated Gamers\n\"I honestly was surprised at the amount of fun that I had playing this game. The main reason for this is that you are constantly involved with every player's turn. There is an opportunity each turn for your agent to get moved into the active area for a location and if that agent happens to be a special operative, you get to take that action during the other player's turn.  There isn't downtime for players in this game. Things are constantly changing and affecting your future plans.\" - Board Game Quest\n\"So is the game [Gunrunners] as good as or better than Biblios? These games are different enough that you can't compare them directly but Biblios is the bar to measure against. Gunrunners in my opinion is preferable to play because of the excitement that builds during each turn. It gets to the point of nail biting as each undercover agent is uncovered during a large bust. So pick this game up and help fend off the Merchant of Death.\" - Board Game Tavern\nAbout Capo dei Capi\n\"Dr. Finn has another winner here...The more I play the game, the more I am making strategic moves. Of course, with any dice game there is obviously a good amount of luck. Having said that, there are also meaningful choices to make. The game plays quickly and is quite fun -- it is always interesting to see how long you or your opponent will push their luck. It is easy to get too greedy.\" - DeanMary (bgg user)\nFREE SHIPPING IN U.S.\nAll rewards include free shipping in the U.S. For those outside the U.S., please see shipping costs for each level or, if you are customizing your reward, please follow the instructions below to calculate shipping costs.\nWANT TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR BACKER LEVEL?\nIf you are looking for a specific combination of Dr. Finn's Games (or if you just want 1 game) and you cannot find what you are looking for in the levels, you can use the $1 Level to customize your own reward by adding the specified amount.  You can also add any game to any level by adding the amount below.   For those backing to Kickstarter for the first time, you can only back at 1 level. So, to add on games, just pick the 1 level that you want and increase your pledge by the necessary amount. Later, about a month before games are shipped, I will send out a survey and for those whose pledge exceeds the particular level, I will ask what the additional funds were for.  In any case, read on for the prices to add games or to customize your own level.\nThe first price listed is for the game alone; the second price is for your own combinations or as add-ons to any level.  Free shipping in U.S. for all levels.  Unfortunately, S&S Dice cannot be added due to low supplies. I only have a handful available, all of which are reserved for the $95 level.\n$32 for Let Them Eat Shrimp alone ($30 as an add-on or in a custom combination)\n$22 for Biblios alone ($20 as add-on or in a custom combination)\n$25 for Capo dei Capi alone ($20 as add-on or in a custom combination)\n$17 for Gunrunners alone ($15 as add-on or in a custom combination)\nEXAMPLE: If you want Capo dei Capi and Gunrunners, please pledge $35 (please enter it in the $1 level).\nADDITIONAL SHIPPING COSTS:  Inside U.S., no added costs for additional games.  Outside U.S., see below.\nCANADA: If you are in Canada and if you are creating your own combination, add $8 for the first game and then $4 for additional games. If you are adding games to one of the levels, then just use the shipping costs of the level, plus $4 per additional game.\nOUTSIDE U.S. & CANADA: If you are anywhere other than Canada and if you are creating your own combination, then add $18 for the 1st game and $6 per additional game.  If you are adding games to one of the levels, use the shipping costs of the level and then add $6 per additional game.\nMINI-EXPANSION FOR SCRIPTS AND SCRIBES: THE DICE GAME\nA suggestion by a backer led to a new reward, namely, the mini-expansion for S&S Dice.  This mini-expansion will include a new \"power\" die for use in S&S Dice, a new card and two wooden cubes that will help keep track of the bidding in a revised \"Auction for Gold.\"  As this was a late addition to the campaign, the rule changes have not gone through a rigorous editing process.  Nevertheless, here is a set of draft rule changes for you to inspect. \nSPECIAL \"RIDE THE WAVE\" BACKER REWARD\nFor $200, your image will be included on 1 of the 5 player screens. You provide an image of yourself and the game's illustrator will include an image of you riding the wave on the player screen.  The illustrator will draw a custom image of you riding the wave (see below) and can even add in a personal touch or two, depending upon your request. Also, at this level you receive 2 copies of Let Them Eat Shrimp and 1 copy of Biblios, Gunrunners, and Capo die Capi.\nOTHER NOTES ABOUT THE BACKER LEVELS\nFor backers receiving a copy of Biblios, please note that the game is currently being manufactured. I've been informed that the games should be ready by May, 2014, yet I personally am not in charge of this.  What I can say is that Dr. Finn's Games will be one of the first to receive a supply of the new printing.  If any delays occur, you will be notified immediately.\nIf you would like a signed copy of any of the games from Steve Finn, with a personal message, please add $5 per game to be signed.  Note that signed copies will no longer be shrink-wrapped by the time you receive them.\nThe likely retail price for Let Them Eat Shrimp will be $37-40.\nNY STATE RESIDENTS\nAfter my last Kickstarter campaign ended and I filed my state tax report, I realized that I do not collect NY state sales tax during Kickstarter campaigns, which I am required to pay for any sales to residents of NY state. If you live in NY, please consider adding an additional 5% to help me defray the sales tax costs.  For those who do not add the sales tax, I will cover it. However, it really does add up for me, so I would appreciate your assistance.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nAny stretch goals reached will be included for all levels that include a copy of Let Them Eat Shrimp!\n$13,500: Thicker Player Mats. 300gsm C2S cardstock player mats become 1mm thick mats.\n$17K: CUSTOM ENGRAVED DIE.  The base game has 1 custom silk screened die.  If we reach $17K, the die will be engraved instead.\n$20K: CUSTOM WOODEN SHRIMP.  The base game has printed circular punch board shrimp tokens. If we reach $20K, the shrimp tokens will be shrimp-shaped custom wooden tokens instead.\nWooden Shrimp Shape\n$25K and Beyond????? As we approach $25K, new stretch goal will be posted.\nCOMPONENTS\nAs far as components goes, this will be Dr. Finn's \"biggest\" game.  While Dr. Finn seeks to make portable games with limited components, in part to keep the price of games at $30 or below, this game will have a bigger box that holds a lot more stuff than my other games.\nComponents include: \n3 Double-Sided Game Boards (2mm thick)\n140 Fish Tiles (2mm thick = Carcassonne tile thickness)\n20 Egg Tokens\n25 Shrimp Tokens\n1 Custom Six-Sided Die\n5 Player Mats\n5 Player Screens\n1 Rule Book\nScroll down to see images of many of the components.\nSOME ARTWORK FROM THE GAME\nFish Tiles. The tiles and tokens are 2mm thick, which is the same thickness as Carcassonne tiles.\nThe artwork was done by Giorgio De Michele, who also did the artwork for my Capo dei Capi. Once again, he did a fantastic job, as you can see. I would like to publicly thank him for his work on this project. \nBoard (1 of 3 double-sided game boards). 2-3 boards together form the game board. Notice this is \"board 1\" which has fewer sharks than the board below.\nBoard 6: More sharks = more danger.\nFish Die\nShrimp and Egg Tokens\nWHY KICKSTARTER?\nKickstarter offers individuals the ability to help support the \"little guys (and gals)\" in a way that was not previously possible. Dr. Finn's Games is a small, one-person company that wants to continue to self-publish its own games. It is very risky for a small company to have 1500 copies of a game made (the standard minimum) without truly knowing the demand for the game. Kickstarter allows for the minimization of that risk by ensuring that people will actually buy the product that is being manufactured.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGame manufacturing and publishing, as you would expect, contains its own share of risks. For this project, the greatest risks follow from the fact that the games will be manufactured in China and shipped to the U.S. The most serious threat in this regard concerns quality control over the manufacturing. A more likely threat, though less serious, is the possible delays involved. Dr. Finn's can mitigate both of these concerns. First, Panda Games has a good reputation for game manufacture and they did a great job on a previous project for me. Second, Dr. Finn's now has experience ordering games from China and has done a good job estimating delivery dates. If any delays do unexpectedly occur, supporters will be notified promptly.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #50", "update_userinfo": "Let Them Eat Shrimp: Expansion Packs", "update_content": "Hello backers of Let Them Eat Shrimp,\nThis is a quick note to let you know that I launched a Kickstarter campaign for a couple small expansion packs to Let Them Eat Shrimp.

Visit our website for details, and thanks for stopping by here!\nLagoon: Land of Druids is a game about forging the destiny of a world. Players lead circles of druids in search of enchanted sites that offer magic powers and the energy you'll need to bend Lagoon's destiny. Each site belongs to one of three different energies that compete to dominate Lagoon:\nEvery action you take alters the balance of power among these three energies. The energy with the most sites on the board at the end of the game becomes Lagoon's destiny. Position yourself on the winning side of destiny, and you win!\nLagoon: Land of Druids supports 1-4 players. Most games are completed in 60 minutes or less. A game with 4 is a team game. \"The team actually works really well,\" says UndeadViking in his video review below (\"What People Are Saying\" section).\nThe recommended starting tile setup for new players is shown below. Like all setups, it includes one site of each energy to ensure the game begins in a place of balance between the three energies.\nGame setup for two players.\nPlayers alternate turns, using their druids to perform various actions. Common actions include exploring a new site from the bag, moving around the world, summoning a fellow druid back into play, and unraveling a site to remove it from play. \nAdditionally, every site on the board offers a unique magic power. If your druids occupy a site, you can use its power. A fun twist is your druids share their site powers with one another. So if you have five druids on different sites, each of them could use any one of the five site powers. This opens up a lot of tactical play and fun combos.\nMidpoint of 2 player game. Each player has a stack of unraveled sites and acquired seed tokens at bottom left and right.\nThe heart of the game comes down to manipulating how many sites of each energy are on the board, and this is where you'll be trying to outmaneuver your opponents by making better use of all the site powers to carry out your agenda. Explore new sites aligned with an energy you want to support, and gain a seed token matching that energy. Unravel and remove from the board the sites of energies you wish to oppose.\nAt the end of the game, the energy with the majority of sites in play becomes Lagoon's destiny. If you supported that energy better than any other player, you win! The game tracks loyalty to the dominant energy as follows. Seeds of the dominant energy remaining in your supply at the end of the game are worth 1 point each. Secondly, whenever a player unravels a site, it's removed from play and placed in front of that player. At the end of the game, unraveled sites not matching the dominant energy are worth 2 points each.\nUndeadViking Video Review\nGame play explanation begins at 5:35.\nTestimonials\nAdam P. McIver, Designer of Coin Age: \"Lagoon is a board game oxymoron. It somehow manages to feel immediately familiar while also being fresh and different. It simultaneously seems like a classic game and the hot new thing. The rules are easy to teach, learn, and understand but they combine to give you seemingly endless combinations and countless strategies.\nDavid has done something really extraordinary here. He's effortlessly walked the line between Eurogame elegance and Ameritrash atmosphere, blending theme and mechanics so perfectly that it should make every game designer jealous. I really hate him. (JK, I love him but reluctantly.)\nMy impressions of Lagoon were solidified while the game was still a prototype with no real visuals to speak of, and now that I've seen the artwork, my eyes have exploded right out of my head. I have no idea how I'm managing to type this right now, but convincing you to support Lagoon is that important. It's that good. Trust me.\"\nJason Tagmire, Designer of Pixel Lincoln: \"Lagoon feels like Magic the Gathering meets Summoner Wars meets a very thinky game of rock, paper, scissors. A very subtle, beautiful game.\"\nBen Pinchback, Co-Designer of Fleet, and Eggs and Empires: \"Lagoon is a gorgeous looking game and a real brain burner under the hood. Each decision is meaningful and fun. This is the type of game you think about long after you're done playing.\"\nDarrell Louder, Designer of Compounded: \u201cLagoon is a fantastic game where options and gameplay grow as the game goes on. It\u2019s a brilliant puzzle that I love to unravel every single time I play. Probably the best game I played at BGG Con 2013.\"\nMichael Mindes, Founder of Tasty Minstrel Games: \"Lagoon is fun, intriguing, and as you can see the artwork is amazing. I will be an excited backer on day 1 and I expect great things for this game and its designer David Chott.\"\nKyle Hendricks, Game Designer and Player Extraordinaire: \"There is a damn good chance that Lagoon will end up being in my top 5 favorite games of all time.\"\nThe components included in one copy of Lagoon are listed below. Every single one of the 54 sites has a gorgeous, unique illustration to vividly bring the world of Lagoon to life on your table! The hex tiles are a large 3.5 inches wide (as big as Eclipse tiles for those familiar with that game).\n1 rulebook \n1 round-bottomed drawstring bag for randomizing site tiles \n1 token draw bag for solo mode\n4 player reference cards \n4 player markers / exploration aids\n16 Elemeen seed tokens \n16 Vowelon seed tokens \n16 Deonin seed tokens \n40 cardboard druid tokens (5 each of Mushroom, Hare, Stag, Fern, Owl, Dragonfly, Turtle and Moon)\n40 WOODEN, screen-printed druid tokens in addition to the cardboard tokens (will NOT be included in base retail version)\n36 WOODEN, screen-printed seed tokens in addition to the cardboard tokens (will NOT be included in base retail version)\n24 double-sided site tiles (3.5 inches wide)\n3 advanced double-sided site tiles (3.5 inches wide)\n1 BONUS site tile!\n* Prototype components, graphics may change in final version. Forthcoming art will replace gray placeholder illustrations.\nI believe in Lagoon, and want you to believe in it too. So I've made a FREE print and play version of Lagoon: Land of Druids available for anyone to download. Print a copy and play at home today!\nDownload the Lagoon Print and Play\nDownload the Lagoon Rulebook\nI've worked hard to ensure my first board game design will be produced to a high standard of quality. The art will enchant you, and you'll have fun exploring all the possibilities of Lagoon's rich game play. But I have plans to make Lagoon: Land of Druids even more alluring if the project overfunds.\nMy philosophy for stretch goals is that they should make the game better without jeopardizing the schedule or the ultimate success of the game. There's a ton of exciting enhancements we can do within these parameters, and I have a succession of sweet options in mind! \nThe most effective way to achieve upgrades to the game is by sharing this project on your social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, blogs, etc. Please share Lagoon far and wide the world over!\nFirst Stretch Goal - $22,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nA 5th druid circle will be included in the game! \nBackers chose the Owl to be the emblem of the 5th druid circle! This provides an alternate art design for the emblem representing your druid circle, as you boldly forge Lagoon's destiny.\nThe initial four druid circle designs included in the base game are shown above, and the owl design will be completed early this coming week!\nPlease note, however, the addition of these tokens does not allow Lagoon to support 5 players. The balance of Lagoon's game dynamics is excellent with 2 and 3 players, but it does not scale well to 4 or 5 individual players. This is why the 4 player game is played with teams, which feels different but truly makes for a very fun, balanced experience.\nSecond Stretch Goal - $25,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTHICKER COMPONENTS! \nThe Lagoon: Land of Druids punchboards will now be 2.5mm thick instead of the original 2mm. This will make all site tiles, druid tokens, seed tokens, and player markers/exploration aids thicker! Thicker components are more durable, are easier to pick up, and feel more substantial and satisfying to use. They also look a lot more impressive on your table.\nThird Stretch Goal - $30,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSOLO PLAY MODE!\nLagoon: Land of Druids will now be playable for a single player! This will be a great way to play when you're a druid circle of one, or when the game first arrives and you're eager to learn it on your own. More details on this experience will be added soon.\nFourth Stretch Goal - $35,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nCHUNKY THICK COMPONENTS!\nThis enhancement will increase the thickness of the punchboards once more, from a thick 2.5mm to a chunky 3mm! That's right, we're on the threshold of magnificence, where .5mm tips the scales and pushes us into chunky land!\nThis is the thickness every prototype of Lagoon has used for its tiles, and I'm thrilled that this upgrade is well within reach. Considering most board games use 2mm or even 1.5mm thick chipboard for components like Lagoon's tiles, I think you'll love the heft of 3mm tiles in your hand and how impressive they look on your table!\nFifth Stretch Goal - $40,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nTWO ADDITIONAL BACKER CHOSEN DRUID CIRCLES!\nA 6th and 7th druid circle design will be included in the game. Note this does not increase the player count above 4, as explained in the first update.\nBackers are nominating nature-themed emblems on the comments page now! To promote druid diversity, the two new emblems will be non-plant, non-fungus, non-bird, non-mammal emblems, as those are already represented. Lastly, I reserve the right to filter out suggestions that aren't thematic.\nSixth Stretch Goal - $50,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSIX ADVANCED SITES ADDED!\nSix \"advanced\" sites will now be included with Lagoon! That's three additional site tiles. Check out Flaming Lotus below, one of the advanced Vowelon sites! \nThe six advanced sites offer potent magic to your druids. They didn't initially make it into the base game because their usefulness is less straightforward, or they're a little tricky to use. But exceedingly useful they are! Now you'll be able to swap out three tiles from the base game for the advanced tiles, or play with all 27 tiles if you want a slightly longer game.\nSeventh Stretch Goal - $60,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nWOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nEvery Kickstarter copy of Lagoon will now include FOUR player sets of wooden druid tokens. That's 20 total druids, which is the full complement for the largest player count of 4. The tokens will be 4mm thick wooden discs, 1mm thicker than the punchboard druid tokens. Also included will be emblem stickers to label the members of each circle of druids.\nThese wooden tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter. I want to keep the retail price of the game as affordable as possible, and that's why these wooden components will not be standard equipment in the retail version of the game. They won't be exclusive to Kickstarter backers, but they will be free to you.\nEighth Stretch Goal - $65,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nSCREEN-PRINTED WOODEN DRUID TOKENS!\nThe four wooden sets of druid tokens added previously will be upgraded from stickers to screen-printing. The druid circle emblems will be painted directly on the wooden discs. More attractive and durable than stickers, screen-printed wooden druid tokens make a classy and refined addition to Lagoon. And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nNinth Stretch Goal - $75,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nEIGHT SETS OF SCREEN-PRINTED DRUID TOKENS!\nA full eight sets of screen printed wooden druid tokens are included with every backed copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids. That's a total of 40 wooden druid tokens! This includes the four original emblems (Stag, Hare, Fern, Mushroom) as well as the four chosen by backers: Dragonfly, Owl, Turtle, and Moon.  And as before, these tokens will not be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail.\nTenth Stretch Goal - $80,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nLAGOON ART DIGITAL WALLPAPER 3-PACK\nThree digital wallpapers of Lagoon art have been unlocked! If you can't wait until then, the sixteenth update has a nice treat for you!\nEleventh Stretch Goal - $90,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n16mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nRendering of seed tokens. Final design may differ.\n36 wooden seed tokens with screen-printed seed designs on both sides are now included with backed copies of Lagoon. This is in addition to the 40 wooden druid tokens unlocked previously, tricking out your copy of Lagoon with a grand total of 76 wooden tokens! This will complete the upgrade of all tokens from punchboard to painted wood.\nSeveral things to note about these tokens:\nThey will NOT be added to the base game of Lagoon sold at retail, making them a nice non-exclusive perk for backing Lagoon on Kickstarter!\nThe game will still include all the punchboard seed tokens.\nThese seed tokens (16mm) are smaller than the punchboard seed tokens (19mm). If that saddens you, please take a look at the next stretch goal.\nThis goal provides 12 wooden seed tokens in each energy, whereas there are 16 punchboard seed tokens in each energy. Twelve tokens is actually the number all prototypes of Lagoon have used, which is plenty. We're doing more punchboard seeds because having extras may be handy and we have space for them.\nTwelfth Stretch Goal - $100,000 (UNLOCKED!)\n19mm WOODEN SEED TOKENS!\nAll 36 wooden seed tokens are now upgraded from 16mm to 19mm. The larger size is the same as the punchboard seed tokens.\nAchieving this stretch goal makes every Kickstarter copy of Lagoon: Land of Druids a deluxe experience with a full 76 wooden tokens that will not be included in the base retail version of the game. That's 40 druid tokens in 8 different designs, as well as 36 seed tokens in 3 different designs. \nThirteenth Stretch Goal - $125,000 (UNLOCKED!)\nBONUS PROMO SITE!\nEach backed copy of Lagoon will include a bonus site tile! This promotional tile will introduce a new site type to Lagoon, the totem. Totems are game changing sites that don't behave like the others. Just one totem can completely change the feel of a game, so this bonus site will pack a punch! \nThis promo tile will NOT be included in the base retail version of the game.\nFourteenth Stretch Goal: $150,000\nWEEKLY LAGOON LORE!\nI will lovingly write and share with you a new chapter of Lagoon's lore and history once a week until the game goes out to backers.\nThe first chapter would be delivered by the first week of April, so we're talking at least 18 chapters! Each chapter would profile a new character, give background on a significant location, or cover some overarching topic in the world of Lagoon. We're not talking book sized chapters, but there'll be enough meat on these bones to flesh the world out.\nI could not produce Lagoon without the faith and support of Kickstarter backers. To respect this trust placed in me, I promise that backer copies of Lagoon: Land of Druids will be shipped out before the game is available for purchase at conventions or retail stores. \nI also pledge to keep my backers well informed at each step in the process of producing and delivering Lagoon: Land of Druids. If you ever have any questions or concerns about this project, please don't hesitate to contact me.\nLastly, I'm pleased to announce Lagoon: Land of Druids is now an EU Friendly project!\nIf you've made it all the way down here, thank you for giving my game your attention! Lagoon is the culmination of a dream going back many years to publish my own board games. My favorite games have evocative themes that are tightly woven into the mechanics. I love opening a game box and discovering an entire world beckoning me inside. When I sit down to play a game, I want to feel like I'm exploring a living system filled with mysteries to be solved and dynamics that grip me but aren't easily mastered. To me, that's magic in a box. That's what I want most when I sit down to play a game. \nI've put a lot of love into this game, and I hope when you sit down at your table to play Lagoon that your experience has a handful of these sparks pulling you in and creating memorable experiences with your friends and family.\nI have a big vision for this game and its future, and a dream to publish other outstanding games that are also set in the world of Lagoon. If this world resonates with you, I'm delighted that we've connected! I believe so strongly in what I'm doing that I actually quit my job four months ago to devote most of my time and energy towards building Three Hares Games. It may sound crazy, but I'm taking a leap forward towards forging my own personal destiny, and I'm grateful to anyone who plays a role in it.\nI started a blog to document this wild journey, and invite you to follow along if you like.\nCheers,\nDavid\n Three sizes available in three designs.\nGrizznant, Ancient Forest Lord\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\n Jokulmas, Trickster\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)\nElixona, Queen of Dreams\nView the FULL width art here (please thumb!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe biggest risks for this project are possible delays with art, manufacturing, shipping and fulfillment. The schedule includes several weeks of buffer time at different stages in order to absorb a decent amount of unforeseen delays without jeopardizing on-time delivery.\n\nMost of the art has been completed already, and the remaining pieces are scheduled for completion before this campaign even ends. My graphic designer has worked in the board game industry for many years and has the experience to ensure the pre-press phase goes quickly. \n\nThe game will be produced by Panda Game Manufacturing, a very reputable company I've established a good working relationship with going back to August. I'm working with a well-recommended and responsive freight company to manage the logistics of getting the manufactured game from China to warehouses in other countries.\n\nI've analyzed several different fulfillment scenarios to get games to backers, and have evaluated three vendors to handle most of this process for me. I believe I've settled on the most efficient approach for fulfillment. As the project proceeds, I will continually monitor this aspect and shift my strategy if a more efficient approach is possible.\n\nAnother factor I want to disclose is that I will be on a family trip to Alaska at the beginning of August, which could overlap the timeframe that rewards are being distributed to backers. Fortunately, I am not planning to directly handle fulfillment myself, so I don't anticipate this causing problems with that process being carried out by my fulfillment vendors. I do mention this though because problems could arise in that timeframe that require my attention. I have verified that internet access will not be out of reach where we are staying, so I should be able to work productively while on this trip if required.\n\nI am prepared and motivated to meet any obstacles along the way, and diligently resolve them. My backers can count on honest and open communication from me about any such challenges. You are my primary stakeholders, and I will honor my obligation of transparency as a project creator.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "GenCon, Lagoon Story Game", "update_content": "Greetings!

They all agreed it was a great idea and kicked your friends out, too! Now you\u2019re out in the world of Vallhyn and have to compete with other young dragons to be the first to build a respectable treasure hoard... even if you have to prank them to get there.\nCurrent Stretch Goals:\nShadow Pearl - $29,500: LOCKED\nShadow Ruby - $31,000: LOCKED\nDouble Crystal Dragon - $35,000: LOCKED\nBacker Goal Three (850 Backers) - Play Mat: UNLOCKED\nWe'll create a play mat for Havok & Hijinks and included in every $15 DRAGON pledge level and above!\nEach retail copy of Havok & Hijinks, available starting at the $15 DRAGON pledge level, comes with the following:\n4 Double-sided Dragon Cards (all unique artwork)\n40 Hijinks Cards (no duplicates - all unique artwork)\n40 Havok Cards (22 treasures and 18 events with unique artwork)\n1 Rulebook\n\nHavok & Hijinks is easy to learn and fast to play. It was designed by gamers with the non-gamer crowd in mind. We hope you\u2019ll be able to use the game to introduce friends and family members to the light-strategy genre. \nFor more traditional gamers Havok & Hijinks will take some time to master and offers replayability as you learn the strategies of each dragon type.

We\u2019re pleased to offer the game (target MSRP $17.99), the Kickstarter exclusive promo card, and free US shipping in the $15 DRAGON pledge level. \nHere is an overview of our primary reward levels:\nA Crystal Dragon is a rarity in Vallhyn. It refuses to stick to an affinity! We're offering a Kickstarter exclusive version of the Crystal Dragon to our kind backers at the $5 HATCHLING pledge level and above. This project is the only way to get this card! It is also one of the few ways to get a Crystal Dragon. They're simply too rare to be included in the retail box!\nVallhyn is full of dragons and we want to get a few more into the hands of our backers! Our artist Amanda has produced four alternate dragons for those who want a little more. \nEach dragon is named, has a back story, and plays slightly different than the standard version.  They won't be included in the retail box! Two of them (your choice) are available at the $20 ELDER DRAGON pledge level.  At the $25 ANCIENT DRAGON pledge level and above you receive all four alternate dragons!\nThe ultimate reward is to become your own unique dragon! Backers at the $200 CELESTIAL DRAGON pledge level will have the opportunity to work with our artist to create the dragon in your imagination! \nPick a pose, the color, horns/spikes/ears/etc., an affinity, and a name. We'll do the rest to ensure you get a dragon card that is as rare and as unique as you and include it in your copy of Havok & Hijinks.\nIn case you feel like our reward levels don\u2019t offer enough Havok & Hijinks you can pick up extras by increasing your pledge amount! Backers at the $15 DRAGON pledge level and above can add any item in our extras area by increasing their total pledge by the price listed on the item.\nIf you love the Havok & Hijinks art we have good news!

Any individual who backs Havok & Hijinks at the $15 DRAGON pledge level and at least $11 on the Tinker Deck will receive two special Tinker Dragon Coins (one from H&H and one from TD).\nWe're pleased to announce a cross promotion with another Kickstarter project.

These tokens will help track your dragon's affinity throughout the game. The tokens will be color matched to the affinities and bare the symbol that matches it. \nThese tokens are high quality, hard plastic poker chips with color art on them.

There is no better way to get your voice heard and make a mark on the development of our products!\nWe know that these days our backers are especially curious as to where their money will be spent. Rest assured that your support will be going towards Havok & Hijinks first and foremost. No one at Epic Slant Press will be paid until you get your rewards! \nThe largest cost associated with Havok & Hijinks is printing retail quality copies of the game.To do that we need to reach the minimum order specified by our printer. \nFollowing the printing of our game we'll have a large deal of costs associated with having it shipped from our printer to our warehouse and then shipped out to you.\nAfter printing and shipping costs our next largest pool of money will be going to the amazing people that created the game. That includes our artists, editors, writers, and support folks. Many of these folks have done their work on nothing more than a promise and a prayer. We want to make good on that promise.\nThere are also numerous other small expenses that have been adding up but those will be handled last.\n\nEpic Slant Press is a small publishing company based in North Carolina that currently focuses on books and tabletop games. Positivity is the driving force that guides each and every project that the company takes on. \nThe team strongly believes that with a positive outlook anyone can achieve great things.

In order to ensure that they stay one step ahead of the other hosts, players will have to carefully watch the growing line of guests at the door, inviting those in that seem to share passions with partygoers already inside, all the while handing out their precious stash of Regrets to those who should seek delight elsewhere. Of course, other hosts may find it advantageous to invite a rejected guest inside just to collect their accumulated Regrets for later use. \nHosts may also choose to ignore the competition for guests and instead try to earn the favor of the Belle herself - the muse of the festivities whose mirth, mischief or mayhem can make or break any party.\nThe cards and components will be of the same high quality as in Carnival and The Great Heartland Hauling Co. The box size will also be the same, so you can easily take it with you to your next soiree!\nBelle of the Ball is a game for 2 to 4 party-goers, ages 10 and up, and designed by Daniel Solis. You can learn more about Daniel's design process, as well as the full development life of Belle of the Ball, on Daniel's personal design blog.\nBelle of the Ball will feature a ton of cards, most with unique and stunning art from award-winning artist Jacqui Davis. Here's what you'll find inside every copy of Belle:\n- 60 Guest cards, representing five representatives each of the 12 counties of Ludobel. Each guest card is unique - that means 60 different character portraits from Jacqui!\n- 27 Belle cards that describe a certain action that the Belle can perform, divided into three categories: Mirth, Mischief and Mayhem. Players can use all three categories or mix and match to create a custom gaming experience!\n- 3 double-sided score cards for tracking how well each players' party is faring during the game.\n- 8 wooden scoring discs in four player colors - and more, with use on special scoring cards, are planned if we reach our stretch goals!\nIf you'd like to dig deeper into Belle of the Ball, you can download the simple rules here. If you have the time and wherewithal, you can also download the full Print and Play files with the rules for the base game right over here. Just bear in mind that we're still refining things a bit to make sure they are the best and clearest they can be. The final rulebook will also contain variants and advanced scoring for the more hardcore partiers! We can also make the rulebook larger to incorporate some expansion ideas that have been in development for awhile - if funding for our party goes well!\nBelle of the Ball takes place on the magical Victorian isle of Ludobel - a wondrous place filled with rich history and loads of whimsical characters. The guests that players invite to their parties are comprised of residents from one of 12 counties on the island. The attire, title, and sometimes even the name of each guest reflect the culture and contributions of each county. \nDesigner Daniel Solis likes a good story and his award-winning work on Happy Birthday, Robot, Do: Pilgrims of the Flying Temple and numerous other role-playing and storytelling projects are reflected in the tales of Ludobel. Look for project updates that will feature more about the counties, people and history of this wondeful isle!\nDice Hate Me Games has been blessed with some of the best backers on Kickstarter. The enthusiasm and support of those backers have made it possible to not only produce our card games Carnival and The Great Heartland Hauling Co., but also to quickly sell out of the initial print runs. Honestly, if we had known, we'd have ordered more! But, that's the nature of the business - sometimes you have to be cautiously optimistic.\nSince we've had such demand for both games since selling out, we thought that the Kickstarter campaign for Belle of the Ball would be a perfect opportunity to fund a second print run for both titles. Since they are all produced by the same manufacturer, we will be able to combine production times and shipping, cutting costs and getting all three titles to the market at the same time.\nWith each of your pledges to Belle of the Ball you are essentially lending your support for the birth and rebirth of three games - so now you can feel three times as good for being so awesome to us!\nAchieving our base funding goal ensures that we're able to produce Belle of the Ball (and Carnival and The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) at the quality that you've come to expect from Dice Hate Me Games. Now that we've reached overfunding, we have some cool ideas to expand the game!\nOur first stretch goal for $30,000 has been reached! We're now able to introduce a whole new set of guests... who weren't invited to the party! These party crashers are Grifters who don't call any particular county in Ludobel home, but prefer to wander about from party to party, spreading their particular brand of mischief. For more information about the Grifters, please see project update #2!\nSince this campaign is also a way for Kickstarter backers to pledge for Carnival and The Great Heartland Hauling Co., we also have a stretch goal just for them - and we've reached it! Since we've hit $35,000 in funds, every copy of Carnival will include the Sideshow expansion and every copy of The Great Heartland Hauling Co. will include The Badlands 5th player expansion! More info. on these expansions can be found in project update #2. \nOur $40K stretch goal is a very special \"inspansion\" for Belle of the Ball! We can now include the County Pride variant card inspansion - a set of 12 double-sided cards representing the 12 counties of Ludobel that introduce variable player powers and advanced ways to score!\nThe image above is just a sampling of the County Pride cards, and you can find more info. on this inspansion in Project Update #4. We'll be unveiling more County Pride cards, including information about the various Counties and their rich culture and history, over the course of the campaign.\nWe've reached our next stretch goal at $48K! This one is a tad smaller than the County Pride inspansion, component-wise, but definitely not in scope. We'll be adding two more features to Belle of the Ball: A special Belle's Favor variant card and more scoring discs to allow players to play the \"Epic\" variant and add a 5th player while playing in \"Classic\" mode! Be sure to check out all the details on this stretch goal in Project Update #7!\nThanks for helping us to bring more to Belle of the Ball - keep spreading the good word and let's keep this party going strong!\n\"I\u2019m very pleased with Belle of the Ball. It played well with all our groups and left everyone satisfied. Dice Hate Me Games has another great game here and I\u2019m pretty sure they know it.\" - Cyrus Kirby, FatherGeek\n\"Quick enough to get a game in without feeling rushed, strategic enough that there is the occasional pause to figure out the best move. It\u2019s a great balance of luck and strategy.\" - Ken Grazier, Geek-Craft\n\"The instant I picked up the cards for Belle I was hooked on the concept and look of the game! Belle was my favorite game at UnPub 2013. I played it three times and each time it was unique and enjoyable. Even though Belle focuses on the individual player's decisions, it is super interactive and enjoyable for serious gamers and party gamers alike!\"  - Lesley Louder, ChalkboardGamer\n\"Belle of the Ball is fun. Simple as that. The art is slick, the names of the guests had our group laughing, and the game play is fluid. This is a nice game to breakout with pretty much any group of people - it's simple yet maintains a level of strategy that anyone can engage with. Definitely glad this got to the table at GenCon.\" - Charlie & Matt, Sizzlemoth\n\"My husband and I had the opportunity to play Belle of the Ball during GenCon. Out of the many (many) games we played it is one of two we continuously gush over. It's easy to understand, quick to set up, laugh out loud enjoyable, and gorgeous. Hats off to designer Daniel Solis and well done to Dice Hate Me for picking another winner!\" - Annisa Jones, Tangerini\n\"I loved playing Belle of the Ball. The theme, art, graphics and mechanics blend into a wonderful package worthy of placement on any game shelf. I am excited to play this with family and friends! Cannot wait to get everyone announcing their invitees to the ball!\" - Brian Frahm, frahminator\n\"Belle of the Ball is the best game for couples since Lost Cities!\" - the_FlyingSheep\nKickstarter provides a platform for direct consumers to get Belle of the Ball shipped directly to their door before it hits the store shelves. As a retailer, though, you may reserve copies of the game through Game Salute.\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, Dice Hate Me Games would not be able to bring quality games to market. To show our respect and appreciation, DHMG promises that backer copies of Belle of the Ball will be shipped out before copies are available for purchase at retailers or conventions. DHMG also pledges to keep all backers informed at every step in the development, printing and delivery processes. We love staying in touch with all of our supporters, so please never hesitate to contact us with questions and concerns.\nHello again! Can you all believe that two years after the launch of our first title, Carnival, that we're here presenting our sixth Dice Hate Me Games title? These past couple of years have been an overwhelming experience, and I'm humbled by the support from everyone that has been along for the ride since day one - or joined us along the way!\nI'm very excited about Belle of the Ball, and I think you all will have so much fun throwing your parties - especially when announcing your guests! Daniel Solis has poured out his heart and put all of his extremely creative mind into this project for over two years, and I couldn't be more proud to offer it to all of you.\nThanks in advance for all of your support - now come on in and let's get this party started!\nAll the best,\nChris Kirkman", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins. We have a good working relationship with two of our overseas manufacturers and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects.\n\nWe've learned a lot these past couple of years. The last Dice Hate Me Games project - VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game - was successfully funded last month and is currently in production. Things are going smoothly with that project, so far, but it still falls well within the risks and challenges category since we are still awaiting dice samples and file approvals. We are vigilant and resourceful, however, and will keep on top of that project while we promote and prepare Belle (and Carnival and The Great Heartland Hauling Co.) for a hopeful production run. If there's one thing we've gotten good at it, it's multitasking!\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Party Reports!", "update_content": "Greetings card gamers,\nWe\u2019re pleased to announce that all pledges for Belle of the Ball, Carnival, and The Great Heartland Hauling Co. have been shipped out to backers!

Created by the wonderfully fertile and imaginative mind of designer Richard Launius, and enhanced by the genius of artist Larry Elmore, DOTR has developed an ever-increasingly larger and loyal fan base.  This Kickstarter campaign is primarily geared to that fan base and generally assumes that Backers will be familiar with the base game of DOTR.  However, Eagle Games recognizes and appreciates that some Backers will not be familiar with DOTR and for them we offer this link so that you can check out the world of Defenders of the Realm and perhaps purchase the base game as an add-on to this Kickstarter project:\nMore Information Here\nWhat will I get if I back this project?\n1) You will have your choice of getting from one to four of the expansions of 25 unpainted Minion figures.  Each Minion Expansion will include 5 Elite Minions and 20 Base minions. The Elite Minions are pictured in the video above and the sketches below, along with sketches of the Base minions and  a description of each race. Keep in mind that these are the artist sketches of the figures you will obtain.  The molds have not yet been created as this is the primary purpose of raising funds via Kickstarter for this project.  The molds and resultant figures will be created from these sketches and will thus highly resemble them.  The material used will be PVC resin, the same as that used for the DOTR Hero Expansions (also available as an add-on in this campaign).  The factory that produces the Minion Expansions will be the same as that used to produce the Hero Expansions.  The 25 Minions (per expansion) that you will receive will each be in one solid color (i.e. the Orcs will be green, the Undead black, the Dragonkin blue, and the Demons red).\n2) You have the opportunity to purchase Additional DOTR items --some never produced before, including:\n   a) The QUEST deck -- 84 standard-sized (3.5\" by 2.5\") cards, including 23 from the original game, 9 from the Dragon Expansion, and 52 that are brand new! \n   b) The MAGIC GATES pack of five 3D plastic magic gates to replace the 2D tokens used in the original game! \n3) You will get any and all stretch goals we reach for free if you have pledged at least $45 (of any sort) to this campaign.  Later on (post Kickstarter) they will only be available for an extra cost as an expansion.\n4) You may purchase the base game of DOTR; or the Hero Packs; the standalone Defenders of the Realm: Battlefields Game; or even painted versions of these Minion Packs; as add-ons to the basic Minion Pack campaign.\nOrc Minions: The Orc Minions are made up of large numbers of savage warriors and swift Wolf Riders that swarm over the Realm. Although weaker in combat than the Demons, Undead, or Dragon Armies, their vast numbers can lead to a quick Dark Lord victory if not kept in check. The elite Wolf Riders roam the realm making the movement of the Realm Troops and Heroes difficult, disrupting Hero Quests and attack plans. The Orc Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Orc Warriors and 5 Wolf Riders, along with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defenders of the Realm.\nUndead Minions: The Undead Minions are the most terrifying troops of the Dark Lord\u2019s Army. The most numerous of the Undead Minions are the ferocious Skeleton Warriors raised from the dead by powerful necromancers, terrifying the inhabitants of the Realm as they march unceasingly toward Monarch City. Riding in support of the Undead Skeletons are terrifying Nightmares, heartless creatures raised from the underworld, riding flaming stallions as they terrorize the villages and cities throughout the Realm. The Undead Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Skeleton Warriors and 5 Nightmares, along with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defenders of the Realm.\nDemon Minions: The Demon Minions are foul and corrupt creatures primarily made up of grotesque Gluttons; bloated creatures that feed off the land, destroying all life and consuming the mana from the Realm as they trundle toward Monarch City. In combat, the Gluttons attack using their long spike-like claws to skewer their enemies and pull them into their gigantic razor-toothed mouths, feeding upon their enemies the way they feed upon the Realm. Deadlier than the Gluttons, the Blood Demons charge into battle wielding a flaming sword that not only burns the body, but corrupts the soul as well. The Demon Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Gluttons and 5 Blood Demons, along with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defenders of the Realm.\nDragonkin Minions: The Dragonkin Minions are made up primarily of the brutal Dragonkin themselves. These ancient creatures are half-man/half- dragon, with hard-scaled skin that deflects arrows and blades in combat-- making them the toughest warriors of the Dark Lord\u2019s very formidable army.  Controlling the Dragon-Kin are the Dragon Mages, powerful wizards casting ancient Dragon Spells to protect the armies of the Dark Lord. The Dragonkin Minions Pack provides the players with 20 Dragonkin Minions and 5 Dragon Mages, along with the Minion Cards describing how these Minions are to be used in playing Defenders of the Realm.\nYou get FREE Stretch Goals--when we reach these Funding Levels they are Unlocked and FREE to you if you have pledged at least $45 in total pledges (of any sort) for this campaign!\n$28,000 - Unlocked\nALTERNATE MINION CARDS - These cards feature different, harder abilities for the base game Demons and Dragonkin.\n$31,000 Goal - Unlocked\nALTERNATE MINION CARDS - These cards feature different, harder abilities for the base game Orcs and Undead.\n$34,000 Goal - Unlocked\nDemon and Dragonkin Darkness Spreads Monarch City raid cards.\n$37,000 Goal - Unlocked\nOrc and Undead Darkness Spreads Monarch City raid cards.\n$40,000 Goal - Unlocked\nInn Raid and Move any General Darkness spreads cards.\n$50,000 Goal - Unlocked\nLegendary Deck - an ALL-NEW Deck of cards to add new abilities to the heroes!

Players roll 7 specially designed dice, and can choose whether to focus on grabbing treasure (from the dragon or from another player), fighting the dragon, protecting themselves and their treasure, or running for the exit.\nTry not to draw the dragon\u2019s attention as you make your way, and note that your fellow adventurers may hinder (or aid) you in your strategy and that the final scoring changes depending on how the game ends, so watch your Dragon Rampage is a strategic dice game for 3 to 5 players.

We feel it is important that people who buy Defenders of the Realm: Minion Expansions receive a game, or games, that is well made and will be in playable condition for many years. Defenders of the Realm: Minion Expansion will be produced using the best printing, box and components available.\n\nThanks for your support of Eagle Games and the Defenders of the Realm: Minion Expansions\n\nPlease direct any questions to: customer-service@eagle-gryphon.com\nWhy should I back this Kickstarter project?\nWe realize that some of you think that Eagle Games, being a well-established and reliable company, and that Richard Launius, being a well-respected and accomplished designer, should not necessarily need to raise money on Kickstarter for such a project.  However, there are many risks and challenges in the games publishing business, and we want to take on these challenges sensibly.  There are numerous companies that cannot handle these challenges and there have been some spectacular failures recently. Eagle Games has been around for more than a decade (and we intend to be around for a good deal longer).  To us it makes no sense to spend the many thousands of dollars required to produce molds and miniature figures unless there is clearly demand for this product.  So that is the primary reason why we are running this Kickstarter campaign--to establish that sufficient demand is there to warrant this production.  To make it worth your while to help us out, we want to make sure that you realize:\n1) When the Kickstarter campaign is over and the product is available, we expect the MSRP for each Minion Pack to be $30.  You are able, via this KS campaign, to get each mini-pack for as little as $20 each.\n2) When this Kickstarter campaign is over and the product produced, the Stretch Goals that you are getting for free will be sold separately as an expansion.  We do not have a firm MSRP in mind yet for these but it will likely be $10 or more.  Also, this expansion may not be available for an additional 6 months or so to the mass market, so think of this as a \"Kickstarter Exclusive Release\" to Backers only.\n3) You have the opportunity to buy Add-Ons for much better than MSRP prices by buying them now via this KS Project.\n4) You get FREE shipping if you are in the USA.  If you are in Canada or another international location, you get the \"American subsidy\" for shipping plus the best rates that we can arrange for you.\nWe really appreciate your support via Kickstarter, it helps us a great deal with decision-making and covering the big production costs involved in producing molds and miniatures.\nThanks--Richard Launius and the Eagle Games team\nThe DOTR Minion Expansions are relatively small. One, by itself, will fit into a USPS Small Flat Rate box tightly--and that's a good thing. That costs $6 in the US. We pay this and send those to you (if you are in the US) for \"free\".\nCanada\nIn Canada, we plan to send all the Canadian Backers' orders to one single person or company that would agree to having us send all copies to them and then out to individuals. Assuming this works we still need to pay for shipping all the games to Canada, and customs, and the costs of internal-to-Canada postage and materials, as well as some labor to actually send these out. So please add $16 (for the first pack) for shipping if you are a Backer in Canada. And add $3 for each additional pack in the same order delivered in Canada. So that is $25 for shipping a four pack to Canada.\nGermany and other EU countries\nUnfortunately the small size of the Minions Pack does not help us in the EU -- where the rates for us to send anything from .1kg to 5kgs are all the same. That is great for bigger and heavier games but not for the DOTR Minions.  So we have arranged to send the DOTR Minions and related products  internal to Germany to an individual in Germany who will send them out, and that allows us to tell German backers that they can add $16 to their pledge for the first game sent to an address in Germany and $3 for each additional game sent to that same address.  So that is $25 for shipping a four pack to Germany.\nThe Netherlands is also an exception because our warehouse is located there.  So shipping the four pack of minions within the NL costs only $22.\nThe EU other than Germany\n If we can find someone in France, Italy, Spain, and other countries that multiple backers might live in then we need to know that. Otherwise we will use our warehouse in The Netherlands to send out all EU orders. And these orders will cost $22 added to each pledge for shipping for one pack and an additional $3 for each additional game. So that is $31 for shipping a four pack to a country in the EU.\nAustralia\nThe rates to Australia are the same as those to Canada because of a new relationship we have with a distributor in Australia. So add $16 for the first game and another $3 for each additional game. So that is $25 for shipping a four pack to Australia.\nElsewhere in the World\nFinally, if you live somewhere other than Canada, Germany, the EU, or Australia, please add $30 for shipping the first game to you and $5 for each additional game to the same address. So that is $45 to ship a four pack anywhere else in the world.\n We realize that shipping is expensive and we do not like paying this amount any more than any of you do either. \n We do subsidize shipping expenses, and we certainly do not profit from them at all. Thanks for your understanding.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEagle Games has participated in 20+ successful Kickstarter projects completed in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and all of our projects have shipped out either in the same month we originally projected or within 30 days thereafter. Even so, there are always unpredictable events which can occur that might delay our projects. We will do our best to avoid them, but there is always the risk that the project might be delayed. Shipping can be a particularly difficult challenge when it involves destinations outside the US (and sometimes even within the US as well). We will obtain tracking information when it is possible, but sometimes it is not. We cannot guarantee that there will not be shipping problems as we cannot guarantee the service and reliability of the various postal services involved around the world. You will have to assume that risk along with us. We have been producing board games for over 10 years and we have a good reputation for the quality of our productions because we visit and choose our Chinese partners/factories carefully. However, mistakes happen occasionally that we cannot control--such as missing or defective components. When they do, our customer service department will work with you to take care of production problems that might arise.

Thankfully, the journey from port to warehouse only takes 2-3 days (accounting for all the inventorying and other stuff that needs to take place), so best guess is that things can start going out on December 8.

As in its predecessor, players of VivaJava Dice take on the roles of employees at the VivaJava CoffeeCo., scouring the globe for the best beans to keep the company on top while keeping themselves one step ahead of the rest of the executives.\nAlso as in VivaJava, VivaJava Dice has players making the crucial decision between blending beans and research, but with a quick, new twist. Players must now use the dice in their pool to Blend \u2013 using the beans to create a best-seller for quick points, then deciding whether to press their luck in subsequent rounds for bigger points but fewer dice as the blends degrade \u2013 or to Research, which involves using their valuable beans to gain an ever-changing variety of dice-manipulating abilities, new ways to score, and paths that lead to aiding a competitor for a later payoff or hindering that competitor for immediate gratification. VivaJava Dice also offers a unique system of cooperative dice-rolling that can help you rise to the top, but at the price of someone else riding your coattails.\nWith an astounding mix of plug-and-play research abilities, subtle social play in semi-cooperative mode, and the chance to hog all the glory and blend the best for yourself, VivaJava Dice is all about choice, making each game decidedly and delightfully different.\n- Two Blend Coasters (Featured and Rainbow)\n- Flavor Coaster\n- Two Research Coasters (One double-sided Lite and House Blend, one custom Top Cup! Coaster)\n- Four Player Color/Reference Coasters\n- Two Solo coasters for solo play\n- One Intern coaster\n- 24 Research Discs (for use with the custom Top Cup! Research Coaster to randomize play and provide hundreds of variant set-ups)\n- 12 Wooden player discs\n- 10 Custom Coffee Dice\n- 5 Custom Flavor Dice\n- 1 Pad of Full-color Research Track/Score sheets, double-sided\n- 24 Research Ability reference cards\n- 4 Flavor cards for integrating VivaJava Dice with the original VivaJava\n- 1 Travel Jute tote that fits all components of VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game for easy carrying to your favorite coffee house!\nWe built VivaJava Dice with a little help from our friends \u2014 the passionate and vibrant board game community! When TC first started developing VivaJava Dice, he prepared a print-and-play version for an open group of beta testers to try out. With their gracious help, new ideas were quickly tested and gameplay was improved. TC introduced a new print-and-play of the base game in late May and anyone who would like to try out VivaJava Dice is more than welcome. Check out the link and instructions here on Boardgamegeek.\nSince the birth of Dice Hate Me, fans of the blog, the company and really cool custom dice everywhere have been demanding their very own set of Angry Dice, but we've resisted the call to cubes until the right campaign came along. Well, the time is nigh - now you too can own the lovable, grumpy mascot of Dice Hate Me!\nAngry Dice are much more than just custom dice, though - these dice are a part of one of the fastest and most furious dice games ever created. \nOne fateful night at Origins Game Fair 2012, Shawn Purtell and Compounded designer Darrell Louder sat with the Dice Hate Me Games crew, waiting for a table at Barley's Brewing Company. Armed with only four dice and plenty of time to spare, the dynamic duo developed a truly addictive and adrenaline-fueled cube-tossing game for gamers of all ages. What has quickly become a favorite pursuit while passing time at the pub can now be shared with all of you. Want to see Angry Dice in action? Check out all the fun in The Showdown below!\nWhen we say that VivaJava Dice has a ton of variability, we aren't kidding - designer TC Petty III has so many ideas that his brain can barely contain them all. The \"Game of the Year\" Expansion was conceived as an expandable set of several themed expansions that could bring some of these new concepts and playstyles to VivaJava Dice. The first of these is the Anger Expansion. The core game is designed with positive player interaction and neutral conflict to provide a thoughtful and relaxing atmosphere for a large variety of gamers. The Anger Expansion does exactly the opposite - it's filled with a lot of sneaky moves, game-changing abilities and \"take that\" mechanics. It's a total blast to play, but it's not for the thin-skinned. The Anger Expansion also gives players a way to incorporate Angry Dice into their games of VivaJava Dice.\nThere are many other possible expansions we could introduce to the \"Game of the Year\" Expansion pledge level if funding is healthy and we reach certain stretch goals. We'll give you sneak peeks of others as the campaign rolls along!\nThe original VivaJava: The Coffee Game campaign ran on Kickstarter in January of 2012. We were blessed with an amazing amount of support for our second game, and since its release it has been embraced by gamers for its unique semi-cooperative play style and thoughtful social interaction for 3 to 8 players. Along with VivaJava, we also offered a separate \"Geekspansion\" to the game, which added more geek-inspired Blend Slates, Country Tokens and Investment Tokens. It has never been offered anywhere outside of conventions as promotional - but if you pledge for ALL THE CAFFEINE, you can get it here! Take a look at the original VivaJava campaign page for more information on the game and its Geekspansion.\nWe've achieved our base funding goal! That means we will be able to publish VivaJava Dice with the quality that we all have come to expect. Now that we have exceeded our base, that allows us to add more to the game! \nWe've exceeded $35,000 in pledges! That means we'll be able to incorporate a solo player mode into the base game \u2013 every pledge of COFFEE REGULAR and above will receive this stretch goal! For more information on the solo play Coaster, see Project Update #2.\nWe've reached $40K in pledge! That means we'll be upgrading the \"Game of the Year\" Expansion at the COFFEE DELUXE pledge levels and above. The GOTY Expansion will receive Coasters and Research Discs themed around Dice Hate Me Games titles like Carnival, Compounded and the upcoming Brew Crafters. These will be very thematic and fun variants that will add even more replayability to your games of VivaJava Dice! For more information on the DHMG Expansion, see Project Update #2.\nWe've reached $45,000 in pledges! We can now include two new upgrades to the base game of VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game. The first upgrade is the addition of the Intern Research Disc and Coaster. This coaster is built around our concept of \"inception\" technology, allowing players to go one level deeper. When a player Researches this ability track, they place a token on one of the Intern Abilities on the Intern Coaster. Hiring an Intern opens up a large variety of dice manipulation abilities, allowing players to customize their play strategy even more!\nThe second upgrade is a set of 28 mini-sized cards - the same size and style as the Flavor cards in the original VivaJava. Twenty four of these cards are references for the 24 different Ability Discs in the base game, allowing players an easy way to keep track of abilities every time they mix up the game. Four of the cards can be placed into the Flavor Deck in VivaJava: The Coffee Game, allowing VivaJava Dice to be played with the original!\nWe've reached $50,000 in pledges, so we'll be upgrading ANGRY DICE! That's right, we have a few upgrades planned for the Angry Dice system, the first being integration of the Wild Die, originally introduced in our first Kickstarter campaign for Carnival, and the Lucky Bean die, an homage to one of our favorite blends from the original VivaJava. For more information on this awesome stretch reward, see Project Update #2 and Project Update #6.\nWe've reached $55,000 in pledges, so we'll do a double upgrade! The base game - any pledge of COFFEE REGULAR and above - will receive both a Brewple-shaped eraser, as well as a thicker score pad with more sheets! We know there's been a lot of discussion about the paper score pads, and it's always been our wish to include a little something special for gaming old school with pencils. Not only can you use the Brewple to adjust scores and Research tracks, you can also use it to designate the game's Brewmaster - the start player that comes into play with a couple of advanced variants.\nThe other aspect of the $55K stretch goal will be the remainder of the Angry Dice expansion dice. The other two dice are homages to The Great Heartland Hauling Co. and Compounded. For more information on the rules for these expansion dice, please see update #8.\nThanks to everyone for helping us reach these goals! \n\"There is real, crunchy strategy involved here in what you choose to do with your roll. Well-thought-out player interaction. Scales well from 1-4 players. And the modular set-up causes replayability to be off the charts. A very interesting, quick-playing yet thought-provoking game that I hope some will not dismiss as another too-light dice-rolling filler.\" - Jim N., Boardgamegeek.com\n\"I've been searching for a great end-of-the-night game and this is the one! Rolling fistfuls of pretty dice to make coffee blends, invest in research, and ultimately get 21 points works for me!

This is a game my wife not only asks to play regularly (she refuses to call it anything but \u201cDiced Coffee\u201d), but wants to play back to back multiple times in one sitting. So, I personally have to say the designer has succeeded in his mission.\" - Ryan Sanders, boardgamegeek.com\n\"Angry Dice plays fast and if games like Coup or Love Letter are microgames then Angry Dice is a nano game.

It has been an amazing couple of years for the company, and we are all grateful for the outstanding support of our extended Kickstarter family that have made possible four great projects - Carnival, VivaJava, The Great Heartland Hauling Co., and Compounded.\nThis time around it's TC Petty III's turn to be in the spotlight - again! You all may remember TC from his memorable VivaJava: The Coffee Game campaign video last year; he loves to make an impression. But any of you out there who have met TC over the past couple of years already know that he is nothing like his video alter ego - he is a warm, gracious and humble designer with grand ideas and an amazing passion for board games. He just happens to love poking fun at his own coffee snobbery, and we're lucky enough to catch it all on camera. ;)\nWhen I first played VivaJava: The Coffee Game in 2011, I instantly fell in love. The same thing holds true when TC unveiled VivaJava Dice in January of this year - I was blown away, and I think you all will be, too. The game is fun, unique, and incredibly addictive. Thanks in advance for all your support - now get in here and get caffeinated... again!\nAll the best,\nChris Kirkman", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project that involves the production and manufacture of a good to be delivered, there is certainly a real chance for hiccups, delays and more than one or two gremlins gumming up the works along the way. Many boardgame projects on Kickstarter have been seriously hampered by art production delays, problems with an overseas factory, missing units and one shipping snafu after another. This has never been more true than when dealing with custom dice - gremlins just love custom dice. They're delicious. True story.\n\nLuckily, we have a few projects under our belt, and have dealt with many of those snafus and gremlins along the way. We have a good working relationship with two of our overseas manufacturers and have become accustomed to their protocols, communication styles and general idiosyncrasies. We try to plan for all contingencies, and we've been fairly successful with that in our past projects. We've also been lucky enough to have an inside track with many other project creators and publishers who have produced a custom dice game in the past and so we know quite a few helpful tricks.\n\nWe won't lie - stuff happens. Delays can occur. Sometimes you have to go back and forth on color samples six times just to get the color right, and even then the color isn't perfect. But what we do promise is that we will hold ourselves to the same high standards we expect from other board game publishers, and we will be completely honest and open with each of you every step of the way.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "Something new is brewing from T.C.

Fallen is so much more thanks to you. We could not have brought this game to so many without all of your support.\nFrom all of us Watchtower Games,\nThank you!\nExtended Game Overview:\nTom Vasel Preview:\nKickstarter Video in HD: Watch Here\nDesigner Diaries: Watch Here\nFallen is a two-player card and dice game with fast and challenging game play, gorgeous art, and plenty of re-playability all wrapped up in an ever-changing story.\nOne player chooses a Hero to delve deep within a dungeon, seeking the ultimate evil that waits below. Play as Seroth the Pit Fighter and fight to win at any cost, Merace the Sorceress and cast devastating spells, or Ranek the Thief striking from the shadows.\nEvery Hero comes with a unique character card depicting the hero and the special abilities and proficiencies of that particular character. Each hero also comes with nine unique skills to choose from which are divided into three skill trees catering to a particular proficiency. Ten signature Power cards also come with each hero, giving them special abilities that are themed to their style of play.\nThe second player takes on the role of the Dungeon Lord, summoning vile creatures and ancient spells to defeat the Hero. Play as the Archivist of Souls weaving dark spells that plague the hero, the Forge Master, part wizard and part machine, filling the dungeon corridors with horribly augmented monstrosities, or as Krogarn the Ogre king sending your primal horde and spirit magic to hunt down the adventurer.\nSimilar to the Hero, the Dungeon Lord has a character card that depicts the chosen form as well as showing the special abilities used by that character. In addition, ten signature Power cards come with each Dungeon Lord that are specific to style of villainy.\nUnique Story cards bring the dungeons of Fallen to life. These cards drive the action of game forcing the Hero to make choices about actions to take or locations to explore. Each choice determines a challenge's attribute rolled, difficulty, whether a valuable Treasure or Omen card are at stake, and if any damage is taken.\nAfter adventuring through the dungeon, the Hero and Dungeon Lord clash in an epic battle between good and evil. The challenges are fast and furious as cards are played and custom dice are rolled.\nThis is the game of Fallen.\nTake a look at previews of the characters in Fallen. Click on a character's portrait to learn more.\nHeroes\nDungeon Lords\nRules of Fallen (Pre-release PDF)\nPledges at Adventurer ($40) level or higher receive a boxed game of Fallen, the digital art book featuring many of the original illustrations in the game, thank you credit in the rule book, and all stretch goals.\nThose who pledge at the top tiers of Enchanter ($200), Summoner ($200), or Sage ($200) add their custom creations as bonus content to every Kickstarter game of Fallen.\nFallen is loaded with enough content to keep you playing for a long time. If you want to pack even more adventure into your game, take your pledge to the next level by adding Adventure Packs. Each Adventure Pack ordered adds more challenges, more story, more creatures, more treasure, and helps make Fallen a reality.\nWhen you pledge at Skeleton ($55) level or higher, we will contact you at the end of the Kickstarter campaign to see which packs you want to add to your game.\nThese Adventure Packs will NOT be available for sale at retail after the end of the Kickstarter campaign.\nAs the additional content in these packs is under production, not all art assets are currently displayed.\nWith your support, additional funding will unlock stretch goals to add even more to your game.

In the game you control a group of kids in a water balloon fight.  To win, you will throw water balloons, fire water cannons, dive behind cardboard boxes and hide inside garbage cans.  When things get really tough you can even call your friends.  The object of Water Balloon Washout is to have the last kid standing in this fight. \nWater Balloon Washout is a card game that consists of 90 cards in a standard tuck box.  It will be printed by Delano Service in Battle Creek, Michigan.  Proudly made in the USA.\nHow to Play\nCheckout the rules here.\nThe Cards\nFor Water Balloon Washout we are working with the very talented artist, Brendan Keough. He is very good at creating engaging artwork that helps to draw players into the theme of the game. Here's a sample of some of the cards included in the game! The layout and backgrounds will be refined for the final version of the game.  Also, all 16 kid cards in the game will be a unique drawing of a different kid.\nEach Kid Card double sided, One side Dry, the other soaked.\nWater, Defense and Utility are the 3 card types used in the game.\nCard Breakdown\nHere's a few cards from our prototype, the artwork here is completed but the layout and backgrounds will be improved once our awesome Graphic Artist gets ahold of it. In addition our artist is still working on another 40+ images for the final game.\nReward Levels\nWater Balloon x1: At this level you get 1 copy of the game with free shipping within the US.\nWater Balloon x2: At this level you get 2 copies of the game with free shipping within the US.  This will allow you to play the game with up to 8 players by combining the decks!\nWater Balloon x3: At this level you get 3 copies of the game with free shipping within the US.  This will allow you to play the game with up to 12 players by combining the decks!\nWater Balloon x4: At this level you get 4 copies of the game with free shipping within the US.  This will allow you to play the game with up to 16 players by combining the decks!\nI'm in the Game: At this level our talented artist will take a photo that you provide of a kid, approximately between the ages of 5 and 12 and turn them into a character in the game! Two drawings will be completed, one of the kid ready to play and one of them completely soaked.  In addition you will receive a copy of the game and 2 8x10 prints, one of each piece of artwork.\nHow will we spend the funds we raise?\nAll of the funds raised for this game will be used to complete the artwork, layout the game, Produce quality copies and ship those copies to backers.  We have worked very hard to calculate the budget for this project and in addition have set aside some of our own money to cover additional expenses that may arise during the production and fulfillment process.\nStretch Goals\n$9,000 - Totally Washed Out Expansion \nThis 9 card expansion will be added to every single copy of Water Balloon Washout. The expansion will focus on adding new play variants that will increase the complexity of the game. Some of the cards included will be Sprinkler, Kiddie Pool, Fire Hydrant, Snorkel and Slippery Slide. Variant rules will be added to the game for using these cards.\n$11,000 - Fair Weather Friends Expansion\nThis 9 card expansion will be added to every single copy of Water Balloon Washout.  The expansion will focus on adding new 4 speciality kid cards and also 5 weather cards.  Each player will start with one speciality kid who has a unique ability to enhance the game.  Weather cards will be shuffled into the deck and change the entire playing field whenever they are played.  These should add a nice twist to the already fun and solid Water Balloon Washout.  Some of the cards included will be Princess (kid), Small Fry (kid), Downpour, Drought and Gusty Day. Variant rules will be added to the game for using these cards.\nMedia\n      Developed in association with\nYou can hear a lot of the development and playtesting of this game on the building the game podcast episodes here.

Much like a real water balloon fight, the game is centered more around the experience of the fight and less about who wins or loses and that makes for something great that everyone can enjoy. Quick, light and most of all fun game play ensures you will have a good time in this simple but engaging card game.\" - A.J. Porfirio, VanRyder Games\n\"Water Balloon Washout lets you enjoy all the fun of an epic water balloon fight without actually getting wet.  With simple and easy to understand rules we were playing right away.  Each game plays quickly and is perfect for a family game night.

Every card is soaked with creativity and will remind you how much fun water balloons are on a hot summer day.\" Stephen Hoogendyk, Geeta Games\nFinal Words from the designer and publisher...\nI really hope that you find Water Balloon Washout intriguing and decide to back this project.  This game has went through months of playtesting and has developed very organically.  The most often heard comment from our playtesters has been, \"When can we play this again?!\".

You do not need to change your original Reward Tier.\nFor example let's say I was backing at the \"Citizen Tier\" which is $18 for one copy of the game and a set of Swag and I wanted to add The Zombie Cards and (2) copies of \"Where Art Thou Romeo?\"\nI would keep my Reward Tier the same and simply add $10 onto my existing pledge of $18 so it would be, $18 + $4 + $4 + $2 = $28.\nWhere Art Thou Romeo? is a Nano Game in which 3-5 players take turns taking on the role of Juliet, who is attempting to find Romeo amongst the others players. Each card, other than Juliet, has two different roles from which to choose. Players holding these cards choose one of the two roles, which will subsequently make them want to convince the Juliet player that they either are or are not Romeo or perhaps point out who they think Romeo might be.\nThe game lasts 3-5 rounds depending upon the number of players with each player taking on the role of Juliet once. The player with the most influence points at the end of the game wins.\nThe citizens of Verona have grown tired of the constant quarrel between the houses of Capulet and Montague. As ruler of the region, Prince Escalus has formed a council to help mediate the conflict and bring lasting peace to Verona.\nIn Council of Verona, players take on the role of influential citizens of Verona and act to use their influence to either add characters to the council or cast them into exile. Through thoughtful hand management of their cards and clever placement of influence tokens, players gain victory points based upon the agendas of the characters at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins!\nWe've all heard the story of Romeo and Juliet \u2013 now is your chance to steer the story and determine who will rule Verona once and for all!\nTutorial Video\n3-Player Game Play Video\n*The video may freeze just the visual portion at the 2 minute mark if you're watching in standard definition.You'll need to watch this video in 480p or higher due to an internal glitch by YouTube.\nWhen Council of Verona ships, the price listed on the customs form will be the price that I, the publisher, paid for your copy of the game and any extras. This is EXCEEDINGLY lower than full retail and should substantially offset any high import fees, taxes or tariffs.This is how we have shipped every Crash Game's game and it is how we plan to keep doing it.\nJason Tagmire (Fruitless Pursuits Blog)\nClick here to read review!\n[Council of Verona] is a blast. The non-food related highlight of my trip [to Origins] - Jason Tagmire\n\nRich Sommer (AMC's TV Hit, Mad Men)\n\"Council of Verona is one of those great games you can just throw in your backpack, ready to be pulled out whenever the opportunity presents itself.

And it falls squarely between them in both size and complexity, which makes it a perfect fit.\" - Rich Sommer\nClick to read review!\n\"If AEG's Love Letter was the game that ushered in the Year of the Microgame, I honestly believe that Council of Verona is going to be the release that takes it to the next level.\" \"Cliches aside, Verona is a bloody good game.\" - Michael Fox\nLance Myxter aka Undead Viking\nRichard Ham's New Video Review Series\nClick to read review!\n\"Council of Verona should be on the radar of not only Microgame fans, but gamers in general\" - Eric Leath \nClick here to read review!\n\"...simple and brilliant game design.\" - Anthony Racano\n\"This is Crash Games' best offering yet.

The new cards are Rosaline, The Apothecary, Sampson & Balthasar.\n-Rosaline (Neutral, Agenda Card) Does not want Romeo & Juliet to be together.   Rosaline's Card will score at the end of the game if Romeo & Juliet are not together.\n-The Apothecary (Neutral, Agenda Card) wants to sell to as many people as possible so The Apothecary's Card will score at the end of the game if he is in the area with the majority of the characters (counting himself)\n-Sampson (Capulet, Ability Card) Mimic one ability of a Capulet Ability Card in the location Sampson is played.\n-Balthasar (Montague, Ability Card) Mimic one ability of a Montague Ability Card in the location Balthasar is played.\n\nStretch Reward #2 - @ $21,000\nThe Poison Expansion\n(*NOT IN RETAIL VERSION*)\nThe Poison Expansion will introduce two new tokens into the game for all 5-Player. One Poison Token & One Antidote Token. Here's a brief explanation of how the poison and antidote token work. When the game is over all Agenda Cards are checked for poison and antidote. If a card has a poison token on it without any antidote token the card is physically removed from it's location and put back into the box along with all tokens on it (this is very important as removing the card will affect Capulet/Montague Control)\nIf a card has both a poison and an antidote token on it the card is eligible to score, providing its Agenda has been met.\nAn Agenda Card with an antidote token with no poison token on it is not affected in any way as is an Agenda Card with two antidote tokens on it. \n\nStretch Reward #3 - @ $26,000\nComponents & Box Upgrade\nThis Stretch Reward will convert the cardboard influence tokens into high quality colored wooden tokens with stickers (The sticker sheet will include the numbers on one side and the \"V\" logo on the backside like the prototype Influence Tokens)\nThe box will be increasing in size slightly from the \"No Thanks\" box size to a size very close to \"The Resistance\" This is to allow for putting more stuff inside of the box. \nThe card quality will also be improving into a very nice card stock with linen finish.\n\nStretch Reward #4 - @ $31,000\nDouble Size Player Aid Mats &\nLocation Cards\nThis Stretch Reward is in direct response to backer feedback. You have spoken and I have heard you!\nThis Stretch Reward would include a  Player Aid Mat for all 5-Player (a cardboard, linen covered that will feel and look super nice) that lists all the Agendas and Abilities of every card in the game.\nAlso included will be two cards that will be played Horizontally to indicate the two separate locations that cards can be played into in Council of Verona.\nBloopers from the Kickstarter Video\nCheck out Update #1 for more choices of Council of Verona Social Media Avatars!\nWithout you, our backers, we would not be able to keep making the awesome and fun games you have come to expect from Crash Games.

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Thanks to all Kickstarter backers who built this dystopia! If you discover Euphoria after the project ends, you can order the retail version of the game (not the Kickstarter-exclusive deluxe or supreme versions) on the Stonemaier Games website.\nThe creators of the successful Kickstarter game, Viticulture, bring you a new dice worker placement game set in a dystopian future. Euphoria incorporates mechanical elements of Alien Frontiers, Tzolk'in, and The Resistance with thematic inspirations from dystopian fiction like The Hunger Games, Fahrenheit 451, Wool, and Brave New World.\nCustom dice samples to show all 6 sides of the dice. There are 4 custom dice per player in 6 colors in EVERY copy of Euphoria. 24 extra custom dice are included in the Kickstarter-only \"Supreme\" copies of the game.\nFind ALL media mentions of Euphoria on our website and join the discussion about Euphoria on Board Game Geek.\nRead Father Geek's Review here!\nRead GeekDad's Review here!\nMoney-Back Guarantee: If you decide you don't like Euphoria within the first month of receiving it, you can return it for a full refund, no questions asked.\nEarly-Bird Discount: There is no \"early-bird\" pledge level because every copy of Euphoria comes at a steep discount compared to its MSRP of $70.\nWe Listen: Our backers have told us they enjoy working with us. We are prompt with addressing any questions or concerns, and value all backer input.\nKickstarter Backers Come First: Our backers have a special place in our hearts. For Euphoria, that means you'll get your game before limited traditional distribution begins, and we will always be completely honest and transparent with you.\nBecause We Need You: We've covered the cost of the graphic design and art for Euphoria, but we can't manufacture and ship the game without your support.\nKickstarter-Exclusive Stretch Goals: See below for some major stretch goals that will make your copy of the game unique. We're also giving a digital art print of the board art to all backers.\nmost of the custom tokens in the game, including the realistic-material tokens for gold, stone, and clay (the clear glass tokens will be solid grey)\nIn Euphoria, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate the opposition, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.\nFully formatted rules here (these will be translated into 10+ languages and available for free download from our website after the project), and here are some of the unique elements of Euphoria:\nDice Represent Worker Knowledge: The number on each die represents a worker\u2019s knowledge--that is, their level of awareness that they're in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your workers gets too high, one of them might desert you.\nRecruits and Allegiances: You have 2 elite recruit cards. One has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reluctant recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game\u2026or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.\nConstructing Markets: Players who don't contribute to the construction of markets receive a dystopian-style restriction they must deal with for the rest of the game. Because different markets are available for construction each game, commodities and resources that are valuable in one game might not be worth as much in the next.\nFlow of the Game: There are no rounds and phases in Euphoria, and thus no need to determine the first player on a regular basis or memorize action checklists. On your turn you either place a worker on the board or retrieve workers from the board.\nRead in-depth discussions of the unique elements in Euphoria on third-party blog interviews as listed here. Euphoria is also on Board Game Geek.\nEvery dystopia begins with a significant event that changes the world. Starting on May 16 and ending a few weeks later, you voted to decide on the apocalypse that created the world of Euphoria. The resulting story is told in Update #13. The winning scenario inspired the creation of 4 new recruits.\nThanks to the supply chain we set up for Viticulture, we have very cost effective ways of getting your copy of Euphoria to you. We'll explain this for each region:\nUnited States and Canada (free shipping): We will ship games across the world by boat from China to the US and Canada, a process that takes about 30 days. Those games will then travel by truck to an Amazon fulfillment center (~5 days), from where they will be sent to backers in the US (5-10 days). The total shipping and customs cost per unit is about $12, which we've wrapped into the price of the game on Kickstarter. Note: We're in St. Louis, so Amazon will ship the games for St. Louis backers to us in bulk. We'll have a launch party to get the games into your hands, and we'll deliver games to anyone who can't attend.\nEuropean Union (free shipping): This is exactly the same as the Canada-bound shipment, except this one goes to Amazon.de in Germany. The total shipping and customs cost per unit is about $12, which we've wrapped into the price of the game on Kickstarter. Note: Norway and Switzerland are not in the EU, so backers in those countries should provide a EU shipping address if they want free shipping (family, friends, Poste Restante in Sweden, or a DHL pack station in the EU).\nAny country not in the EU nor the US/Canada: It's quite expensive and time consuming to ship individual packages to South America, Mexico, non-EU Eastern Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, etc. Sending 2 or 3 games per package via USPS is the only way to maintain a somewhat reasonable cost per unit for these international backers. We will mark these games as \"Kickstarter rewards\" on the customs forms using the manufacturing cost as the commercial value of the game. (Note: If you really don't want two copies of the game, you can order a single copy and add $45 for international shipping.)\nAsia/Australia/NZ (bulk pledge level only; free shipping): Our manufacturer has graciously offered to send a limited number of shipments directly from China to backers in Asia, Australia, and New Zealand (hence why these backers will get the games earlier than the rest of the world). This is only cost-effective if we send at least 10 games to each location. Hence the only pledge level available to backers in Asia, Australia, and NZ is the $490 pledge level for 10 games each. If you are an individual in those regions who only wants 1 game, you can put your name and contact info on this Google spreadsheet so people who have arranged a group buy in your country can reach out to you.\nUPDATE: We have added a $499 level for 10 copies of the game sent anywhere in the world. The key difference is that they games will be come to the US via boat, be trucked to a facility, and then packed, shipped, and sent to you. So unlike the Pacific level, you won't get the games until December. It's the best we can do!\nUPDATE (CHINA): Backers in mainland China may pledge to the DELUXE or SUPREME reward levels and receive the game directly from our shipping partner in China at no extra shipping charge.\nA few notes about some of the less self-explanatory reward levels:\nSUPREME: The 24 extra dice (4 in each color) and the 44 extra recruit cards with sketched faces will be included in the game box with 1 blank card (in addition to the full Euphoria deluxe game) by the manufacturer and thus will not be available by themselves. Neither the dice nor the cards are needed for the game (other than the faces, the recruit cards are identical to the other recruits in the game).\nIMMORTAL: There are 36 artifact cards in Euphoria (6 copies of 6 different cards). Your name or any name of your choice will be typeset at the bottom of 1 of those cards in the format, \"Discovered by ____________.\" The maximum character limit of your name is 28 characters (including spaces).\nADVANCE: Our manufacturer will send us the first few copies off the assembly line via 3-day DHL to review before they start full production. We'll send you one of those games, giving you the chance to play Euphoria months before any other backer. (ALL backers will receive their copies before limited traditional distribution.)\nMODEL: When you pledge to this level, you will select an available recruit card and take a photo of your face in a similar pose as the recruit. We will integrate your likeness into the card, and your first OR last name will be incorporated into the recruit's name.\nBULK: The bulk level includes 10+ copies of Euphoria deluxe (the word \"deluxe\" is missing from the reward level) shipped anywhere in the world.\nVITICULTURE: The Viticulture levels are limited by the number of copies at various Amazon fulfillment centers worldwide. The levels are for the retail version of Viticulture unless they say otherwise.\nrecruit cards with temporary names and face sketches\n$1 backer toast can be added to any reward if you'd like us to celebrate you, your Kickstarter project, your cat, or pretty much anything you want on camera after the Euphoria campaign is over.\n$10 extra dice and special-edition recruits can be added exactly once per copy of Euphoria deluxe you order. The 24 extra dice (4 in each color) and the 44 extra recruit cards with sketched faces will be included in the game box by the manufacturer and thus will not be available by themselves. Neither the dice nor the cards are needed for the game.\n$49 extra deluxe game can be added to reward levels for an extra copy of Euphoria deluxe. You will need to manually change the $ amount of your pledge (but not the reward level), and after the project is over, you can indicate the number of games you're receiving on the post-project survey.\n$59 extra supreme game can be added to reward levels for an extra copy of Euphoria supreme.\nAfter many months of development, we put Euphoria through a worldwide, three-round playtesting gauntlet (Viticulture backers volunteered to do this) to hone the rules and mechanics. Dozens of Kickstarter backers have also tested the game during the campaign. We've listed all playtesters in the rulebook to show our appreciation for the hugely positive effect they've had on the game.\nWe've put a significant amount of our time and personal funds into making Euphoria a polished, production-ready game. With a successful Kickstarter campaign, we'll send the final files to Panda Games in June and aim for pre-Christmas delivery to all backers.\nWe love our FLGS here at Stonemaier Games, and we know that some retailers want to stock the full Kickstarter version of the game with all stretch goals at distributor pricing. If you're a retailer, please contact Jamey directly at stonemaiergames@gmail.com.\n\"Thanks Jamey, for updating us regularly on the progression of Viticulture. I have backed numerous KS campaigns, and I can confidently say that Stonemaier Games has set a wonderful benchmark for post-campaign supporter service!\" --Mark Chen, comment on project update\n\"Next week or so? Holy yes!!! See, now THIS is how you run a campaign and engender brand loyalty.\" --Shane Charleston, after learning that Viticulture backers in Asia and Australia would receive their games a month earlier than promised (all other backers will receive their games on schedule in May)\n\"The [Viticulture] bits are great! Tons of different shapes for each different building type. I love cool bits, but in a mediocre game they do not save it. Thankfully, this game needs no saving. I am a huge fan of worker placement games in general, and this one is no different, in fact it is in a lot of ways superior to many I have played before.\" --Heather Walters, BGG review\n\"Stonemaier\u2019s work [for Viticulture] is all-around excellent, Alan and Jamey and their design team pulled off a really top-notch production, a game that\u2019s enjoyable, deep and has high replay value.\" --Jeremy Loscheider, BGG review\nViticulture: The Strategic Game of Winemaking", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nViticulture enabled us to form a game company called Stonemaier Games. It's a dream come true to design and publish board games, and we're incredibly excited to have the chance to continue to bring memorable moments to tabletops around the world.\n\nThanks to our experience with Viticulture, we know exactly what goes into creating a high-quality game and delivering it on time. Stonemaier Games now has a worldwide supply chain set up to ensure punctual and cost-effective delivery to backers in almost every country. We're still learning, but we're not inventing the wheel this time around. We're also working with the same manufacturer again (Panda GM), so we know exactly what they need to produce quality product on schedule.\n\nBecause of Euphoria's success, we will be dealing with a much larger-scale project than Viticulture. This will be a learning process with shipping and distribution, but we have confidence in our shipping company and in Amazon.\n\nStonemaier Games established an advisory board of industry veterans in January '13 to help us mitigate risks and challenges. So even though we will surely face new challenges in the future, we have an incredible team of experienced advisors to point us in the right direction.\n\nIf you would like to know more about what we learned from our first Kickstarter experience, go to www.stonemaiergames.com to see 30+ Kickstarter Lessons to help you create a successful project too.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Finally, an Expansion!", "update_content": "Hi!

There is a CHARACTER, holding an ITEM, completing an ACTION, in a LOCATION. Each of these elements can be used to create something new, get you out of a mid-project slump, or just to have some creative fun with family and friends.\nThe cards also feature additional icons in the corners to help you dig a little deeper into storytelling, creating, and gaming. The icons represent a RANK, SUIT, MOOD, SEASON, LETTER, and COLOR. There are a few more surprises within those icons, but we'll get into all of that later.\nNow, how can I use these cards? There are so many ways. It just depends on what you are doing. \nARE YOU A WRITER who needs a location for a scene or just a character to spark a new adventure? Flip a card and you've got one! \nARE YOU A DUNGEON MASTER running a modern day RPG and you need a special item for your party? Flip a card and you've got one! \nARE YOU A TEACHER trying to encourage your students' writing skills? Pass out a card to each student and let their imagination finish the story. \nARE YOU JUST LOOKING FOR SOME CREATIVE FUN? Flip 5 cards and craft a scenario using an element from each card. Pass the cards to the next player to continue the story. Keep passing, it's a blast!\nThere are so many more uses for Storyteller Cards, many of which you will come up with on your own. We also have a whole bunch for you in our Storyteller Pads and Storyteller Manual. \nSTORYTELLER KITS: Starting at the $25 pledge level, you can get a kit that contains a full color printed 50-100 page pad, 2 interactive pencils, and two decks of cards. The pad features a game or activity that you can play over and over alone or with friends. The pencils are interactive in that when you sharpen them, the small challenges on the sides will start to change (example: the Artist pencils feature moods to set the tone of your story, and the Director pencils feature the three-act story structure to encourage additional writing and sharpening!).\nArtist Kit: Comic Challenge. Create a comic alone or with friends!\nDirector's Kit - Director's Cut. Players create their own film using just 8 cards!\nChildren's Kit - Once Upon A Time. An activity where the children get to tell the story! (Ages 3+)\nORIGINAL ARWORK: Starting at the $100 pledge level you will receive one of The original illustration for one of the cards, signed by artist Campbell Whyte. These are 1/2 A4 sized (around 5.25\" x 8\") and are each one of a kind.\nYOU CAN BE A STORYTELLER CARD: We have an opportunity to make 6 backers into Storyteller characters. We already have the character types, items, actions and locations chosen, but Campbell Whyte will illustrate you as the character! This will require some coordination, so if you have any questions about the character types available, contact us beforehand. Note: All but one are based off of adult characters.\nYou can add any of the items below to your pledge by adjusting your pledge amount. After the campaign ends, we will send you a survey to determine what you pledged for. Please message me with any questions.\nNOTE: International shipping is $7 for one deck and $10 for everything else. If you add-on any items (except stickers), please make sure you adjust your standard international shipping to $10. \n\nWe've had some ideas for Stretch Goals and we'll post more on those here as the campaign continues. For now, here's:\nSTORYTELLER MANUAL\nThe Storyteller Manual is a book of games, activities, and examples of uses for the Storyteller Cards created by very talented game designers, writers and artists from throughout the world (Scott King, Carey Pietsch, Tim Rodriguez, Kevin Kulp, Daniel Solis, Scott Almes, John du Bois, Jay Treat, Kevin Spak, Sam Liberty, Charles Beauvais, Gaetan Pappalardo and many more). The Storyteller Manual will be a free PDF for all backers, as wells a $11 US / $13 International Add-On purchase.  \nABOUT THE DESIGNER: Jason Tagmire is a game designer from South Jersey. He is best known for reducing our 16th president to 16-bits in his card game / video game, Pixel Lincoln. He's the designer of the upcoming AEG card-throwing game, Maximum Throwdown. He was also co-set designer on Quarriors: Quest of the Qladiator, co-creator of the pop-culture site Fruitless Pursuits, and the Kickstarter curator for the Philadelphia chapter of the International Game Design Association.\nABOUT THE ARTIST: You may know Campbell Whyte from his amazing illustration series 8-Bit Dreams, where he illustrated a whole bunch of classic Nintendo Games. I have quite a collection of the originals, snagging up Megaman 2, Blades of Steel and many others as soon as they went on sale. Campbell is a great friend and an amazing artist, so I'm thrilled to be able to work together on this project.\nABOUT THE PUBLISHER: Button Shy is \"The Cardboard World of Designer Jason Tagmire and Friends\". Jason has been involved in the game industry for 5 years now, starting out with self-publishing and print-on-demand and then working on projects with companies such as Wizkids, Game Salute, Island Officials, AEG and more. This will technically be the first Button Shy release, but with the history of self-publishing and the experience on the design side has led to an opportunity to branch out on our own with a relatively small and confined project.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAny creative production has risks and ours are just like everyone else's.

Within each of these areas there can be snags and hiccups and thankfully we have many professional and seasoned friends and family members that have offered to lend their hand and expertise in getting us off of the ground and getting us through any hurdles. \n\nMy personal experience in working on games like Pixel Lincoln has given me a front row seat (and often drivers seat too) in the manufacturing and post-production of a board/card game, and I'll be putting everything I learned to use once again.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Only 2 days left for Storyteller Cards: Fantasy on Kickstarter", "update_content": "Hey everyone! \nI just wanted to pop in one last time and remind you about our campaign for the second deck of Storyteller Cards.

See the FAQ section below\nHelp bring the smash indie hit of 2012 back!\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce a collaborative effort with Rikki Tahta & La Mame Games to make this fantastic game more readily available for everyone to enjoy.  We have everything ready, including the incredibly amazing artwork that this game deserves - all we need now is some help to fund the production and shipping to get games to you.\nThe Resistance: Coup\nIn the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new \u201croyal class\u201d of multi-national CEOs.Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of The Resistance have created discord, intrigue and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse.  But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.\nTo be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.  In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.\nIf you are not already familiar with Coup - here is a quick overview and review of the 1st edition from Tom Vasel, an industry leading reviewer  Note - this is 1st edition of the game. Rewards for this project will be for the same game (no changes to the rules), but the artwork & box will be different.\nThere are a number of other great reviews for this game, including these links:  Undead Viking Video Review, Trent Hamm - Written Review, I Slay The Dragon - Written Review\n\nRikki Tahta - the designer of Coup explains his game to the BGG team at Essen 2012.  Note - this is 1st edition of the game.  Rewards for this project will be for the same game (no changes to the rules), but the artwork & box will be different\nPromos\nCoup Promos - Every pledge reward level will include a set of cards for \"The Inquisitor\", an alternative role card that can be used in place of the game's \"Ambassador\" role.  And as a stretch reward, we are also including an Inquisitor token for The Resistance.  Note - Each copy of Coup you pledge for will come with a set of these promos. \nThe Resistance promos - Also included in every reward package are dsytopian themed Merlin & Assassin cards. If you are a fan of the art from The Resistance, and want to add these roles from The Resistance:Avalon, you'll love these promos.  Note - Each copy of Coup you pledge for will come with a set of these promos.\nThe Resistance Avalon Promos - if your pledge rewards include The Resistance: Avalon, you'll also get a copy of the cards needed to play the Excalibur and Lancelot variants of this game.\nAlso included in every reward level will be the two fixed cards for The Resistance Avalon.  These cards correct the misspelled word \"Unkown\".\nAdd-ons\nExcalibur/Lancelot promos - these are included at no additional cost for each copy of Avalon you are receiving as part of your rewards ($35 & $50 pledge levels). If you want to add the Excalibur/Lancelot promo cards on their own you can do so by adding $6 to your pledge, as an alternative you can get these from the boardgamegeek.com store for the same price.\n\nMayDay Premium Sleeves in the 65mm x 100mm size can be added to all reward levels for an additional $3.99. These are high quality sleeves perfect for keeping secret information secret. The sleeve packs contain 80 sleeves - and Coup with promos is at 30 cards now, so you will have some extras to share with your friends or to use on a second set of cards.\nExtra copies of Coup for the ten packs - The highest of our reward tiers, you can add additional copies of Coup for $12 (US shipping) or $15 (Anywhere outside of the US). This is only available on the ten pack.\nExtra copies of Coup for the $35 & $50 reward levels - US SHIPPING ONLY!!!! - You can add additional copies of Coup for $13.  This is only for shipping to the US, the reason is that this causes a big jump in international shipping rates as the package would now weigh more than four pounds.\nAdding The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon for the six & ten packs - you can add either of these games for $15 (US Shipping) or $20 (Anywhere outside of the US). This is only available on the six & ten packs. These copies will be sent at the same time as your copies of Coup.\nAdding extra copies of The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon for the $35 & $50 reward levels - US SHIPPING ONLY!!!! - you can add either of these games for $15 These copies will be sent at the same time as your copies of Coup.  This is only for shipping to the US, the reason is that this causes a big jump in international shipping rates as the package would now weigh more than four pounds.\nTo include any of these add-ons - first click the \"manage pledge\" button, then increase your pledge amount without changing your reward level.\nAt the end of the project kickstarter will send you a project survey (about 6 weeks before games are ready to ship) - in that project survey I will capture all the information I need to get all the information that I need to get your rewards to you including numbers and composition of your add-ons.\nAll the Add-ons are priced per unit (eg, Add-on The Resistance $15/$20 is for one copy of the game).\nStretch Rewards\nWe'll introduce a limited line of stretch goals for this project - a combination of promos and exclusive promos cards featuring alternative art.  These promo cards will highlight your contribution to this project and I am sure will be highly sought after the project ends.  \n$10K - Box upgrades - see update #1, we are upgrading the game box with a very elegant and attractive foil finish box.\n$15K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Captain - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$20K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Contessa - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$25K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Ambassador - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$30K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Duke - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$35K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Assassin - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game. At this point your copy of Coup will have enough cards to play 7 or 8 players!\n$40K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Inquisitor promo - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game (the Inquisitor promo won't be in the retail game either!). At this point your copy of Coup will have enough cards to play 7 or 8 players with either the Ambassador or the Inquisitor roles!\n$50K - The Resistance token of \"The Inquisitor\" - This is an optional role for Don Esridge's The Resistance, familiar to Avalon fans as the \"Lady of the Lake\".\n$70K Extra Set of Coup Roles -  a second set of the Exclusive Promo role cards that have already been unlocked.  With these extra cards you can play up to 10.\n$90K More alternative art - We'll replace the 6 role cards from the $70K reward with new alternative art cards.  This means that you can either play up to 10, or you can play up to 6 with unique art on every card.  These are also Exclusive Promo cards.\n$110K \"kickstarter edition\" game box -  Final details aren't worked out, but I am thinking that we would include the kickstarter logo on the box side and on the box back (in place of the bar code).  This will only be done for the first printing - so it will be another very unique item that you can only get if you were part of this project (or getting this game in Essen 2013).\nKickstarter editions of the game will feature a dual sided player aid. One side will have the all the roles for the retail version and the other side will replace the ambassador with the inquisitor. Just another small way to thank you all for your support and distinguish the version of the game that you are getting as backers.\n$130K Coin Upgrade - an upgrade to foil backed coins that feel very futuristic. We are still experimenting with different holo foils to find the one that is going to work the best - but here is what we are looking at for the $130K stretch reward upgrade coins:\n\nNew stretch rewards are added as they are unlocked.  Promos are things that aren't going to be included in the retail version of the game. Exclusive promos are items that are even more limited than our standard promos, and will only be available through Indie Boards and Cards (at events like Essen for example) or our direct representatives. We aren't limiting any of these promos to kickstarter, but it's still not going to be easy to get the exclusives outside of kickstarter.\nWhat is the \"World of The Resistance\"\nIndie Boards and Cards started by publishing three games in 2010 - the biggest success of those games was The Resistance designed by Don Eskridge.  The Resistance is a game of secret identities, deduction and deception for 5-10 players.  The game play instill a deep sense of mistrust among the players, and makes for a great time among friends and families.   The setting for The Resistance is a dystopian future, but a rather bland future.  As the popularity of The Resistance continues to grow there have been more and more requests to develop a comprehensive back story for the game.  Coup is the first step in this direction, and I am optimistic that we will see the story behind The Resistance provide more background for future games from Indie Boards and Cards.\nIf you are not familiar with the game play of Don Eskridge's The Resistance, you can get no better explanation then watching this celebrity filled cast playing the game:\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of the first edition of Coup were good, and I am very optimistic about this edition of the game - I am just not sure that the game is going to be  popular enough to print in the minimum required print runs and sell them via distribution.  \n\nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of right now.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game - the promos for Coup, The Resistance and The Resistance: Avalon.  Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you.  We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production. \nWhat are the shipping costs to Canada?\nKickstarter only lets you list one international shipping charge, so if you are getting the $35 or $50 pledge rewards sent to Canada - please select \"Ship to the US\" (this is a manual process) and then add the extra $ to your pledge as follows:\n$35 Pledge Levels - $15 extra (Pledge $50 respectively for this reward level)\n$50 Pledge Level - $20 Extra (pledge $70 for this reward level)\nInternational Shipping - Outside of Canada - Kickstarter should Charge this automatically\n$35 Pledge Levels - $20 extra (Pledge $55 respectively for this reward level)\n$50 Pledge Level - $30 Extra (pledge $80 for this reward level)\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools.   Be sure to look for The Resistance, Flash Point: Rescue, and Gauntlet of Fools wherever games are sold. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I promise that if you keep your comments positive and proactive that the project will get more in the way of stretch goals and get your rewards to you sooner. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less. Have an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #49", "update_userinfo": "Ready to go on a Quest?", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #48", "update_userinfo": "Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition", "update_content": "Just a short update to let everyone know that the kickstarter for Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition is up (and in it's final hours).

We have a thriving artist community, a huge entrepreneur community, and a world class Museum of Art.   We are also home to the largest retailer in the world.  This area has a strong, growing economy, but we are missing the boat when it comes to social media marketing and crowd funding.  \n*UPDATE*\nIf you are interested in \"attending\" the seminar, but can't make it to NWA, all reward tiers $20 and up will receive video of the session in addition to any other rewards.\nBlank Wall Games, a Springdale based board game design start up, is sponsoring a lecture and workshop event for the entire NWA region.  The current dates for the event are April 19th and 20th.  The venue will be revealed in a later update as well as the specific schedule for each day.  Tickets at the door will be $15 for Friday and $20 for Saturday if any are left so back now and reserve yours at a discount.\n When we were first looking for funding we realized that traditional investment paths were not going to work for us.  We turned to Kickstarter, jumped in feet first and were quickly in over our heads.  Dominique stumbled upon a podcast hosted by Richard Bliss that was specific to our industry and we were lucky enough to win a 15 minute Skype Marketing conference.  Within minutes Richard honed in on what was right and wrong with our campaign and offered valuable advice on how to turn our failing campaign into a marketing platform, as well as pointed tips on how to run our relaunch.\nAfter talking with locals and getting more involved in the business and non profit scene in NWA we quickly came to realize how many people here could benefit from the same kind of expert help we were fortunate enough to receive.  So back in January we approached Richard about coming down to NWA and doing something new.  Taking the crowd funding podcast and articles he writes and instead doing a lecture and workshop to actually teach an entire region how to break into this new and quickly growing capital market.\nRichard is a Senior VP of Social Tech Media with over 20 years of marketing experience, a contributor to Forbes Magazine, the host of Funding the Dream, author of Stealing the Show, and one of the foremost experts on crowd funding. You can also view his LinkedIn profile here.\nWhen we first decided to do this project we aproached what we felt were the traditional sources of marketing and funding knowledge in the area, the University of Arkansas and our local Chamber of Commerce.  It turns out they were just as in the dark about this as we were and just as excited to have Richard come down and speak to the region.  Unfortunately due to charter and bureaucracy issues neither group was well positioned to pull this off in a timely manner.  I say timely because with the recent passing of the JOBS act we may see a new explosion in crowd funding when the SEC finally releases the regulations for non certified investors to use crowd funding for investment as well as reward based funding.  If we wanted the area ready and knowledgeable when the new regulations and market places hit the pipeline we would need to move quickly.\nThat's where you come in.  By backing this project you are investing in the future of NWA.  Your pledge will be used to fund the lecture and workshops that will help propel the region into the new marketplace ready to take advantage of all the capital sitting out there.  The money from this campaign will be used to offset the costs of the venue, compensate our guest speaker, and help with promotional materials.  Any profits generated from this event will be donated to GBSC, a local anti-violence, anti-bullying organization.\nKickstarter campaigns are difficult work and take a lot of prep and maintenance, but going in ready and armed with expert knowledge will help you get ahead and stay ahead.  So back this project and help us teach North West Arkansas how to turn this revolution in capital funding to our advantage.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nBarring catastrophic events this is a zero risk project.

Looking around we find very limited options when it comes to good tactical board games that parents and their kids can play together,  and be on equal footing.  The name and theme were actually inspired by our son Octavian.  The first animal sound he ever learned was that dinosaurs roar, and so as far as he is concerned every animal sound should be a roar.  We were driving past a farm and he began frantically pointing at the cows in the field moo-roaring as loud as he could and we absolutely cracked up and responded that yes those were some monster moos he was making.  That led to a discussion about monsters who were cows and that became the final piece of the puzzle we had been trying to solve for months.\nMonster Moos! is designed to be accessible to adults and kids and quick to play.  The game supports for 2-6 players, ages 6+ and is meant to last from 30-60 minutes with minimal set up time.  Monster Moos! was developed to help bridge the gap between adult hobby games and kid's games, but Monster Moos! is a fun game for everyone no matter your board game experience level.\nIn Monster Moos! players take on the role of inter-dimensional cowboys riding the range in a limbo plane called \"The Field\".  The Field is populated by monstrous cows (called Moos) that have escaped from their home dimensions.  Your goal is to try to wrangle as many Dragon Moos, Ghost Moos, Cyborg Moos, and/or Zombie Moos as you can before the other cowboys.  You can go for quantity and get a larger herd, 25 Moos to be precise, or quality, and get a pedigree 15 Moo herd of all the same type of Moo.\nGAMEPLAY VIDEO\nAll the art shown below is beta art!\nOur goal with Monster Moos!\nAs we said our goal was to create a family friendly fun party game and our out-of-house testing indicates we have succeeded.  What we need now is funding to take our game from the prototype to a full-scale ready-to-hit-the-shelves product.  Our artist has worked hard to interpret our childish scrawls into masterpieces of design!  As the kickstarter continues we will slowly release teasers of the final art in the released game.  \nBlack and White\nNow with a little help from you this awesome game will go from our table to yours by August 2013.\nBeta Prototype Board - Not completed artwork on cards, tokens, or board\nReward Tiers:\nShipping to the US and Canada included. INTERNATIONAL BACKERS PLEASE ADD $20 TO YOUR PLEDGE: Any pledge $75 and above gets international shipping FREE!\nAnyone is free to pledge however much money they want for any reward within their pledge range or no reward at all if they just want to back us. However, we have some awesome rewards planned and have visuals below.\nYou can add an additional copy of the game to any tier for $25 and a t-shirt for just $15.\nHere's a visual of the reward tiers! \nAt the end of the campaign we will make a video showing the development of Monster Moos! if it's successful.

We're getting the game at a great price from them, but they have a minimum requirement in how many we have to order. Tooling is required to set up the machines to produce our game, testing is the cost to ensure the manufactured product is safe and follows the required laws for retail here in America, and production is the cost of the actual units at their minimum quantity.\nIn addition to production, there is also the shipping from the factories to our warehouse which is relatively expensive as well. There are also Kickstarter and Amazon fees. Our company goal is to keep the cost of games down and to reward those who support us. The game will retail for $30, but all Kickstarter backers will get it for $25 which is going to include shipping of course to the US and Canada. (INTERNATIONAL BACKERS PLEASE ADD $20 TO YOUR PLEDGE FOR SHIPPING: Any pledge $75 and above gets international shipping FREE!)\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$15,750\nBetter art! We'll hire a graphic designer to improve the quality and appearance of the cards!\n$20,000  \nWe will make a complete documentary video of everything it took to make Monster Moos, all of the companies we contacted, all of the bumps we ran into, all the advice we received along the way, and tips for other people interested in this process. This video will only be available to backers.\n$25,000\nWe've unlocked a higher manufacturing tier and are able to produce more copies of the game! THANK YOU! This makes it cheaper for us AND you! For all tiers Drifter! ($25) and above we will be sending you a $5 with your order. \n$35,000\nWe will have custom made Moo figurines! These will be an add-on to your current order and we'll have the Dragon Moo, Zombie Moo, Ghost Moo, and Cyborg Moo cast in a 3\" tall statue.\n$45,000 - MOOPLE INVASION\nThe chipboard tokens will be replaced with plastic Monster Moo Mooples. \n$55,000\nWe'll put out an IOS app for Monster Moos, allowing you to play the game right from your Apple device!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe predict little problem with the game going live. We have already secured a production company and have quotes in hand. (Although if things fall through with them, somehow, we have two others lined up.) We vetted many producers before finally settling on ours. \n\nWith that said it is possible for there to be delays in the form of weather delays with shipping, quality check delays, and product testing. However the production company has given us a timeline of around 3 months for production so even with delays we should still have product in hand by August 1. We have conservatively put our estimated delivery date at that time to account for any possible delays. Our plan is to get rewards out far sooner than this. The official release date is during GenCon Aug 15, 2013-Aug 18, 2013, but backers will receive their rewards before it goes on sale.\n\nI will not lie, shipping rewards to numerous backers can be a daunting task, but we are preparing for that by checking with local shipping companies for bulk rates and large pickup, and are enlisting the help of our local community and family members (free labor powered by guilt and delicious baked goods) to help us ensure that all rewards will go out. \n\nThe only other issue may be with supply of the Custom Wooden Collectors board. They are being produced by a local craftsman and hand carved but we will stay in contact with all backers at that level and fulfill the reward as quickly as we can get them made and still ensure the quality of the product. These will start being made immediately upon completion of the Kickstarter, so they should also all be ready by the time the game is ready to go out.\n\nA similar issue may arise with the stretch goal Moo figurines, but as those are being mass produced from a custom sculpt and the producer has assured us that an August deadline is perfectly achievable, we are not overly concerned about this.\n\nAny delays will result in updates being sent to all effected backers immediately.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Blank Wall Games\n3 created \u00b7 78 backed\nWe (Dominique and Olivia) are longtime game enthusiasts, and parents.

In my opinion, we need as many games like that as we can get.\" -Games And Grub\n\"Look at some of the neat components you can get!\" -Gamesalute News\nThe Game\nGnomes: The Great Sweeping of Ammowan may best be described as a family-friendly, scavenger hunt / storytelling game. It has been built from the ground up with the sole purpose of igniting the imagination of children. It can be run as a simple adventure for small children like an Easter egg hunt, as an immersive adventure with clues and riddles, as a scavenger hunt, as a map reading adventure, or as a GPS adventure. \nCreate shared memories of the time when your family \"saved the gnomes of Ammowan\". \nGnomes: The Great Sweeping of Ammowan includes:\n 1 storytelling book \n 1 contact letter from the gnomes Read it!\n 1 blank parchment for customizing your own map\n 5 award certificates for those who complete the quest See it!\n 1 thank you letter from the gnomes\nThe storyteller's book provides the story, background, objectives, tips and step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run the game. The book is also packed with wonderful art by Steve Ebdon and Luis Francisco!\nBack cover\nThe game is run in 6 steps:\nStep 1: Review\nIn this phase the storyteller reads through all of the provided materials, becomes familiar with the backstory, and learns what he/she must do to create memories to last a lifetime. \nFor the best results, read instructions first\nStep 2: Prepare Ammowan\nIn this phase the storyteller plants evidence of a gnome civilization that players will discover on their quest. Included in the guidebook are step-by-step instructions on how to create everything from a rustic gnome fire pit to a branch-powered, gnomish saw. The evidence can all be created with basic household tools and items, and the step-by-step details make it simple to do! And if you want a zero fuss option, be sure to check out our reward levels that include gnome-sized items like buckets, baskets, garden tools and other such evidence. Ammowan can be prepared on a wooded spot, beach, piece of lawn, or even in a basement, barn, or attic.\nBuild your own branch-driven, gnomish saw with step-by-step instructions!\nStep 3: Prepare the Map (optional)\nIn this phase the storyteller can create a custom map on the provided map paper. While optional, a map helps personalize the game, ties it to the location, and provides an immersive guide to your young adventurers.\nStep 4: The Gnomes Make Contact\nIn this phase a contact letter arrives from the gnomes that is read aloud to players. The letter not only lays the foundation of the story, but makes your adventurers main characters! The storyteller's guide provides options and instructions on how to deliver the letter in a believable manner. This is the player's introduction to the adventure, and it's best done without them having any knowledge of what's about to unfold.\nStep 5: The Adventure\nThis is the main part of the game, when adventurers go on their quest to save the gnomes of Ammowan from the great sweeping of trolls, which is less than a day away. The storyteller will guide them as they follow clues, uncover the secrets of gnome society, solve puzzles, and protect their new friends by removing all evidence of Ammowan before the trolls arrive. Choose from 5 different adventure types, or mix and match.\nGear up and go, trolls are dumb, but should not be taken lightly!\nStep 6: The Ending\nIf the adventurers succeed, a second letter will be delivered thanking them for their service along with an official award certificate signed by the Lord Chancellor of Ammowan himself! Your adventurers will henceforth be known as \"protectors of gnomes\", and it may be that they are called on again in the future!\nKickstarter Rewards\nIn addition to the book, we have other rewards to offer.\nHere are some images of the Kickstarter Rewards provided at different pledge levels.\nAny of the gnome figure or necklace rewards are hand sculpted out of polymer clay by Little Chirp Designs in Florida.

Players truck to various locations around America's Heartland, picking up and dropping off goods using matching cards from their hands. All locations have native goods that require fewer cards to load; other locations may pay a premium for those goods but may also require more fuel - and time - to get there with the cargo. With limited space in each trailer and only five cards in hand at a time, players will have to expertly manage their resources, as well as play the odds and press their luck to be the best trucker on the road.\nClick Here to Pin It!\nThe Great Heartland Hauling Co. will offer a lot of replay value through the use of cards to create a variable board set-up each game. The game will include 60 goods cubes, 4 thick cardboard trucks, and 46 resource cards - required for pick-up and delivery - that are drawn from a shared draft board, as well as 19 fuel cards, which are used to move about the Heartland. The cards and components will be of the same high quality as in Carnival, the first release from Dice Hate Me Games. The box size will also be the same, so you can easily take it with you on the road!\nThe Great Heartland Hauling Co. is a game for 2 to 4 players, ages 10 and up, and designed by Jason Kotarski.

When I played with the Parent and Child geeks, the game was about moving as fast as you could, and the players more or less stayed out of each others way. When I played with the Gamer Geeks, players were stealing goods out from under other players and hording them to ensure other players couldn\u2019t score points. In both cases, the game was well received and highly enjoyed. Although, I\u2019ll never be able to look at ham cubes on a salad again and not think 'pink pig chunks'.' - Cyrus, Father Geek\n\"It\u2019s really a game about careful planning, good timing, and a little luck combined with adapting your strategy. Your end game is really important, but be careful to get there at the right time. This makes it an interesting game. It\u2019s one I look forward to playing again.\" - John Moller, Cartrunk Entertainment\n\"The balance between a quick game and feeling like a game was actually played is difficult, and the designer did a great job of getting the balance right for this game. I borrowed the game later for a two player game with just Sam and myself, and I had a really hard time returning the prototype to Chris. I wanted to take the game home just so I could play it more.\" - Ken Grazier, Geek-Craft\n\"I got to play Heartland Hauling at WBC. It's like a light version of Steam.

Many of you have been on this incredible journey with us since our first Kickstarter project, Carnival, and stayed buckled in through the incredible ride of VivaJava: The Coffee Game. For that, we are forever grateful.\nAnd now it's time to help us navigate through the highways and biways of yet another project - The Great Heartland Hauling Co. Your pledges and support have been instrumental in keeping the engines of Dice Hate Me Games   purring like a well-oiled machine, and your continued support can help us to maintain the dream in which we - and more than a few of you - continue to believe. We couldn't have done it without you, and we want all of you to know that we are thankful in your sharing of our vision of a publishing company that can bring fun, unique, and accessible games to you, your friends and family.\nWhether you are an old friend or new, if you stick with us and share with others we promise that this ride will never get old. You all are an inspiration, and we guarantee to keep bringing the fun!\nAll the best,\nCherilyn & Chris", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"status": []}], "comment_no": 227, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dicehateme/the-great-heartland-hauling-co-a-card-game-for-2-4", "project_name": "The Great Heartland Hauling Co: A card game for 2-4 truckers"}}, {"backer": "A.J. Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "The Resistance: Avalon pits the forces of Good and Evil in a battle to control the future of civilization. Arthur represents the future of Britain, a promise of prosperity and honor, yet hidden among his brave warriors are Mordred's unscrupulous minions. These forces of evil are few in number but have knowledge of each other and remain hidden from all but one of Arthur's servants. Merlin alone knows the agents of evil, but he must speak of this only in riddles. If his true identity is discovered all will be lost.\nThe Resistance: Avalon is a stand alone game. It does not require you to have The Resistance to play, but it remains compatible so you can combine games.\nLike the newly released 2nd Edition of The Resistance, The Resistance: Avalon features upgraded components from the 1st Edition of The Resistance.  These upgrades include thick tokens for voting and tracking players on the quest (mission).  The game also includes 6 tableaus, one for each player count, with incredible illustrations. \nIf you are so excited about this game, why do you need kickstarter funding to get it made?\nIt is all about what we call cashflow. Making board games is a cash intensive proposition.  The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of right now.  I simply do not have the money in the account right now to get these games made in time for Essen without your support - and I really don't want to miss having these games at Essen, the biggest game show of the year!\nSo I hope that you support this project and help bring this very exciting new version of a great game to market.\nPromo cards:  To thank you, all support levels will receive special promotional cards (10 promo cards in total):\nExcalibur: An additional mechanic that gives a player selected by the leader a strong ability every Quest.  But this great strength must be used wisely, so choose carefully whom to entrust with its power.\nLancelot: 2 additional character cards,and 7 supporting cards, that can be played in three different ways.\nStretch Goals\nWith over a year in development, our plans are pretty set on what will come in the box, and what we have to offer as promos.  I am not holding that back to offer later as stretch goals, nor am I offering an inflated price to be subsidized with \"free\" extras.  We know what works best and have included that in the game box.  The promo items are extras that require more explanation so best suited for expert gamers (such as yourselves) that can handle more complex rule explanations and will be more likely to appreciate the nuanced game play that they add to an already complete game.  So that is a long way to explain that there aren't a whole slew of stretch goals that are waiting to be rolled out - and I won't be making things up to throw in as a marketing gimmick, if we have thought of it and tested it and liked it, its in the game already.\nI have one very big, and what I think is a very exciting idea for a stretch goal that I need to full bake out before announcing.  It will be a super stretch goal that will be included at every support level, but rather than get people excited for what might not happen or I might be able to deliver I'll wait to make sure that I can make it happen before making an announcement.\nBest way to make this (and other ideas I might come up with) - stay positive, and be active in promoting the project.

Positive (and unfortunately Negative) comments are infectious!\nFlash Point: Fire Rescue - second chance!\nBy request, add Flash Point to your order.

It is currently on it's way and slated to be delivered within the promised time frame. Without a revenue stream we are unable to produce The Lost Dutchman. Without your help, The Lost Dutchman simply and sadly won't see the light of day it deserves.\nThe Lost Dutchman at Origins\nIn this video we talk about our first published game Rise! our current Kickstarter Project for The Lost Dutchman as well as what Crash Games hopes to accomplish as a game publisher.\nPurpose\nCrash Games is anything but your average, run of the mill game design company. We are a small, passionate company. Crash Games is committed to the highest quality standards in design, publishing, game play and customer service. Crash Games mission is three fold, Creation, Community and Contribution.\nCreation\nCrash Games is in the business of designing games that we think are fun, creative and engaging. As fanatical gamers ourselves we strive to provide games that are of the highest quality both in design and components. Nothing is worse than having a game with sub-par components or a game that is great to play but has a terrible design or artistic quality. Crash Games will have no part in poor quality or design.\nCommunity\nCrash Games recognizes that the board game community is a community filled with phenomenal people that have enriched our lives and the lives of so many others. The board game community is largely in part giving, compassionate, nurturing, truthful, gloriously fanatical and comprised of people of amazingly great caliber and quality. Crash Games is committed to furthering, aiding, harboring and uniting people through board games.\nCrash Games is extremely cognitive of the psychological impact board games have on families, spouses, partners and groups compromised of people that are as diverse as the components in the games we all play. We are committed to enacting programs, groups and missional gatherings that use board games as a mortar in a world that is largely in part fractured and non-personal in an effort to unify and engage people that are used to being closed off, marginalized and compartmentalized into a demo graph society is familiar and comfortable with.\nContribution\nThe Board game Community is one of immense contribution whether it is charitable, collaborative or giving. Crash Games is committed to being a leader on this front as we will always use our influence, resources, talents and knowledge to primarily help others within and outside of the community as well as those less fortunate. This will be realized not only through our company but through our non-profit organization, Meeples 4 Peoples, whose primary purpose is to teach valuable life skills to youth that are exiting the foster care system through the power of playing board games. If there is a need Crash Games will be there to contribute in any and every way we possibly can.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Pay Dirt is LIVE on Kickstarter NOW!", "update_content": "Hey Everybody!\nFirst off my apologies if you get this message a couple time.

Today. Thanks for your support!\nFor a long, long time, goblins and fairies have lived in a magical world right beneath our noses. If you look hard enough, you can find rings of mushrooms, called \u201cfairy rings\u201d, which act as doors between their world and ours. Today, a gang of mischievous goblins escaped from the fairy ring, and it is up to the players to send them back before they cause trouble! But an ancient spell of rhymes which transforms goblins into fairies and fairies into goblins makes this a trickier task than you might think\u2026\nGoblins Drool, Fairies Rule! is for 2 to 4 players, and has special solitaire rules for a single player. The game takes about 15 minutes to setup and play. The components consist of 20 unique cards, each card having one side representing a Goblin, and another side representing a Fairy. Each side of a card has one of 4 Symbols: a Sun, a Moon, a Mushroom, or a Frog. The names of the Fairies and Goblins are divided into 5 rhyming groups, each name ending in one of five sounds.\nPlayers begin the game with 4 cards each, goblin-side-up. 4 cards are placed fairy-side-up in the middle of the table, called the \"Fairy Ring\". The goal of the game is to be the first player to get rid of all their Goblins by sending them to the Fairy Ring, or be the first to obtain 6 Fairies. Players take turns adding one of their cards to the Fairy Ring. When a card is added, any other cards in the Fairy Ring which rhyme with the name on the added card are flipped over: Fairies become Goblins and Goblins become Fairies. Once all rhyming cards have been flipped over, the player then takes any cards from the Fairy Ring which match the symbol on the added card. The first player to end their turn with no more Goblins, or with 6 Fairies, wins the game.\nThe game was designed by David Luis Sanhueza, with illustrations by Mike Maihack.

You will pay for shipping separately, when your items are ready to ship. So there's no need to include shipping with your pledge. We will email you a link to enter your info, which will also allow you to save on shipping if (for example), you wanted to combine your package with other backers or combine other eligible projects that are fulfilled by Game Salute. Your final shipping cost will be based on the actual cost to ship to wherever you are. Your actual shipping cost will be based on the total weight of the items you're having shipping together as well as your location. Here's a handy chart of ESTIMATED shipping costs based on your pledge level and location. Shipping costs should not exceed these estimates for most backers. They may be lower in many cases and higher in some cases (like if you live in Tanzania and we have to personally deliver your game by sea turtle). \nClick Here for Kicktraq Stats!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #47", "update_userinfo": "Immortal board game on Kickstarter!", "update_content": ""}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #46", "update_userinfo": "IMMORTAL Board Game and Book of Mythology", "update_content": "Dear Friends and Backers,\nI hope you are doing well!

But it's also a collection of tools which allow you to quickly and easily create any game component you like, and manipulate them however you like.  With this completely free-form system, you can play almost any game you can think of, even changing the rules as you go, if you like.  Play your old favorites, playtest a new game you've brewed up, or show off a new game you're bringing to market, all without leaving home!\nAnd, since this will be released under a fairly permissive license, you can use it however you like.  Host your own custom service, or build a new product based on it!  Since Global GameSpace will include all the multiplayer features you'd expect, it could be used as the base for online adaptations of your board games as well!\nReally?  ANY Game?\nPretty much!  I've identified sixty basic mechanisms needed to construct most games, including meeting other players, creating boards, creating and manipulating tokens, cards, spinners and dice, and keeping score.  By combining these basic mechanisms, users can make almost anything they can imagine - without coding.\nCan I try this before I back it?\nNo, because it's not written yet.  I do have a series of video mockups that show how the final product will work, though.  Here's a sample:\nThe full set of mockups and discussion is available on the project blog.\nIf you're giving Global GameSpace away at the end, why should I pay for it now?\nVery simply, without your help, I can't make it at all!

A game lasts for 20min (beginner board) to 3 hours (expert board).\nEach player controls from one (for 6 players) to four (solo game) \"survivors\", human beings in a zombie-infested town. In fact, \"survivors\" hastily change to \"hunters\" to smash zombies through and through. However, the team must constantly keep the balance between survival and slaughter: as the zombicide's going on, the \"Danger level\" is going up and infected are growing in numbers. Any misstep can turn to disaster.\nZombicide is a fun and easy game with cool minis in an archetypical, popular and comics-inspired environment. Ambiance is constantly kept between \"beat'em up\" and \"survival horror\" as characters keep on turning from preys to predators. Humor and gloom happily marry in a zombie-fest.\nGAME CONTENTS\n71 miniatures (28mm \"Heroic\" scale): 6 Survivors, 40 Walkers, 16 Runners, 8 Fatties and 1 Abomination\n110 mini-cards (42 Zombie cards, 62 Equipment cards, 6 Wounded cards)\n9 gaming tiles\n6 dice\n6 Survivor Identity Cards\n24 advancement counters\n4 Cars tokens (police car and pimp mobile)\n18 Noise tokens\n10 Objective tokens\n12 Door tokens\n6 Zombie spawn tokens\n1 \"First player\" token\n1 Exit point token\n71 minis. A special effort has been given to detail and diversity: several models are available for most zombies of the same type (example: several models for \"walker\"-type zombies, including male and female versions).\n9 double-sided gaming tiles. Scenarios take place on boards from two to nine tiles in a riot-devastated urban area. Characters move from zone to zone defined by walls and crosswalks. Designers were careful about the overall quality and playability of the tiles' illustrations.\nDouble-sided tokens. Objective tokens. Door tokens. Car tokens. Noise tokens. Zombie spawn zone tokens. More tokens than required indeed. In fact, enough of them are planned to create your craziest scenarios.\n110 cards. Including Equipment cards and Zombie cards.\nWe're launching this Kickstarter to drive down production costs by making more copies.

Corrupt and cocksure, Nick gets his man, anyway he can, even if it means doing things a normal cop wouldn\u2019t do. Bluffing and bullying his way through the streets of New York, this highly decorated officer has put away hundreds of criminals and lined his pockets discreetly while he was at it.\nNow, with no more crime and money meaningless, he desperately searches for his wife, rescuing and helping other survivors in the vain hope that someone has seen her.\nNick is available for all pledges $25 and over!\nRunner - Bitten + 2 promo Survivor miniatures not available in the base game!\nEl Cholo, Zombie Hunter\n\u201cI\u2019m not angry, I\u2019ll show you angry\u2026  Joder! \u201d\nNo one seems to know this gruff latino\u2019s real name but everyone calls him El Cholo. \nWhether he minds, or even cares is unknown, El Cholo rarely speaks, preferring to let his twin machetes do the talking.  A hardened farmhand or possibly an ex-cartel enforcer, putting Zombies down at close quarters is El Cholo's specialty, and damn! he's good at it. The survivors whisper stories of hopeless last stands and daring raids, and El Cholo walking out covered in (someone else's) blood.\nFatty - Runner + copy of Zombicide ($89 retail value). That's a 15% discount plus 2 exclusive miniatures and a signed lithograph!\nAbomination - Fatty + 3rd special promo Survivor miniature - Dave the Geek and Zombicide dice!

NITRATE!\u201d\nAs far as he remembers, Dave always found reality to be terribly boring. So he locked himself up in an imaginary world and learned piles of useless stuff... useless until now.

Just add $10 to your Abomination and above pledge!\nPaint the Town includes these trays. Since we're doing them anyway, we thought some of you out in Kickstarter land might want some. So, if you want to paint your great Zombicide miniatures and still want to transport them around conveniently, this might fit your needs.These trays will be available for sale from Battlefoam later, just that shipping is free within the USA if shipped with your Abomination or above order.  Outside the USA, please add $15 per set (sorry, these are bulky).  $40 for a set of 2 trays.

While wearing the \u201cred dragon\u201d shirt, Nico accompanied Rackham in its ascension. He worked on Rag\u2019Narok, Confrontation 2nd to 4th edition,\nIn 2008, Nico lent his hand to Kraken Editions for the background of Alkemy Genesis. The Jade Triad arbors his signature.\nIn 2011, he worked with Studio Cyanide, developer of the Confrontation videogame, as a consultant, freelance author and playtester.\nJean-Baptiste Lullien, a.k.a. Ogre-Mercenaire \nWith a background in linguistics and information, J.-B worked for several years as a game designer for Rackham, on several projects including girls games with little horses and a fashion academy, numerous miniature games (even a kind of \u201cmarbles\u201d monsters!), videogames and comics.\nRapha\u00ebl Guiton\nRaphael is one of the founders of Rackham, and together with another ex-Games Workshop employee Jean Bey, created the iconic game of Confrontation in 1996, and eventually leading its creative team.\nNow a co-founder of Guillotine Games, a studio of french designers, Zombicide, a cooperative boardgame of survivors VS zombies, is his first project to be published as a game designer. \nPercy de Montblanc\nPercy has never worked in Rackham. Co-founder of Guillotine Games, he is in charge of all the tasks the other associates hate and he prepares coffee.\nHe is the executive producer of Zombicide and from time to time he has one or two good ideas that are systematically ignored.\nThanks for the great support everyone!

Powerful Intervention cards are also found in the City decks that allow you to skew the game in your favour \u2013 or take down your opposition in style \u2013 while Agents can also be used for their special abilities to turn the tide in your favor.\nBackground\nSet between the two World Wars, Ace of Spies draws inspiration from the glory days of spycraft as well as classic movies and books, but doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. With influences from The 39 Steps through to the tales of the codebreakers of Bletchley Park, it\u2019s a game that will see the most devious and skilled player win - perhaps! Never underestimate the power of a little bit of luck, but remember that clever play can all but eliminate the role of chance. Will you focus on finishing as many small missions as possible or go for the glory of completing the trickier high scoring ones?\nEither way can win you the game\u2026 but make sure that you stay on your toes! With your enemies always watching for your next move, the world of Ace of Spies can be a dangerous place. You may believe you\u2019re only a single card from victory but beware\u2026 nothing is as easy at it initially seems. You could be stopped in your tracks by another player\u2019s Intervention, or one of your sneaky Agents could turn rogue! Perhaps you\u2019ll manage to catch a glimpse of someone else\u2019s cards that may give their plans away? It\u2019s all part of the game after all\u2026\nWith gorgeous artwork throughout, Ace of Spies is a solid game that\u2019s accessible to players of all ages and abilities. Whether you\u2019re playing with children who love to get one over on the grown ups or experienced gamers looking for something fun but fulfilling, Ace of Spies will give you a great play experience that is always enjoyable. It\u2019s easy to understand yet offers a surprisingly deep level of gameplay that will appeal to everyone who gets their hands on a copy!\nWe really want to focus on the importance of the game during this whole campaign. We\u2019ve listened to people who\u2019ve backed projects in the past and paid attention to the kind of things they like \u2013 and more importantly don\u2019t like. You won\u2019t find any t-shirts or bags as stretch goal rewards with Ace of Spies, though we do have a couple of ideas up our sleeves should they be needed! We\u2019d sooner focus on getting our game out into the hands of as many people as possible, so that\u2019s why we promise Free Shipping to every single backer wherever you are in the world.\nRewards\nYou can see an example of one of the custom agent cards above. Here is an example of the same likeness used for the custom box top:\nTwitter\nIf you\u2019d like to keep up to date with what\u2019s happening during our Kickstarter campaign and beyond, follow us on Twitter at @Ace_of_Spies. The designers are also there too under @idlemichael and @blightygamer \u2013 it\u2019s a brand new adventure for them and they\u2019re both rather excited about how this is all going to turn out.

Really, though, it\u2019s quite a good game.\" - Wired GeekDad\n\"My group is already looking forward to playing it again. Your group should be looking forward to playing it. Give Titans of Industry a chance to build some factories in your game collection. You won\u2019t regret it.\" - Cartrunk Entertainment\n\"Titans gets high marks at the outset for making a great first impression... The game shines where it takes the expected mechanics, and twists them ever so slightly... I had a lot of fun playing Titans of Industry.  While it is an economic game with surprisingly tight money, it's not as thinky as some others I've played.\" - Games And Grub\n\"While Titans builds on some of the cardinal concepts of worker placement, it hits a sweet spot for me with its combination of resource utilization, building upgrades, and non-confrontational player interactions.\" - Nerdbloggers\n\"How do I know it's a good game (at least, how do I gauge if it is to me ).\nOne factor is that I never turn down a chance to play it. I've been more than happy to play this game every time I've been asked over the past year. When I think about a game when I'm not playing it, that's how I know it has grabbed me.\" - midnightmadness on BGG\n\"It hits on all cylinders for me. Highly enjoyable. I highly suggest [it].\" - Undead Viking\nUpdate\nWe can't change the description once people have backed, so we're putting it here. We've decided to add to the pledge levels, so that you can get more for your money. All levels $25 and up will now receive the $25 level of the signed artwork and Vampire Werewolf Fairies, our quick \"Take that\" style game which was a followup to our card game Zombie Ninja Pirates. Both games can be played separately, or be combined for one mega-game of up to 10 players.\nAll backers at the $100 level will also receive one of the last copies of Zombie Ninja Pirates. We only have a few copies of this game left, and they'll go to you if you back at this level and we are successfully funded.\nGozer Games has published several successful games over the years, most of which were created by me and funded internally. My most recently published game was Vampire Werewolf Fairies, which was successfully funded on Kickstarter and won the Gaming Genius award for Best Non-Collectible Card Game 2011. Last year, I had the pleasure of finding a great game at Origins by game designer Brian Lewis. This is the first game that Gozer Games has licensed from another designer, and is the largest game I have undertaken to manufacture. I have already put quite a bit of money and countless hours into making and playtesting this game, but for it to be a success I need your help. $30,000 is a little under what I figure I will need to cover the remaining costs for all the fantastic artists, the manufacture of the game with Panda, and shipping.\nIt is the 1920s, a time of much industrial building and growth. In this board game, you must invest in building factories and businesses, in order to produce goods and sell them to gain victory points. It is a delicate balance of money, production, and goals. The person who can best manage their buildings and meet their goals in 7 turns will win.\nEach player starts the game with 4 workers and $6000. Every turn, players first buy buildings, then place workers on those buildings or on the board. Factories allow you to produce goods, while Businesses allow you to sell those goods for money or victory points. A good player needs to balance their production and sales, and encourage other players to sell with them to maximize sales. Board elements allow players to take advantage of bonuses, such as extra production, building improvements, and Corporate Strategy cards. Corporate Strategy cards help give players additional goals and direction, by specifying additional ways to gain victory points.\nAt the end of 3 turns, on years 1923, 1925, and 1927, upkeep will be due, and players must pay to maintain their buildings, or will need to take out loans. Players will need to sell enough goods before then to have enough money to cover the costs, as loans are worth negative victory points at the end of the game. After year 1927, whoever has the most victory points from combined sales, buildings, and Corporate Strategy cards wins the game.\nTitans of Industry is a rich worker placement/resource management Euro-style game. It plays 3 to 5 players, and plays approximately 20-25 minutes per player.\nTitans of Industry comes with the following components.\n35     Factory Cards\n35     Business Cards\n21     Corporate Strategy Cards\n168   Goods chits\n      24 Wood\n      24 Brick\n      24 Stone\n      24 Tar\n      24 Concrete\n      24 Steel\n      24 Glass\n14   Research and Development chits\n30   Workers (6 each in red, green, blue, yellow, and purple)\n10   Discs (2 each in red, green, blue, yellow, and purple)\n1     Temporary Worker (gray)\n1     Turn Indicator\n1     Game board\n44   Money coins  (20 $1k coins, 12 $3k coins, 12 $5k coins)\n8     Loan cards\n5     Player reference cards\n6     Plastic zip bags\nAs mentioned above, the board, cards, and chits in the video are prototype pieces. You can see a more final version of the board below.\nThere are 7 turns. Each turn, all players do the following, in order.\n1. Buy buildings. Factories produce goods, while Businesses let you sell goods to the bank for money or VP.\n\n2. Place workers, on any player's Factories, Businesses, or on any available spot on the board.\n3. Get goods from Factories and the Goods area of the board.\n4. Sell goods on Businesses and use the Services area of the board.\n5. Gain Advances for future turns from the Advances area of the board.\n6. Pay upkeep for buildings you own and workers you train.\n7. Maintenance. Take back workers, replenish goods, and advance the turn order.\n\nMoney will be tight, so try to gain money early on to pay upkeep, otherwise you might have to take a loan. If you don't pay off your loans by the end of the game, you lose VP. Later in the game, you can sell goods for VP as well as money, to gain the upper hand and win.\n\nYou can view the full set of rules here (5.2 Mb PDF).\n\nSpringboard Approved\n\nThe Springboard Seal of Quality is your assurance that a new game project is worth your time and attention. All titles approved for Springboard campaigns are vetted by the game professionals at Game Salute. During this comprehensive evaluation process, Game Salute works with the publisher to ensure solid designs, thorough play testing, excellent presentation, and high quality components.\nTitans of Industry has gone through repeated playtesting and refinement, and is now a solid game ready for production, with a lot of depth and strategy. It has been compared favorably to such hits as Race for the Galaxy, Agricola, and Caylus. We need your help to produce Titans of Industry and get it into your hands.\nIf you've read this far, we also have some great incentives and stretch goals planned that we think you'll really like. For example, you can have one of the buildings in the game named after you or your business. Other incentives and stretch rewards will be revealed as we get closer to those goals, the first one being at $36K.

Their survivors are trying to make it day to day in a world torn apart from the walking dead.\nAs in any survival game one needs food, guns, ammo, and more. Players go out into the wasteland and scavenge for supplies, or perhaps to find a new gun or melee weapon to fend off the next zombie attack.\nIn addition to gathering supplies, each player forms and controls their own squad. Each squad works to fortify the base(s). However your walls and barbed wire won\u2019t hold the dead for long, and they\u2019re getting hungry.\nPlayer's receive victory points for killing zombies, building defenses, and successfully completing goals. Victory points show who is soldiering on the best in this wasteland. The final tally of points determines the winner.

It\u2019s a tense game of careful choices: \nDo you go for another weapon? \nDo you go Kamikaze on a group of zombies with just an axe? \nOr do you run the other way with your tail between your legs?\nThis myriad of choices adds to the fun of the game, and leads us into our next segment, Re-playability.\n\nZpocalypse, by design is a highly modular format game. The tiles used, as the game board, allow them to be placed in nearly any orientation, with the ability to have expansion tiles added in later on down the road. This adds for a much varied landscape and new experience every play through. This modular style of play has been so successful, that we have found many people who kept coming back to play more and more Zpocalypse. \nAt several conventions we would have people come back the next day, or even later in a same day, to play another round.  What shocked us was, at a recent game demo day at a local board game store, we had two repeat players who brought friends to show the game. \nSo far nearly everyone who has played our game has had an enjoyable experience and a desire to play again and again!\nClick Here for larger view of Components\nNote: This is a prototype shot, thus miniatures shown with tokens\n20 board tiles\n80 build tokens\n120 standard cards\n20 non-standard goal cards\n1 point tracker\n12 dice (8 red, 4 blue)\n20 page rule booklet\n30 zombie miniatures (10 singles, 20 doubles) - Prototype tokens shown!\n4 squad sheets\n4 squad miniatures (male & female, back to back) with unique base colors\n4 colored point tracker tokens\nEnlarge rules example\nWe have spent untold hours refining, editing, adding, removing, and tweaking our rule booklet to make it as approachable and understandable as possible.\nAnd even if you're unclear about a certain aspect of game play, we will be including Quick Response (QR) codes on each page section, that you can easily scan with your smart phone,  that will link to tutorial videos on that particular topic.\nWe would like to produce Zpocalypse with the best miniatures humanly possible.

Many paths are dead ends, but some sectors have sizable deposits of rare minerals that can be refined into the precious fuel crystals that drive your space fleets onward. Soon, a trail of colonies leads out from your homeworld, and soon the races venture into the same cosmic regions.

It performed well in the market place and has been critically acclaimed.\nWe have a lot of cool game ideas to offer. However, producing boardgames is an expensive and risky business. We would love to get to work publishing our backlog of games sooner rather than later. We are hoping to put out more games and do it much faster by using Kickstarter to help get us over the financial mountain that producing each game represents. We also really like the Kickstarter model of rewarding people who get on board early with cool and exclusive stuff that can even have an impact on the game itself, like being able to name a Sector Card or help write a Conquest Card.\nWill that be paper or plastic? The 3d design of our paper punch out space ships makes them look cool and work great. Big plastic space ships would be even better, but its quite a bit more expensive to produce plastic pieces. If we overshoot our goal by a significant margin, we will absolutely look into plastic space ships. That will probably raise the eventual MSRP, meaning that Kickstarter supporters will have gotten an even cooler game at an even deeper discount!\nNow about the game...\nAdded 3/29...Here we have examples of the 4 promo cards that will come with each copy of the game at all the $60+ levels (3 of the same sector and 1 conquest card...ignore where it says only 1 on the pledge descriptions). Backer's Construct (that's no moon in orbit), apart from being a nice fuel producer at 3, can hold a MOD by itself. This is typically something only a homeworld can do, so it brings a unique addition to the sector deck. We're putting 3 copies of Backer's Construct into the promo pack, making this a rare triple-bridge sector. Funded Outpost provides fuel in a way that no other conquest card does while it still provides a MOD slot just like the other outpost cards.\nXCarbonite is an example of how a player can help write their own card (the top 2 backer tiers). XCarbonite was inspired a few weeks ago by a player who knew he was going to be a backer at an influential level, so this card actually made it into the last prototype and was well received by playtesters. We have already begun the conversation with our top tier backers so we can begin working together with them on their cards. There's still plenty of opportunities left for you to leave your mark.\nAdded 3/27...Here is the latest draft copy of the rulebook! The final will have better graphic art, but this will give you the nuts and bolts.\nAdded 3/19...Here is a sample turn, shot guerrilla style on the fly with my phone. The A/V quality is poor, but the content is good stuff. It's totally unscripted with very little editing (just about half a minute of \"thinking\" time and some fumbling with the less than perfect prototype MODs and slots, which have already been addressed by the next generation of prototype.\nStelCon: Infinity is a light strategy war game on a galactic scale. 2-6 players can expect around 30-45 minutes per player, so 2 players can often power through a game in about an hour. The 6 player game is kept short by combining into 3 teams of 2 where the teammates execute their turns simultaneously.\nVariable game board. There are 6 races to choose from, each with its own strengths. Although the jump lanes that connect the sectors forming the galactic map are printed on the game boards, each sector location is covered by a different card from the sector deck each game.\nClose up here.\nSectors are drawn from the deck and placed as the players explore the galaxy, so you never know what you're going to get...unless you do some scouting with your fighter squads or happen to have some telepaths on board your ship (telepaths are handy that way). Some of the sector cards are identical and therefore also create a \"bridge\" which is a unique adjacency in addition to the normal jump lanes. All this makes for a very different board every time.\nThere is no natural ally. The board's unique layout means that the player to your left, your right, and 2 positions away to the left/right are all equidistant from you. Thus, in a 2-5 player game, no opponent is your natural ally or enemy. In a 6 player game, the person 3 positions away (straight across) is your teammate, so even then all enemies are 4 hops away.\n(Above graphic close up.) Thanks to the elegant way that wormholes allow you to exit/enter different map boards, you can either push the player boards together or leave them comfortably spaced to fit the table you are using.\nMoving your space fleet around is straight forward. Each ship can move 1 sector per turn, plus 1 extra sector per turn per engine MOD. Your space ships are modular in design, both from a gameplay and a literal perspective. You physically insert engines, extra guns, and fighter squads into holes in the space ships. We call these MODs.\n(Above graphic close up.)\nCombat is simple but tense. Add up your FirePower present at the battle site (above, defender brown + sector = 9FP; attacker red = 8FP) and then toss in a d6 roll and possibly some cards. The opponent does the same. Compare the two FirePower totals, and the winner keeps the sector while the loser retreats and loses a ship from his fleet.\nWhile the game is a conquest type game, it ends immediately when one player conquers any homeworld, so there's no eliminated player stuck waiting around for the game to finish. We've also included an alternate VP system for those who want to keep their galactic domination time to a bare minimum.\nConquest cards are the soul of the game. The deck of 115 cards gives tons of gotcha moments, and serious replay value. They allow you to do all sorts of fun things:\nModify the firepower of your sector or your ship\nBoost fuel crystal production (the economy of the game)\nSteal or stop opponent's cards\nCheat the dice\nWipe out a whole sector\nEven influence battles your forces are not involved in, adding an element of table-talking diplomacy to the game\nWe are you. As avid gamers and card-carrying geeks, we love to read and watch both history and science fiction, just like tons of gamers we've met at conventions the past couple of years. We like the things you like and filled the conquest cards with homage that we're sure you'll appreciate. Plus, we would love to hear from you about what types of cards you'd like to see go into the game. We have reserved quite a few card titles and themes for last minute fan suggested additions to the deck.\nVisit us at ConquestGaming.com and our page at BoardGameGeek.\nAbout the designer: Russ Rupe has been an educator, network admin, fan of Pericles, and for the last 8 years has been a full time stay at home dad with his 2 boys (ages 8, 2).

They will \"Lust\" after your copy when they see this bonus - for every copy of Seven Sisters that you pledge for, you will receive fifty (50) yellow 15mm x 4 mm wooden discs to use to represent gold, and fifty (50) red apples to use to represent fruit.

The die-cut markers will still be included with the game.\nFour player game set up\nThe King\u2019s birthday has arrived!\n\nWealthy aristocrats from across the land have gathered to throw a lavish ball in the King\u2019s honor, sparing no expense in an attempt to impress him. Of course, everyone knows that the best way to impress a father is to win the favor of his daughters. At the ball, one more bit of business needs to be settled...each aristocrat has bet a parcel of land that he can curry the most favor from the seven sisters over the course of the party! With their land and honor on the line, each aristocrat is rushing to gain the favor of the daughters, and to cast derision on his opponents.\nSeven Sisters is a hand management/worker placement euro-style board game for 3-6 players ages 12 and up. In Seven Sisters, the players play the roles of wealthy aristocrats who are trying to gain the favor of the king\u2019s seven daughters, who happen to be named after the seven deadly sins: Wrath, Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, Pride, and Envy.\nSeven Sisters consists of 4 rounds, during which the players will be dealt 6 cards each round. Using five of the six cards, players influence the sisters by sending servants to do the sisters\u2019 bidding. Multiple options when playing each card create opportunities for players to use both strategic and tactical play to influence the sisters more than their opponents do.\n\nEach round, after cards are played, scoring occurs, with each sister granting her favor (victory point) and a special reward or action to the player who has influenced her most that round. These rewards and actions are thematically tied to the name of the sister; e.g. - Greed rewards players with gold.  Gaining this favor is important not only for the victory point, but also to gain advantages and resources for following rounds.\n\nAfter four rounds are played and scored, another scoring round happens immediately. Victory points are tallied, including bonus points for having gained the favor of all seven sisters and for having the highest quantity of unused resources remaining (gold, fruit, and servants).  The winner is the player with the most points!\nPreview from www.dicetower.com:\nSeven Sisters page on www.boardgamegeek.com:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/100172/seven-sisters\nCheck out these reviews on www.boardgamegeek.com:\nhttp://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/724473/seven-sisters-review\nhttp://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/734937/an-early-temptation-of-seven-sisters\nWhat is our goal?\nWe are near ready for production of Seven Sisters...design, playtesting (200+ games) and artwork are finished (except the kickstarter special promo card, which is underway).  We are ready to gather the final printing estimates and go to pre-press.  However, printing games is expensive, and we need your help so that we can increase our production run to get a reasonable cost, and to include all the quality components and finishes that we would like.  Funds will be used for production and shipment of the final product, as well as advertising and marketing of Seven Sisters.  Brent and Lee have a combined 50+ years in the gaming industry, and Lee has previously been a contributing author to two Mayfair publications.   Brent has a strong background in sales and marketing, and is detail oriented (some would say controlling!), and will accept nothing less than the best product we can provide.\nWrath tile\nSo, what do you get?\nIn addition to a professionally produced copy of Seven Sisters, the following is included or available:\nThank You - Every backer will receive a special thank you including your name on our web site.\nPromo Cards - For every copy of Seven Sisters that you would get for your pledge level, you will also receive a FREE set of 4 promo cards, the \"8th Sister.\"  These four cards may be used to replace up to four wild cards in the game, without significantly altering strategy or gameplay.  The concept was designed to provide a variant play option.  In addition to the free promo cards, every backer at the $45 level or higher will get to vote on the artwork for these cards.  We will develop two pieces of art, and then you get to vote on which concept is used!\nFor those who want a set of promo cards without pledging at a level to receive Seven Sisters, please pledge $5 per set of cards (maximum of 3 sets) plus $4 shipping to an address in the United States, or $6 for international shipping.\nShipping - Due to the expense involved in shipping more than four pounds internationally, we have set up a shipping model to try to provide the best value to our international pledgers; this is reflected in the reduced shipping rates below.  Please add the following amounts to your pledge based on your shipping address:\nU.S. address:   FREE for up to 6 games\nCanada:           1 game FREE        2-4 games $25     6 games $30\nInternational:    1 game $15            2-4 games $25     6 games $30\nExtra Value - Backers pledging for 2 or more copies save money!  Pledge levels for the game are reduced by 10% (1 copy), 15% (2-3 copies), or 20% (4 copies) at those levels.  This is especially valuable for people who would like to group a pledge with friends, family, and game groups.\nCheck out our newly added \"Retailer\" pledge level and  \"THE BIG ONE\" pledge level\nArtist's Prints - The artist's prints will be 5\" x 7\", and professionally mounted.  Pledge $10 to receive a print of your favorite sister, signed and numbered by the artist.  You may also add $10 to another pledge...the $55 pledge level is an example of a pledge with one print included.  For more than one print, add $10 for each print, or $60 for all seven prints.  There is no additional charge for shipping if you include prints with a pledge that includes a copy of Seven Sisters.  If you are pledging for only prints, please add $10 for shipping to an address in the United States, or $15 for international shipping.\nT-Shirts - These quality 50/50 blend t-shirts will be black shirts, with the art of your favorite sister, and text reading \"Have you ever wondered what Wrath looks like?\"  Substitute the name of your favorite sister for \"Wrath\" in the text.  Pledge $15 for one t-shirt.  You may also add $15 to another pledge...the $60 pledge level is an example of a pledge with one t-shirt included.  For more than one t-shirt, add $15 for each shirt, or $90 for all seven shirts.  There is no additional charge for shipping if you include shirts with a pledge that includes a copy of Seven Sisters.  If you are pledging for only t-shirts, please add $10 for shipping to an address in the United States, or $15 for international shipping.\nVisits - All visits, including delivery of your copies of Seven Sisters, dinner, teaching and playing of the game, and reviewing and playing of your prototype must have the location pre-approved before you pledge.  These visits will occur after all copies pledged for have been shipped.\nA note on expected delivery dates:  I have been intentionally conservative in estimating the delivery dates.  We hope to have Seven Sisters produced and sent to pledgers much sooner than July, but I built in a little extra time to account for unforeseen delays.  Changes in expected delivery dates will be sent to pledgers via an update.\nOver-goal Funding - We would love to add some great rewards if we meet milestones higher than our funding goal.  Please consider pledging so we can reach these goals!\nIf you are a retailer that would like to pledge, please contact Brent via a message or email at brent@wishingtreegames.com to discuss parameters for retailers.\nExample card:  Gluttony (primary sister) and Envy (secondary sister)\nA Note From Wishing Tree Games\nWe sincerely appreciate you taking the time to check out our Seven Sisters kickstarter campaign.

They will get one bag for each copy of the game they are getting.\nWill you bring together a Zombie, Pirate, Ninja, Alien, and Monkey FOR THE WIN?\nThis story starts with a man named Michael.  A man with a great love for simple abstract games.  A man that wants to see abstract games be fun and have incredible themes.  This describes Michael Eskue when he designed For The Win and also described Michael Mindes before playing For The Win.\nFor The Win is a tile laying game.  The tiles will be made out of compressed urea plastic with painted debossed icons for the characters.  This is a highly durable and tactile material.\nFor The Win is an abstract game at heart, with a solid theme of internet memes applied. Players control a host of characters, playing them to the board and using their powers in order to arrange a group of all 5 types. Each character has thematic abilities in this easy to learn and fast playing game:\nThe Zombie turns other characters into zombies.\nThe Pirate shoots people out of cannons, moving them wherever you want.\nThe Ninja through the power of stealth can disappear and reappear wherever desired.\nThe Alien utilizes its tractor beam to pull people next to it.\nThe Monkey messes everything up and toggles all of her neighbors.\nBe the first person to get one of each adjacent to each other, FOR THE WIN!\n\"For The Win!\" has been an anticipated release from Tasty Minstrel Games for quite awhile now.  The game has been 100% complete and under contract since July 16th of 2010.\nWith your help, it will soon become a reality!\nThe Rulebook...\nPlaying The Game\nOn a player's turn, they make take one or two actions, which are:\nAdd a tile, cannot be adjacent to your own\nMove a tile 1 space (face up only)\nShove tiles 1 space (face up only)\nUse an ability (flip tile face down afterwards)\nFlip a tile face up\nOnce one player has taken 5 actions they cannot go until the other player has taken 5 and ends the round.  With first player switching in between rounds, you might get as many as 4 unanswered actions in a row.\nThe Rulebook...\nWhy For The Win Is Awesome\nThere are lots of reasons that For The Win is awesome, I will just list some of the highlights:\nA quick 2-player game for those times you arrive late to game night.\nFor The Win is in a compact box and travels well.\nFor The Win is an abstract strategy game with a real and integrated theme.\nWhat games do you get to play with zombies, pirates, ninjas, aliens, and monkeys?\nFor The Win is easy to learn and difficult to master.\nFor The Win is priced for a great value.\nFor The Win is a great game to play at lunch time.\nPledge Now, Play Now!\nFor those that pledge now, Print and Play files are available.  You will be able to get the files from a backer only up-date.  Play it with your friends and enjoy!\nThe Rulebook...\nGiven The Excitement And Recent Successes, Why Kickstarter?\nTasty Minstrel Games has enjoyed success recently, with the sales of Eminent Domain, Belfort, and Martian Dice.  While this success is fantastic, it is only sufficient for us to continue to support those projects.  \nCombined with not investing more personal money into Tasty Minstrel Games, we need to raise money for new game projects like For The Win!  Even with a smaller game like this or Martian Dice, it is surprising how quickly the costs for plastic moulds, safety testing, manufacturing, artwork, shipping, and so forth add up.\nOn the right, you'll see that we have several different ways you can support our game.  With any of those options you will help make our dreams become a reality... Thank you very much for your support!\nRetailer Support Levels\nThese support levels provide resellers like retailers a fantastic deal.  You will get immediate shipping along with the other Kickstarter copies along with the fantastic discount.\nGet 12 or 24 copies of For The Win.  It works out to be $8.33 per copy of the game!

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "VivaJava: The Coffee Game is all about finding that perfect blend of beans to create the next best-seller in the coffee houses and kitchens of the world. Players will travel to exotic coffee-producing nations around the world to collect beans and gain fame and fortune.  But, in order to be successful, players will actually have to work together. Mostly.\nIn VivaJava, players send their researchers to hot spots around the globe to gather the perfect bean. This may bring them into contact with other players who are also on the hunt, creating a crucial choice: Go it alone and continue to research, or join forces with that opponent, hoping to combine beans from both player's bags and share the score with a superblend. Going it alone with research can often prove useful as players spend time in the lab developing abilities that grant them an advantage. However, in VivaJava the bold taste of victory will go only to those players who are able to balance solitary research with cooperation amongst their fellow gamers.\nThe rich depth of varying strategies and social play will satisfy most players' thirst for unique gameplay, but VivaJava has even more brewing. This flexible game can accommodate up to 8 players, and through smooth simultaneous actions, play is quick and constant with little downtime.\nBelow are some other useful links:\nOfficial VivaJava website\nVivaJava page on BoardGameGeek\nExcellent review on BGG that details game play\nVivaJava: The Coffee Game will be bursting at the seams with caffeinated gaming goodness. We've worked hard to develop the components to an exacting \"Euro feel\" with lots of wood, thick punchboard and beautiful artwork for an immersive theme. Here's what you'll find inside every copy of VivaJava:\n\u2022 Two game boards - why settle for just one board like all those other games? VivaJava's game boards are designed for multiple gaming configurations to account for gaming preferences, table shape, group size and whimsy.\n\u2022 Tons of punchboard - 8 thick Research Labs (personal tableaus), 9 country tokens, 8 Research/Blend Tokens, 12 Investment Tokens, 8 sets of three Blend Markers, 8 sets of five Research Markers, and 16 Blend Slates with custom coffee culture deco art.\n\u2022 Wood! 90 custom lathed wooden \"beans\" in six different colors (the heart of VivaJava). 8 chunky player pawns. 8 thick scoring discs.\n\u2022 Bags! 8 black fabric bags serve as the players' personal \"Roasters\" which are used to pull beans blindly while Blending with other players.\n\u2022 Cards! Two sets of cards in two different sizes - a deck of 16 mini-size cards (the Flavor deck), and 24 regular-sized cards for the inept but useful interns, part of the Intern Inspansion (plus 8 player reference cards).\n\u2022 Little plastic baggies! Have you ever opened up a game box and punched out about 18 gajillion little bits and then realized that the publisher didn't put any plastic baggies in the box for sorting? Don't you hate that? So do we - so we're putting some inside each box of VivaJava.\n\u2022 Rules! Yes, we'll even throw in a fully-illustrated, 16-page rulebook that will not only explain how to play, but will also provide advanced variants and strategy notes that will give you the upper hand amongst your over-caffeinated cohorts in no time.\nYou can even check out the pre-release rules right here!\nWe created this special \"geekspansion\" just for Kickstarter, and it's likely to be a long time (if at all) before it's offered for retail sale. We may put it in an expansion later, we may not - who knows! One thing's for sure - the only way to make sure you nab one is to get it on Kickstarter. And here's what makes it so special:\n\u2022 Four special Blend Slates - Each Slate features double bean colors for adding to The Fields. In addition, the team that claims the Blend Slate will receive +1 prestige points for creating a Blend that includes the featured bean color!\nClick here to embiggen image\n\u2022 A celebration of geekiness - The four Slates will embody themes that are near and dear to everyone's geeky hearts. Each week, we'll reveal one more Slate, but for a little teaser, here are the titles: Twin Perks, Whateley's Strange Brew, Caf\u00e9 LaBrea, and Lord of the Beans.\n\u2022 Four variant Country Tokens - These tokens feature abilities that can really add a shot of bold flavor to any game!\nNow that we've made our funding goal, gamers can rest assured of two things: 1) That VivaJava will be produced, providing coffee-gaming goodness to all of our wonderful backers, and 2) that Dice Hate Me Games is going to be providing more goodies for our backers for every funding milestone we reach!\nOur first stretch goal goodie is the burlap Bean Bag - perfect for holding all 90 of the wooden coffee beans in each copy of VivaJava. Since we reached $25,000, each backer who pledges for a pre-order copy of the game will receive a Bean Bag emblazoned with the official VivaJava logo!\nOur second stretch goal goodies are... Brewples!\nYes, if we reach $35,000, everyone who pledges for a pre-order copy of VivaJava will receive a randomly-selected Brewple, lovingly hand-crafted by Cherilyn. These vibrant player pawns can be used to designate the official Brewmaster - the player who oversees the game and acts as scorekeeper and general ringleader of awesomeness. \nThe third stretch goal was a components upgrade at $40K that offered new Blend Slates and a variant for the learning game - the Roaster Purge Tokens! More info. on that in Update #12.\nWe set the bar high for the next stretch goal at $47.5K and everyone answered magnificently. We are now able to put a new variant in each box of VivaJava - the Featured Blend Cards! \nThese cards allow players to score extra points whenever they create the Blend featured on the card. Learn more about this awesome stretch reward in Update #15!\nVivaJava is meant to be a social experience, so what better way to get a group into the game than taking it to your local coffee shop! Below is a sample of the jute tote and porcelain tumbler that will be included in the Coffee To Go reward level. Sip the Rainbow!\n\"Six different colored beans are available to represent different origins, and blends are ranked in poker hand-style groupings of five as well as on color priority. Each turn, though, blends will \"degrade\", losing a bean and falling down the best-seller list. Judging your blend's chances at long-term success turns into a great mental exercise, and makes VivaJava a game you'll be itching to master.\" - Matt Morgan, MTV Geek\n\u201cLook, let me put it to you straight, I\u2019ve seen this game in action at 4 events (I\u2019ve played it at three of them!) \u2026 It\u2019s a great strategy game with a good deal of social interaction.

It offers many paths to achieving the goals, has been unpredictable, and just a really solid Euro-style game!\u201d \u2013 John Moller, Cartrunk.net\n\u201cViva Java combined many common mechanics from Eurogames into a unique game experience\u2026 This game is a nice combination of strategy and luck and since you are constantly teaming up there is not much down time.\u201d \u2013 Jason, play board games\n\u201cI played this at WBC and look forward to seeing it get out there.

Thanks again.\n\"Agents of SMERSH is unlike any other game out there . . . and the best spy adventure game I've ever played.  It meets all my criteria for a great game and you can quote me on that.\" - Richard Launius (designer of Arkham Horror,  Defenders of the Realm,  and Pirates vs. Dinosaurs).  Read a full\nreview by Richard here.\n*New Review* I am honestly humbled by game designer Frank Branham's glowing review. Read it here in the forum.\nFIVE STRETCH REWARDS REACHED!\nThe initial print run will most likely cost around 35k and that won't even include paying the artists.  So while play testing I actually removed elements of the game that I liked so I could get the cost of printing down.  I will bring those back (and new items) if we go over.    Each Pledge of at least $50 will receive a copy of each of the stretch rewards below (except the 100 additional encounters will be in the $70 or above only and all future editions of the book).\n30k.  *REACHED!*  The first reward will be THE TRAVEL DIE.   It potentially makes the game a little tougher (the game is currently pretty tough).  You roll it to get movement points AND to see if you can fly (flying an airplane is automatic in the core rules).  The game works great without it - I took it out because it was unnecessary for gameplay but it is one of my favorite items  removed. I will put it back in at 30k (for kickstarters only).   I will post a picture of my Travel Die once we go over 20K (Picture of Travel Die prototype posted on BGG here)\n40K.  *REACHED!* 2 MORE CHARACTER CARDS! George has started on  NEW ILLUSTRATIONS (made in the likeness of two of our supporters).  We will make it into a character card and give it out to all  KICKSTARTERS.  Like the Travel Die, we will only print a minimum number so it will be very hard to find after KS runs. \n50k  *REACHED* A Master of Disguise -  Luring you in and targeting your weakness.   THE 5TH HENCHMAN CARD!\n65K  *REACHED*  MORE BOOK ENCOUNTERS!  This was a tough decision. But since we have time to work on the book as the base game is printing - and you guys are so great -  I will be adding 100 more encounters for a total around 1640-1650.   This will be in all editions of the Encounter Book - in all future prints.   Thanks again!\n82,057  *REACHED* POKER CHIP MINI EXPANSION -  KICKSTARTER EXCLUSIVE.   Each $50+ pledge will receive a custom printed (both sides) and professional grade clay poker chip - and  instructions for its uses in the game.  This chip will also be attached to the special ability of one of the KS only character cards.  $82.1 will make AGENTS OF SMERSH the 2nd HIGHEST FUNDED KICKSTARTER GAME EVER.  \nThe poker chip is dual sided and you will spin it to get a result. You can use it during gambling or other one time \"Hail Mary\" actions. The best use will be with the additional KS character card.    \n100K -  ENGRAVED DICE.  Big stretch for a big reward.  UPGRADED DICE.  The 6 custom dice that come with the base game will be ENGRAVED.  That 6 unique large 20mm dice, engraved.  (Excludes the Travel Die).\nBonus Kickstarter Only Character \nThe Bonus Character Card - Agent Zyler - starts out with a Probed by Aliens Status Card.  If you want to get this Character Card you have to pledge through Kickstarter. Link to image on BGG. \nYes, this is an expensive game. It has a lot of components.  I crunched the numbers for months trying to get a good quality game made with a minimal number from China but it all came down to price. INTERNATIONAL BUYERS: Our apologies for the steep shipping.  The game is heavy (even without the book) and I just could not get a reasonable price for shipping.  I've grouped THREE copies at the $290 level to get shipping down for INTERNATIONAL. CORRECTION: The 2 Bundle set has the wrong shipping price.  It should read $100 INTERNATIONAL/ $35 CANADA.\nWHY A LARGER COMPANY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PRODUCE A GAME LIKE THIS . . .\n  Simply paying a writer for 500-1000 hours of work would be a huge expensive for them.\nThere are 2 ways to play AGENTS OF SMERSH.   To make the game less expensive and more versatile we took The Book of Encounters, a 200+ page book with 1500 written encounters, out of the base game and added simpler Encounter Cards. The Book of Encounters is now optional, so for a fuller storytelling experience, you can play the game with the book, players choosing reactions from a matrix, reading encounters, and rolling dice. OR you can play the base game, which includes a set of 100+ Encounter Cards.The cards do not have a reaction matrix and the text for the encounters is shorter, but game play is quicker and just as fun.\nPlease Note: The initial print of The Book of Encounters will be very limited.  We will print enough for Kickstarter orders (Printed within the USA). We will only be able to do a full initial run if we get a lot of orders on Kickstarter. Hopefully we will print more overseas once funding is available. \nFAMILY FRIENDLY?  We think so . . .\nI received a question asking if the game was Family Friendly. I wrote the person a very long response but simply put: the answer is YES. There is the occasional flamboyant and odd Villain type,  and there are references to violent acts - also  the extremely rare innuendo, but overall I tried to keep the game appropriate for kids who can read independently (by common standards), although the Box will Suggest Ages 12+.   Email me if you have questions.\nWHAT'S IN THE BOX?\n- Original Illustrations by George Patsouras (The Resistance)\n- OVER 300 Cards (including Cards that come with The Book of Encounters)\n-Punchout tokens with character images in standees\n- Around 100 tokens\n- 5 Character Player Cards (6 WITH THE KICKSTARTER BONUS CHARACTER)\n- 4 Villain Henchmen mats that set near the main board\n- Main Villain Advancement Mat\n- 6 Custom made dice and Dice Bag used to draw dice blindly\n- Large Main Board - Custom Illustrated\n- Random Player tokens and pieces (Miniatures may be added if we go over our goals)\n- Optional Large Format O-Ring Bound Book of nearly 1500 written encounters (over 200 pages)\n- Cooperative Gameplay.   1-4 Players.  Game length average 90 minutes. For a 4 player game using the book - you may need to add 30 to this estimate.\n\nWHAT'S THIS GAME ABOUT?\nAgents of SMERSH is a cooperative Storytelling game that pits players as UN Secret Service Spies against SMERSH -  set in an alternate 1970s timeline. The game comes with over 1500 written encounters - in a similar vein to Tales of the Arabian Nights - except game play is expanded, including custom dice to determine success or failure of encounters, and more strategic play from what is typically expected of a Storytelling board game. There are plenty of James Bond gadgets and pop references and detailed artwork - not to mention a touch of humor. The game features the artwork of George Patsouras (The Resistance & Flash Point).\nEasily over 1000 hours have gone into the development of this game and by the time the project has gone to print, more than likely about 1400-1600 hours will have gone in.\nKickstarter Rewards? We have cards and dice lined up in case we go over our goals. So keep checking back!\n-- LINK HERE TO BGG. WE HAVE UPLOADED A LOT OF ARTWORK\nOTHER GAME ELEMENTS:\n-- COOPERATIVE GAMEPLAY.  Plays 1-4. And can be played within 90 minutes.  Can it play 5 players?  Well, yes, but due to downtime between encounters we recommend 1-4.  Variant rules for 5 players will be included in rulebook.\n-- A GIANT BOOK of encounters (Optional Reward).  Around 1500 written encounters in a large format softbound book probably over 200 pages.   A typical game requires reading of between 20-30 encounters so reply value is very high.  \n-- GREAT ARTWORK:   George Patsouras  (The Resistance & Flash Point) is creating the illustrations,  including illustrating the board.   He has also agreed to illustrate the likeness of a few supporters who will be placed on cards in the game!  GEORGE recently agreed to do the work for another KICKSTARTER game that looks great!  Go check out POLICE PRECINCT\n-- PASS/FAIL CHALLENGES: Unlike Tales of the Arabian Nights, the game presents players with challenges. Each encounter has a PASS or FAIL consequence.\n-- HENCHMEN  with their own reference cards that players encounter from time to time.  \n-- GAMBLING: Yes you may be called upon as a Secret Agent to sit at a Poker Table.

Each player starts the game with a unit of a few soldiers and nothing else. As the game progresses, he will roll dice to collect resources and advance on the beach, sector by sector, as his unit grows stronger and deadlier. He will succeed... or die trying!\nD-Day Dice will get you right there on the beach. You will experience the fear of getting killed by enemy fire, the anguish of losing your men, and the thrill of surmounting seemingly impossible odds to accomplish your mission. And since this is a cooperative game, all players are on the same side, fighting like brothers (and sisters) in arms! This game can be played by anyone (you don't have to be familiar with World War II) and has been enjoyed by families and wargamers alike.\nD-DAY DICE IS A GAME FOR 1-4 PLAYERS, AGES 10 and UP, WITH A PLAY TIME OF ABOUT 45 MINUTES.\nSO, WHAT'S THE DEAL?\nPeople who pledge money for this game will have access to a lot of bonus content and savings, so don't pass up on this wonderful opportunity.\nIn the donation levels you will see references to expansions and exclusives. Here is a description of each of those items so that you can make the appropriate choice. The \"Kickstarter exclusives\" are only going to be available to our supporters (extra stock will be destroyed). We're not kidding!\nThe base game, the Kickstarter exclusives, plus the expansions Atlantikwall, Operation Neptune and Normandy, are expected in March, 2012. This means that our supporters will get the expansions months before everybody else (some of this stuff is not scheduled to hit the stores before 2013)!\nSHIPPING FEES\nShipping will be FREE for anyone living in the USA or Canada.\nWe will have to charge 50$ for international addresses.

Please add 50$ to your pledge if you have an address outside Canada or the USA.\nWe have supporter levels that offer multiple copies of the game specifically created to help our international customers split the shipping bill (see the 100$ and 200$ levels).\nAnd now, let's see what's in store for this exciting project:\n(The rulebook cover, designed to look like an old war journal)\nD-DAY DICE (base game)\nNormandy, June 6th, 1944. As you land on the well-defended beaches, a German machine gun nest is killing your comrades like flies...\nYou must do something!\nD-Day Dice is a multiplayer co-op game, where all players play their turn simultaneously and must help each other in order to stay alive. If one player loses, the game is lost for everyone! This makes for great interaction between players, who must consult each other about the best route to the bunker, or the best way to maximize their dice rolls.\nThe game is played on a small board representing a beach (called a \u201cBattle Map\u201d). Players move their units on these maps and follow the written instructions. Some sectors are helpful, some are dreadful, but all are dangerous. Players roll dice every turn to determine what they find in their sector (more soldiers, items or specialists, or even courage). Meanwhile, enemy fire makes them lose soldiers at the end of each turn. The game ends when all the Units have successfully entered the bunker at the top of the Battle Map.\nAlthough built around dice rolling, this game is about resource management (soldiers, specialists, items and courage) and knowing when to move your unit. Resources are kept from turn to turn, so the players can plan ahead. Even though luck can influence your decisions, it is not a game of luck.\nOne of the main features of the game is the (almost famous) \u201cRWB System\u201d: if a player rolls 3 identical results on 3 dice of different colors, he scores a \u201cRed, White & Blue\u201d special bonus (RWB). Obtaining as many of these bonuses as possible is the key to winning the game, so players will have to think about dice combinations when they choose which dice to re-roll.\nD-Day Dice even includes solitaire rules, so you can storm the beaches all by yourself.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE RULES IN PDF FORMAT (select \"save as\" to save them on your computer)\n(Every player in D-Day Dice has a set of 6 dice: 2 red, 2 white and 2 blue. The game comes with 4 sets. Also included are 4 Unit marker dice, on the right, that serve as player tokens and as turn reminders. The regular black die is used to determine machine-gun fire and landmines casualties.)\nIf you want to try the game for free, here are the files (note: these won't look as good as the final project, but they'll give you an idea of gameplay.

Each Specialist has a special ability that becomes yours if he joins your unit.)\nAnd now, here's a preview of everything you can get if you become a supporter:\nKickstarter special rewards\nDistinguished Service Pack                                   \nThis exclusive 8 card pack contains some of the various card types found in the base game and some expansions. These cards are unique and will never be reprinted in the English language. Only Kickstarter supporters will have access to these exclusive cards (similar cards might become available in a future expansion, but with different names, so you'll be allowed to play with both versions).\nD-Day Dice Pouches                                                                                \nThese dice pouches will have the D-Day Dice logo printed on them, one in each player color + a black bag for the German player (5 bags in all).\n(Here are the cards from the Distinguished Service Pack, available exclusively to our Kickstarter supporters.)\nThe \"Badges\" Mini-Expansion\nThis small, 10 cards expansion introduces a new card type to the game: the Badges. Every time a Unit gains a \"Battle Cry\" RWB, it now has the option to draw a Badge card at random. These Badges have a permanent effect and can go a long way to help you storm the bunker. This mini-expansion is offered to all our Kickstarter supporters, and will become available later on as an online exclusive.\n(These are the \"Badges\", a new type of card that will help Units obtain some precious RWB bonuses.)\nBonus Kickstarter cards: the \"K-Pack\"\nThis pack of 6 cards, designed specifically to celebrate the success of our Kickstarter project (and offered to our supporters of all levels), can be added to any D-Day Dice game. All these cards are themed around \"Kickstarter\". The K-Pack includes the Supporter Specialist, the K-Rations and K-Gun Items, and the Awards Pledge Ribbon, Victory Ribbon and Campaign Ribbon. Here is an image of the first 2 cards:\n(These cards will add a little \"Kickstarter touch\" to your DDD games.)\n4 MGF Dice\nSupporters of all levels will also get a set of 4 \"MGF Dice\". These will come with special optional rules and will be compatible with the base game and all its expansions. \n(With these dice, Machine-Gun Fire will become much more unpredictable.)\n2 Bonus Battle Maps: SWORD BEACH II & RIVA BELLA\nThese 2 new Maps, printed on a heavy, double-sided board, will bring the total number of maps to 10 for supporters of the lowest level (just the base game), and to a whopping 22 maps for those who pledged for the Atlantikwall/Operation Neptune/Normandy expansions!\n\n - Sword Beach II: Playable as a single Battle Map OR as an extension to the \"Sword Beach\" Battle Map included in the base game, \"Sword Beach II\" will offer more of the very popular \"random sectors\" feature, where some sectors have variable special text. Random sectors mean that you can play the map over and over again, and never have the same experience!\n\n- Riva Bella: Ouistreham's Riva Bella Casino was one of the main objectives of the Sword Beach landings. The 177 French Commandos, led by Philippe Kieffer, were ordered to neutralize this strongpoint, which the Germans had converted to a very well-defended bunker. The French were greeted by sniper fire and an almost-impregnable machine-gun nest. Kieffer had to commandeer an Allied tank to break through the German defenses. Once the casino fell, the French Commandos went on to relieve the British forces at Pegasus Bridge... (These events can be seen in the movie \"The Longest Day\")\nLimited Edition Tin Box\nSupporters of all levels will also receive a special tin box to hold their game. This box will be embossed and printed with the regular box art. While this tin box can replace the original cardboard box of the base game, supporters will still receive the original game box (so they can choose which to use).\nA set of 6 Limited Edition RWB dice\nThis set of dice can replace any regular set of RWB dice. They have a cool, \"speckled\" look, which will make the KS supporter stand out when he plays a game with \"regular\" gamers. You can look at a dice sample pic in the \"updates\" section (at the top of the page).\nTHE D-DAY DICE EXPANSIONS\n(Click here for the full description of all expansions and their components in a pdf document)\nAtlantikwall \nThis expansion puts a new spin on the game: it lets one player play the German side. The German player can be added to any existing Map. He can transform a 2-player game into a head-to-head confrontation, or be added to any group of players (now up to 5 players).\nThe German plays like all the other players, rolling dice to gather resources, and spending those resources to recruit Specialists and find Items. The main difference is that the German does not move.\nThink of the German player as the Battle Map itself. It is up to him to \u201cactivate\u201d some of the features of the Map, and to make life difficult for the Allies, who have to work among themselves against him.\nAtlantikwall also includes 2 new Battle Maps.\nCLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE ATLANTIKWALL RULES\n(Instead of spending Courage to advance on the map, the German player, who stays in his bunker, spends his Courage to draw Decorations from a random deck. When he draws a grey Decoration, he must suffer a nasty effect that will help the Allies.)\nGott Mit Uns\nThis small expansion offers new cards for the Atlantikwall expansion. It contains a complete new deck of 21 Decorations for the German player, plus 3 new German Specialists and 4 German Items. These new cards will add variety and a little bit of unpredictability to the German player.\n(Brave and daring soldiers can earn Awards while under fire. These will help you bolster the morale of your unit.)\nOperation Neptune\nThis one offers 6 new Battle Maps. 4 of them are normal Battle Maps (with some exciting new rules to add a new level of challenge to the game) and 2 are double-sized, giant Battle Maps. New features like the \u201cCommand Posts\u201d and the \u201cFew Good Men\u201d rules give these new maps a character of their own. Also included are new Specialists and new Items.\nNormandy\nWant more Battle Maps? Here are 4 new ones, using some of the new features introduced in the Operation Neptune expansion.\n(Click here for the full description of all expansions and their components in a pdf document)\nAs you can see, we have a lot to offer. More than a game, D-Day Dice is like a family of games. It has already been enjoyed by hundreds of players and playtested intensely over the last 2 years. And with the various expansions it offers, you can tailor it to your individual needs. The basic mechanics (the RWB system) give a lot of control on dice rolling, so people who feel \"unlucky\" still have a very good chance of winning. \nAnd most of all, it's fun!\n**************************************\nWant to see more? Of course you do! Here are some montages of the game components... vintage items not included!\n(In D-Day Dice, you can find Items on the beach, half-buried by an explosion, dropped by a soldier in a hurry, or still clutched in the hands of dead comrades.)\n(There are also a few stalled Vehicles you can find on the beaches. With some repairs, you can get them going again to help your unit reach the dreaded bunker!) \n(To keep track of your Soldiers, Stars, Courage and Item Points, the game includes 4 Resource cards, with dials.)\n(Some game components from Atlantikwall for the German player.)\n(The German Specialists from Atlantikwall. Nasty bunch!)\n(The German player also has access to unique Items that are guaranteed to annoy the Allies.)\n(However tough the Germans might seem, the Allies have a few surprises of their own when playing against the German player in Atlantikwall!)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #38", "update_userinfo": "UP FRONT now on Kickstarter!", "update_content": "Good day everyone.

Here is what players had to say about Rise!\n\nBGG \"Mom\" : \"This would be a great introduction to strategy for my kids\"\n\nBGG \"Daper Gentleman\": \"I really see Rise! as a really great puzzle game\"\n\nBGG \"Wargamer\": \"Rise! is totally a tactical war style game\"\n\nBGG \"Euro Gamer\": \"I see Rise! as a worker placement / area control game\"\nProfessional Game Reviewer : \"It feels like cultists building monuments to allow Cthulhu to enter the world\"\n\nEveryone that we played with had their own take on Rise! Each player took the theme that was most meaningful to them and injected that into the game without even realzing they had done so. It was so amazing to see each player making the game their own!\nHow Rise! Plays\nIn Rise! you must build three towers before your opponent beats you in a battle to rise to the top! By cleverly surrounding an empty space with six workers you will break new ground and lay the foundation on a path to victory. Take caution though, if you lose sight of your opponent\u2019s plans your towers may be left in the dust!\nIn this simple yet strategic game for the whole family, two players battle it out by both adding to the ever changing board and placing their workers strategically to watch their towers Rise! While seemingly simple the entire game can change with the placement of a tile or a fiendish movement with a worker. What actions will you take in a game where winners must balance their construction with the destruction of their opponent?\nBreak Ground and Become a Permanent Part of Rise! with The Benefactor Tier\nNow you have the chance to break ground and become a permanent part of Rise! at The Benefactor Tier Reward Level. By pledging $125 you will receive everything in The City Planner Tier plus we will put your name on the foundation side of an actual Rise! tile that will be in every copy we get printed. People will always marvel at your tile! Your name being on a tile is very symbolic of the support you have given Rise! We couldn't have done it without you. You will also get a much bigger version of this tile as a \"Thank You\" that will be frame worthy. It will have the Rise! logo on it and your name with a thank you from us here at Crash Games!\nThe Ballistic Expansion Pack\nThis is something special we wanted to provide only for our Kickstarter backers. The Ballistic Expansion Pack adds a more \"take that\" element to Rise! with three different types of pieces. Let's take a look at them now.\nThe Anchor Piece- The Anchor Piece is nearly an immovable object. The Anchor Piece doesn't move except when he meets another one of our special pieces which we'll get to in just a minute. The Anchor Piece can wreak quite a bit of havoc when placed near an opponent's freshly laid foundation of one of their towers.\nThe Flash Piece -  The Flash Piece moves in quickly and is gone in a flash! When placed The Flash Piece wipes out everything that is on the six tiles that surround it, except towers. Use The Flash Piece wisely though because no one's workers are safe when The Flash Piece arrives!\nThe Vortex Piece - The Vortex Piece swallows everything in its path! When placed the Vortex Piece begins its timer and your opponent has four turns to disarm The Vortex Piece. If The Vortex Piece isn't disarmed, on the fifth turn after placement, the Vortex Piece wipes everything from the board from the six tiles surrounding as well as the tile it is placed on. This includes The Anchor Piece, Towers as well as land tiles. To disarm The Vortex Piece a player's opponent must sacrifice five of his workers within four turns of the initial placement of The Vortex Piece.\nAlso included in the Ballistic Expansion Pack for Kickstarter Backers will be a high quality, double logo drawstring bag. It will have the Rise! Logo on one side and the Crash Games Logo on the flip side. This bag will be great to pack your game up and take it on the go if you prefer to keep the box at home!\nRise! Production Components\nThese photos represent what the final components will look like with the exception of a slight color difference. The final product will come with very high quality pieces including over 75 painted wooden pieces and 60 linen covered hex tiles.

Night of Man is a card-driven, tactical board game. Set in a post-alien-invasion-of-Earth universe, the squads, heroes, and tanks of Earth's Militia battle against powerful aliens with enhanced power armor, hover tanks, biped robotic tanks, and spider-like robots. Gamers have a four card hand and may play a card, sometimes more, in each impulse. The cards activate units to move, fire, assault, and use special powers, such as explosive rounds, telekinesis, and more. Special cards, such as critical hit or bullet storm, can also enhance a unit'sattacks. Each turn continues until three end turn cards have been drawn. Players then choose one card from their hand to keep, the administrative markers are removed from the board, and a new hand is dealt to each player.

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Note: The images you see in the video are prototypes, and will not reflect the quality of the final product, which will be higher! Thanks for understanding!\nThe presidential election of 1860 was one of the most critical in the history of the United States. With civil war looming as a near inevitability, the challenge was to find a way forward after years of degenerating political discourse in the increasingly divided American electorate. In the end, after months of contentious campaigning between four major parties and over a dozen smaller ones, the election was won by the Republican dark horse candidate, a little known Illinois politician named Abraham Lincoln who hadn't even been the first choice of his party's senior leadership.\nDivided Republic is a card driven two to four player game representing the last calm before the storm that was to become the American Civil War. Players represent the four major parties (Constitutional Unionists, Northern Democrats, Republicans, and Southern Democrats) and attempt to win the presidency by defeating their opponents with dirty tricks, platform speeches, and the manipulation of key historical events. All the while, President Buchanan interferes, radicals riot, and the country continues the downward spiral toward civil war. \nIf one party wins the election by achieving the necessary 152+ electoral votes, or wins in the case of an electoral tie thrown to the US Congress, history may well change. Nevertheless, there is always the chance that the population of South Carolina will finally explode into open rebellion and secede, ending the game, at which point everyone loses!\nThis is a light to medium weight game with intense player interaction, card-driven play, and a play time of about 2-3 hours depending upon how events proceed. There are even a few laughs along the way as the mudslinging between parties heats up. Literally anyone can win - it's not simply a cut and dry Republican victory. This is a different kind of US election game, a game where there are not two, but four parties, set in a period when candidates did not generally campaign for themselves, and run in an era when the Republicans were still liberals and the Democrats were the vanguard of traditional American conservatism.\nI have been testing this game and showing it off at gaming conventions for entirely too long. Along the way, it's consistently been well received, and dozens of players have asked the same question: When will it be published?\nHonestly, the delay in getting it produced was twofold. First, it's a fact of anxiety: submitting one's designs can be a nerve-wracking and often demoralizing process, particularly if the game just doesn't suit the companies you're seeking to publish with. On a more practical front, however, it's simply a very difficult matter to get yourself published as a virtual unknown. One could have a truly brilliant design ready to go but be completely ignored by the industry's movers and shakers simply because one has not yet been published; it's a vicious cycle: they want more experience from you as a designer, and yet, without being published, you simply cannot get that experience! It's a tough road to hoe, even tougher with the economy in the state it's in.\nFortunately, and somewhat miraculously, a great little company called Numbskull Games, is offering me the opportunity to see my dream come true and to become a published board game designer. There's only one catch: producing a board game costs money. The design and component costs are only half the battle; there are also the costs of printing, production, distribution, and marketing. The costs are even higher with an unknown in the industry like yours truly.\nFortunately, the game is developed and ready to go. It's been extensively tested and proofread; placed in a burlap bag and soundly beaten with reeds; sanitized for your protection. All it needs is a little help in the production cost department to cover printing, final artwork, distribution, and the like.\nThat's where you, faithful reader, can make a difference. I need to raise the necessary funds to help cover the cost of the first production run of 1,000 copies. This can be accomplished with a relatively modest fee by industry standards: approximately $13,000. \nBy making a contribution, you'll not only help to bring a quality game to market, but you'll also help fulfill a long and dearly held dream. It would be my distinct honor to present this design to the gaming community, and Kickstarter finally affords that opportunity. Won't you consider a contribution?\nThanks very much for your time, in -any- case.\nAlex T.

Porfirio", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "Over a year ago, Clever Mojo Games jumped on the Kickstarter train with our first major game release, Alien Frontiers. People just like you--maybe even you yourself--sent us soaring to nearly 300% of our funding goal and helped put Clever Mojo Games on the map! Now we're back with an all-new board game called Sunrise City.  Take a look at the video above to get an idea of what Sunrise City is all about.\nGo ahead...I'll wait.\nSo, Sunrise City is a role selection, tile-laying, city-building board game. It's simple enough for kids of a reasonable age, friendly enough for family game night, and meaty enough for experienced gamers. It can be played by two, three, or four players and, depending on your experience, is playable in 60 to 90 minutes.\nAs you saw, a game of Sunrise City is played in three rounds and each round has four phases: Role Selection, Zoning, Bidding, and Construction. You can download the Prototype Rule Book PDF for all of the details, but lets take a quick look at each phase, below.\nAt the beginning of the game, before any of the rounds or phases start, each player is dealt four role cards.  From those four they select one card and pass the remainders left. They select a second card from the three cards they receive from the player on their right and again pass the remainders left. Finally, they select a third card from the two handed to them from the player on their right and return the unchosen cards to the game box. This is a simple draft and allows each player to choose their roles from nine possible cards. In the three rounds that make up a game of Sunrise City, the players will each choose one of their roles to use for the entire round and then discard it when the round is over. \nAt the top of each role card is a number. The player with the lowest role number each round will go first in each of that round's phases. At the bottom of each card is a description of that role's special ability. It could be a unique scoring opportunity, a means of harassing the other players, or a chance to bend the game rules in some special fashion. In general, the lower numbered cards have weaker role abilities, but give the player an increased chance of going first.\nAfter players have been dealt four zone tiles and four building tiles and chosen their role for the round, the zoning phase begins. Starting with the player with the lowest role card number, players take turns adding zone tiles to the city. Each tile represents a residential, commercial, industrial, parks & rec, or mixed use zone. \nAny zone type can be placed next to any other zone type, but the goal is to form zone combinations that match the building tiles in your hand so you can score points in the construction phase. Placing zone tiles adjacent to same-type zones already on the table will create a \"district\" and earn the player extra points.\nMixed in with the zone tiles are community tiles: Cathedral, Emporium, Fire Station, Zoo, and Police Station. These are the infra-structure of the city and they earn players extra points when they place certain building tiles in the areas surrounding the community tiles.\nAfter the players have added all of their zone tiles to the city, the bidding phase begins. Players are bidding to control the undeveloped zones so that they can construct buildings on them in the next phase. \nThe bidding system is simple, transparent, and cutthroat! Each player has a stack of six bid tokens and they take turns stacking them on undeveloped zones. To outbid another player you just stack your token on top of theirs. A player can \"close\" a bid by stacking one of their bid tokens on top of a bid stack where they already have the top bid. When the bidding is complete the markers on top of each stack are the winners and the markers underneath are returned to their players.\nEach building tile is made up of two building types that match the zone types mentioned earlier. When both buildings on the tile are the same type, the tile shows one larger building but it still counts as a separate building for placement and scoring. Each building tile also has three score numbers on it. The center number is scored by the player who adds the building tile to the city. The side numbers are scored by the players who controls the zone tiles on which the building is placed.\nIn the construction phase, there are two ways to add a building tile to the city. Placing a building tile directly on the zone tiles is \"ground floor construction\". The player must have one of their bid markers on at least one of the zone tiles on which the building tile is placed and the zone types much match the building types on both halves of the building tile. Placing a building tile on top of an existing building tile is \"upper floor construction\". In this situation, both halves of the new building tile must match the building types of the tile on which it is being placed. The player scores only the center number on the building tile and the side numbers are ignored. Bonus points are earned for adding odd numbered floors (3rd, 5th, 7th, etc...)\nThe community tiles that were added to the city during the zoning phase also affect scoring, giving a player an extra point if a matching type building tile is placed in an area surrounding the community tile.\nSo, there are lots of scoring opportunities, but what does that actually mean? Each player tracks their score on a ten-point score track, working their marker up the track for each point they earn. If a player's marker overshoots the top of the track, their marker wraps around and starts climbing again and the player earns one benchmark token. However, if the player's score marker lands on the star at the top of the score track by exact count, they earn two benchmark tokens. The player with the most benchmarks at the end of the third round is the winner.\nSunrise City is not a simple race for the most points, it a contest to grow the city in a manner that allows you to score the right number of points at the right time so that you can maximize your collection of benchmarks.\nThe Springboard Seal of Quality is your assurance that a new game project is worth your time and attention. All titles approved for Springboard campaigns are vetted by the game professionals at Game Salute. During this comprehensive evaluation process, Game Salute works with the publisher to ensure solid designs, thorough play testing, excellent presentation, and high quality components.\nThis Kickstarter funding project for individual gamers like you, is the first step in the overall Springboard campaign for Sunrise City. If we are successfully funded here on Kickstarter, the Springboard campaign will continue on to Phase II, a limited-time opportunity for retailers all around the world to get Sunrise City and the promotional exclusives.\nWe recognize and appreciate the important role that our Kickstarter Backers and Springboard Retailers are playing in the launch of Sunrise City and the success of Clever Mojo Games. Therefore, we make the following promises to you:\nThe promo cards and tiles noted as EXCLUSIVE will remain exclusive. We promise not to sell them individually or as a set, and not to include them as a part of any game expansion or re-printing. Once the Kickstarter Backers and Springboard Retailers have received their exclusive items they will NEVER be re-printed.\nSunrise City will be shipped to Kickstarter Backers at least two weeks before the items are available for purchase at ANY convention or store. Actual delivery dates will vary depending on your local postal service.\nStores who participate in Game Salute Preview Nights for Sunrise City will receive a preview copy for their Game Library in advance of the scheduled release date. \nI know this page is already three miles long, but I've got a lot to say. Below you will find some information about the variety of rewards available at the different pledge levels. From exclusive cards and tiles, to apparel, trinkets, art, and even your own image on a Role Card, I think we have something for everyone.\nWe have a set of nine EXCLUSIVE items for our Kickstarter Backers and Springboard Retailers. The primary character and building art is finished but the frame and borders are still being polished.\nFour Role Cards:\nDetective allows you to combine your zone tiles and the zone tiles of another player, choose the four you want to keep, and give the remaining four back to that other player.\nCity Planner allows you to rotate any zone tiles you control, thus changing the road layouts and possible zone combinations before you place building tiles on them.\nForeign Investor earns you floor points for even numbered floors. You already earn points for odd numbered floors, so now you'll be able to earn a bonus for every upper floor you add to the city.\nRe-Elected Socialite is a great last-round role as she allows you to choose a role card from any role that any players used in a previous round.\nFive Community Tiles:\nPower Plant subtracts a point for any Residential Building added in a surrounding area.\nUniversity subtracts a point for any Commercial Building added in a surrounding area.\nTheatre subtracts a point for any Parks & Rec Building added in a surrounding area.\nLibrary subtracts a point for any Industrial Building added in a surrounding area.\nStadium subtracts a point for any Mixed Use Building added in a surrounding area.\nWhat better way to show your support for Sunrise City than to wear a handsome, high-quality ball cap with an embroidered Sunrise City logo there for all to see and admire? The CITY PATRON levels are all about the cap, but the GROUND BREAKER and CIVIC LEADER pledge levels can add a cap to their other rewards for a small increase in the pledge amounts. The CITY SOCIALITE and CITY FOUNDER pledge levels include the caps. \nWhen you're sitting around the gaming table and telling everyone how you were the key to Sunrise City's success, you can dazzle your gaming buddies by pointing out the Sunrise City Key To The City lapel pin that you're wearing. The Key To The City Pin is included in the GROUND BREAKER, CIVIC LEADER, CITY SOCIALITE, and CITY FOUNDER pledge levels. This brass and enamel pin will become a treasured keepsake and make you the envy of all who game with you.\nIf you have a game room then you're definitely going to want some game art to hang on the walls, and we've got you covered.  We're making arrangements with Panda Games Manufacturing to set aside uncut printer sheets of role cards and building tiles for those Backers who pledge at the CITY SOCIALITE and CITY FOUNDER levels. I don't have the exact dimensions of the sheets yet, but I expect they'll be at least 20\"x30\".  Your friends will certainly appreciate your taste in art.\nThere are vanity license plates, and vanity book publishers, but those are nothing in comparison to a board game component! As part of the CITY FOUNDER pledge level, we will draw your likeness in the game's snazzy style, and put you on the Role Card of your choice. Four of those cards are already taken by the members of our design team, but that leaves 16 cards for you to choose from. Role Card choices will be awarded in a first-pledge first-drawn basis, so bid early for the best choices.\nSo, if you're reading this, you've slogged through three miles of text and we've had our chance to show you what Sunrise City is all about. Now, it's all up to you! Sunrise City will only go to press if gamers like yourself step up and say \"Yes, I want to play this game and here's my money!\" \nCan we count on your pledge?", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Sunrise City: Nights!", "update_content": "Just wanted to pop over to the original Sunrise City backers to let you know that the first full expansion for Sunrise City is now live on Kickstarter.\nSunrise City: Nights!\nClick on over and take a look and please do spread the word."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #32", "update_userinfo": "Sunrise City: Nightlife", "update_content": "A great big hello to all of you original Sunrise City backers.

Super Bonus Rewards Unlocked!\n\nAbout the Game:\nDIG: the Card Game is an easy to learn and fun to play, tactical card game of hiring dwarves, provisioning supplies, digging tunnels, and mining gemstones for 2 to 4 players. Average play time is about 45 minutes for 4 players.\nIn the game, players represent Dwarven Mine Foremen. Each day the foremen hurry to the Provisioner to buy tools and to the Labor Camp to hire Dwarves. The Dwarves then set out to mine the dangerous caverns of an unexplored mountain. The mountain isn\u2019t going anywhere, but other foremen are after the same gemstones. The Miners have six days (turns) to dig tunnels, mine gemstones, and hope to survive the day\u2019s inevitable cave-ins.\nThe Goal of the game:\nPlayers must carefully plan when and where to position their miners within their Tunnels for the most successful haul of gemstones. At the end of each day, players may sell their gemstones to the Provisioner (at variable rates) and try to win the game by having the most Gold Coins at the end of the sixth day (turn).\nDIG: the Card Game includes the following fun mechanics: worker placement (dwarves), resource management (picks and lanterns), a light economic engine (valuable rubies, emeralds, sapphires, and diamonds,) and a dash of geological luck (random Cave-Ins).\nA little more about the game\nThe game features great artwork by Sean McMullin, a clever economic engine using a variable set of Provision Cards, and is easy to pick-up and enjoy for new players. While there is a good bit of depth to the game for those who love to work through the best possible decision during their turn, the game can also be enjoyed in a lighter setting and by those who just want to have a little fun.\nComponents:\nThe game comes with a box full of great components:\n108 Full-color Cards, 40 Wooden Gold Coins, 10 Wooden Chests, 1 Rule Book.  \nThe box is not too large, but does contain just enough room to comfortably house the game (with cards sleeved if you so choose) and even a few future mini-expansion card sets.\nRead the rules to DIG: the Card Game\nView a sample round of game playDIG: the Card Game on Board Game Geek\nWhat the play-testers are saying about the game\n\"We really liked the idea of the changing buy/sell prices [via Provision Cards]. That adds a huge amount of risk and strategy to holding or selling. Great mechanic.\"\n\"[The game] goes surprisingly quickly, and so leads to more plays. That's a great thing.\"\n\"[The game] really is a unique blend of the fantasy genre (dwarves!) with an economics game (sell your gems at the best price!). There's a nice push-your-luck aspect in waiting for the best prices. Do you sell your gems early for a lower price to buy more tools and hire more dwarves, or do you wait for better prices?\"\n\"The proud owner [of a Level 5 Tunnel] had it for one round before it collapsed. Ha! If it hadn't collapsed, he would have been ruling the game--4 draws per turn just from one tunnel. But it takes some luck and a lot of investment to get there, so I think the return on investment is absolutely valid--don't change a thing!\"\n\"It's a really good game.\"\n\"You may want to consider entering DIG into [a] contest . . . you've got a good shot at winning, in my humble opinion.\"\n\"I will be pre-ordering.\"\nRegarding the art preview:\nView the complete Art Preview\n\"The cards look awesome.\"\n\"Well, I'm ready to shell out money for this game. To whom do I give my credit card number?\"\n\"It's always fun to see a game grow from a rough idea . . . and end up finished and looking fantastic.\" \n\"Fabulous. Absolutely fabulous.\"\n\"Very nice! [The Gemstones] give you the feel like they are hidden and (if you're lucky) of actually finding them!\"\n\"Love the escaping dwarf...he looks terrified.\"\nAbout the Game Designer \n\nHi, my name is Jason, and I'd like to welcome you to my Kickstarter Campaign. I am really glad you're here. If you've read this far, I owe you a little bit of background information about myself as well as why I'm so excited about DIG: the Card Game.\nIn the picture above, you'll see me posing in the gardens of Houmas House in Louisiana--it's one of the surviving sugar plantations of a lost era. I first conceived of the game (and began taking furious notes on its design) while traveling to Louisiana. I very much enjoy traveling, reading, watching movies, live theatre, collecting books, collecting games, and, as you might have guessed, playing and designing games.\nDIG: the Card Game is my first design, and it has been very well received by those who have played it in its earliest forms through the final version. I love card games because they are portable, usually easy to learn, most of the time a lot of fun to play, and, can be played a few times in a row in most cases. I designed DIG: the Card Game around those four principals:\nPortability (about the size of a hardback book)\nEasy to learn (you can learn as you play)\nA lot of fun to play (I've had great feedback on how fun the game is)\nA relatively short (but rich) playing time (about 45 minutes for 4 players)\nIn order to share my game with as many people as possible and in a beautiful format that everyone can enjoy, I am asking for your pledge to make the game a reality.\nI have a proof copy in my hands (right this very moment). The full-color artwork is beautiful, the wooden gold coins and treasure chests have a great feel to them, and the full-color clear and concise, illustrated rule booklet is a joy to flip-through while you are learning the game. If you love games, maybe you'll love DIG: the Card Game. Give it a try and pledge! Designing and creating the game was an immense amount of fun. I hope that you have an opportunity to play the game whether or not you are able or interested in pledging.\nRegards,\nJason Fordham\n\nThe Goal of the project:\nThe primary goal is to make DIG: the Card Game a reality. By pledging, you will be lending your support to the game, and, at the $25 Level (or higher) you will be receiving a copy of the game shipped to you for free (US addresses).\nThe artwork is done, and looks fantastic. The components are chosen, and look and feel great. The rule book has been completed, reviewed, edited, and polished for quick pick-up-and-play. All that is needed now is a group of people, yourself included, who are excited enough about the game to pledge.\nDetails:\nWhen can you expect your loot?\nEverything is finalized (art, layout, print proofs, components, box, rulebook, etc.) and, assuming funding, should be shipped out no later than December 5, 2011 with plenty of time for gift-wrapping, if applicable. Please note that this is a projection and not a promise, but it is a well-educated projection, and, barring any unforeseen circumstances, everything will ship on December 5.\n\n1.) Promotional Cards:\nTwo Promo Cards are included in each copy of the game at the $35 Level and higher. These cards are a lot of fun, with no extra complicated rules to learn. Add variety to your game by using one or both cards during your play sessions. Simply shuffle either or both into the starting decks and play. The pertinent rules for each card are included on the cards themselves making for a seamless experience.\nBlack Diamond Card - Card Text: Always sells for 6 Gold Coins; do not shuffle back into the Mine Deck. \n-The Black Diamond is a once-per-game find, adding additional excitement and fun every time your Dwarves go digging.\nDwarf Thief Card - Card Text: Always costs 6 Gold Coins. Play in your Play Area. Steal 2 Gold Coins from any 1 Player during each Dig Phase.\n-The Dwarf Thief does not dig or mine; instead, simply play him face-up in your play area as soon as you hire him. From then on, during each Dig Phase, you may steal 2 Gold Coins from any 1 player. So, for example, if you hire the Dwarf Thief on Day 2, you can feasibly net 10 Gold Coins (2 Gold Coins per day on Days 2-6).\n2.) Bonus Bits\nUpdate: funding has reached and exceeded $3000! all those who pledge at the $65 Level or higher (or who pledge at that level or higher prior to the end of the campaign) will receive a special Start Player Token and a Cloth Drawstring Bit Bag in each copy of the game.\nUpdate:  the Stretch Goal of $4000 has been reached, and all those who pledge at the Junior Journeyman Dwarf $35 Level or higher (or who pledge at that level or higher prior to the end of the campaign) will receive the custom Luck Mitigation Die. This die will add more fun to the Mining Rules--escape those cave-ins, mine an extra time, or discover a new \"free\" tunnel behind that wall of rubble! More details on the die as it becomes available. The die may ship separately from the game due to manufacturing deadlines.\nUpdate: the Super Stretch Goal of $5000 has been reached, and all those who pledge at the Junior Journeyman Dwarf $35 Level or higher (or who pledge at that level or higher prior to the end of the campaign) will receive advance PDF copies of all DIG: the Card Game mini-expansion card sets to print and play. Release dates for the mini-expansions may vary. Links to PDF downloads will be made available via KickStarter messaging, regular e-mail, and or via third-party website(s). Professional print copies of each mini-expansion will be produced, as well; these PDFs are advanced previews.\n3.) Expansion Sets in-the-works:\nWhile DIG: the Card Game is a complete game and a lot of fun to play by itself, there are even more ways to add variety to the game. There are six Mini-Expansion Card Sets in the works for DIG: the Card Game:\nThe Flood - Included in all pledge levels $45 and higher.\nSneaky Dwarf \nGoblins \nGemstones \nLava \nTools \nEach of the six mini-expansion card sets is inter-changeable--use one, two, or all of the mini-expansion sets with the base game to add interesting new decisions (and more fun) to the base game. A couple of the sets completely remove any luck from the game, adding more strategy and a deeper experience.\nUpdate: The Flood, the first Mini-Expansion Card Set, including ten new cards (Flood Cards, Pump Cards, and Raft Cards) is now included (Free) with all pledge levels at the $45 level or higher. If you are already pledging at $45 or higher, you don't have to do a thing: the Mini-Expansion is included in your Rewards Package. The mini-expansion set may ship separately from the game due to manufacturing deadlines.\nOther Details\nShipping:\nShipping within the US is free as long as all copies of the game are being shipped to the same US address. If you need multiple games shipped to multiple addresses, please contact me directly, and we will work something out.\nAdd $10 to your pledge for a Canadian address. $15 for two copies.\nAdd $15 to your pledge if shipping to an International address. $25 for two copies.\nNote: Simply click on the Pledge Level of your choice and change the dollar amount of your pledge (adding the above shipping fees) accordingly--Kickstarter will still register you at the appropriate Pledge Level (including its rewards), but your additional shipping fee will be included.\nIf you'd like to add an additional copy of the game to your order, simply add $25 to your pledge. Shipping is still free to any US address. Add $10 per additional copy of the game for Canadian addresses and $15 per additional copy of the game for International addresses. Your order and shipping intentions will be clarified prior to shipping. All extra copies of the game will include all rewards/bonus rewards appropriate to the respective Pledge Level. Exception: The $95 Pledge Level is limited to 10 pledges; extra copies of the game added to this pledge level will not receive additional copies of the signed, limited-edition art print.\nRetail versus Kickstarter Pledge:\nDue to the smaller print run, the retail price for the game with shipping included will be around $26. Pledging through Kickstarter is not much of a discount, but if you are interested in the game anyway, your pledge will help make the game a reality. If you do pledge, your support is very much appreciated.  Also, at higher pledge levels, you will receive added incentives to make your copy (or copies) of the game(s) special. \nKickstarter Rewards versus what everyone else can get:\nPromo Cards, Bonus Components, and the Mini-Expansions will eventually be available to those who did not pledge through Kickstarter. The Mini-Expansions will not be offered at 60% off to those who do not pledge through Kickstarter. The truly exclusive rewards include the free game contest, any additional contests that are added throughout the campaign, and the signed, limited-edition art print.\nHow to pledge\nIt's easy! \nClick any of the Pledge Levels in the grey boxes on the right-hand side of this screen. You'll be taken to a pledge screen where you can make your pledge. Pledges may be adjusted to account for extra shipping, etc. by simply changing the amount of your pledge in the box near the top of the screen.\nKickstarter uses Amazon Payments. If you already have an Amazon account, you are all set; if you do not, it's fast and easy to set up. Your pledge will not charge until/unless the project funds on October 2, 2011.\nFinal Words\nIf you've read this far, please accept a very heartfelt \"thank you.\" Creating DIG: the Card Game has been a truly rewarding experience, and I hope to have an opportunity to share the game with you.\nMy very best regards,\nJason", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #19", "update_userinfo": "DIG: the Card Game - Shipped and Shipping!", "update_content": "Many of you have gotten your copy(ies) of DIG: the Card Game already, and I hope that you have a chance this holiday weekend to break it out and enjoy it.\nI'm always available by e-mail if you have any questions during play.

How hot is this project getting?  \nFeatured on Wired.com.   Nerdbloggers.com just reviewed it too!\nReviews HERE, HERE, and HERE\nIt has now been picked up by major horror website Fearnet.com on their MAIN PAGE!\nThere is a new $180 pledge level for stores as many stores have been asking how they can get a copy with the distribution channels getting very little on the first print run.  Only a few left!\nCheck out this amazing Eaten By Zombies review by Drakkenstrike, the premier board game review site.  See all of their reviews at \nwww.drakkenstrikevideos.com\nHow much does Drakkenstrike like the game?  Here are some excerpts from the above video:\n\u201cWhat is so special and anomalous with Eaten by Zombies as a deck building game though, is the atypical game play  behind the game's premise, which takes the formulaic approach of deck building and injects it with a new set of mechanics that provide a COMPLETELY different style of game than what most fans of the genre are used to.\u201d\n\u201cEaten by Zombies first and most obvious visual appeal is the wonderfully suited ammo-style case in which the game is shipped\u2026. First, the card quality in this game is impeccable with bright colorful cards printed on very sturdy linen card stock, making it one of the best printed sets of cards I\u2019ve seen yet for a deckbuilding game.  Second, the 31 tab dividers are likewise printed on extremely durable stock, but also provide a wealth of information about each card for which they correspond, making them not only extremely functional but versatile in their use as well\u2026.\u201d\n\u201cWhat I haven\u2019t explained are the numerous nuances that create the games wonderful sense of tension and impending doom, including the balancing act that players will face when deciding on what actions to partake in during each of their turns\u2026\u201d\n\u201cOn top of all this I didn\u2019t even go into how incredibly creative and inventive other parts of the game are in a genre that has become so saturated with products.\u201d\n\u201c\u2026 makes the game an exercise in brilliant and balanced game design.  Eaten by Zombies is EASILY the most unique and well-thought out deck building game in quite some time.  And although I enjoy a multitude of games in this genre, its hard not to overlook the sheer inventiveness of this title, which sets it apart from so many others.  And with so many ways to approach victory in this game, players will continue to uncover new strategies and combinations of actions to accomplish their goals as either a survivior or as a zombie, making the game both highly enjoyable and infinitely replayable.\u201d\nNEW VIDEO REVIEW:\n___________________________________________________\nNEW REWARD: This will be included for all USA shipping rewards of $12 or more at all levels because the funding has reached an incredible $40,000.  What will we do if the Fearnet.com and Wired.com traffic push this to $50,000 before it ends?  We have no idea, but it will be something crazy!   OK, what is the $40,000 bonus?\nA Zombie Die!\nOne small annoyance of the game is that you have to remember how many zombies are supposed to come out each turn.  The game starts with one zombie per turn and then climbs to 2,3,4 or more as the game progresses.  We have admittedly lost track of the # of zombies coming out on occasion so thought what better way to keep track than with a Zombie Die!  Yes Die Zombie Die!  \nJust start the game with the Rosie the Riveter face up indicating one zombie per turn.  Then each time you shuffle the zombie deck and move up a level you change the Zombie Die up by one number.  This way you always remember how many zombies are supposed to come out.  It is a simple, fun way to remember the zombies and really how could we say no to a Zombie Die!  Whats more, it will easily fit in the box!\nEvery USA delivered copy will get this exclusive Zombie Die! with every copy in your reward since the pledge got over $40,000.\nUpdate: Please note the zombie die will take 8 weeks to produce so it will NOT go out with the game, but rather on its own separately or when the expansion is shipped to you for those with the expansion coming.  For those picking up at Essen we will NOT have the die in time for you.   We can ship it out with the expansion for those ordering the expansion, or with any other purchase on our website for free. \nIf anyone getting the game internationally shipped would like to wait to receive the game until the die is released we can do that for you, but it will put your shipment back about 6-7 weeks.  We will email you at the end of the campaign to let you know.  Sorry for the change here but we do NOT have the ability to internationally mail the die separately.\nWe have a new  Kickstarter for our other game, Tok Tok Woodman ENDING on Oct. 2!  Check it out!\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maydaygames/tok-tok-woodman-dexterity-game-2-7-players\nSorry for the confusion about international backing, if you are outside the USA and want to order the game for $25 please select the $32 support level which is the game + $7 international shipping.  We closed the $7 shipping as a separate item to avoid confusion.\nYou can check out the FULL RULE BOOK in PDF form HERE\nWhat are we doing?\nMayday Games has been around for several years and we have some great titles under our belt. We are launching our first ever Kickstarter Campaign to raise funds for an exceptional game developed by Max Holliday. Max is an AVID Zombie Movie and board game fan and has made a GREAT game that is the first to truly capture that feel of dread and scarcity that you should feel when playing in a zombie-infested, post-apocalyptic world. Eaten By Zombies will have KILLER artwork and will be available in September/October of this year! Don't wait months for your support to pay off, this will be to you quickly!\nDesign\nMax and John have done an AMAZING job on capturing the feel and look of a Zombie flick in this game. The game itself comes in an Ammo Box! Max did a great thing in making each of the 4 starting player cards truly unique. You will play as one of four characters: Bob (the office worker), June (the stay at home mom), Mary (yes, save the Cheerleader, save the world!) or Barney (the affable cop). Each of these four starting players has a UNIQUE set of cards, Barney's sandwich is a sub, June's Fight card uses a rolling pin, Mary's sandwich has the crust cut off... yeah it is just GREAT!\nDescription\nIn the new game Eaten By Zombies! players strive to survive as the horde of the living dead make it their goal in Death to force you to join the crowd. You must work with or against the other survivors to be the last one standing. No not standing, cowering in the corner crying for their mommy.\nThis game was developed in the spirit of AMC's \"The Walking Dead\", the movie \"I Am Legend\", and all those classic zombie movies. Eaten By Zombies takes you into a dark world of eventual death (undeath actually). Every turn you must venture out from your safehouse and scavenge for Swag. But not so fast, the Undead have other plans for your brains. Every day a Horde of fresh zombies will be waiting for you, and over time the threat gets greater. Now it's time for your \"Fight or Flight\" instincts to help you to survive just one more day. Using the swag you've got on you (ie cards in you hand) you must survive any way you can.\nIf you can get away or kill the Horde, you may scavenge the remains of the desolate suburbs for any Swag the neighbors may have left behind. With the right stuff and a few good friends to out run, you may just make it through this alive... well, no probably not. But being the last one to die a slow, painful death means you can claim sole victory!\nWith a set of 25 different cards to start with, no two games will ever be alike. This game is a combination of Card Drafting, Hand Management and Survival Horror with a few dirty tricks thrown in.\nGame Play/Mechanics\nYou start with five heavy sticks (each worth +1 fight) and five hide cards (each +1 flee) as well as two sandwiches (+1 Flee & Draw one card). You shuffle these 12 cards and draw 6 into your hand. You then face one of the 25 zombies from the Zombie Deck with a fight value ranging from 1-8 and a flee value of 1-4. You must announce Fight or Flee and then proceed to play some/all of your 6 cards in your hand.\nIf you successfully fight/flee you then take the total fight/flee value to the scavenging portion of your turn (think of it as a \"buy\") where you acquire items such as Shotguns, fists full of ammo, crowbar, binoculars, fire on a stick, grandma pantry, deadeye or other cards which you then put INTO YOUR HAND for use in the very next turn and draw back up to 6 cards from your draw deck. Played cards go to your discard pile, including any zombies you have succeeded in killing.\nIf you flee then the zombie card goes to the zombie discard pile. As you draw zombies into your hand (from shuffling your discard pile) you are stuck with them in your hand forever unless you play them into the zombie horde attacking on another player's turn, so the zombie horde gets tougher over time.\nIf you are unsuccessful in killing/fleeing then you must loose a number of cards equal to the flee value of the horde. These lost cards come from either your hand or as a blind draw off the top of your draw pile and go back to the scavenging area, weakening you. If you run out of cards you succumb to your wounds and become a zombie, now trying to kill the other players on each turn.\nIf a player ever ends up with six zombie cards in his/her hand the zombie players win as the remaining players have gone insane. Each time the zombie deck is gone through and reshuffled you add one more zombie to the horde for the rest of the game, making perpetual survival impossible.\nIt isn't a matter of if you're going to die but when. Be the last player standing and win. If at any time the entire zombie deck is depleted (because the players have killed all of them rather than using flee), all remaining players alive win together.\nThis is a unique cooperative/competitive game where you really feel the tension and inevitability of doom. You spend the first few turns building up your deck only to see the zombies increase in power and slowly drain your will to live as the game progresses.\n2-4 players, 20 minutes per player.\nContents:\nAmmo Box Shaped Box\n25 Zombie Cards (5 of each of 5 levels)\n4 Individual Starting Player Cards (48 Cards total)\n25 Swag Card Sets (125 cards each)\n31 Tab dividers\nFull Color Rule book\n2 Foam Inserts for easy storage/distribution & future expandability\nNew Tshirt BONUS!\nWe have had a lot of people asking for these and are excited to offer Eaten By Zombies Tshirts to all of you!

It is a product reflecting the designers' dedication, philosophies, and most importantly, their passion for games. We've brought Carnival to Kickstarter with the hopes of reaching out to both experienced and curious new gamers to help us raise enough money to bring Carnival to your table.\nOur dream is to create entertaining, innovative, and challenging games, and Carnival is just the beginning. Our Kickstarter goal is set at $5,000 but this only covers some of the costs related to the manufacturing and distribution of Carnival. If we are fortunate enough to receive further funding, this will help offset more of these costs and enable us to share Carnival and other future games with more people.\nThank you so much for your support and encouragement!\nThink Ferris wheels, rollercoasters, carousels, flying swings, and bumper cars! Open your carnival for business before the other carnies do by building four of the five available rides along your Midway. Then cue the carnival music and watch the crowd rush in!\nBelow are some other useful links:Official Carnival website\nCarnival Rulebook\nCarnival Video Tutorial\nCarnival page on Board Game Geek\nCherilyn's Designer Diary on Board Game Geek\nCarnival in the News\nCarnival is a card game of set collection for 2-4 players that utilizes dice to determine actions. Each turn, players have the option to either roll three dice and choose two of them to perform actions which can allow them to gain and discard cards from their hands and/or Midways -OR- to discard a Wild along with unwanted cards from their hand to draw new ones. Each player also has three tickets that may be discarded to affect the dice rolls or block other players' actions.\nThe box full of components was designed to bring a rich, thematic experience to the table; the cards are linen-embossed, the Tickets and Tableau are made of thick, durable card, and the dice are wooden. Popcorn is not included, but highly recommended!\n80 Parts cards (20 each of banners, lights, materials, seats)\n20 Midway base cards (4 each of bumper cars, carousel, ferris wheel, rollercoaster, swings)\n6 Wild cards\n12 Tickets\n3 Dice\n1 Tableau\n4 Reference cards\nWould you like to learn more about variants, strategy notes, or download a copy of the rules? Then visit this section of the website.

These products will never be offered for sale in stores by Dice Hate Me Games. So get yours here on Kickstarter now!\n                                            (click here see close-ups!)\nThis six-card addition to your Carnival box is sure to add even more fun! These cards replace the Wilds from the base game and all feature a character from the carnival sideshow. In play, they can behave just as the original Wilds or they can be discarded to perform the event specified on the card.\nAnd here they all are...come see The Sideshow!\n\nWe are collaborating with Chessex to create a set of dice that will bear the Carnival logo printed on the one-pip side. These dice have an antique marble finish and are guaranteed to live up to the high-quality standard that is always provided by the Chessex team.\nThis is the best game you will ever play with just one card and three dice. Or at least we like to think so! Lucky Dice is a quick game of solitaire in which the value of nine dice rolls are assigned to spaces on a 3x3 grid. We could tell you more, but don't you like surprises?!\nNeed some more convincing? Here's a testimonial from one of the first to try Lucky Dice at the World Boardgaming Championships: \"Once I had those dice in my hand, I couldn't put them down. I needed to get the high score like a a kid at the carnival needs that giant cotton candy. It's amazing how something so simple can be so fun. I can't wait to put a copy in front of my friends and watch them pull their hair out trying to beat me.\" - Mike Swiryn, designer of States: After the Fall\nKickstarter provides a platform for direct consumers to get Carnival shipped to their door before it hits the store shelves. As a retailer, though, you may reserve copies of the game through Springboard at Game Salute. \nAll titles approved for Springboard campaigns are vetted by Game Salute. During this comprehensive evaluation process, we work with the publisher to ensure quality. This includes ensuring solid designs, thorough playtesting and refinement, excellent presentation, and high quality components. - Game Salute\nWithout our Kickstarter Backers, DHMG would not be able to bring quality games to market.

Simple, you throw away everything the reader knows about zombie books and build a whole new foundation.\nChosen and Forsaken is not a \"zombie\" book... Well, not really. In telling this story, I wanted to create a world where zombies existed, but weren't the prime focus.\nChosen & Forsaken does that very thing by breaking the barriers that many zombie books rely on. This is not people surviving the undead, this is not trying to pick up the pieces and start all over again. This is simply existing in the face of ultimate adversity.\nSo, how exactly does this book differ from the others you may have read? I wanted to bring new life to the genre by making the zombies a bi-product and not the end result. Instead of the center stage, zombies take just a small part of the larger picture that's brought about by the four horseman of the apocalypse.\nIncorporating the four horsemen opens an infinite number of doors in the storytelling. There are literally no limits to what you can do. For that very reason, I decided to bring in every religion and not to stick to one. Each horseman is a deity or figure from a separate religion and those ideas lay on top of a foundation of more mainstream beliefs. This is not a religious book and doesn't teach a moral point. The story simply incorporates things from each religion or belief system, and moves on to more fruitful killings and more twisted story lines.\nDong Beniga Jr introduces the readers to the zombies and the team that we focus on and then Armando Rillo Sr. steals away the focus with his new age four horseman. All this talent is brought to life by Vladimir Popov and his coloring ability.\nAny money raised will be used solely to promote, advertise and produce copies of the book.

Will YOU be the last one standing?\nArena of Heroes pits two to four players against each other in a great melee battle to the death.  Each player starts in a corner, acquires items, and uses the movement and combat cards to fight it out in the arena.\nMovement cards allow you to move around the arena and gain the proper advantage against your opponents. \nCombat cards allow you to attack your opponents as well as defend against attacks launched at you.  \nItem cards allow you to increase the effectiveness of the combat cards by giving bonuses to attack or defense. \nArena of Heroes has been designed, play-tested, and is ready for you!\nIf you'd like more information on the rules, the English version can be downloaded here.\nHere is an \"actual play\" video showing the pace of the game and the various mechanics.\nHow do I know Arena of Heroes is for me?\nThat's a great question.  During the design process of Arena of Heroes, we playtested it with several different groups, hundreds of times, refining the rules and game mechanics.  In the end, we made sure everything works as expected, there wasn't a single \"cheap\" way to win every time, and everyone playing the game has fun!\nArena of Heroes is easy to learn with only 3 types of cards, but the strategies available are infinite.  You have the ability to play any and all of your cards on a turn, so it is not uncommon for someone to sprint across the arena, dealing blows to the other combatants.  Another approach is to be conservative with your moves and attacks, while building up the perfect combination of cards to get you into the right spot on the board for maximum damage to your opponents.\nIf this is such a great game, why do you need funding?\nAnother great question!  At this time, we are only able to offer products through various print-on-demand services.  This is extremely more expensive than being able to do a large print run with a print shop...which means if you help with funding, this will be more economical for us and cheaper prices for you!  In the end, we hope to release Arena of Heroes for around $40 to $50 a copy.  By backing us on Kickstarter, you can get a copy of the game and other great rewards for cheaper than the target retail price!\nHow much is shipping in the USA?\nShipping is FREE for all backers in the United States!\nI don't live in the USA, can I still help fund Arena of Heroes?\nShort answer: YES YOU CAN!\nLong answer: Shipping to Canada is an extra $5, other locations will need to add an extra $15 for shipping.  The game will only be released with a print version of the rules in English, but Spanish and German will be available via digital download.  Be sure to add this additional shipping to your funding pledge.\nEDIT: Backers at the $35 level and higher have an additional prize added, see Update #5 for more information!\n\nNew pledge levels added at $90 and $200, see Update #6 for more information!\nSee what others are saying about Arena of Heroes:\nReview from SinisterForces.com\nMentioned on Gnomestew.com\nReview from Home of Kindros\nReward change: $10 or more - your name in the manual, adjusted!\nAs the pledge levels show, anyone who pledges $10 or more will be listed in the manual.  I've decided to list each pledge level separately under the following Roman gladiator types (only the type will be listed in the manual, not the translation or definition):\n$10 - Praegenarii: Mock Gladiator. These were used as an opening act to get the crowd in the mood. They used a wooden sword (Rudis) and wore wrappings around the body. As they fought, they were accompanied by light-hearted comical music.\n\n$25 - Noxii: Criminal.  These were condemned criminals who fought each other. Sometimes one had a weapon and was blindfolded while the other was unarmed but had no blindfold. Sometimes they both fought with blindfolds with two referees (and the audience) giving them directions. The audience was known to yell wrong directions at times for their own amusement.\n$35 - Velites: Skirmishers. Fought on foot, each holding a spear with an attached thong for throwing.\n\n$50 - Rudiarii: Free Gladiators.  A gladiator who had won his freedom (received his wooden sword or rudis) but chose to remain a gladiator. Not all continued to fight and there was a hierarchy of rudiarii such as trainers, helpers, referees, fighters etc. These were very popular with the public as they were experienced and could be relied on to provide a good show.\n$75 -  Hoplomachi: Shield Fighters. From the Greek \"\u1f41\u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2\" (armed fighters). They wore quilted, trouser-like leg wrappings, maybe made from linen, a loincloth, a belt, a pair of long shin-guards or greaves, an arm guard (manica) on the left arm, and a brimmed helmet that could be adorned with a plume of feathers on top and a single feather on each side. Equipped with a gladius and a very small, round shield made of one sheet of thick bronze (an example from Pompeii survives) and a spear, (which the gladiator would have to cast before closing for hand to hand combat). \n$90 - Essedarii: War-chariot fighters.  From the Latin word for a Celtic war-chariot, Esseda. Likely first brought to Rome from Britain by Caesar. Essedarii appear as arena-fighters in many inscriptions after the first century A.D.\n$125 - Bestiarii: Animal Fighters.  Men specializing in fighting various types of exotic, imported beasts with spears. The fights were arranged in such a way that there was a small chance the animal would win.On occasion condemned criminals also fought animals in the arena, but under less favored conditions. Bestiarii were technically not considered gladiators as they did not fight other men.\n$200 or greater - Andabatae: Horesback Fighters.  From the Greek \u201c\u1f00\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u201d (ascensores) because they fought on horseback. They wore mail like eastern cavalry (Cataphracti) and wore visored helmets without eye holes. They charged at one another on horseback similar to a medieval joust but without being able to see each other.\nTake a look at Update #8 for the map and more information about the top three pledge levels!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Jeremy Southard\nFirst created \u00b7 153 backed\nJeremy Southard has played board games, card games, roleplaying games, and video games all his life, and officially started Wastex Games in...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #12", "update_userinfo": "Spanish and German", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just got the completed translations of the rules for the game.

Be careful though to not make one group of Aid too powerful or your feudal opponents will grow in power.    \nOnce the Aid has arrived to your Barony, use it wisely to either build impenetrable defenses, upgrade your troops in order to combat the invaders as they enter through the mountain pass or take the fight to them using siege equipment.\nDraft of the Rules\nNext Targets\nNow that the minimum funding has been reached, let's go for the following add on rewards!\nBecause we reached $18,000, each Kickstarter backer who pledged $50 or more will receive a free copy of the mini-games with the designer's prototype art on postcard mats.\n\nAt $21,000, the artwork will be upgraded to professional art.\n\nAt $25,000, the professional artwork mini-games will be mounted on board stock.\n\n* - These are not exclusives, Kickstarter backers of >$50 will receive a free copy. If any of these goals are reached, the mini-games will be available for sale in the near future.\n\nWhat are the mini-games?\nThe mini-games were designed during the early design phases of Dragon Valley. They can be played by themselves or provide entertainment to players while the other player(s) divide the King's Aid. They can provide real, in-game victory points. This creates a nice, integrated timer within the game.\nHow can you try Dragon Valley?\nI have been able to provide demo prototype copies to the following locations.  If you live near them, please contact them about how to arrange access to the game.  Make sure to support them any way you can.  It would be a great time to pick up a game you want while you are there.\nDallas Games Marathon (DGM) in Plano, TX - http://dallasgamesmarathon.com/ or http://www.meetup.com/Dallas-Games-Marathon/\nChicagoland Games in Chicago, IL: http://chicagolandgames.com/\nColumbus Area Boardgaming Society in Columbus, OH: http://www.buckeyeboardgamers.org/\nDiamond K Games - All other locations, especially Dallas, TX: http://www.diamondkgames.com/\nNote that these copies are the pre-production artwork and components.\nSpecial thanks to Wonko's Toys and Games in Austin, TX for their hosting of a demo day on July 30, 2011 and weeks of being a demo location:  http://www.wonkos.com/\nWhat happens with your pledge\nThe funds received will go towards the manufacture of Dragon Valley through the top notch game manufacturer used by other prominent board game projects on Kickstarter.

The final board will look amazing as the artist updating the art has illustrated a lot of game board maps and game tiles including Runebound, Republic of Rome and various sets of Zombies!!!.\nHow Pledging Works\nIf you haven't pledged to a Kickstarter project before, here are some tips. You can pledge any amount, you don't have to stick with the pledge levels on the right. The levels are just the minimum for the various gifts. After you pledge, Kickstarter will send you over to Amazon. Neither Kickstarter nor Diamond K Games will ever see your financial information. Your credit card will be charged only if the project is successful, and only at the end of the funding period. Once funded, we will follow up with you on the details of your rewards.\nOnce the funds are received from Amazon, the required payments will be provided to the manufacturer to begin.  If you pledge at a the $50 level or above, your gift(s) will ship as soon as the shipment is received, targeted for January 5, 2012. \nT-Shirt Details\nThe t-shirt concept artwork is below.  Once the project is successful, a professional artist will create the final artwork to be used on the t-shirt.   If you would like to add a t-shirt to a funding level, just add $25 per shirt you would like.  That even goes for the $25 t-shirt level.  For example, if you select the $25 level and make the donation value $75, you will receive three t-shirts.  \nRegistered Royalty Level (Royal Advisors)\nThe below chart shows the titles and likely powers of Royal Advisors from the upcoming expansion to Dragon Valley.  By backing at the Registered Royalty Level, you can have your name on the role card of your choice, pending availability, with the choices made in order of backing at this level.\nGame Play Photos\nProtospiel-South organizer Jonathan Leistiko playing a prototype version of Dragon Valley with University of Cincinnati students who traveled to Austin, TX.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #23", "update_userinfo": "Update on \"Dragon Valley: Coruns\" (Includes the Royal Advisor Expansion)", "update_content": "My intent was to release the Dragon Valley expansion in 2012.

I\u2019m here to talk about my nearest-and-dearest project, Recipes for the Dead. \nRecipes for the Dead was an idea I came up with in 2010.  I was deeply passionate about it and it must have showed, because I found a wonderful artist and produced the first issue with her within months of the idea\u2019s inception.  After successfully producing the first issue, the many unfortunate circumstances that can hit a young artist during a recession happened to me, and I had to put Recipes on an unintended hiatus.  However, after months of building up my resources and clout again, I am able to present to you with issue 2 of Recipes for the Dead: Apricot Asylum.\nI was always a believer that art and illustration is transcendent beyond its own genre \u2013 be it fine art, manga or anything else.  Simply, I thought, if done well, a work of art can be appealing to anyone, even if that person typically is not an enthusiast.  I wanted to create a beautiful book that would be appealing through the story, the colors, and the lines.  Recipes for the Dead was my experiment and I am pleased to say that it performed beautifully \u2013 I found that it captivated not just the fans of anime or even art, but it did well amongst people who never read comics before.  Veronica\u2019s wonderful supporters gave me the motivation to do it again - find another amazing artist, to keep writing and to come back to Kickstarter with the second issue in this series.\nThis time around, the enchanted brushes will be wielded by one brilliant Allison Strom, an artist who can build atmospheres and tear down worlds with a simple brushstroke.  Check out her magic on the first page of RftD: Apricot Asylum!\nSimilar to Issue 1, Issue 2 will be roughly 20 pages and completely in full color.  The $2,000 will allow me to pay Allison, the production costs, Kickstarter fees, and offset some of the post office costs.  I am hoping to bring this book with me to New York Comic Con in October, so I anticipate having the complete PDF by the end of September (anyone who donates $5 will be seeing it the same day as I do!).  Along with the rest of the incentives, I will be posting Allison\u2019s sketches, updates and notes from the story, which anyone can access just by donating $1.\nI hope you take the opportunity to become part of this project and in the meantime, enjoy the process.  And if you\u2019re New York-bound during Comic Con season, remember, I\u2019m the girl with the cookies.\nP.S. It would do me a world of favor if you add an extra $4 to your donation if you\u2019re pledging internationally. \nThank you all for checking out my project and I hope you decide to contribute!\nYours truly,\nVera Greentea\n(Practically all of the art in the video was created by Allison Strom.

We are excited to have the game printed and get it sent out to everyone. And YES, you can still pre-order the game through Saturday, July 23 to ensure you have the keenest Christmas and the niftiest New Year ever!\nIt happens every year\u2026\nThe annual White Elephant Christmas Party is coming up and you want to take the best gift ever. But you put it off until the last minute (again) and end up taking a box of mac & cheese wrapped in newspaper (again). Lame.\nWell, this year is different. This year, be the first on your block (or office, or family, or whatever) to bring the most sought-after gift ever! Some lucky partygoer will take home the excitement with their very own copy of the White Elephant Card Game. Better yet, grab an extra copy for yourself and relive those classic gift stealing, backstabbing moments all throughout the year!\nSome may know the classic White Elephant gift exchange game as Yankee Swap, Dirty Santa, Thieving Secret Santa, or Parcel Pass. The retro-style White Elephant Card Game simulates this classic holiday game. It's a jolly good time for three to six players aged eight and up and plays in about 15-20 minutes. It\u2019s perfect for families and anyone in the Holiday spirit all year \u2018round!\nIn the White Elephant Card Game you play the part of a no-good cheapskate, unwilling to spend a measly dime on the people on your gift list (hey, just like real life!) However, you will be attending several White Elephant parties. You can take some junk from your attic and exchange it for treasures to give as gifts. If you \u201cplay your cards right\u201d you could fill your gift list for free and no one will be the wiser!\nEach player has a Gift List Card, a list of three people for whom to acquire gifts. The Gift Cards in their hand constitute their \u201cattic\u201d. There is one \u201cWhite Elephant Party\u201d for each card in a player\u2019s attic.\nFor each \u201cparty\u201d a player \u201cbrings a gift to the party\u201d by placing one Gift Card from their hand facedown on the table in front of them. The first player begins by selecting one of the gifts and \u201copens\u201d it by turning it face up. The next player may then select a new gift, or \u201csteal\u201d an opened gift by taking a face-up Gift Card from a player who has an open gift. When a player steals an open gift they hold it in their hand until a new gift is opened. This way a gift may be stolen only once until a new card is turned over. When a new card is turned over all stolen gift cards are placed face up so the next player may steal any opened gift.\nThis continues until the last gift is opened. At this point each player keeps the gift they have and a new party begins. This continues until all of the Gift Cards have been played.\nAt the end of the game each player counts only the one highest-numbered Gift Card they received that matches each color on their gift list. The total of these cards is the player\u2019s final score. The player with the most points wins. Ties are resolved by the player who looks the most like an actual white elephant claiming victory.\nComponents\n36 gift cards, 6 gift list cards\nSeven-player expansion (13 gift cards, 1 gift list card)\nRules\nTuck box\nSo why the Kickstarter campaign? The answer is simple\u2026we need the cabbage. We are asking for your help to finish all of the artwork and have the White Elephant Card Game printed. The game consists of a standard poker-sized deck and a short set of rules in a lovely little tuck box.\nBut wait, there\u2019s more. Every game will include the seven-player expansion. The seven-player expansion is truly amazing because it allows you to\u2026wait for it\u2026play the game with seven players! (I\u2019ll bet you didn\u2019t see that coming.)\nBut wait, there\u2019s even more. Some of the backer levels include special one-time offers that will only be available by supporting the White Elephant Card Game through Kickstarter (like the awesome Mystery Box promo cards). Please read through the levels for more information.\nSo what are you waiting for? No really, most people don\u2019t make it this far down the page. Select a pledge level on the right and give it a click.

I was happy to hear Philip got signed for this game with another publisher - we were just a bit late. After talking to Philip more we found out he had another game he's spent even more time on that he'd consider publishing with us. Its a good solid Euro game with some twists on WP, so we decided to take a chance on it. But wood bits are expensive, and we just recently sent 4 other games to the printer. So we could use some help with cash flow on this one. Thus, this Kickstarter event.\nWORDS FROM THE DESIGNER: Philip duBarry\nDon\u2019t assume this is just another get-resources-and-build-stuff eurogame. Our years of development have resulted in multiple innovations tightly fused together in an easy-to-learn, challenging and fun gaming experience. Right from the start players are presented with interesting choices and a \u201cfirst-to-blink\u201d mechanism that adds real excitement to the basic worker placement. From there players may connect the individual spaces together forming vast trade districts that can be activated by only one pawn. Finally, players must decide how best to deploy their various resources. Buildings block other players from certain resources and give you extra spaces. The Market allows you to profit from any shortages or over-abundance in the game. Or you may choose to help construct the famed Temple of Solomon, which grants access to the powerful High Priest and a substantial endgame bonus.\nWith these elements along with many other twists and turns, Kingdom of Solomon will provide you with a concentrated and unique gaming experience. Thanks for your support. We are very excited to bring you this wonderful new game!\nMain Design Elements for Kingdom of Solomon:\nInteresting choices right from the start. This game features a tight worker-placement mechanic with a \u201cfirst-to-blink\u201d twist. Players may claim spaces with pawns or use all their remaining pawns to claim one of the three Bonus Spaces, each providing a super-sized bonus.\nCreate vast trading regions. Players may connect various spaces together with Roads and piece together a gigantic Resource Region which can be activated with only one pawn.\nConstruct various unique structures. Buildings block the other players from certain resources while giving you extra action spaces. Different buildings are available each game!\nFortune cards always give players a few surprises. Fortune cards may be held and played at a later time. Does your opponent have extra victory points, more resources or a special power that might complicate your plans?\nA dynamic Market system regulates shortages and over-abundance. Skill and timing can help you earn those last few points or obtain that last hard-to-find resource.\nBuild the famed Temple of Solomon. Helping to build the Temple grants access to the powerful High Priest and a substantial endgame bonus.\nFantastic theme. Ricky Hunter\u2019s amazing art transports the players back in time and makes the game come alive. Prove your loyalty to the wisest and richest monarch in history. The top-notch components will make your experience one to remember.\nWORDS FROM THE ARTIST: Ricky Hunter\nTo start, what a wonderful team to be a part of, and what a great experience it has been for me. I have always wanted to create art for a board game, so naturally I jumped at the opportunity to work on the Kingdom of Solomon. I'm hoping the art helps create a great atmosphere for everyone while playing, as great game art has always done for me. I am extremely proud of every illustration, and am thankful and grateful to each and every fan who will help get Kingdom of Solomon started.\nMinion Games has created several board and card games in the last 2 years, but since we've already paid for 4 more to be printed this year, we find the cash flow tight - yet we have some more great games we wish to publish! So we come to all you great gamers for assistance in publishing one more!\nWhile the game costs way more than the $5,000 we're seeking here, we should be able to cover any remaining costs if we at least get that much. But we hope to see more from this effort. So please continue to donate even if we've reached the funding level.

This really only makes sense for people who are not living/shipping to North America. So especially if you live in Europe this will save a good amount of time and maybe even some money. Since we can bi-pass the month on the boat, I'm willing to do this so you have copies in time for Christmas.

It's my understanding that the games will be on a boat November 11th and then that takes 28 days to get to the USA. Then about a week to get to us and then we'll ship out the Kickstarter copies (with the promo card) and pre-orders from our website and Essen. We will thus ask for your mailing address any any extra shipping due in the beginning of December. If you picked up your copy at Essen already, we still owe you a promo card so still supply us with your current address when asked."}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #17", "update_userinfo": "Shipping Update", "update_content": "Arise Minion Gamers!\nCalling all MINION GAMERS!
