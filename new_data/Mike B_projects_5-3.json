On Grim Peak, players are not tasked just with survival, but also satisfying the whims of the Peak's masters. Players will also find throughout the game that some monsters interact together, often worsening the situation. Adapting to these new threats will be key to your victory.\n\nTo defeat the peak, you will have to work together and plan the usage of your abilities wisely. Combinations set up between players can solve many problems on one turn. At other times, you may simply try to delay, distract or unsummon monsters to prevent yourselves being overwhelmed.\n\nGrim Peak will have artwork by Joseph Knight. Below are a werewolf enemy and a Chieftain player character by Joseph that will feature in the game. Some of the money raised in the Kickstarter will be to commission Joe for the rest of the game artwork (with the rest being to fund the first factory production run). You can find more of his artwork here.\nThose interested can take a look at a quick rules overview here. More detailed information on characters and monsters can be found lower on this page.\nThe miniatures included in the genteel and deluxe backer options are from Black Sun Miniatures. We have used them in testing and have found them very good. Some of them come with different weapons options too! Miniatures need some assembly (usually just 1 or 2 parts). Players getting the standard set will have 6 small wooden figures (kind of like meeples, but to our design) in different colours for the characters.\nCustom hand-painted wooden boards are available in the deluxe tier. They are painted in acryllic, which is water resistant and hard wearing, then painted with a few layers of gloss varnish for a slight shine finish and to further protect the board.\n\nBoards will come in base several designs and you will be able to choose the style and colouring. A small message or detail can be included on the board too if you wish. The board artist, Vikt\u00f3ria Murtinova, will work with you via E-mail to make sure any customizations you want will be suitable to paint onto the board.\nCharacters have a variety of powers. Special abilities can only be used once per game. Planning when and how to use player special abilities is often one of the keys to victory. A well planned combo can see several threats removed in one turn!\nYou can take a look at character powers below. The final game character cards will be redesigned around Joseph's artwork.\n The game includes 40 monsters. Many of these monsters have different effects, can interact and this can drastically change gameplay. A unique aspect of the game is that most monsters will continue in the direction they were initially summoned in. This means players can see where monsters will be in a few turns, and often work out strategies a few turns in advance and try to plan when best to use their powers. Sometimes you can delay or destroy many more monsters with epic combos planned over several turns.\nMonsters come in many types. Fast flying monsters provide threats that must be dealt with quickly. Player Hunting enemies will relentlessly hunt the closest player. Demons can, if left alone too long, end the game in a single turn. While dealing with these major threats, other minor monsters will be roaming the board, possibly summoning allies or being redirected by their kin.\nThe large number of different monsters mean that during most of the game, there are numerous interesting threats to deal with. It also offers good replayability, as each game plays very differently depending on the order the monsters appear (and characters selected).\nGames can be collected at the UK Games Expo 2019 if you don't want to pay shipping. If you wish to collect your game, please select 'Antarctica' as your shipping option.\nOtherwise, shipping will be done by Royal Mail and we will try to ship all games within the first week of receiving them from the manufacturer. Shipping times vary, but should be approx. 3 days UK shipping, 5 days European shipping and 7 days to the rest of the world.\nGames will be sent from the UK, so no customs charges will apply within the EU. Other countries may charge customs / taxes.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have had quotes and time estimates for production and shipping of the game, the miniatures and artwork (including the artwork for customized game boards). I have worked with all involved artists (Joseph Knight on artwork and Vikt\u00f3ria Murtinova on custom boards) before and with Black Sun Miniatures. All parties have delivered in a timely fashion (in fact, they have been very good to work with!).\n\nI have consulted with some people with experience self-publishing in the board game industry and have been advised about some of the hidden pitfalls that await the unwary self-publisher.\n\nAlso, there is quite a long date for the arrival of your game, just in case there are any delays.

Experience dice free combat and battle against more than 10,000,000 uniquely generated creatures on a map that has 1,000's of possible layouts, using characters you create by choosing from over 100 different options.\nThere are 6 heroes to choose from, each featuring 12 unique skills and 90 customisable stat points allowing you to specialise in attacking, healing, tanking, area control and worker management.\nThis Kickstarter adds four new World Packs to The City of Kings allowing you to pick and choose the new content you want to have:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma  \nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nSide Quest Pack 1\nHero Pack\nEach Character Pack contains 2 new playable heroes with advanced skills, a new 3 story adventure, and more terrifying creature abilities creating new puzzles for you to solve. \nThe Side Quest Pack tells you more about the world by adding 50 new side quests to The City of Kings, introducing the new \"Get To\" and \"Build\" quests to the game.\nThe Hero Pack adds 6 miniatures to The City of Kings, so you can replace your hero standees with beautifully sculpted miniatures.\nFor those of you who already own The City of Kings, an Upgrade Pack will be sent to anyone selecting the \"Create your own\" or \"World Packs\" tiers containing free copies of the updated Rulebook and Quick Reference booklets.\nDigital versions will also be made available shortly after the campaign for anyone who would like them.\nIn addition to new content for The City of Kings, during this Kickstarter we are offering our new standalone game, Vadoran Gardens for the very first time!

By earning XP! For every \u00a320,000 we raise, you will earn 2xp, and every day we will be releasing daily quests via updates, Facebook, Twitter and on our website where you can help earn bonus XP!\nThe City of Kings can be played in 2 ways, by choosing either a story or a scenario.\n7 Stories  \nThere are 7 stories to play, each story has its own objectives and continues a narrative introducing you to the world and characters. Stories are the heart of The City of Kings and will provide you with a challenging, immersive experience.\n12 Scenarios\nThe 12 scenarios provide quick ways to play the game offering smaller challenges of varying difficulty. They focus on different aspects such as combat or worker management and provide endless ways to play, and you can even create your own!\nLet\u2019s go  \nOnce you have chosen a story or scenario, each player will need to choose a hero to play. Each hero can be customised by levelling up, allowing you to create your own role.  \nPerhaps you want to be a long-range attacker or a fast moving, short range healer. If you\u2019d prefer to focus on absorbing damage (tanking) or managing workers, then you can do that too! There are 90 customisable stat points and 12 skills per hero, so you never have to play the same way twice.\nThe City of Kings is played in rounds, during each round you will check if you have completed your objective, update the time tracker and then each player will perform their turn.\nPlayers will move across the board turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders, creatures and more.\nEach player will control multiple characters, their hero and their own workers, who can be used to gather resources, build structures, explore and place traps.\nWhen you encounter creatures they will be generated from a simple set of rules creating a challenging creature for you to defeat. There are over 10,000,000 possible creatures to fight and each will require you to come up with a strategy to defeat it.\n Creatures are persistent, staying on the board until they are defeated. There are no dice*, if your attack stat is 5, you will do 5 damage. You will need to work together, using your environment to absorb the creatures attacks, keep each other alive and to find a way to overcome the creatures' powerful abilities.\n* For players who like to roll dice, there is an optional character stat which you can level up, allowing you to roll dice to modify your attack and heal actions.\nThe Blood-Letter's chase Vyliria and Earthshaker around the board setting fire to the environment. Our heroes try to survive whilst their workers build up the Shrine, giving them the additional strength they need to defeat the creature.\nThe City of Kings offers endless puzzles requiring true cooperation, full character customisation, roleplaying quests, resource management and an immersive experience that we hope you will love. \nYou can download the rulebook here and the quick reference booklet here.\nThe City of Kings is a fully cooperative game with no hidden information and supports solo play through a single player controlling 2 heroes. As such, the game plays the same as it would for 2, 3 and 4 players and you will get the full experience.\n  You can read the full review by Geek & Sundry here.\n You can read the full review by Who Dares Rolls here.\n You can read the full review by Polyhedron Collider here.\nYou can read the full player report by Robert Yates here.\n The following full customisation options can be added to any reward, simply increase your pledge amount by the amount shown below.

Old V\u2019Sheel, the High Priestess of the Vadoran Gardens is retiring, and maybe one of you will take her place. Go out into the gardens, study her lessons in Life, Nature, and Wisdom to prove yourself worthy of such an honor.  \nVadoran Gardens is a standalone competitive card-drafting and tile-laying card game, set in The City of Kings universe. Players take it in turns to play cards while trying to connect similar tasks such as feeding animals, watering flowers and cleaning relics, as they try and complete the lessons set by Old V'Sheel.\nVadoran Gardens is played over 10 rounds, in each round you will be set a lesson restricting the cards you can play.  \nOn your turn, you will pick up the card you selected on your previous turn (or during setup if it\u2019s the first round), and then place 1 card in front of you.\nThe first card you play will be placed on the table, every following card you play must overlap the last column of the previously played card. The card does not have to overlap all 3 squares in the last column, but it does have to overlap at least 1, giving you 5 options each turn.\nAs you explore the gardens, you will want to connect areas of grass, soil and water to score points and avoid the sand. You will need to connect animals, flowers and statues in specific ways to complete achievements while trying to return lost animals, pendants and tools to their homes.\nOnce you have played a card, you will then need to place your Player Token on the card you want for the next round, this decides both the card you get and turn order for the next round. You will always know what cards you have available for this round and the next, along with what restrictions will be in place, so forward planning is essential.\nYou can download a draft version of the rulebook here.\nIf you would like to get both Vadoran Gardens and The City of Kings then please select the appropriate tier for The City of Kings content you would like, and increase your pledge by \u00a317. You can do this when you select your reward by manually increasing the amount shown by \u00a317, and at the end of the Kickstarter we will ask you to confirm the \u00a317 is for Vadoran Gardens. \nShipping for Vadoran Gardens will be free, when added to any The City of Kings or World Pack rewards.\n You can read the full article by Creaking Shelves here.\n All shipping is EU, America, Canada and Australia friendly, so no custom fees will be charged for these locations.\nUnfortunately we can no longer ship to Brazil due to their customs regulations. If this should change I will let you know.\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\nFrank West is the designer of The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens, he is also the worldbuilder, art director and graphic designer.\nMiguel Mitchell Da Silva works full time creating the artwork for The City of Kings Universe and creates nearly all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst adventuring in The City of Kings and Vadoran Gardens.\nSara Jorge is responsible for making Frank\u2019s dream became a reality by helping with prototypes, playtesting, design concepts and by believing in him every single day.\nIan O'Reilly is our primary writer assisting Frank with writing the stories and quests you\u2019ll find on our website and in the game.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nHeriberto Valle Mart\u00ednez is our primary sculptor and created the amazing miniatures available during this campaign.\nMatthew Walker created the sound track for our Kickstarter project video.\nRosko Lewis provided the voice for our Kickstarter project video.\n We would love to hear from you and talk about The City of Kings, Vadoran Gardens or just gaming in general!

We will be running more playtests as the Kickstarter campaign runs, but we expect any further changes to be minor. \n\nArtwork\nAll of the artwork is done for the core game, we have a few tokens and bits of graphic design to finish off for the expansions but otherwise we are good to go. \n\nMiniatures\nThis will be the first time we include miniatures in our campaign, but we have chosen to work with the same company that is used by CMON to produce their miniatures and are confident the end result will be amazing.\n\nEditing\nThe bulk of the work prior to manufacturing now is copy editing and proof readings of all the new content and rule updates to make sure we catch as many spelling mistakes as possible. We\u2019ve allowed time in our delivery schedule to manage this.\n\nManufacturing\nWe will once again be working with Whatz Games who did a fantastic job for us in the first print and we are confident in their ability to manufacture a great second print.\n\nShipping\nOur importing and fulfilment process went very well during the first campaign, delivering games to all regions within a few weeks of each other. There were a few minor issues which we have learned from and are confident our fulfilment partners will deliver on time.\n\nFinal words\nThe first Kickstarter campaign for The City of Kings was an incredible journey, we all learned a lot and I hope you will join me in this next stage of the adventure.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u00a31 or more", "title": "Adventurer", "descp": "Follow along with updates and take part in The School of Games!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2018"}], "stat": ["611 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a35 or more", "title": "Create your own", "descp": "If you would like a custom selection of World Packs, addons and Vadoran Gardens then this tier is for you!\nUse the \u201cFull Customisation\u201d menu on the campaign page to choose your items, add up the total and pledge here.\nShipping will be added after the campaign based on the shipping prices shown at the bottom of the page.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["227 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a317 or more", "title": "Vadoran Gardens", "descp": "One copy of Vadoran Gardens.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of Vadoran Gardens", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["168 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a350 or more", "title": "World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a367.50\nAll the new content for The City of Kings, for those who already own the game!\nINCLUDES:\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\nSecond print upgrade pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,374 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a359 or more", "title": "The City of Kings", "descp": "MSRP: \u00a375\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter.\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["182 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a395 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3155\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter and all Deluxe upgrades!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["175 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3109 or more", "title": "The City of Kings & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3142.50\nOne copy of the base game including all stretch goals from the first Kickstarter and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["105 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u00a3145 or more", "title": "The City of Kings Deluxe & World Packs", "descp": "Total value: \u00a3222.50\nOne copy of the base game including all unlocked stretch goals from the original Kickstarter, all Deluxe upgrades and all The City of Kings new content!\nINCLUDES:\n1 copy of The City of Kings\nAll stretch goals from the first campaign\nCharacter Pack 1: Yanna & Kuma\nCharacter Pack 2: Rapuil & Neoba\nHero Pack\nSide Quest Pack 1\n4 'anti knock' character sheet trays\n2 quick setup storage trays\nDexterity micro expansion (120 wooden resources + 9 quests)\nKickstarter armour set\nKickstarter faction pack", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jan 2019"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,301 backers"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #33", "update_userinfo": "Chapter 2 complete", "update_content": "Hi everyone,\nIt is time for us to wrap up the campaign, by now everyone should have received their games and I want to thank you all for the incredible journey that has been Ancient Allies and Vadoran Gardens.

All other players are the crew of the doomed mining starship Valley Forge. Lifeform can also be played alone with the solo expansion Dragon's Domain where the player fights to survive against the game itself. \nRacing against the self-destruct timer, the crew must search their labyrinthine ship for weapons and supplies to load onboard the escape shuttle, whilst the alien lifeform ruthlessly tears the crew apart one by one...\nNo marines. No power armour. Just terror...\nIt kills to live...\nLifeform is a standalone, diceless game that tells the tale of twelve commercial astronauts working on a battered mining starship, far away in space and time, who encounter an awesome galactic horror.\nWith an innovative self-destruct timer, unique hidden movement rules, and alternate playable endings, Lifeform delivers a tense, suspenseful adventure every game.\nIt lives to kill...\nIn the vast, forbidden seas of space\u2026 terror stirs.\nA Right Royal Playthrough!!\nWe are extremely pleased and honoured to welcome boardgaming royalty on board.

Because Alien is in a three-way tie for 2nd favorite movie, because asymmetrical hidden movement is totally my jam, and because Mark designed the only true board game adaptation of one of the other movies in that three-way tie.

Thanks to the thousands of generous backers who successfully funded Gloom of Kilforth originally, as well as its reprint and expansions, along with our second game 1066, Tears to Many Mothers, we have learnt a huge amount about the development process, design and file submission for the printers, and we will be working again in close partnership with our factories and fulfilment agencies to ensure the smoothest delivery of your games.\n\nProduction of the cards and game boxes will take a couple of months. \nThis will only be possible once all the art for the game has been turned in, but we have ALL of the art for this project completed ahead of time! This means we only have to finalise the graphic design and manufacturing files which should only take a couple of months.

For the last few years, I've decided to set myself a new challenge each Summer, and last years challenge, after realising my passion for Harry Potter and Monopoly could be combined, I found myself attempting to create a Harry Potter inspired board game similar to Monopoly. I realised as I was approaching the end of Summer that this was no longer a Summer project. This was much longer, as I wanted to strive for quality when it came down to the manufacturing of the board game, I wanted to be sure it looked and felt like a genuine board game that you may find on the market. With that in mind, I began to redraw all of my initial designs in far superior quality.\nNow, I'm not going to lie, at the start of the project, I was expecting it to be way easier than what it has been, myself currently being a university student, meant I was putting some of my student loan and some money from part time work over the holidays into this ambition. Initially, I thought I'd just make one copy for myself, but since then, other people have been showing interest from around the world, and I found myself with the real potential to make this big.\nI am now looking to raise sufficient funds that will enable me to bulk buy the products needed to assemble the board game.Board game items:\nBoard\nProperty Cards\nSpells Cards\nPotions Cards\nMoney\nHouses\nHotels\nCounters\nBox\nInstructions", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are obviously going to be some risks associated with this project, firstly will be obtaining the rights and analysing what rights are needed in order to use the Harry Potter inspired places and the Monopoly inspired layout.

Most players will step into the shoes of LAPD Homicide detectives that will do whatever it takes to solve the case, but one player will take on the role of The Chisel whose goal is to stall and misdirect the detectives at every turn. \nInspired by classic film noir like The Big Sleep, the works of James Ellroy (L.A. Confidential), and the video game L.A. Noire from Rockstar Games, Detective: City of Angels is a mystery and crime solving game unlike any other. \n    4 unique sculpts are included in the game. Prototype sculpts shown here.\n  Detective: City of Angels is a VRG Select title. This means that it will not be sold through normal retail channels. It will be available at the best price to backers of this Kickstarter campaign, for preorder/late pledge at a higher price through our pledge manager, and eventually through our website, at conventions, and/or through other direct partners. For more information see Update #9 here.\n          Each case is beautifully illustrated by renowned artist Vincent Dutrait, creating a rich and gritty noire atmosphere.\n  Detectives will explore every shadowy corner of the City of Angels, rendered in gorgeous and authentic detail on a massive 33x21 inch game board. The game board is based on an amazing public domain map created in 1932 by K. M. Leuschner, which Vincent has lovingly updated and adorned with his own touches.\n     Click here to download the rulebook for Detective: City of Angels. This is the rulebook that was sent to reviewers and uses prototype components and art. It is NOT the final version! \nWith 9 cases included and the option to play competitively, cooperatively (see below), or even solo (see below), Detective: City of Angels will provide hours of mystery-solving gaming.\nPlus, go all in for the Hardboiled Pledge level and get Bullets Over Hollywood, the first expansion which includes four additional cases, putting even more noir goodness on your table!\n      While we highly recommend the game be played competitively, the versatility of Detective: City of Angels is such that it can also be played cooperatively against \"The Chisel\" or Cooperatively/Solitaire with no Chisel player. \nPlaying cooperatively against the Chisel removes the \"corruption\" elements and the detectives become a team working together to solve the case. There is still competition with the Chisel though. \nAlternatively, this KS will come with a 64-page Solo/Cooperative case book and case grid cards that allows the game to be played without a Chisel player as the book will simulate the play of the Chisel. In particular, playing the game solo is a great way to prepare for your first game as The Chisel! \nDesign of solitaire case cards and solitaire paragraph book is not final.\nIn each of these modes of play the ARC system is in the spotlight and the competitive elements of the game, like scratch and bribe actions, are removed. The focus is primarily on solving the case and immersing yourself in the role of a detective.\nAn important question with scenario-based mystery solving games such as Detective: City of Angels is: how replayable is the game? \nWhile detective players will not be able to experience a given case again as a detective (since they'll already know the solution), anyone can play the same case multiple times as The Chisel. In fact, it even benefits The Chisel to have played a case more than once! The Chisel will understand how the mystery works and have a better grasp of how to mislead and delay the detectives during their investigation. \nIn fact, a case can unfold VERY differently depending on how the detectives pursue their investigations, always forcing The Chisel to stay on his or her toes even if it's a case he or she's already played.\nDetective player boards\n  Rahdo Runs Through\nThe below video has Richard \"Rahdo\" Ham's final thoughts on the game.

We endeavor to ship as inexpensively as possible while still being able to cover costs and get the games safely to you!\n  From Vincent Dutrait, the amazingly talented artist behind Detective: City of Angels: \n\"Detective is an epic journey! Because of the huge narrative aspect of the game, it's a real challenge to bring to life all the iconic characters and well-know places. I've never worked on a game with a \"film noir\" atmosphere before, and I did a lot a research to find precise documents and great references, all in support of helping the players immerse themselves deeply in the game and the city of Los Angeles in the 1940s. Another tricky challenge was to get the right tone and to capture the right mood! Working with Evan and the Van Ryder team has been incredibly rewarding as we worked so hard to share and convey our points of view with the players. We wanted to give them the chance to live out the stories and everyday life of Detectives & Mob characters.\"\n\"Technically, I really enjoy to working on 'fake' illustrations, imitating textures, objects, colors and lights of past periods, which is a unique opportunity. I also enjoy bringing the characters to life, giving them authenticity, truth and credibility! Furthermore, Detective is a fascinating project because of all the different component sizes and elements: I have to develop precise and accurate solutions for building the box, cards, boards and tokens in order to get the most cohesive ensemble!\"\nMiniatures\nWe would like to thank James Van Schaik for his incredible sculpting work on the miniature in Detective. Thanks to him, each player will have his or her own miniature to move around the City of Angels!\nJames has worked on many top grossing kickstarters including Gloomhaven, Defense Grid, Myth, Mercs, Relic Knights, Dreadball, and many more. As a sculptor, he has worked with Ral Partha, WizKids, Wyrd Miniatures, Games Workshop, Mantic, Megacon Games, Ninja Division, Soda Pop Miniatures, Pulp City, Battlefront, Gale Force 9, Dust Tactics, Reaper, Gloomhaven, and Lynnvander.\nSee the many projects he has developed here on Artstation.

They focus on different aspects such as combat or worker management and provide endless ways to play, and you can even create your own!\nLet\u2019s go\nOnce you have chosen a story or scenario, each player will need to choose a hero to play. Each hero can be customised by levelling up, allowing you to create your own role.\nPerhaps you want to be a long-range attacker or a fast moving, short range healer. If you\u2019d prefer to focus on absorbing damage (tanking) or managing workers, then you can do that too! There are 90 customisable stat points and 12 skills per hero, so you never have to play the same way twice.\nThe City of Kings is played in rounds, during each round you will check if you have completed your objective, update the time tracker and then each player will perform their turn.\nPlayers will move across the board turning over tiles, discovering resources, side quests, hazards, building sites, traders, creatures and more.\nEach player will control multiple characters, their hero and their own workers, who can be used to gather resources, build structures, explore and place traps.\nWhen you encounter creatures they will be generated from a simple set of rules creating a challenging creature for you to defeat. There are over 10,000,000 possible creatures to fight and each will require you to come up with a strategy to defeat it.\nCreatures are persistent, staying on the board until they are defeated. There are no dice*, if your attack stat is 5, you will do 5 damage. You will need to work together, using your environment to absorb the creatures attacks, keep each other alive and to find a way to overcome the creatures' powerful abilities.\n* For players who like to roll dice, there is an optional character stat which you can level up, allowing you to roll dice to modify your attack and heal actions.\nThe Blood-Letter's chase Vyliria and Earthshaker around the board setting fire to the environment. Our heroes try to survive whilst their workers build up the Shrine, giving them the additional strength they need to defeat the creature.\nThe City of Kings offers endless puzzles requiring true cooperation, full character customisation, roleplaying quests, resource management and an immersive experience that we hope you will love.\nYou can download the rulebook here and the quick reference booklet here.\nThe City of Kings is a fully cooperative game with no hidden information and supports solo play through a single player controlling 2 heroes. As such, the game plays the same as it would for 2, 3 and 4 players and you will get the full experience.\nWe have spent the last 2 years building a world for The City of Kings, designing characters, writing stories and detailing events spanning 13,755 years. We wanted to go further than a theme and design a world which you can immerse yourself in for years to come.\nAs you play through the game you will experience the Cloud Keep War and learn about the key characters who came together for one last fight, as they tried to stop Vesh from claiming the entire world.\nYou will encounter survivors in need of assistance and they will offer you side quests further describing the world you are in.  \nThanks to unlocked stretch goals we can now add even more lore to the game by including back stories for each of the characters and all of the enemy factions.\nOver time we plan to release more stories, written materials, and much more as we continue to share this world with you.\nThe City of Kings was designed for both video and board gamers. The inspiration for the game comes from a life time of video gaming and many of the mechanics were inspired by MMORPGs. Combat is based around the holy trinity, character progression uses skill trees and creatures are procedurally generated.\n Retailers can find out more info about our retail options here.\nYou can read the full review by Who Dares Rolls here.\nYou can read the full review by Polyhedron Collider here.\n \"It is proper cracking.\" - Lucy\n\"I can't stress enough just how great it feels to play a game in which players become a close team through trying to beat the scenarios Frank has painstakingly worked on without enforcing co-operation... it's something else.\" - Jamie\n\"It reminds me of Mage Knight and Descent\" - Nick\n\"it\u2019s one of the funnest games I\u2019ve played. Especially as a video game player it feels like World of Warcraft as a board game. Heaps of praise for it overall. It\u2019s amazing how polished it is.\" - Ryan\nWe asked our playtesters what their favourite parts of The City of Kings were and put together a Top Ten Features list based on their feedback.\nYou can customise your pledge by clicking the 'manage pledge' option at the top right of the campaign page (it's green) and then manually edit your pledge amount, increasing it by the amount your customisations cost.\nAll customisations will be available after the campaign has ended but at higher costs and will incur extra shipping. You can save up to 50% on customisations by getting them during the campaign.\nIf you would like to help spread the word during our campaign then feel free to download and use our avatars anywhere you like. \nWe have also put together a fan and media kit containing some high resolution photos and artwork which you are welcome to use on your website, social media or anywhere else you choose.\n You can download the images here.\nWe have spent months planning our fulfilment process, arranging bulk shipping to warehouses around the world including the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. All with the goal of offering you the cheapest and most efficient shipping possible. But please keep in mind, this is a big game with over 1,000 components and is estimated to weigh between 5 and 6 kg (11 - 13lbs) so it is not cheap to ship, yet we are confident the level of replayability in the box will give you endless hours of gaming and offers great value for money.\nBackers may add multiple copies of the game to their pledge but must include the additional shipping fee for each additional copy, as listed above.\nFrank West is the designer of The City of Kings, he is also the worldbuilder, art director and graphic designer.\nMiguel Mitchell Da Silva is the amazing artist who spent the last 18 months creating all of the beautiful pieces of art you will see whilst adventuring in The City of Kings.\nSara Jorge is responsible for making Frank\u2019s dream became a reality by helping with prototypes, playtesting, design concepts and by believing in him every single day.\nIan O'Reilly is our primary writer assisting Frank with writing the stories and quests you\u2019ll find on our website and in the game.\nAlec Jackson created our visual identity and brand, helping to guide our graphic design.\nWally is our account manager at Whatz Games who are manufacturing the game.\nMatthew Walker created the sound track for our Kickstarter project video.\nRosko Lewis provided the voice for our Kickstarter project video.\nWe would love to hear from you and talk about The City of Kings or just gaming in general! \nHere's where you can find us:\nTwitter | Facebook | YouTube | Instagram | Board Game Geek\nOur official website: www.thecityofkings.com\nThe long journey\nFrank first started posting about designing The City of Kings on Board Game Geek back in 2015, you can read the work in progress posts here.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is a large, ambitious project, but I am on Kickstarter today because I believe The City of Kings is ready and that I can live up to all the promises I am making on this page to deliver a great game.\n\nWhilst this is my first Kickstarter, I have backed over 150 other projects, spent months studying and preparing for manufacturing, shipping and fulfilment and have worked on many high pressure projects in the last 10 years.\n\nDesign\n\nThe game has been designed and tested by countless people spending hundreds of hours testing the game. There are still a few scenarios to finish off and the stories may be enhanced if we hit our stretch goals but I have allowed time for this in our plan and have no doubts the game will be finished on time.\n\nArtwork\n\nAll of the artwork is done for the core game, we have a few icons and bits of graphic design to finish off prior to print but otherwise we are good to go. We have allowed time in our plan for any artwork needed for stretch goals to be produced without impacting the delivery dates.\n\nManufacturing\n\nWe have been working with manufacturers and getting quotes for nearly a year, we are confident we can deliver a high quality game for the prices stated and will be looking at blank samples and pre-production prints before starting mass production.\n\nOur prototype has had much praise for the quality of the components and we are convinced we will get an even better response with our end product.\n\nShipping\n\nWe have arranged shipping, importing and fulfilment around the world working with multiple companies who have been tried and tested by countless Kickstarters. There are always unknowns but I am confident we are as prepared as any Kickstarter can be.\n\nFinal words\n\nBeing this is my first campaign, I want to assure you I have picked over every detail, from rigorous playtesting of the game to having a full understanding of shipping logistics. Everything that can be done to make this successful and deliver on time has been done.\n\nThis is my passion, and I hope, the first steps to my future.

The game will be widely available in retail this August/September, so you can pick it up there!\nIt's time to join the adventure! Whether you are a veteran mercenary or this is your first foray into the wilds of Gloomhaven, I am happy to have you on board.\nThrough this Kickstarter, you can pledge to receive a copy of the second printing of Gloomhaven, complete with new health and experience trackers and a revised rule book and scenario book. Your game will come with miniatures for all the character classes, but you can also purchase extra sets of miniatures and standees.\nIf you already own the game, you can pledge to receive just the upgraded trackers and revised books. In addition, there is also an all-new mini expansion of 17 solo scenarios available.\n If you want to learn how to play Gloomhaven, these two Gaming Rules! videos are all you need.\nGloomhaven is a series of tactical combat scenarios that are strung together in a persistent, thematic campaign.\nEach scenario is played out through rounds of combat against fully automated enemies. In each round, players will play 2 cards to determine the order in which they act and what abilities they perform. Each card has 2 special actions, and on their turn, players can perform the top action of one card and the bottom action of the other.\nCard actions are varied and powerful, cutting through the monotony of a basic \"move and attack\" system. Default actions are available, though, if a player's plans get ruined by an enemy's ability card or even by the actions of their own teammates. Gloomhaven eliminates the alpha player through simultaneous hidden action selection to illustrate the chaos of battle.\nPhoto courtesy of Jinha Yoon\nThere are also no dice in Gloomhaven. Instead, attacks are modified by a player's attack deck. Over time, this attack deck will change as a player begins to add and remove cards by completing battle goals and leveling up, which will also give them access to more powerful, higher level ability cards.\nIn midst of battle, players will also need to focus on looting money tokens. These can be used to purchase useful items in town, where new stock is always being unlocked by player actions.\nAs players interact with the town through events and move along the branching story paths of the world, they will always be working towards completing personal quests. By meeting certain objectives, a player's character will retire, unlocking a new character class to play with, new events for parties to encounter, and additional perks for the achieving player. After retirement, a player will create a new character, possibly from the class that was just unlocked, and continue the adventure!\nIf you'd like to learn more about the game play, you can find a PDF of the rule book here, or you can watch another overview video:\nOr a game play video:\nAre you ready to start the adventure? Becausewe have started a community-driven expedition that I would love you to participate in.\nJust head on over to the first update to find out what it is all about and join in on the adventure. You won't regret it!\nIf you don't have the physical game in front of you, that's not a problem. There are still plenty of ways to participate. If you own Tabletop Simulator on Steam, each scenario in the community-driven campaign is available as a separate workshop file. (Scenario 1) (Scenario 2) (Scenario 3) (Scenario 4) (Scenario 5) (Scenario 6) (Scenario 7) (Scenario 8) (Scenario 9)\nOr you can follow along and watch as the following groups play through the scenarios every third day.\nMike Bennett's YouTube stream is scheduled for 3pm EDT (19:00 GMT).\nAlucard's Twitch stream is scheduled for 7pm EDT (23:00 GMT).\nIf you're just joining us and want to get caught up on the story, you can find everything you need to know here.\nEither way, the important thing is that, when you are ready, I want you to vote on what happens next. This campaign is being run by and for you, and I'm just excited to see where it goes!\nBut the extra adventures don't end when the Kickstarter ends! Starting in November of this year, after everyone has had time to receive their games and enjoy them for a while, we will starting a brand new community driven expedition.\nThe number of scenarios in the new expedition will be directly tied to this Kickstarter's funding goal. Every $100,000 past $2 million will add a new scenario to the expedition. It's going to be huge!\n\n\nNew to Kickstarter? No problem! The number people pledging to Kickstarter board game projects seems to be getting larger all the time, and we are happy to have you on board. Becoming a backer is very simple. Just follow these steps: \\\nStep 1: Look through the banner at the top right of this page and click on the reward level you'd like to receive.\nStep 2: Choose the correct shipping location and the pledge amount should automatically adjust to the correct value. This step is important!\nStep 3: Click the green \"Continue\" button and then finish filling out your information on the subsequent page.\nStep 4: Click \"Pledge\" and you're done! Welcome to the adventure!\nImmediately after I was finished working on Gloomhaven, I realized I wasn't done with the world. I wanted to make a set of scenarios specifically designed for strategic solo play - scenarios that would highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each class and force players to really get under the hood and learn to play each class masterfully.\nPDFs of these scenarios and the accompanying item rewards are already available online, but now you can pledge $10 to receive a printed version. This includes a 24-page scenario book of 17 all-new solo scenarios and a deck of 17 item cards - rewards for completing each of the missions.\nThe solo scenarios are not included in the base box, but you can add $10 to you pledge to receive them in addition.\nStrictly for those who already own the game, we are offering four health and experience trackers and revised rule and scenario books. These are already included in the reprint pledge, but are upgrades from the original version.\nYou can get the four dials for $7, the upgraded books for $15, and if you'd like the solo scenarios as well, you can bundle all three offers for $25.\nPDFs of the new rule book and scenario book are also available online.\nAnd if you are interested, you can order some cool third-party stuff like removable stickers from Sinister Fish Games and a nice wooden insert from Meeple Realty.\nThe second printing of Gloomhaven comes with a full set of miniatures for each of the 17 character classes. These add-ons are not needed, but if, for whatever reason, you want additional sets of miniatures or standees, you can add $20 to your pledge for additional sets of minis and $5 for additional sets of standees.\nBe forewarned that while the miniatures box comes spoiler-free, the standees will be delivered as a single bare punch-board and may ruin the surprise of some of the unlocked character images.\nGloomhaven is a big, heavy game, so you will need to pay shipping on every copy that you order. The good news is that the cost of shipping to the US is already included and subsidized elsewhere. The price for shipping in other regions per game box is listed in the first column.\nThe second column is the price of shipping when ordering up to six other items (this includes sets of HP/XP dials, the book upgrades, the solo scenarios, sets of miniatures, or sets of standees). The upgrade combo pack is considered three items. If you pledge for more than six items, you will need to pay the second column shipping price again.\nThere's more good news, though. If you order a copy of Gloomhaven and want to add to your pledge the solo scenarios and/or a set of standees, those items are small enough to fit into the game's shipping box, so you won't have to pay any additional shipping on them - just the one shipping price for the main box itself.\nAll of these shipping costs are added automatically when you pledge, but if you add more onto you pledge for additional items, you will have to add the additional shipping costs yourself.\nUnfortunately, I made some mistakes when setting up the initial pledge levels. If you live in the following countries, please use the alternate pledge levels (labeled DE and SG) to get the correct shipping price: Germany, Singapore, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Sorry for the confusion!\nPlease note! Shipping is US, Canada, China, and EU-friendly! You will not have to pay customs if you are in these regions.\nWhile pledging $1 won't get your name into every copy of Gloomhaven, it will get you into my personal copy of Gloomhaven.\nThat's right, I am going to take a sharpie to as many of my components as necessary to commemorate the names of everyone who pledges $1 or adds $1 to their pledge. Not only that, but I'll shoot a video of the whole sordid, game-defacing thing. It will be wonderful.\nIsaac is the driving force behind Cephalofair Games, which published its first game, Forge War, three years ago, and its second game, Gloomhaven, was released to much acclaim in February.

They wrote 100% of this expansion, and the cards they came up with are hilarious and unexpected in all the ways Monikers cards should be hilarious and unexpected. It's sort of uncanny.\nPart of the idea behind Monikers has always been to take a game that has existed basically forever, and to make it feel like you and your friends just came up with the idea that night. It's really hard to get that tone right, but Paul and Philippa and Matt and Quinns completely nailed it. I mean AHHHHHH LOOK AT THESE CARDS THEY'RE SO GOOD\nAnd if you've never heard of Monikers, the rules are really simple: get your friends to guess the name on a card. The twist is that you play over three rounds, and each time, you have to give clues in different ways. So in the 1st round, you can say or do anything. In the 2nd, you can only use one word. And in the 3rd, you can only do charades.\nThe same cards are used in each round, so by the end of the game you've made up a bunch of silly jokes together.\n         The Shut Up & Sit Down Nonsense Box comes with 112 hilarious new cards. It's only $10. Which is legitimately a steal and probably dumb of us to keep doing. And like always, you can combine it with all your other Monikers sets, or just play it as a standalone party game.\nYou'll be cry-laughing they're so good.\nAnd like usual, we're working with some amazingly talented artists to illustrate some of the cards. Artists like:\nGemma Correll\nMarina Esmeraldo\nThomas Howes\nLaurina Paperina\nOh and ALSO as a thank you, for every pledge we're including a bonus pack of 12 Hopelessly Stupid Fourth Rounds For Monikers for free. Stuff like getting behind a couch and doing hand puppets. Or doing charades in pairs, but one person has to pose the other person. They're hilarious and weird and perfect for when you're having such a good time that you want a game to go on for just a little bit longer.\n  Basically, you can get any configuration of Monikers stuff you want. That *should* cover everything\u2014but if you're looking for multiple copies or whatever, just shoot us a message and we'll sort that out for you!\nAnd for international backers: shipping includes customs.\n\nOh and if you've gotten this far, there is a 90% chance you are wondering about a MONIKERS STORAGE BOX. We're planning a Kickstarter for that early this summer! It's going to be filled with some really weird stuff and, we assure you, quite capable of holding every Monikers card ever made. \nWe promise we're making it.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've shipped tens of thousands of copies of Monikers to backers all over the world.

We all have a masters degree in engineering and therefore, are very meticulous when it comes to arranging little details that make manufacturing, fulfillment and shipping possible, affordable and sensible.\n\nWe have done the following to mitigate risks and make your support a 'safe bet', that you will surely receive your reward:\n- Three people can specialize and concentrate on separate fields: Gergely Kruppa does design and art direction, Andr\u00e1s Drozdy handles testing and manufacturing, while Gergely Gombos arranges business, shipping and marketing details.\n- We own a BV (LLC) in the Netherlands so that we can conduct business easily. This helps us with tax and customs issues as well. For example to make sure you are not charged additional VAT when receiving your reward.\n- We have a very detailed budget with multiple scenarios, so the project's funding goal is sensible and it is definitely possible to accomplish the project from this amount of funding.\n- We have already chosen a manufacturing partner from many great offers, and have already arranged most manufacturing details, including stretch goals.\n\nOur previous game, Saltlands has already been fulfilled for several backers, and the rest of the copies are already on their way to them.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Antler Games\n5 created \u00b7 15 backed\nAntler Games is an indie board game publisher from Hungary.

As the Kami descend from the heavens to reshape the land in their image, it is up to each player to lead their clan to victory. Use politics to further your cause, negotiate to seek the most profitable alliances, worship the Kami to gain their favor, recruit monsters out of legend to bolster your forces, and use your resources wisely to be victorious in battle. \nHere's a look at everything included in a base pledge:\nAnd all the Optional Buys you can get:\nClick to learn more about Dynasty Invasion, Playmat Board, Art Book, and Metal Coins.\nCreated by acclaimed designer Eric M. Lang, Rising Sun reunites the same creative forces responsible for the smash hit Blood Rage, with stunning artwork by Adrian Smith and intricate miniatures sculpted under the direction of Mike McVey.\nChoose your clan: Koi, Dragonfly, Bonsai, Lotus or Turtle.\nEach of the five clans in Rising Sun brings not only their own individual set of ten beautifully detailed miniatures for their Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi units, but also a unique ability that sets them apart from the others and affects all players' strategies.\nKoi (Flow, Like Water) - Ever adaptable, the Koi clan is able to use hired Ronin as coins and vice versa, giving them great flexibility and making their decisions very unpredictable.\nKoi Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nDragonfly (Wings, Wind and Spirit) - Flying on gossamer wings, the Dragonfly clan is able to move anywhere on the map without restriction. You never know where they'll strike next.\nDragonfly Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nBonsai (Humility, Earth and Root) - Ever growing and evergreen, the Bonsai clan needs to spend no coins when buying resources. Strongholds sprout from the ground and Upgrades to the clan blossom naturally.\nBonsai Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nLotus (Patience is key) - The Lotus clan dictates the flow of politics by turning the Political Mandates they play into anything they wish. A powerful ally to have at your side, and a terrible foe to betray.\nLotus Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nTurtle (Hard as the mind; delicate as steel) - The Turtle clan builds their Strongholds on top of the shells of giant legendary turtles. These indestructible fortresses can move around the map and even join in the fights for the provinces.\nTurtle Daimyo, Shinto and Bushi.\nPlayed over the course of a year, each Season in Rising Sun is divided into a Political phase, where players prepare their clans and set their plans in motion, and a War Phase, where dominance over each of the contested provinces is decided.\nThe Political Mandates.\nDuring the Political phase, players choose among a restricted selection for a Political Mandate to play. These determine the actions all players may perform. They can Recruit new units on their Strongholds, Marshal their forces across the map, Train to upgrade their clan with Season cards, Harvest to reap the rewards of the provinces they dominate, or even Betray their ally to bring opposing forces to their side.\nWhen players perform a Train Political Mandate, they are able to spend their coins to upgrade their clans with Season cards that bring all manner of new abilities. From Virtues that give you bonuses according to your actions, to Enhancements that improve your clan, to powerful Monsters that may join your clan, bringing with them amazing strength or other more devious benefits.\nKomainu, Yurei and Oni of Spite.\nOni of Skulls and Oni of Souls.\nOni of Hate and Oni of Blood.\nRiver Dragon (all monsters are to scale with this human figure).\nThe miniatures shown are resins. All miniatures in Rising Sun will be pre-assembled plastic.\nAlliances are formed. Alliances are broken.\nAt the start of each Season, players engage in a tea ceremony to negotiate new Alliances. Having the right ally and playing for mutual benefit (for a time) is often key to victory. Allies don't kill each other during war, and they also grant each other a unique bonus whenever they play a Political Mandate. Recruit extra units, build Strongholds when you Marshal, save coins when you Train, and reap a bountiful Harvest. However, the enticing Betrayal option always casts a shadow of doubt over Alliances.\nDo not be too quick to Betray your ally, though, for such an action brings dishonor to your clan. Honor is a tangible force in Rising Sun. Clans are always competing on a ladder for who is more or less honorable than the other. Having more Honor than your opponent gives you the upper hand on any ties in the game, from a dispute when worshipping a Kami, to deadly war on the provinces. But occasionally being dishonorable might also be a valid strategy, for upgrades such as the nightmarish Oni often favor those at the bottom of the Honor scale.\nThe Kami await the worshippers.\nWhen players Recruit their forces, they may choose to send their Shinto warriors to climb the mountains and go worship the mighty Kami. Three times per Season, each of these gods will grant their blessing upon the clan who worships them the most. The competition for the grace of the Kami can become fierce and change the course of the game. Each Kami grants a different benefit, from increased Honor, to extra Bushi, Ronin or coins. Only four of the seven Kami are used in each game, creating different dynamics each time you play.\nEach Season ends with the War phase. In each of the contested provinces, the warring players secretly bid their coins on the different War Advantages. Only the winner in each of the different options is allowed to execute them, allowing for dramatic shifts in the outcome of each battle, or cunning players coming out ahead even in defeat. Bluff your way through impossible odds and trick your opponents into needlessly wasting their coins. Sometimes losing a battle may win you the war.\nWhen Winter comes, all politics and fighting are over. Players gain extra points for winning battles in as many different provinces as possible, and also for certain upgrades they may have gathered. As the snow falls, the new Emperor will ascend! \nGame Components:\n58 Highly Detailed Miniatures, including 10 warriors for each clan and 8 huge monsters.\n40 Counter Bases\n137 Tokens\n5 Clan Screens\n5 Political Sheets\n53 Cards\n6-fold Gameboard\n1 Rulebook\nYou can take a look at the Work In Progress Rulebook HERE.\nFor $100 the Daimyo Pledge gets you a Rising Sun core game as well as the Kickstarter Exclusive Phoenix monster, and any stretch goals we manage to unlock!\nThe Phoenix comes with its amazing miniature and Season card. \nThe Phoenix has otherworldly powers of resurrection. Whenever it is killed, it automatically reappears in the same province and raises the honor of its clan.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an Exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available at conventions and special promotions only. \nThe honorable CMON crew gathered to play a session of Rising Sun.

We'll sort out what your extra money is going towards after the campaign has closed and we've sent out our Pledge Manager.\nPlease Take Note!\nBased on past experience, we will be charging shipping after the Kickstarter concludes based on the actual costs incurred to ship. We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the UK (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico.\nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities.\nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries.\nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia).\nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand.\nAFRICA: $80 to most countries.\nEUROPE: $15-$30 to most countries.\n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia.\n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia.\n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania.\n  $60 to Iceland and Israel.\n  $70 to Greece and Turkey.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs from some specific countries have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to them.\n*WE DO NOT SHIP TO:* Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release. Thank you for your understanding.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.\nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 26th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as: \nProduction delays \nShipping delays \nCustoms delays\n\nThe estimated delivery date is April 2018, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all. Since the game is 90% complete, we don't believe this is in the least bit likely. We've successfully delivered Zombicide, Sedition Wars, Guilds of Cadwallon, Zombicide Season 2, Relic Knights, Rivet Wars, Kaosball, Dogs of War, Arcadia Quest, Wrath of Kings, XenoShyft, our Base System, Zombicide Season 3, The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service, Rum & Bones, Blood Rage, B-Sieged, Zombicide: Black Plague, The Others, XenoShyft: Dreadmire and Masmorra: Dungeons of Arcadia. We have almost completed the delivery of Arcadia Quest: Inferno, and are halfway through with delivering Rum & Bones: Second Tide.\n\nWe have two ongoing projects currently: Massive Darkness, which is in production, and The World of Smog: Rise of Moloch, which is being prepared for production.\n\nPlease refer to our individual project pages if you'd like to check the progress there. Each project is entirely independent from each other, has completely different development teams, and has no effect on the production flow or development of Rising Sun.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via Paypal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

You and up to five friends are cave explorers who have become trapped deep underground. You must quickly explore a tile-based cave system, utilise your character's specialist skills and carefully manage your actions to find the way out before your flashlights die and you're lost in the darkness forever.  \nYou'll need to work together to overcome deadly subterranean hazards - stick together for safety, or split up to cover more ground. One wrong step could knock you unconscious and your friends will need to stage a rescue. Light and hope are scarce. And worst of all, you don't think you're alone down here...\n Looking for the Stretch Goal announcements?\n  Let's descend...\n        Check out the how to play video below (courtesy of Toucan Play that Game), which outlines the game setting, objectives, gameplay and some strategies for attempting your escape!\nSub Terra is a team-based push-your-luck game. Together, you'll decide what risks are worth taking and when. The caves is a dangerous place - no matter how well you plan, things WILL go wrong, and your survival depends on how well you react to unforeseen circumstances.\n\nYOUR OBJECTIVE: Escape the cave before you run out of time.\n1) CAVERS: Everyone picks a caver, and gives that caver 3 health points. There are eight characters to choose from in Sub Terra - each has unique abilities that change how they play\n2) TILES: Cavers begin the game on the START TILE. You're all trying to get to the EXIT TILE, which is near the bottom of the TILE STACK.\n3) ACTIONS: Every round, each caver has two action points to spend (and can risk a health point for a third) \nThe basic actions are: \nReveal (Flip the top tile of the stack and place it a gap next to your current location) \nMove (Move to an adjacent connected tile) \nExplore (Reveal a tile, then immediately Move onto it. Faster, but riskier!) \nHeal (You or another caver on your tile regains one health point)\nRun (Move three times) \nTogether, you must place tiles as quickly as possible while not getting too spread out. Why not run off by yourself? Well\u2026\n4) HAZARDS: At the end of each round, resolve the top card of the HAZARD DECK. Each affects a certain type of tile: cavers on those tiles will lose health, and the tile may become harder to traverse. For example, GAS hurts cavers on GAS TILES a medium amount, whereas a FLOOD hurts those on WATER TILES only a little but makes the tile twice as costly to enter in the future.\n If you lose all your health points, you fall UNCONSCIOUS - you're unable to take further actions until another caver reaches your tile and HEALS you. If a friend is nearby, this won't take long. If you've strayed too far down a side passage, it might take some time to reach you. Why does that matter? Well\u2026\n5) RUNNING OUT OF TIME: When the hazard deck runs out of cards, your flashlights are nearly out of power: instead of resolving a card, each caver has a chance of getting lost in the darkness forever. Turns are precious - time spent rescuing fallen cavers or backtracking through difficult passages is time you'd rather spend uncovering more tiles and getting closer to the exit.\n6) HORRORS: You're not alone down here. Some hazard cards can spawn...things...which will relentlessly hunt you down. If they catch you, you'll immediately lose all health points and fall unconscious. If you try to fight them, you will die. RUN.\n7) MORE STUFF: Sub Terra also contains: cave-ins, squeezes, ledges, slides, ropes, rough treacherous terrain, tremors, dynamite, cave diving, \"geology\" and soul-crushing despair \n(soul-crushing despair supplied separately)\nEager to play Sub Terra?

The team is poised!\n\nMANUFACTURE:\nWe're partnering with Whatz games from Shanghai, the team behind Iello's manufacturing, they're fast, reliable and produce high quality games. We're confident they'll produce a box that helps us deliver the Sub Terra experience. I will personally review the blank samples, the pre-production samples, and if the budget permits, visit the factory itself to inspect the production run.\n\nFREIGHT & SHIPPING:\nWe're working with a specially honed team of fulfillment and shipping experts, in Hong Kong, Shanghai, the UK and elsewhere to ensure that we can offer leading backer shipping rates as well as deliver you your games speedily and in good condition. We're aiming to get a chunk of games once manufactured to the UK Games Expo in June, so we're aiming to get shipping on the go before then. November is our worst case scenario. We may obviously sell copies of the game at the UKGE before some backers get their copy elsewhere in the world. We're hoping that this doesn't happen but we want to be upfront, we can't afford as a small publisher to not take that opportunity.\n\nHORRORS:\nThere's a small chance the darkness will close in on the ITB team and the horrors will catch up to us. If this happens, we may not be able to ship your game, as we'll probably have been eaten.

Think of it as Two Rooms and a Boom on HARD MODE!\nWe wanted to make our first expansion special so we focused on four things that we thought would make the game incredibly fun for old fans and new fans alike:\nCharacter cards inspired by the master of horror, H.P. Lovecraft (we're talking the Cthulhu Mythos, here).\nEnhanced tension and play for seasoned Boomers (peeps that enjoy playing Two Rooms).\nIntroduces and encourages color sharing when playing with fewer than 11 players.\nSpecifically designed to make Two Rooms just as fun with few players. Only have 6 players? NO PROBLEM!\nNote: Necroboomicon requires Two Rooms and a Boom. This is NOT a standalone expansion.\nThe concept is super simple\u2014add Necroboomicon to your base game of Two Rooms and a Boom to create an evening of a Lovecraftian Horror Mystery. Suspicion and tension abounds. \n\"Just nine cards?\" you say? Yes. The most terrifying nine plastic character cards ever. If you're familiar with Two Rooms and a Boom, you're aware that just one character can change the entire game. Multiply that by nine, and your mortal mind will begin to comprehend the dire corruption these characters will inflict upon your feeble friends.\nThe player standing next to you, that player you think you can trust, could actually be an Elder God (like, say, Yog-Sothoth) with the power to end the game instantly. Everyone is free to share information with the players in the same room, but sharing too much just may complete the summoning ritual for YOUR DOOM!\nOver 8 cards filled with terror, madness, and nightmares. Also they are 100% plastic.\n  If you are unfamiliar with the base game of Two Rooms and a Boom, or you don't trust us when we tell you the game is fun, here are some words some reviewers' mouths said. Click the images for links to the full reviews and/or videos.\n                         $5 Gets you the foil pack expansion with 9 high quality plastic character cards. Just remember: this game requires a copy of Two Rooms and a Boom.\n$25 Gets you the expansion and a copy of the base game Two Rooms and a Boom. Now that's a deal! Why? Because Two Rooms normally costs $25. Now you're getting a copy AND we are throwing in the Necroboomicon expansion for FREE. Shipping rates still apply.\n  $50 Gets you the expansion and a signed copy of the base game Two Rooms and a Boom. Alan and Sean will write you a personal message on your game. This is limited to just 100 copies to celebrate Kickstarter's Make/100 thingy that they're doing. What will the personal message be? Who knows?!?\nWe don't have any! \"What the poop?!?\" Yeah, sorry about that. The truth is that stretch goals are a great way to entice people into sharing this project with others. But this expansion pack is DONE as is. We're talking about a foil pack with 9 beautiful plastic cards. Yeah, plastic... just like in the original game. That means these babies are damage resistant and waterproof. That means that you can play in the pool! This also means that if one room is the shallow end, and the other is the deep end, the deep end gets some exercise while playing. Pledge in the name of fitness! \nLegal Note: Tuesday Knight Games is not responsible for drowning or injuries received during play of our games.\nStill bummed about no stretch goals? Sorry, but we may have a mysterious trick up our sleeves. As a \"please share this project with your friends even though we don't have stretch goals\" apology, we are also including a mystery bonus! Yeah! I'm not just making this up. You'll get your expansion and say, \"Where is this mystery?\" Then after fiddling around with your expansion pack for awhile, you realize...\"WHOA! This is a most excellent mystery! This was way better than stretch goals.\"\nTuesday Knight Games will always do our best to keep you informed of the progress of your games. We will do this in several ways: \nOfficial updates here on Kickstarter. These updates will always be on a Tuesday and at least once a month. \n\"Mini\" updates on the comment section here on Kickstarter. Ask a question in the comment section, and Sean or I will do our best to answer it in a timely fashion. \nPrivate messages (PM) - Send me a message here through Kickstarter and I'll answer! \nTuesday Knight Podcast - We do a weekly podcast in which we provide updates, insights into running a small independent game company, and other games we've been playing. \nNewsday Night Newsletter - Free games and updates straight to your inbox? Yep. With every issue we send a free game along with a big Tuesday Knight Games announcement.\nFacebook - Have you heard of Facebook? We have.\nTwitter - If you think we talk too much, Twitter is perfect for you.\nBoard Game Geek - Play Two Rooms and a Boom online!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nTuesday Knight Games is a company run by two friends. Yeah, they get on one another's nerves due to trying to run a company, but they've learned a few things about publishing a game.\n\nDelays are always a big challenge. But Sean McCoy and I (Alan Gerding) have learned from our previous mistakes publishing Two Rooms and a Boom. This time, we already have the art and design finished. We even had \"pre-release\" copies made to send to reviewers. This means we can GUARANTEE that you will get your copies of #Necroboomicon on schedule (pending some unforeseen tragedy...like pirates, murder, or Elder God damnation). So the biggest challenge for us will always be proving that we've learned our lessons by ensuring that our backers get their high quality games on schedule.\n\nThere is a chance that not all players will enjoy Two Rooms and a Boom, or especially this expansion of Necroboomicon. People are like snowflakes, each totally different. This is one of the reasons that we put so many dang character cards in the base game. Character cards greatly change the way the game is played, making Two Rooms more of a game system than a game itself. So while there is no character that every snowflake will love, there is a character for every snowflake to love. Necroboomicon is for those hardcore snowflakes that don't mind losing in an instant.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Necroboomicon Foil Pack", "descp": "Get the first expansion (includes 9 plastic character cards, mini-rule book, and foil pack).", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["2,045 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more", "title": "Necroboomicon AND Two Rooms and a Boom", "descp": "Get the first expansion (includes 9 plastic character cards, mini-rule book, and foil pack) + a copy of the base game, Two Rooms and a Boom!", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["1,626 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 50 or more", "title": "Make/100 Signed Copies!", "descp": "Get the first expansion (includes 9 plastic character cards, mini-rule book, and foil pack) + a copy of the base game, Two Rooms and a Boom, SIGNED BY THE CREATORS with a \"personal message.\"", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "May 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["89 backers", "Limited (11 left of 100)"]}], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #16", "update_userinfo": "More Two Rooms coming soon -- and a new Mothership module on kickstarter!", "update_content": "More Two Rooms and a Boom?\nIf you've been at convention or two this year you might have seen Alan breaking out something pretty new for Two Rooms and a Boom.

I'm Jonathan W. Gilmour! Game designer type person!\nHow are you today? I've designed (or co-designed in some cases) a few games (Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, Vault Wars, Heroes and Tricks, Pocket Dungeon, Wasteland Express Delivery Service)! \nLet's make a limited edition board game!\nI am really inspired by the Make/100 idea! So I thought it would be cool to make 100 hand made games! What game is it going to be? I don't know yet! But you will get to help decide! I'll send out polls about theme, concepts, and things like that! Your feedback will help shape the game. You'll have access to the playtesting files, and the entire process. I'll still make decisions that I feel are best for the game, because my design priority is that I want the game to be fun! \nJust to be clear, no matter how good this game is, I will never sell it to a publisher, or in otherwise reproduce it. You're copies will be unique and I will make sure they stay that way! \nHow did you come up with the prices?\nI've been designing games for 5 years, so I know how much I will spend in materials throughout the process. I'm not a graphic designer, or artist, so I will have to pay other people to do those things. I also factored in valuing my time, and how much the final products are going to cost. I'm anticipating the game to be pretty good sized, with a myriad of tokens, dice, cards, boards, etc. If I end up designing a component light game, I will just design a second game to make it worth it for you!\nWhat are the different backer levels about?\nPrint and Play files: You'll get the files during playtesting (after I've run the game enough times I'm comfortable with it), as well as once the files are \"finalized\". So you can playtest it if you want, and give feedback, or just wait and make yourself a copy of the game once it's done.\nThank you card, and prototype components: I'll send you a card, thanking you for your support. I'll shove some prototype components in it, so you can have a neat little piece of the project. \nMake/100 Hand Made copies: These will be hand made by me. I'll cut, assemble, and do the whole caboodle. Components will be matte finished, so that it will hold up to multiple plays. The boards, etc will be made with foam core, the dice will be stickered, the cards will be printed on paper, and put into card sleeves, with old MTG cards as backing. I will do everything I can to make the game as nice as possible. Each copy will be signed and numbered as I make them. Here's a picture of a prototype that I worked on, it will be like this, but with better art and graphic design.\nMMMMMMM Foamcore.\nMake/100 Print on Demand copies: I will have 100 copies printed through a POD service. The main difference is that boards and cards will be made from Chipboard and Cardstock, rather than Foamcore and sleeved MTG cards. I'll ship them to me first, so that I Can sign and number them, before shipping them to you. I will be working closely with The Game Crafter to ensure these copies are as nice as possible! \nWhy aren't there any reviews?\nBecause this game doesn't exist yet. I've already started coming up with some ideas, and I'll fully start in on it once the project funds. \nStretch Goals?\nYes! Let's do some! I am going to structure these differently than other kickstarters, and will unlock them if the pledge levels get completely sold out. Upgrades will affect all versions of the game applicable! I'll add more here as I think of them! Feel free to suggest ideas! \nAll/100 Hand Made Copies - If all 100 slots get taken:\ni'll increase the money I have allocated for graphic design! Shiny! \nLet's upgrade this baby! I'll get a really nice box printed out to put the game into!\nAll/100 Print on Demand Copies - If all 100 slots get taken:\nI'll increase the art budget and spring for super swank art!\nHigh Quality - I'll upgrade the components as much as I can afford to! \nAdditional Stretch goals:\n$22,000 - I will purchase a 3D printer to Print components for the game with!  \n$26,000 - The 3d printer will be the liquid resin type, so that they 3d printed components are the highest quality I can manage.\nAdd-Ons!\nI've really racked my brain on trying to figure some out, so let me know how you feel about them! \nContent Creation Kit - $10 - I'll send you all of the templates needed to create your own content for the game. I'll also help you make sure that your components match what I produced, regardless of version. \nUpgraded components - $25 - This one was very tough for me to decide on, since I don't know what the components will be. I priced it lower than what I thought it would cost. What are upgraded components? I will 3d print anything that I can afford to for your copy of the game. Any place I can spend an extra dollar or two to make things nicer, I will. \n__________ the Card/Dice Game - $30 - I will design a lighter dice or card game based on the main game. I will try to have this done at the same time, to save on shipping, but I am not going to promise that. If it is not done at the same time, I will ship it separately. \n__________ the Expansion - $15/40/50 - Yup. I'll design an expansion for the game, and make it match your version of the game. Please add the appropriate amount that matches your version of the game: 15 for the print and play version, 40 for the hand-made version, and 50 for the POD version. My goal will be to have the expansion done very soon after the base game, and I would prefer to ship it together, so please be aware that adding this on *may* delay your copy just a little bit.\nThank you!\nI'm very excited to embark on this journey with you! Thank you for considering to help make it a reality! Here are some cute pictures of my kids and a cat helping out playtest games!\nMy kids helping to playtest a game we designed together!

As players move around the board and land on one of your power centers, they must pay you for being within your sphere of influence.\nIn order to obtain the Presidency, a player must first control five or more centers of power (squares on the game board) and twenty cronies (red game pieces).

We are definitely looking forward to playing this again!\" - Game and a Curry\n\"The scenario felt very true to something you would see in a Sharknado movie \u2013 an absurd story that makes no logical sense, but fits into the Sharknado world perfectly ... The game does a solid job of making you feel like you are actually working together to achieve a common goal.\" - The Chubby Meeple\n\"Sharknado is exactly the kind of game I wanted it to be: chaotic, absurd, and, above all, fun as hell. My Mexican wrestler had shinguards, a bike helmet, and a chain gun--and he and his friends saved the city... And beyond the insanity that is the theme, there's a really good co-op game that rewards multiple play styles. I'll be playing Sharknado very, very often.\" - Doug Levandowski, co-designer of Gothic Doctor and UnPub: The UnPublished Card Game and designer of You're Fired and Seven Minutes in Hell\n\"Every so often a game comes along that makes you look back at all that has been created and you wonder, 'Why hasn't anyone done this before?' This might be that game.\" - Tim Mattes, Games on Tape\n\u201cSharknado is a great game that will call out to both fans of the film and game players alike.

The characters, items and abilities are (ir)reverent enough to make the game fun, even if you're losing.\u201d - Ben Begeal, No one of consequence\n\"Sharknado is a game that knows its audience.

Also, the gear/dice system is sweet.\" - Jay Treat, game designer\n\"Why?\" - SMIF Networks\nPreviews & Reviews\n      Sharknado\u2122: The Board Game! is a new take on the co-op adventure genre. Even though it takes place in the Sharknado\u2122 universe, all of the Characters, and most of the scenarios, are completely original. Fans of the films will find familiar weapons, themes, and parallels, while gamers that haven't yet enjoyed the movies have appreciated the strategy and combat system. \nWhile we\u2019ve had this game favorably likened to Dead of Winter, the Forbidden games, Zombicide, and others, we'd like to point out some noteworthy features of Sharknado\u2122: The Board Game! \nNo specific turn order - The game plays in two phases: the Player phase and the Sharknado phase. During the Player phase, you and your team can take actions in whatever order works best for your strategy.\nAI-controlled Sharknado - The Sharknado is controlled by its own AI deck. Each turn it will move multiple times, rain sharks from the sky, flood the city, and cause carnage.\nLoss of limbs - Just like in the movies, airborne sharks are hungry. Losing arms and legs will slow you down, but don\u2019t lose your head or you\u2019re dead!\nCreate your own story - We\u2019ve included 8 scenarios in the base game, each with two difficulties, but we\u2019ll also include tips on creating your own scenarios for infinite replayability. \n  For a more detailed look at the game, without all that reading, check out the videos below!\nHow to play Sharknado: The Board Game!\nLive Playtests/Demos from Gen Con 2016 \n    Using our network of designers and industry contacts, we've done our best to establish the most cost-effective, customs-friendly ways of getting Sharknado\u2122: The Board Game! to your door. \nKickstarter automatically charges shipping at checkout based on location, but we'll also break them down for you here:\n  Make It Better for Everyone: By participating in community goals and by pledging to help us reach stretch goals, you are shaping and enhancing the core game and growing The Backer Pack for everyone!\nWe Listen to You: You are our collaborator--we value your input as we put the finishing touches on the game.

Emboldened by these signs, students and intellectuals in Budapest, the Hungarian capital, organise a protest of previously unseen magnitudes. As the communist leadership sweeps in to kill the movement in its tracks, a violent response is provoked, thus sparking the Revolution of the 23rd of October.\n  Days of Ire: Budapest 1956 is a historically inspired card-driven board game, playable by 1-4 people. It can be played both co-operatively or in a one-versus-many setting. It is set during the most explosive days of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution, in Budapest, where the fighting was the most fierce. The revolutionary players collect cards and fighters to resolve events and other challenges posed to them by their Soviet opponent (real or simulated). In order to win, they must stay alive throughout the 7 days of fighting - while ensuring that the city doesn't fall to pieces\nDesigned by the crew of 2014\u2019s [redacted], embellished by the amazing art of Kwanchai Moriya, and brought to you by a team made up of people who worked on Anachrony, ...and then we held hands, The Pursuit of Happiness and Posthuman, Days of Ire has gameplay deeply rooted in its theme and setting, and mechanisms inspired by all-time classics such as Pandemic, Robinson Crusoe, and Twilight Struggle.\n    Best of both worlds - a historical wargame and a thematic cooperative board game combined. Perfect for a wargamer to play with his/her non-wargamer family and friends, or co-op players to take up a historical spin \nAccessible - the co-operative mode is comparable to Pandemic\u2019s complexity \nLight, card-driven wargame - half the time as Twilight Struggle, less cards to learn, yet similar feeling \nEngaging solo play - game designed from the ground up with solo play in mind. This is a solo mode not a solo variant. \nUnique, unexplored theme - exciting theme for history enthusiasts all over the world, deeply integrated into gameplay \nBeautiful and engaging art - master artist Kwanchai Moriya and our very own Katalin Nimmerfroh provide the perfect atmosphere through the gritty reality of the revolutionary cards and the idealised propaganda of communist SPA cards\nInterested in checking out the rules of Days of Ire: Budapest 1956?

Send them either as PDF annotations or as text in the email. \nYou may download the WIP PDF rulebook here.\nAfter we\u2019ve received comments from the community we will send the text off to our graphic designer and have a full PDF rulebook ready before the end of the campaign.\n Rahdo Runs Through\n\"It works so phenomenally well!\u201d [...]\u201cThis is a very very impressive game\"\n[About the Twilight Struggle meets Pandemic game setup]: \"That right there... is AMAZING! It's such an innovative and cool gameplay setup...\u201d\n[Talking about the coop mode]: \"It's fun! [...] If you get it solely for the coop experience, [...] it is a worthy game!\u201d\nGameplay runthrough (from the Soviet's point of view)\n Extended Gameplay (presenting the co-operative play)\n Final Thoughts (including thoughts on solo play)\nReviews on BoardGameGeek\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that your tactical decisions \u2013 tension between concentration and dispersal \u2013 have strategic effects [...] There are good peaks and troughs of tension as your plans unfold (or not!), and also a great build-up to a dramatic end point.\u201d - Alan Paull, Surprise Stare Games\n\"This doesn't play like your standard 1 vs many where the \u201cGM\" is encouraged to go easy and make sure everyone is having fun - this is a legit head to head strategy game where both sides don't feel like they have to pull any punches\u201d [...] \"This game brought to life an entire chunk of history I was previously unaware of, and did so in a memorable and interactive way\u201d Chad McCallum\nWho Dares Rolls \nConnect More\n   Dice Tower Summer Preview (Origins)\nWritten Reviews\n444 (HU) \nVolpe Giocosa (ITA)\nDice and Sorcery (HU)\nGame Rustlers (ENG)\nGioconauta.it (ITA)\nPodcasts\nNerdstravaganza\nDing & Dent\nWe have already put the maximum that we can include in the game right from the start, and we have made no compromises in terms of its design. The game comes ready with full fledged V.S., co-operative and solo modes out of the box. \nThe stretch goals, therefore, focus more on adding more variety, higher quality components and other enhancements to further improve the overall experience of the game. We\u2019re starting off with these, and then we\u2019ll announce more as we go along!\n    Get it before the rest - copies will ship to Kickstarter backers way before the game hits traditional distribution. \nLimited availability - the game will be manufactured in limited quantities based on the final number of backers.\nGet it cheaper - although the MSRP is not fully solidified yet (as it may go up if we unlock many stretch goals), the game is estimated to go for around $65 MSRP. \nBenefit from subsidised shipping - shipping is always a very challenging and expensive part of any Kickstarter. We have heavily subsidised the shipping costs to make sure we are able to offer an affordable deal to as many people as possible.\nMake it better for all of us - help unlock a number of stretch goals that will make the game even more enhanced and beautiful. \nWe can\u2019t do it without you! - we\u2019ve paid for the development, art, graphic design and gotten the game to where you see it today. But we cannot print and ship without you. Help make this unique game a reality. \n  We like to keep things simple. This is why we have one pledge level with heavily subsidised shipping all over the world. Shipping rates are as follows: \nUS: $4\nWestern EU: $6\nCentral/Eastern EU & Scandinavia (except Norway): $10\nCanada, Australia, parts of Asia, Norway, Switzerland & Russia: $15\nRest of the World: $30\nTo see exact shipping rates, click on the reward and then select your country. Shipping will be added automatically to your pledge!\nYou will not pay extra duty or taxes for packages delivered to US, EU, CA and AU.\nNOTE: Orders of more than a single copy to AU and CA may be subject to extra charges. ONE copy will not be charged anything, guaranteed.\nThese shipping rates are based on accurate shipping quotes. We believe you should not have any hidden costs, so what you see is what you get. \nThe game will be manufactured in factories we have worked with before and we are confident in their capabilities to deliver a good product. The fulfilment will be handled by Funagain and Ideaspatcher, companies with an amazing track record. Cloud Island might be a new company, but the people involved in this campaign have participated and even ran several other campaigns in the past. \nWe expect the game to be ready for Essen 2016, and we hope to have the game fulfilled before or during Essen. We've set the expected deadline to January 2017, this is to allow some time for potential delays that are outside of our control (factory delays, customs, Chinese New Year preparations etc). We prefer to under-promise and then over-deliver, than the other way round. Whatever the case, we will make sure that Kickstarter copies are fulfilled way before the game hits traditional distribution.

With our experience on previous projects, we are confident to be able to handle the challenges that come with launching a board game on Kickstarter.\n\nWe have done everything we can to minimise all risks from our side, however, board games are usually subject to some risks involving factory delays and customs delays which are completely out of our control. Nevertheless, we are working with partners who we trust and have previously delivered, and we are confident we can deliver the game in a timely manner.\n\nAll graphics and art is complete, all development and game design is finalised.

It can be anything (within reason!), be it a game mechanic or just something... strange. Details are in the rewards on the right. Here are a couple of examples to get you thinking:\n  Want to get yourself some bonus cards?\nEach backer who names you as the person that recommended them will earn both you and them a copy of Noisy Bot!\n(They must pledge for at least one copy of the game and their pledges must go through at the end of the project. Cancelling and re-pledging doesn't count. I reserve the right to refuse you the bonus cards if you're doing something else sneaky that I haven't thought of!!)\nSo if you have 5 friends who you refer to back the project, you will have 5 copies of the card and they will each have one as well. All that needs to happen once they've pledged, is each of you message me with the other's name.\nThis game really thrives on word of mouth and it often takes someone's recommendation or demonstration for people to see through the simplistic appearance to the depth of the game beneath.\nNoisy Bot - A sneak preview of the new 'wake' mechanic. When this card enters play, turn the highest face-down card of the chosen Stak to face-up! This not only lets you find out what card it is, it means it won't trigger once it gets to the top of the Stak.\nAs well as revealing cards and disabling entry effects, it is perfect for increasing the size of your Leader Bots. Or to find better cards to Levi or Ladder. Or bigger targets for Pulse, etc etc! Just don't use it on a Clumsy Bot!!\nFor each additional \u00a3500 above our initial goal, an additional Bot will be unlocked. Each pack will include a copy of every stretch goal Bot. \n(Please note that due to the short-run printing process used for the stretch goal Bots, they will appear slightly shinier than the other cards. They are still perfectly usable in-game). \n\u00a35500 - First in line is Recall Bot!\nRecall Bot was in the shortlist for the Red Expansion and its entry effect works brilliantly in combination with a lot of the other cards in the set. Fancy using that Spike Shot Bot again? Or saving up that big Elephant Bot to use later on when it's a bit safer? Well now you can. \n\u00a36000 - Next is the improved Spy Bot!\nSince its first appearance as a stretch goal option in the 'Yellow' expansion kickstarter, Spy Bot has learnt when it should and shouldn't reveal cards! Use it to boost Leader Bots, get bigger groups to sink with Crevice Bot, or just to find out what's lurking in a Stak and then sit and look smug about it. \nMeet the mighty medley of mechanical maniacs! Where possible we have included footage of the Bots from the Breakout game, so you can see some of what they're capable of! \nThis fiendish little scamp generates an EMP tuned to the frequency of the most powerful Bot (or Bots!) in play, regardless of where they are in their Stak. \nPLAY\n\n   When Juggler Bot enters play, it grabs the front 3 Bots of a Stak and deftly rearranges them into whichever position suits you best. No, it can't throw itself. \nArmour Bot has crafted itself an extra thick second skin made from the husks of fallen Core Bots. It is so tough it can completely ignore the feeble blows and shots of weak Bots. \nPLAY\n\n  Harbinger of synchronous entry effects, Avalanche Bot creates a flurry of face-up cards, with a new one appearing atop every single Stak. It is so exhausted from conjuring up such chaos that play then passes to the next player to resolve the first new entry effect.  \nIn basing the design of this Bot on its flesh and blood counterpart, an unfortunate side-effect was generated: an irrational fear of any Bot small enough to be a mouse, that causes the Elephant Bot to self-destruct when confronted! Power zero Bots have never been so damaging! \nPLAY\n\n  Here to give a helping hand to its Stakmates, Ladder Bot will force another face-up Bot in its Stak to rise to the top. Perfect for digging out specific abilities at a crucial time, but if there are no other face-up cards its invitation to ascend will fall flat. \nAs Pit Bot's larger and more manipulative sibling, Crevice Bot can drill up a crack in the ground large enough to swallow an entire front group of face-up cards. Why get rid of one problem card when you can get rid of all its friends as well? \nPLAY\n\n  A fearsome beast, Bounty Bot has the power to completely shift the balance of power in a game. Set it up to take down a string of weak Bots and you'll have a fistful of new cards to tinker with. \nIf you compact enough Spike Bots into a ball, it is possible to create a projectile prickly enough to replicate Spike's damage ability. Fire one of these at an opponent to eliminate two cards with one entry effect!\nPLAY\n\n  A generous gentle giant, Nice Bot will hand your opponent the gift of another card when it enters. Maybe they'll be less likely to attack you now?  \nWhen Shark Bot spys oil on the water, it moves in for the kill, destroying a damaged card when it enters play. Unfortunately, it doesn't distinguish between friend and foe. \nPLAY\n\n  Needy Bot absolutely hates being alone; it kicks up such a stink when it enters play that you're forced to silence it by playing another card on top of it. Another card like a Spur Bot for example...\nIf you can land a Bee on top of another of your Bots it will reset it, allowing you to use its effect a 2nd time later. If the Bee Bot has nothing nearby to sting, it will look elsewhere for a target and allow you to reset any other top card.\nPLAY\n\n   Like the other Leader Bots before it, Ram Leader will grow more powerful when placed with other face-up Bots. When it charges headlong into another Stak, the force of its collision will destroy the weakest surviving card in the Stak. But only if the card isn't stronger than the Ram. Yes it's complicated until you've seen it in action. Yes there will be example diagrams in the instructions. \n  PLAY\n\n    PLAY\n\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis will be the 3rd set of Stak Bots that we have produced and we will be using the same printers, so we are very familiar with the process. \n\nThe Kickstarter rewards for the last expansion were delivered in full and on time, and we plan to do the same for this one. \n\nOnce the campaign has ended, the files go straight to Cartamundi for printing.\nFrom there, depending on whether any proof revisions are needed, it will be about 6 weeks until we take delivery of the games.

All these backers will receive a full version of the board game, Wasteland Justice.\nAt \u00a398 - Colourful Wastelander - Backers will receive the full version of the board game, Wasteland Justice. In addition we will hand paint an extra set of vehicle models for your own personal use. (Please note that the end result may vary but will be to the same level of quality).\nUnpainted models (These are 3D printed Nylon prototypes - Production models will be molded PVC)\n  Painted models\nAt \u00a3250 - King (or Queen)  of the Desert (example below) -  Our character artist (Andres) will create a unique Wasteland Justice driver based upon a supplied photo. These driver cards will either be added to the base game, if there is no impact on our production time scales, otherwise we will create a promotion pack for all backers to include these additional driver cards.  We will work with the backers to decide upon the drivers' unique ability, but Madbeard Games decision will be final to avoid any drastic game play changes.\nExample King of the Desert process (Thanks to Dustin for letting us share this)\nMerchants of the Wasteland - we will be contacting all backers at this level to provide evidence that they are a retailer.  This level this is for 5 full games. Once funded and before we confirm shipping, you may request additional copies of the game should you require.\nStretch Goals\n We would like to make Wasteland Justice the best game it can be, we have the following stretch goals lined up on the starting grid;\n\u00a335,000 - Don't get us wrong, we love the weight and feel of the cards currently, but that extra weight and linen feel will provide that tactile edge. (This will be in the box).\n\u00a350,000 - Ramming the same class vehicle and tired of waiting those few seconds to use the same die as your opponent?  Wait no longer!  We will add an extra set of the custom dice to the game. (This may be a KS exclusive and the dice may be a separate item to the core game in your delivery).\n\u00a375,000 - During standard game set-up, 1 wreck model is randomly placed per track piece. With more wrecks we will add into the rules alternative set-up of two wrecks per track piece for extra chaos mode. Surely no-one would try three wrecks pre track piece...that would just be bedlam! (This may be a KS exclusive and the extra wreck models may be a separate item to the core game in your delivery).\nDepending on interest, other stretch goals maybe added.\nShipping costs\nShipping is added on to each pledge (except for \u00a31 or more reward level), Wasteland Justice should weigh in at around 2.8kg.  These are the shipping costs for individual* game rewards that will be added to your pledge;\n If your location is not listed, please contact us and we will get a quote and try to add the shipping option in.\nWasteland Justice - Individual Game - Shipping rates\n  Wasteland Justice - Movement and Weapon Dice\n* Merchant shipping varies between 1.2x up to 2.5x the individual shipping cost.  Please check the reward level and shipping before you confirm your pledge.

The only caveat here is stretch goals, depending if we are successful to reach stretch goals they may extend our delivery estimate . \n\nAlthough great and fantastic bonuses in board games, stretch goals, can unbalance the core game and extend production times. We have therefore tried to view stretch goals/some bespoke rewards slightly differently from normal. These bespoke rewards or additional stretch goals if we unlock the initial 3, will either state \"in the box\" or \"in a separate packet.\"\n\nStretch goals \"in the box\" will not impact our production estimate. The stretch goals \"separate packet\" will be designed asap and produced in parallel (mainly due to additional art requirements) to the base game. The separate packet items will still be shipped with the core game but in a separate packet(s). \n\nMatthew and Joe are board gamers and have backed numerous games on Kickstarter, we have seen projects run well and projects run not so well. We would like to think we will be bringing the things we have seen done well and learning from those that have encountered some hiccups (in production, unforeseen costs, delays other timing oversights etc) and combining that into a well run project. \n\nDon't get this wrong, we will make mistakes, it would be foolish of us to believe we are perfect. However we will put our hands up when we go wrong and most importantly we will communicate every step of the way and provide regular updates. We strongly believe that our backers should know their upfront costs.

His books challenge everything about mainstream audiences. His novel Lullaby deploys necrophilia, gender-bending, and no-way-would-this-make-it-to-comfortable-TV satire. We want to make a movie that makes people feel uncomfortable enough to think original thoughts again, just like Chuck\u2019s novels do. To do that we need your help through Kickstarter. \nWe first got hooked on Chuck\u2019s novels in the late 90\u2019s, like some of you. We're fans first, and so like you, as directors and producers we want to make sure Lullaby is the film we all want it to be, and not some watered-down too easy commercial yawner. \nThis project is also important to Chuck. He began writing Lullaby during the trial of his father's murderer in 1999. The prosecutor came to Chuck and asked him if he wanted to advocate for the death penalty. This idea spawned the culling song, or the power of the word to cast a spell, and the story of Lullaby was created. \nToday, as co-writer of the Lullaby screenplay, Chuck has maintained his vision of what this story should be.  As an Executive Producer, he\u2019ll help us make sure that this film stays weird and challenging. \nHelp us make a movie that doesn\u2019t suck. \nSo What's It About?\nLullaby follows the life of Carl Streator\u2014an over the hill reporter whose family mysteriously died years prior. After being assigned to investigate a rash of mysterious infant deaths, he discovers the killer of his own family\u2014an ancient culling song published as a lullaby in a simple children's book. Carl sets out to destroy existing copies throughout the world but is surprised to learn that the people he once trusted to stop the deaths may be involved in the heinous acts.\nPraise for Lullaby\nTIME - \u201cDark riffing on modernity is the reason people read Palahniuk. His books are not so much novels as jagged fables, cautionary tales about the creeping peril represented by almost everything.\u201d\nThe Oregonian - \u201cPalahniuk conjures grief, confusion, mystery and fear from the unlikeliest sources . . . [and] teases amusement from the darkest corners of our culture.\u201d\nThe Daily News - \u201cTwisted and nihilistic . . .  the novel packs a dark comic wallop.\" \nPeople - \u201cAmong sick puppies, Palahniuk is the top dog . . . a unique talent.\u201d\nThe New York Times - \u201cMr. Palahniuk further refines his ability to create parables that are as substantial as they are off-the-wall.\u201d\nOur Plan\nOnce we successfully fund this project, we will start production immediately. We've been speaking with some amazing cast and crew, but to solidify any acting professionals, you need to have a budget locked down. We've scheduled the film and have done a lot of pre-production to make the process go quickly once funded.\nThe Timeline\nWe plan to shoot in late 2016 in Oregon\u2014we have 27 days planned of principal photography, giving us plenty of time to edit and add visual FX through 2017. If you are trying to be an extra, you'll need to be available during the later part of 2016.\nThe Budget - To shoot Lullaby, we've put together an initial budget of $250k, but we would like to increase this budget significantly. (Keep in mind, Fight Club was made for $63 million dollars.) \nWhy give to our project? We, as filmmakers, are dedicated to giving you the best film possible. In the end, a bigger budget will mean a higher quality production. This is where you come in! Here's what a larger budget would mean for the film:\nUpgraded visual effects! When it comes to talking cows, it can be a dangerous thing to underfund the VFX! We project an indie VFX budget of at least $200,000, but the bigger our budget, the better the effects, especially for scenes like the Judas Cow and the Seattle Ivy Inferno.\nAmazing locations! As Oyster would say, \u201cWhen you think about it, Johnny Appleseed was a fucking ecological terrorist.\u201d We agree with Oyster. Being that Lullaby takes place at various locations throughout the country, a realistic representation of the environment is important to portray contemporary America and the impact that we've had on our landscape. The bigger the budget, the better the locations.\nWorld class actors! A-list actors are expensive. When Chuck and Andy wrote the screenplay, they had some very notable actors in mind (take a guess at who we're thinking), and are currently in correspondence with these actors. Many of them have read the script and are interested in being a part of the film! That is, so long as we can pay them the salary that their talent demands. With every dollar our budget increases, the closer we move to securing one or more A-list actors.\nA kickass crew! Team Lullaby is committed to recruiting and hiring professional crew members, many of which are from right here in Portland, Oregon, but this also includes talented and diverse women and men from around the country. There\u2019s no doubt about it, a great film requires a great crew.\nInvested Money Multiplied\nWe are applying for IOPIF\u2014a film rebate and incentive program for Oregon filmmakers. We have the potential to receive a rebate of 10% on payroll and 20% on goods and services. We will reinvest the funds back into the production. For every dollar we earn, we have the potential of actually spending 120% in Oregon.\nDistribution and Film Release\nDepending on our festival invitations (wink, wink), we will premiere the film in late 2017 or beginning 2018 and release it publicly thereafter. Distribution usually happens within 18 months after a festival premiere. If we don't secure a distribution deal we are happy with, we will release the film ourselves using art house theaters through our relationship with the Art House Convergence\u2014ensuring that this film will be seen by the public.\nOur Key Team Members\nThe cool thing about our team is that they are all movie lovers. They have lots of experience working on independent films. Our director, Andy Mingo, and Chuck have worked on other projects together including a short, Romance, adapted from a short story of Chuck's, published originally in Playboy, the rights of which were purchased for a bottle of Whiskey and $1.\nDuring Romance's successful festival run, Andy met our producer, and fellow Oregonian, Josh Leake at Raindance Film Festival in London. They were introduced by the Mexican ambassador to the UN during a festival event. Needless to say, they became fast friends and founded their own production company called Mindpollen.\nAndy is currently directing the trailers for the Fight Club 2 graphic novel published by Dark Horse Comics with an expected June release date.\nYou can also see a documentary that our producer helped create on Showtime called Glena, with a feature film adaptation of that in the works. Leake is currently in postproduction on Zombie Day with George C. Romero, which is set to break the Guinness Book of World Records for the most extras in a short film.\nTeam Lullaby\nWe've pulled some talented friends together to help oversee the pre-production, creation and distribution of our rewards, and with your help, make Lullaby into a feature film. \nRewards\n WHAT IS A VIRTUAL PRODUCER?\nPLAY\n\n ARE THERE T-SHIRT COLORS OPTIONS?

The next best thing you could do is to help us build awareness for the game by following us and sharing our posts on Twitter and Facebook.\n                                                                                                                                      We've built in a small discount for ALL shipping. We like to be completely transparent about everything we do. Here's a breakdown of the shipping costs and the discount you're receiving for pledging on Kickstarter.\nIf you'd like to add-on additional copies of Quests of Valeria, you can add any number of copies by adding $19 for each additional copy. \nTo add more games beyond the first, manually enter the $$ total when making your pledge or click the blue \"Manage\" button next to a previously made pledge. For example, if you're in the USA, enter \"$39\" for 2 copies of Quests of Valeria. \nOur previous games, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, ManaSurge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, and Villages of Valeria will be available to add onto your pledge in limited numbers, but they will not be delivered until February when Quests of Valeria is being fulfilled. These games will also not be discounted. We encourage you to ask your FLGS to order these games from Peachstate Hobby or Alliance in the USA and Esdevium in the EU.\nWe like to support game stores around the world by offering the special Kickstarter versions of the game to retailers during the campaign. We treat retailer backers just like other backers in that they receive their rewards before we release regular retail games into distribution. If you're a retailer, please contact David at david@dailymagicgames.com during the campaign for pricing information.\nWe wanted to publish this game on our dime, but due to popular demand from our previous Kickstarter, Villages of Valeria, we are now bringing Quests of Valeria here so that the community can help us make an even better version than we had planned. Every dollar we make will go directly back in to making Quests of Valeria a better game. Our Stretch Goals are designed to add more content to the base game - so your pledge really makes a difference in making the best game possible.\nHere are some incentives we are offering to all our backers:\n32% off MSRP. Pay only $17 instead of $25.\nDiscounted Shipping.

We are actively involved in the Comments section of each Kickstarter and keep backers up to date with plenty of Updates post-Kickstarter.\nWe're happy to report that of our previous four Kickstarter games:\nSwinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge delivered one month late in December 2015 and is nearly sold out.\nValeria: Card Kingdoms delivered on time in January 2016 and it has been selling so well that we've ordered another print run! Woot!\nManaSurge is on a boat to the USA and on track to deliver on time in May 2016. \nVillages of Valeria is in to the printer and on track to deliver on time in September of 2016.\nWe like to make casual and gateway games in an effort to get more people to the table. Our games are easy to learn to help new players get in to the game faster, but they're also layered with strategy for the more seasoned players.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nDaily Magic Games is committed to delivering quality products on time. We realize that the publication of a board game can be complicated and, no matter how experienced the project creators and mangers are, some problems may occur. In an effort to reduce the likelihood of delays and mistakes, we have taken several steps to prepare for success:\n\n1. This game project, as well as the Kickstarter campaign itself, are in the hands of two well-seasoned professionals. David MacKenzie has been running Kickstarter projects since 2010 (Alien Frontiers, Sunrise City, Swinging Jivecat Voodoo Lounge, Valeria: Card Kingdoms, ManaSurge), and Isaias Vallejo comes from a digital game background as production and studio director at Big Fish Games and has designed two successful board games: Sunrise City and Valeria: Card Kingdoms.\n\n2. We are dedicated to backer communication and feedback. Throughout the campaign, we will be as transparent about the process and as open to feedback as possible without jeopardizing production and delivery timelines.\n\n3. We have done significant pre-production. All the art and graphic design for Quests of Valeria is completed with the exception of stretch goal content. The art and design for the stretch goal content has been sketched out and is ready to push forward as soon as each goal is achieved.\n\n4. We have our manufacturer lined up and ready to begin the pre-press process as soon as the campaign ends.\n\nWe hope that everything goes as planned, but if something falls through the cracks, we are ready and willing to employ every tool at our disposal to get the project back on track and running smoothly.\n\nThank you for your support!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Our Newest Valeria-Universe Game", "update_content": "Live on Kickstarter Right Now!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #25", "update_userinfo": "Margraves of Valeria: Funded!", "update_content": "Greetings Questers...\nJust a quick note to let you know that our newest Valeria game, Margraves of Valeria, is now live on Kickstarter.

With your friends, you are fleeing from invading raiders, leaving your desert home: a plain left behind by a once great ocean, called the Saltlands.\nFlee from waves of invading raiders\nUse landsails, motorized vehicles and a multitude of weapons to make your escape\nExplore - the each time different - environment, collect victory items and investigate rumors in hopes of escape\nCompete or cooperate - who wins and who is left behind? \nHow you play and whether you survive is up to you: we did our best to create a challenging game with unconstrained player interaction and chair-gripping tension. Find out for yourself!\n\u201c...it\u2019s clear this is actually a streamlined and rugged bunch of mechanisms all purring together like a finely tuned V8.\u201d - Mike Barnes, Who Dares Rolls\nNumber of players: 1-6\nAverage playtime (classic mode, normal length): 90-120 minutes\nBeside the Classic (semi-coop) game mode, Saltlands can be played in a full cooperative, or in a full competitive mode. Each variant come in different length and difficulty, you can choose the most suitable for you.\nStrategic social interactions - You will almost certainly not be able to win this game as a lone wolf. But first player or group of players who win will leave the others to their fate. - you have to be one of them! Choose your friends and stick with them, or betray them at the right moment.\nChallenging but fair - There are no dice rolls in the game and the movement of the raiders is rather predictable: survival mostly depends on your strategy and who you cooperate with.\nReplayable and expandable - The desert is different each time you play, and combined with the expansion pack, Saltlands can bring you engaging exploration and surprising moments with every play.\nNot just a game, also a world - We endeavored to create an immersive, authentic desert realm where weapons are exotic, firearms are the remnants of a past age and landsails are ubiquitous. We worked hard on bringing you immersive visuals and have a Graphic Novel and some short stories to make Saltlands an especially memorable experience. Plastic miniatures help the Raider vehicles come to life.\nStreamlined, language-independent design - An intuitive system of pictograms and symbols make Saltlands accessible for multiple languages. With your help, we are planning to translate the rulebook to several languages.\n We are offering 3 editions of Saltlands.\nAll backers can instantly download the saltlands graphic novel \u201cTales on the Saltlands: Scorched Salt\u201d in digital form.\nSaltlands the Board Game for only \u20ac43 (~$49)\nSaltlands the Board Game and the Lost in the Desert Expansion together for \u20ac59 (~$66)\nCollector\u2019s Edition for \u20ac249 (~$280)\nSee details of each edition below.

All backers stay updated when the story continues.\nSaltlands the Board Game includes:\n36 plastic miniatures representing the six types of raiders chasing you,\n6 exciting characters from the three great colonies of the Saltlands,\n13 terrain tiles all illustrated individually,\n180 cards: native weapons, firearm relics, motorized vehicles, landsails, damage cards, rumors, and other items\nand much more...\nUnlocked stretch goal: raider bag\n  Saltlands the Board Game plus the Lost in the Desert Expansion \nFeatures 6 additional exciting characters for a total of 12 characters, each with a special ability and a special item:\nThe Thief & The Merchant from the Container Island\nThe Commander & The Marine from the Beached Mother Ship\nThe Shaman & The Twins searching for the Raider Camp\nAnd also advanced mechanics:\nArea-effect weapons, like the Grenade\nAdditional vehicles, such as the Wind Tractor\nAdditional Terrain Tiles enabling the...\nExtended EPIC gameplay mode!\nIn total Saltlands the Board Game plus the Lost in the Desert Expansion contain:\n214 Cards\n18 Terrain Tiles \n42 Plastic Miniatures \n12 Characters\nA printed copy of Tales on the Saltlands the graphic novel in the rulebook\nand much more...\n  The ultimate box of Saltlands, an outstanding item for your collection!\nThe Collector's Edition includes:\nSaltlands the Board Game and the Lost in the Desert Expansion in a single box,\nCollector's Edition box with a laser-cut, skull metal inlay,\n42 metal miniatures!\nThe plastic miniature sets from the normal editions\nAn insert with the names of all the Collector's Edition backers on it\nAn extra bag for the tokens\nThe box is signed by the game designers.\nSpot UV lettering (this is independent of the stretch goal as this box is a separate print run).\nthe Fan kit addon\nPlus the unlocked achievements:\nMetal Wind Tile\nSurvival Guide + Short Story Booklet (same as in the Fan kit addon)\nMetal Victory Markers\nPoster (same as in the Fan kit addon)\n12 Character sheets, explaining the character abilities (same as in the Fan kit addon)\nNote: The Collectors' Edition is a Kickstarter Exclusive! (Photos of our current prototype box do not represent the its final form, as they are still missing the spot UV.)\n(Prototype minis molded off of a 3D print. Final minis will have a finer finish.)\n    About the achievements:\nThe cast metal wind tile replaces the cardboard wind tile in the normal edition for a more substantial look.\nThe short story booklet contains 3+3 short stories about the colonies when the raiders arrive.\nThe custom cast metal victory markers, provide a unique look for each of the three exit points leading to the three mythical destinations.\nA unique poster lets you take a look at the Saltlands even when you're not playing...\nThe music CD contains the album 'Desert Overcrowded' by the Greek post-rock band Tuber. It's the music you hear in the campaign video... the perfect background music for playing Saltlands!\nAdd-ons\nYou've found the Saltlands Survival Guide. Its worn pages contain precious information, rumors and tales noted by fellow travelers throughout the decades. You learn that this booklet contains something else, too - somebody has jotted down stories that may very well be about the origins of the Colonies. Or are they just false gossips?\nThis add-on contains:\nThe KS-exclusive Survival Guide, merged with the short story booklet of the Colonies\n12 Character Sheets, explaining the character abilities (replacement item since the Cheat Sheets were unlocked)\nAn awesome KS-exclusive Saltlands Poster to remind you that Survival Is Not Enough!\nNote:\n1) Collectors' Edition backers will get this add-on as part of their reward.\n2) The Cheat Sheets stretch goal was unlocked, so you will get 12 Character Sheets explaining the character abilities instead.\nYou love to paint beautiful miniatures of all kinds, and love collecting KS-exclusive, unique stuff. You want to have the option to play Saltlands with something other than paper player standees. This add-on is for you! Give each vehicle a unique look.\nUse the landsails as a starting vehicle and after painting, the extra raider minis when players switch over to raider vehicles. (Because each vehicle has 2 vehicle cards in the Supply Deck, the extra minis are enough and you won't end up with less miniatures for the spawning raiders.)\nThis add-on contains:\n6 KS-exclusive, 3D printed landsail miniatures\nTwo sets (2x6) of raider miniatures\nNOTE: the landsails seen on the picture are illustrations and the final model is going to be similar in appearance but different in details. They will be marked in some way if you do not wish to paint them.\nThe raider miniatures are going to have the same color as the other raiders (probably black, see the FAQ), the landsails may differ in color due to the different manufacturing method.\nThe landsails are going to be manufactured with a low-quantity manufacturing method, most probably 3D printing. Expect proper build quality - we don't want to deliver low-quality miniatures anywhere.\nEach box comes with Raider miniatures! The raiders use 6 different vehicles:\nthe Hover-chevy\nthe Beetle-mod\nthe Pickup\nthe Monsterjeep\nthe Trooper-track\nthe Trailer Truck\nThe miniatures are made of injection molded plastic except in the Collector's Edition with its exclusive metal miniatures. (Miniatures pictured are 3D printed prototypes and from molds off of them. The production miniatures will have a finer finish.)\nClick here to see and rotate the miniatures in 3D.\nCheck out the reviews section below for more information about the game mechanics.\nMythical destinations - The characters have heard of three mythical locations, where they can possibly make a living in peace away from the raiders. To find the path to one of these locations (exit points) the protagonists follow a trail of rumors exploring the Saltlands. When enough rumors have been revealed the exit points activate. Each time a player finds a rumor he has a choice concerning the exit point locations.\nRace to Victory - The first group of players to reach an exit point with the necessary equipment, and clear out the raiders there wins. They escape, and leave the rest to their fate. However, there are no fixed teams; the first player, or players to achieve this goal wins. So players have to decide whom to work with and whom to stab in the back.\nLandsails - The hard flat plain of the Saltlands and the prevailing winds provide an excellent terrain for landsails. The game has a simple wind movement mechanic, which follows real sailing principles: Your speed is determined by the strength and direction of the wind. You are sailing the fastest on a broad reach (downwind, but not directly downwind). You can not go directly against the wind, but must zig-zag (tack) to make progress in that direction.\nTough decisions - Decide what to keep and what (or who) to leave behind in the Saltlands. Save helpless souls in the desert and they will aid you during your journey. Or just ditch them when you don't need them anymore. There is only so much space in your vehicle.\nRaiders on the hunt - The raiders are following you with gas guzzling machines. They always move towards the nearest target and attack them if they catch up. Each player must activate a type of raider at the end of their turn (one that has not moved yet). Thus they can determine the order in which the different types of raiders move. By choosing which raider to activate they can help or hinder the other players.\nSwarming Horde - The Horde of raiders is coming and it seems like there is no escape. More and more raiders join the pursuit as time passes, spawning at the end of of each phase. You must decide when to flee and when to fight the Raiders that are after you. If you kill them you get their equipment and can even use their vehicle, but linger too long and you will be overwhelmed. Find the exit soon or your life is going to be even shorter than expected.\nRulebook & Translations\nThe final version is not yet available, but you can download revision 2.15.

Players race against the clock, raiders flood the Saltlands and kill everyone if they can\u2019t escape soon enough.\nThe Classic game mode is semi-cooperative. Players are free to form alliances or fight alone. The first group of players to fulfill the winning conditions wins, and leaves the other players to their fate. The winning group can consist of any number of players, even one.\nThe Competitive game mode is for lone wolves. Players may fight the raiders together, but only one player wins. The first player who collects enough equipment to escape wins alone, and leaves the others behind.\nDifficulty levels\nIn the Easy mode, players aren\u2019t out of the game after death. They lose their equipment, but they respawn at another location as another survivor.\nIn the Normal mode, players have one respawn option and then are out of the game.\nThere is no place for mistakes in the Hard mode: players have only one life. This is recommended for experienced players only, If they are not careful enough they can quickly die.\nLength variations\nTutorial mode is developed specially for rookies. It\u2019s only available in easy mode, since the purpose of this is to learn the basics of the game mechanics fast.\nNormal game length is 90-120 minutes. This option grants the whole challenging game experience with many hard decisions.\nThe Epic mode is for players who are looking for an extended experience. It comes in a bigger map in the Lost in the desert expansion. Players have to optimize their hand for a long trip and for more raiders.\nThe Transporter\n\"Though others choke from it, I love when the smoke of burning tires irritates my throat.

Even more reviews are coming soon!\nWho Dares Rolls\n\u201c...it\u2019s clear this is actually a streamlined and rugged bunch of mechanisms all purring together like a finely tuned V8.\u201d\n\u201c...this is one of those times that I\u2019ve felt I was looking at a project that had really been refined and developed. The design feels tight and lean there\u2019s no flab or needless mechanics this is a product that\u2019s been nurtured and loved.\u201d- Mike Barnes, Who Dares Rolls (click here)\nBONUS: Audio interview with the developers\nClub Fantasci\n\u201cAs a strategy game, Saltlands is a post-apocalyptic chess match, offering unique challenges.\u201d - Maurice Fitzgerald, Club Fantasci (click here)\nindex.hu\u201cHard but winnable, you need to stay on your toes and choose the right tactics depending on the characters, environment and wind direction. [\u2026] But after all, someone\u2019s going to bite the ground and that\u2019s why the game is so exciting.\u201d - D\u00e1vid Saj\u00f3, index.hu [HUN]\ngeekz.444.hu\nThe greatest virtue of Saltlands is that it puts you into a dangerous and mean post-apocalyptic world, where you chase mythical destinations while fighting for survival. The game mechanics suitably mirror this theme with dynamic exploration and victory conditions, and the various available strategies bring along complex action.\nPixelFlood.it - interview with the developers [ENG+ITA]\nBox of Delights\n\u201cA wonderful, climactic experience, a stylized game\u201d - Ricky Royal, The Box of Delights:\nThe Kwarenteen \nSaltlands preview from Mitchel Lurcook - The Kwarenteen:\nSit Down Standard\"If you like thematic games that give you meaty choices, this is definitely an excellent game.\"\n  We're from Europe, and we hate expensive, non-friendly shipping just as much as you do. We have decided for the \"Stonemaier method\" of shipping: using local fulfillment centers to deliver Saltlands in an easy, affordable way.\nFor the USA, Canada, Australia, and the European Union we are going to provide intraregional shipping which means we take care of duties and taxes. We pay for VAT, GST, and other three-letter acronym taxes.\nShipping costs:\nUSA: Free shipping!\nCanada: \u20ac3\nAustralia: \u20ac5\nEU: \u20ac7\nRest of the world: \u20ac20\nThe shipping cost is the same for the base game and the base game plus the Lost in the Desert Expansion pack.\nWe are a small team of close friends and also engineers doing their best to bring their beloved game to life. Playing and designing board games is our passion.\nSaltlands have been in development for almost a year, we've spent endless days on playtesting, graphic design and engaging with the boardgaming community to receive valuable feedback about the game.\nWe became so excited that the two of us have even quit our day jobs just to do this - out of love for gaming.\nOur goal was to create not just a good game but a polished, aesthetically appealing work of art - while keeping an eye on shipping and manufacturing so that the price can be kept at an affordable level.\nNow it's your turn, it's up to you to support us and the Saltlands project to make it a reality. We've been working on Saltlands for months, but we can't cover the costs of the minimum order quantity of game manufacturers. That is why we're doing a crowdfunding campaign in the first place.\nSaltlands can't and won't happen without you, but your involvement can take it even further. In addition to backing, you can help us by spreading the word during the campaign. We'd also love to hear your feedback in the Comments section - we'll definitely try to answer every question that you might have!\nSpecial thanks to Attila Bal\u00e1zs for helping us with press appearances!\nAbout the funding goal\nThe funding goal has been carefully calculated to cover a minimum print run and make sure that we can fulfill our backers properly, truly making Saltlands a reality.\nEverything that has happened before the campaign is 'on us', so the funding goal mirrors our post-Kickstarter expenses.\nThe cost breakdown of the funding goal is the following:\n8% Do any necessary graphic design modifications\n63% Making a minimum order quantity print run at our manufacturer + manufacturing an injection molding tool for the miniatures\n18% Shipping games\n8% Kickstarter fees\n3% Provision", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAntler Games is a team of three enthusiastic guys. We all have a masters degree in engineering and therefore, are very meticulous and elaborate when it comes to arranging little details that make manufacturing, fulfillment and shipping possible, affordable and sensible.\n\nWe have done the following to mitigate risks and make your support a 'safe bet', that you will surely receive your reward:\n\n- Three people can specialize and concentrate on separate fields: Gergely Kruppa does design and art direction, Andr\u00e1s Drozdy handles testing and manufacturing, while Gergely Gombos arranges business, shipping and marketing details.\n\n- We've set up a BV (LLC) in the Netherlands so that we can conduct business more easily. This helps us with tax and customs issues as well. For example we make sure that you are not charged additional VAT when receiving your reward.\n\n- We have a very detailed budget with multiple scenarios, so the project's funding goal is sensible and it is definitely possible to accomplish the project from this amount of funding, including getting quotes for the stretch goals.\n\n- We have been discussing manufacturing details with Panda Games for months and expect that we will be working with them because we think they can deliver a high quality product on time.\n\nNevertheless, shipping and manufacturing delays may occur.

In Victoriana, players take the role of famous Victorian characters. Following a trail of clues through sprawling 19th century London, these characters must investigate a dire conspiracy that threatens Queen and Country. If all three elements of the conspiracy- Mastermind, Plot, and Locale- are discovered before Big Ben chimes midnight, the players have a chance to engage in a climactic confrontation for the fate of the British Empire. God save the Queen!\nLondon, 1899- The board for Victoriana\nTension that builds throughout the game: As the three elements of the conspiracy are revealed, so are Agents of the Mastermind. This results in a game that gets more challenging the closer you are to victory.\nTime made tangible: Each time the clock advances a quarter hour, all the Leads in play physically turn a quarter turn clockwise. If a Lead ever returns to the 12 o\u2019clock position, it is lost forever. Players use this visible timer to prioritize their actions.\nMultiple resources that need to be managed: Players must balance abilities, movement, and trauma in order to stop the conspiracy before time, the most limited resource of all, runs out.\nFantastic variety: With more than 100 unique Leads, 20 possible Plots, 13 fearsome Masterminds, and the whole of 19th century London as the setting, Victoriana will never play the same way twice.\nEngaging theme: Combining characters from Victorian literature with real-world scientists, politicians, occultists, and more, Victoriana offers a rich, exciting world for players to experience.\nOne of the many nefarious plots\nThe Goal of Victoriana\nDiscover the three elements of a vast conspiracy that threatens London- Mastermind, Plot, and Locale- before the clock strikes midnight!\nThe Gameplay of Victoriana\nInvestigate Leads: Lead cards represent information on the conspiracy! Spend your political, scientific, underworld, and occult resources to collect these leads. But hurry- take too long to investigate a lead and it will go cold!\nDiscover the Plot: Spend leads to eliminate plot cards. Players are rewarded for each plot they eliminate, but beware- a dangerous agent of the conspiracy lurks in the plot deck as well.\nReveal the Mastermind: Each mastermind is protected by three henchmen. Spend leads to put these villains away for good.\nTraverse London: Avoid sinister agents! Collect help from Scotland Yard! Explore the darkest corners of London until you have revealed the conspiracy's locale!\nFoil the Conspiracy: Once all three elements of the conspiracy are revealed, gather your investigators for a final confrontation.\nCheck out Update #2 for a more detailed look at the gameplay of Victoriana, check out the playthrough videos to see these features in action, and check out the rules for a complete how-to-play!\nPlaythrough Part 1: https://youtu.be/HI5UtCbIwF8\nPlaythrough Part 2: https://youtu.be/RUj83lL_y2s\nPlaythrough Part 3: https://youtu.be/OdA4HOVCQtI\nRulebook: While the layout, editing, and art is still in process, the rules are finalized.

That means Kickstarter backers will get a board game with high-quality components, stellar art and graphic design, and engaging gameplay at the best possible price.\nStretch Goals for Everyone: There are no Early Bird pledge levels, no add-ons or day 1 expansions, and no extra money required to unlock stretch goal rewards. Every stretch goal we unlock will be included for every backer at the $49 pledge level and above, for free.\nBackers First: We will ensure Victoriana backers receive their games before a single extra copy is sold. In the meantime, we\u2019ll be asking for your opinion on potential component upgrades and expansion ideas to make sure you get the game experience you\u2019re most interested in.\nWe Need You!: The game is ready, the art is looking great, but we can\u2019t finish the production of Victoriana without your support. Help us make Victoriana a reality.\nA Mastermind and his Henchman\nEach card in Victoriana is unique, providing a different experience every time.\n$1: Every little bit helps! We truly thank you for your support. We'll continue to update you on Victoriana's progress!\n$49: Every pledge at this level or above receives a copy of Victoriana. Not only is the $49 level a significant discount, but you get ALL unlocked stretch goals- new investigators, extra content, component upgrades, the works. Retail consumers will have to pay extra for these add-ons; you get them for free and earlier than anyone else as our special \"thank you\" for helping make the game a reality.   \n$69: As Victoriana is inspired in part by the literature of the period, why not create some literature of your own? Write the flavor text for one card that will be included in every copy of Victoriana. We'll give you the name of the card and you supply the reaction of our Investigators! You'll also receive credit in the rulebook for your contribution plus a copy of the game with all the unlocked stretch goals. \n$149: Ever wanted to try your hand at game design? Join us in creating a Lead card that will be in every copy of Victoriana. You come up with the name, effects, and flavor text of the card, we test it to make sure it's balanced, and you receive credit in the rulebook for your creation. Not to mention a copy of Victoriana and all unlocked stretch goals, of course!\n$240: SIX copies of Victoriana plus all unlocked stretch goals- a deep discount. Suitable for group buys, gifting, and people who have a compulsive need to buy things in sixes! You'll save on shipping, too. \n$249: What good is a Mastermind without their Henchmen? Work with us to design one of these bothersome cards, a copy of which will be included in every copy of Victoriana. You'll receive full credit for your creation, a copy of the game plus all unlocked stretch goals, and the ever-lasting hatred of your friends for creating such a devious impediment to their success.\n$499: Now for the SERIOUS design business. Work with us to create one of the most fearsome and challenging cards in Victoriana- an Agent of the conspiracy. These Agents have distinct personalities and far-reaching effects on gameplay. Are you up to the challenge? If you are, you'll receive full credit, a copy of Victoriana plus all unlocked stretch goals, and the terrible knowledge that you may have created the card that eventually costs you the game.\n$1000: Are you a die-hard fan of Gothic literature? Love the idea of a protagonist with intelligence AND anger issues? Help us create a new Investigator that embodies both- the strange case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Create unique abilities, resources, and even drawbacks that will bring this classic character to life for Victoriana gamers across the world.

Finalizing the art could take longer than anticipated. Printing and shipping could be delayed by forces outside of our control. We trust our production partners and ourselves to finish Victoriana in a timely fashion, but the unexpected may occur. \nIn order to solve these issues before they occur, we have taken every opportunity to research the production process in order to build a realistic timeline for delivery. We have purposefully limited pledge options to simplify the fulfillment process. Not only that, we have included in our timeline a generous buffer in case of unexpected delays.

You play as ghosts scaring visitors away from a hotel that used to be YOUR haunted house! Are you the scariest ghost of the night?\nUPDATE: FUNDED! Now lets unlock those Stretch Goals!\nLinks:\nReviews!\nBGG Page\nPress Page (inc Press Release)\nRulebook\nRulebook in German (coming soon!)\nRulebook in French (coming soon!)\nPrint and Play\nCreepstone Manor has been closed for nearly a hundred years, standing dark and silent above the town of Creepstone, and that\u2019s just the way resident ghost Spookie likes it! But now, the manor has been reopened and turned into a hotel for the living. You play the part of one of Spookie\u2019s ghostly minions, charged with ridding the house of these warm-bodied usurpers. Use your skills of terror to send them fleeing into the night and win Spookie\u2019s patronage. Who will be top ghost?\nAccessible: Ghostel has been designed to be inclusive from the ground up. The approachable theme (who doesn\u2019t love a haunted house!?), coupled with a straightforward ruleset mean players with a range of ages and abilities will enjoy an evening of spooky play.\nDepth of Strategy: Ghostel\u2019s ease of learning and lighter mechanics disguise a game with many player choices and interactions. Planning ahead and adapting your strategy to your opponent\u2019s decisions are vital to scoring big in the ghost house.\nIntuitive: We\u2019ve worked hard to reduce text to a minimum on the cards in play, using instinctual iconography to keep the game clear yet beautiful.\nPlaytesting: We\u2019ve taken Ghostel to many, many playtests over the two years it\u2019s been in development and logged literally hundreds of games at events such as the UK Games Expo, Playtest UK, Chaos Unpub and DragonDaze. The result is a game that feels mechanically tight with dollops of fun included.\nEducational: For younger players, Ghostel represents a fantastic way to strengthen numeracy skills through addition, subtraction and multiplication tasks throughout gameplay, as well as tactical reasoning and forward planning.\nTwo Player: The rules for a 2-player variant of the game have been carefully crafted and playtested to make sure Ghostel is just as fun for two players as it is for higher number, see a review about it here.\nStandard and Challenge Solo Modes\nThe game of Ghostel is made of rounds, and each round is split into a Day phase and a Night phase. During the Day, new people will enter the hotel whilst those who already spent the Night and survived will calm down from their night-time visitations. Meanwhile, the ghosts are hiding in the attic, preparing for the next Night by buying Terror bonuses, Scare tactics to improve their frightfulness and Spookie favours to give that extra little edge. \nDuring the Night, the ghosts walk the rooms, using all their cards and dice to frighten the humans away and show off for Spookie himself. At the start of the Night phase, each player rolls their Terror dice to determine how scary they are for that Night. Players can move one room per round, leaving behind a Terror die as they move. If the total on all dice in a room exceeds the courage score of the human in residence of that room, they\u2019re scared out of the house! Players then score based on who placed the highest scoring dice; however, scoring is graduated so even a single pip die will still score the canny player some victory points.\nFor a full version of the rulebook as a pdf, please follow this link.\n                                                     Happy to comply Nate\n  Our youngest reviewer liked it too!\n Breacher18 Preview\nSmarter Backer / Daniel Zayas\nThe Bearded Meeple Reviews\nUndead Viking Videos Reviews\n\"Those ghost meeples are SO DANG CUTE\" - Toy & Game Expo\n                                                                                            - 1 Game Board featuring the hotel rooms and the score tracker\n- 4 cute and custom Ghost figures\n- 12 Phobia tokens\n- 8 Ghostly Barrier tokens\n- 4 Score tokens\n- 87 Cards\n      - 30 Guests, each with individual artwork featuring caricatures of real people!\n      - 4 player aid cards\n      - 20 Scare Tactics with creepy phobia icons: what do you fear?!\n      - 21 Spookie Favours that give your ghosts a little bonus\n      - 12 Terror Bonus cards to help make your scare more efficient!\n- 32 six-sided Terror dice\n- 4 eight-sided Terror dice\nWe're very lucky to have found artist Tyler Johnson (Sketchgeek.com) to produce the illustrations and Rachel Dobbs (Waggle Dance) taking care of the graphic design. Between the two of them they've produced a gorgeous looking game.\nTyler has drawn the Guests as caricatures of the Tinkerbot Games Crew and three lucky competition winners from earlier in Ghostel's development, and they look amazing! Tyler has extended his fun and vibrant art style to the box and tokens included in the game, producing a cohesive and eye-catching set of images that fully realise the light-hearted yet darkly atmospheric theme of Ghostel.\nRachel has worked on some great games, and has brought that experience and enthusiasm to Ghostel. Rachel has been instrumental in reducing the text on all the cards to produce a more intuitive game whilst keeping the style set by Tyler with his excellent illustrations. Her layouts and knowledge of the industry have both meant her designs are produced efficiently and beautifully, making the visuals really 'jump' off the cardboard!\nAll Pledges: NAME OUR GHOSTIES!\nOur four ghosts don't have names!

We have reduced the price of the shipping as low as we can to make sure we don\u2019t make a loss on each copy of the game we make so we can\u2019t offer reduced shipping on pledges of five games or less. If you*are* thinking of ordering more than 5 copies (what would be considered a case of games), please send us a message here on Kickstarter or to bevan@tinkerbotgames.com and we\u2019ll help you figure out the amount to pledge depending on where in the world you are.\nExtras!\n\u00a315: A GLOW-IN-THE-DARK UPGRADE\nWould you like a little more spookiness to your special meeple?

We're going to add an additional 10 cards that can be substituted or simply added to the Guest deck. The new cards feature a new mechanic, the Pentacle Sign, that give bonuses to players who take the lowest scores from these new Guests.\n\u00a320,500 - New score trackers: We're going to upgrade those slightly boring wooden cubes to awesome translucent plastic ones, to better realise the spooky theme of Ghostel and improve how the game looks on the table.\nTop secret upgrades: We've got a couple of extras we'd like to keep a secret for now. Needless to say, you'll love them when you see them!\nBreaking from the norm\nConventional advice tells us that we shouldn\u2019t announce our stretch goals and costs at the beginning. The risk is that we may reach them all very early on and miss the opportunity to raise more money by announcing them as the project runs (i.e. if we raise \u00a319k early, we announce the \u00a319k stretch goal afterwards at \u00a321k). Though this may help us raise additional funds, one of our core missions for this campaign is to bring you the best quality game at the best value. We\u2019ve announced these stretch goals at these prices because that\u2019s how much they\u2019ll cost us to bring them to you, so that\u2019s how much we need to raise, and no more. We want to reward you for believing in us and Ghostel and supporting us when you did, so as a thanks we won\u2019t be artificially raising the stretch goal values to make more money. We've kept a couple of them a secret but that's just for a bit of fun, the value of the stretch goals are fixed and won't be changing.\nGame designer Bevan has been designing for several years now, ever since he caught the full strength gaming bug in his heady higher education days. His P&P designs have been well received (including the popular Tinker Tactics micro game) and his entry into the UK Games Expo redesign competition has seen him as a finalist in both 2014 and 2015.\nFor Ghostel, Bevan has written a series of designer blogs explaining his thought-processes when designing this eerie game of ghostly goings-on. If you fancy learning more about his methodology and the nuts and bolts behind Ghostel, feel free to check these out (we promise they aren\u2019t too long!).\nThat isn\u2019t to say we\u2019ve closed the book on Ghostel in terms of design. We love to hear what other people think about our work. If any of the information on this Kickstarter project has inspired you, we want to hear from you! Not only that, there is also an opportunity for you awesome peeps to get your face in our game via the CREEPY PORTRAIT and GRUESOME TWOSOME Pledge levels.\nThe Designer: Bevan Clatworthy\nThis displaced Cornishman spent his early life bouncing around Europe as a member of the Army Brat Brigade before settling back on his native soil of Cornwall. His love affair with gaming blossomed upon his return, as he later escaped again to Cardiff where the gaming bug really took hold, a heady mix of new friends, new funds and no bedtime.\nThe gaming cycle was fulfilled, as natural progression led Bevan to turn his hand and imagination to designing games of his own. Bevan now spends his time dreaming up new ideas whilst infecting those who stand still too long with his gaming lurgy.\nGino and Tony approached Bevan following success in the UK Games EXPO Redesign competition, bringing Ghostel with him.\nThe Developer: Gino Brancazio\nOriginally training as a teacher, Gino's interest in board games grew from a fascination with how different games facilitate unique experiences for players, especially around innovative use of mechanics when limited by components.\nAfter finding that Bevan had been designing board games, Gino decided to have a go himself, especially after playing a particularly difficult game of Arkham Horror, surely easier games could be designed...\nWorking on their first design, Epic Lab Time, Gino and Tony were finalists in the UK Games Expo redesign competition and were hooked on the game design process. Joining forces with Bevan, he has helped develop the game and create this Kickstarter campaign to help bring Bevan's first game Ghostel onto the gaming tables of families around the world.\nThe Other Developer: Tony Beard\nBorn into a highly competitive family, it\u2019s no surprise that this man was buying houses and hotels, solving murders, catching aces and fishing from a very early age. After a stint of studying on a farm in Shropshire, this Welsh boy travelled around a bit, from Blackpool to France and in between, but it was in Surrey that he fought his first \u2018colour out of space\u2019 and then the \u2018real\u2019 gaming bug took hold.\nNow back in good old South Wales, Tony splits his time between amateur theatre, dungeon mastering and board gaming, oh and sometimes a bit of paid work too! Tony loves the excitement of a new game, and a new story to be told, and hasn\u2019t lost the competitive edge although the desire to win has been tempered somewhat by games like Arkham and Eldritch Horror where gruesome and horrifying death is far more likely.\nBevan, Tony and Gino\nThe Full Version of our Campaign Video\nWith Hidden Horror Movie Game Included!\n 13 Hidden Horror Movie Titles REVEALED\n Why an \u00a317,850 target?\nWe've done the maths, read as much research as we can get our hands on (thanks Jamey Stegmaier & James Mathe!) and spoken to many producers, printers, transporters and smart folks to figure this out. \nProducing a board game is an expensive task. We've done our best to prepare for all eventualities and to make, produce and ship a game like Ghostel it's going to cost \u00a317,850. The bulk of the cost is from producing the game itself, and international freight from our manufacturers in China to the fulfilment centres around the world. On top of the cost of producing the game, we need to pay for the remaining artwork, graphic design, customs, taxes, shipping to backers from the distribution centres* and numerous other charges and fees along the way.\nBelow you can see a pie chart that tells you where the money is going to be spent.\nIt may seem like a high target to reach, but similar projects in the past have succeeded and surpassed this number so with your help we're hoping to make Ghostel a reality and see photos of it appearing on your tables around the world.\n*You may wonder why we've included freight in our campaign target when there's also additional shipping to pay on the pledges. This is because we've absorbed the international freight from the manufacturer to the distribution centres into the campaign funds to reduce the cost to the individual; your shipping fee will only be spent on getting your copy from the distribution centre to you. This is a bit of a gamble on our part as it makes it harder to reach our target, but we felt making the game more affordable for individual backers was worth the extra risk.\nOur Thanks\nThanks to Tyler Johnson for the amazing images \nRachel Dobbs for her graphic design and iconography \nJon Morgan-Heath of Black Jam Circus for the music for our video \nJamie Gibbs of Geeks in Wales for the gifs\nSami Al-Nashee for help with the audio on the videos\nDustin Schwartz for help editing the rules \nOur playtesters (too many to name!) for helping us refine the game\nThe reviewers for their excellent feedback \nOur FLGS Rules of Play for sponsoring our podcast, hosting our Ghostel events and general awesomeness in the name of board gaming\nThe Game Crafter for producing our top quality prototypes\nWinGo for help with many, many quotes, production and shipping info\nOur friends and family for supporting us this far, it's been a long two years and many late nights\nAnd finally, thanks to you for being part of this campaign with us, for supporting us with a pledge or a share, and for getting this far down the Kickstarter page. Good work!\nSocial Avatars!\nWould you like to show that you're part of the Ghostel team? Want to help raise awareness for this campaign? Then take one of our avatars below and make it your facebook or twitter! Does your scary face match one of our guests? Or perhaps you share one of their fears? There's plenty to choose from!\n Social Media\nIf you want to grab us on social media you can find us on:\nFacebook\nTwitter\nYouTube\nBGG", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisks and Challenges\n\nThis is the first time we've had to organise a Kickstarter. Fortunately, both Gino and myself are experienced project managers in our day jobs where we often have to organise complex programmes with integrated budgets. It is these key skills that we will be bringing to the campaign. However, as with any project there will be challenges:\n\nSHIPPING\nWe know that the backbone of any successful campaign is making sure that the backer rewards reach their owners in a timely manner and in great condition. We've done hours of research and built relationships with several reputable fulfilment centres around the world ahead of launching this campaign to make sure we get the best deal for you. This includes shipping from within regions where possible to remove the issue of customs charges. \nHowever, there will always be events that are out of our control; strikes, storms and the unforeseen. Rest assured we will do our best to rectify these issues if they rear their heads but please be aware that our delivery estimate is just that; an estimate based on the best of our knowledge.\n\n\nMANUFACTURE\nAs with shipping we've done our homework, choosing the excellent WinGo Games to manufacture our games. Their reputation is solid and the feedback we've had from previous clients has always been positive.\nManufacture in China is not without challenges. The timezone issue and the busyness of a manufacturing schedule can cause a few delays in communication. We also have custom components included in Ghostel which also come with teething problems as we adjust and quality control until we get the best for you, the backers. Whilst we don't foresee any delays, past experience in our day jobs coupled with our discussions with industry moguls have given us a taste of what to expect and that any project (especially one as complex as a board game) will have some 'tricky bits'.\n\nTHE THANK YOU VIDEO\nFor our video, we're going to be filming at a haunted location, at the dead of night. This may be tempting trouble if the ethereal residents we'll be filming alongside decide we are not welcome (some ghosts are notorious prima donnas), which may result in our 'disappearance'.\nTo address this risk, both myself and Gino will ensure we leave Ouija boards and the contact numbers of a reputable medium with our spouses. In this way we hope to be able to continue communication with the living world and ensure manufacture and fulfilment go ahead. It will make attending the UK Games EXPO convention a trial, but hey what's unlife without a bit of tribulation!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #44", "update_userinfo": "Haunticulture Kickstarter - It's ALIIIIIIIIVE", "update_content": "Hello there awesome backers!\nWe hope you folks are having a wonderful spooky season, and getting lots of creepy gaming in to boot!

Each scenario presents different quests that must be fulfilled in order to be victorious, and various monsters the heroes will need to defeat on their way. The monsters react to the heroes' actions, so no one is stuck playing the role of game master.\nThe Heroes of Arcadia!\nAs the heroes defeat their enemies and accomplish quests, their guilds rake in the coins, which will then allow them to acquire all sorts of powerful loot! From legendary weapons and armor, to new abilities and magic items. The combination of each hero's unique ability with all the different upgrades they earn through the campaign allows players to create amazing and unexpected combos!\nThe Monsters of Inferno!\nInferno is a standalone box, but also fully compatible with previous Arcadia Quest boxes. It contains a full campaign with 12 scenarios for players to explore. As players progress through the circles of Inferno, deeper and deeper into the Underworld, the campaign branches into two distinct paths. The path not taken results in quests the players will not fulfill, and therefore consequences that will come back to haunt them towards the end of the campaign.\nThe Angels. Will they help or hinder you?\nOne such key choice are the Angels. These secret protectors of Arcadia have been imprisoned by the Underlord, who is trying to corrupt them. If players rescue these Angels, they become powerful additions to their Guilds. But beware, the Angels that are abandoned to their fate will be consumed and come back as monsters to seek revenge on the heroes!\nProduction plastic miniatures of the Inferno monsters, angels, and heroes.\nGoing down into the infernal depths presents the heroes of Arcadia with a new set of challenges and opportunities, in the form of Damnation! This dark power permeates everything in Inferno, and daring heroes may want to use it to their advantage (and face the consequences). Weapons and equipment found in Inferno may become more powerful if a hero takes Damnation, monsters may offer the choice of taking Damnation instead of wounds (or flat out dealing Damnation to their target). However, accumulating Damnation may come at a high price. Some Upgrades are more effective against heroes with Damnation, some monsters more powerful against them, and specially Brimstone cards scattered through the scenarios may activate monsters to attack heroes who dabble too much in the dark powers!\nMany of the Upgrade cards use Damnation to punish or reward heroes.\nArcadia Quest: Inferno comes with:\n36 highly detailed figures, including:\n  12 Hero figures\n  5 Angel figures\n  19 Monster figures (6x Demoness, 6x Harpy, 2x Demon Pitcher, 2x Cerberus, Belly'aal, The Judge, The Underlord)\n12 color plastic bases\n8 Attack dice \n6 Defense dice \n9 double-sided game tiles \n4 guild dashboards \n276 cards\n300+ tokens\nCampaign Sheet pad\nRulebook\nCampaign Book\nExplore a brand new campaign, and add Pets to any Arcadia Quest experience with the Optional Buy Arcadia Quest: Pets expansion!\nFind out everything about the Pets Optional Buy box HERE.\nIf you wish to extend your campaign beyond the 6th scenario, don't miss out on the ultimate showdown with the Frost Dragon expansion box!\nFind out everything about the Frost Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nThe mad fight against the Chaos Dragon also takes place after the 6th scenario and brings a whole new epic experience to Arcadia Quest!\n Find out everything about the Chaos Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nNo epic campaign can end without a showdown against the majestic Fire Dragon!\nFind out everything about the Fire Dragon Optional Buy box HERE.\nHell of a Pledge - $100\nThe Hell of a Pledge gives you an Arcadia Quest: Inferno core box, the Kickstarter Exclusive Hero King David III, and all applicable Stretch Goals we manage to unlock!\nKing David III is a natural born leader. Well, at least he was born into leadership as the rightful ruler of Arcadia, but now most of his power has shifted to the Guilds. He's still able to rally his comrades in a fight, though, allowing his guild to activate another Hero if he ends his movement in the same space.\nProduction plastic miniature of King David III.\nNote that anything marked with this:\nis an exclusive item for Kickstarter backers, with remaining stock available through conventions and special promotions only.\nThe CMON crew gathered their guilds and went down into the depths of Inferno in order to produce a gameplay video for you.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in Germany (EU backers), China (Asia Pacific backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a standard game package (4kg volumetric weight). Keep in mind these are just estimates, and costs may rise based on weight increases from unlocked stretch goals and any optional buys you choose.\nUSA: $10-$15 to most states. $30 to Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. \nCANADA: $10-$20 to most cities. \nLATIN AMERICA: $50-$60 to most countries. \nASIA: $10 to China and Hong Kong. $30 to most other countries (we can't predict an estimate cost to Malaysia). \nOCEANIA: $13-$25 to Australia. $30 to New Zealand. \nAFRICA: $70 to most countries. \nEUROPE: $10 to Germany. \n  $15-$30 to most other countries. \n  $35 to Norway, Finland, Estland, Lettland, and Latvia. \n  $40 to Bosnia/Herzegovina, Croatia, and Serbia. \n  $55 to Bulgaria, Lithuania, and Romania. \n  $60 to Iceland, Russia, and Israel. \n  $70 to Greece, Turkey, and Ukraine. \nBe aware that all pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline will be shipped from the US hub at a later date. For non-US backers that will likely incur increased shipping costs. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nPlease note that while we do our best to get you your rewards in a timely manner, you may not necessarily receive your rewards before the product makes it into distribution in your own country or before it's made available in conventions and special promotion opportunities. We hope that the special price and exclusive items you will get during the Kickstarter will make up for any such possible lag. However, if this is something that is not acceptable to you, please do not back this project, and instead wait for the retail release.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.

After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 60 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment (usually 4 to 6 weeks before the actual shipping date), no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 60 days close of the campaign are processed via Paypal only. Refunds within 60 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, we will treat it as abandoned and will refund or ship on a case by case basis.\n\nBy pledging to this Kickstarter, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the Kickstarter) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project is active.

Go to www.secrethitler.com for the most up-to-date information. There you can also read the full rules and download the game to print-and-play for yourself right now!\nSecret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930's Germany. Players are secretly divided into two teams - liberals and fascists. Known only to each other, the fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their cold-blooded leader. The liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it\u2019s too late.\nEach round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.\nSecret Hitler is designed by Max Temkin (Cards Against Humanity, Humans vs. Zombies) Mike Boxleiter (Solipskier, TouchTone), Tommy Maranges (Philosophy Bro) and illustrated by Mackenzie Schubert (Letter Tycoon, Penny Press).\nIn Secret Hitler, each player is randomly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one player is Secret Hitler. The fascists know in advance who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is. Since the liberal team always has a majority, the fascists must play like moles, gaining the trust of the liberals to sabotage their plans and make them suspicious of each other.\nThe objective of the liberal team is to pass 5 liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass 6 fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after 3 fascist policies have passed.\nEach round, the President selects a Chancellor. The whole table votes \"Ja!\" or \"Nein!\" on their ticket; if a majority of players vote \u201cJa!,\u201d the elected President and Chancellor take the following actions to pass a new policy:\nThe President draws 3 policies from a random deck.\nThe President discards 1 policy and passes 2 to the Chancellor.\nThe Chancellor discards 1 policy and enacts the final one as law.\nIf a fascist policy passes, the President gains a new power that she must use immediately. These include:\nIf Hitler is executed, the game ends immediately in a Liberal Victory.\nSecret Hitler introduces new mechanics to the hidden-identity game genre.\nThe first is the element of randomness. When laws are passed, the President draws three policies, passes two to the Chancellor, and the Chancellor enacts one. Only the enacted policy is revealed, so players have to rely on the President and Chancellor\u2019s word to know what got discarded. The deck has a known initial composition (11 Fascist policies, 6 Liberal policies), and players can roughly track deck contents based on what the President and Chancellor report, though someone might have lied about what was discarded. That means players can form reasonable expectations and plan around probability, but they can also manipulate future probabilities and expectations in a way that benefits their team.\nThe second new mechanic is the \u201cHitler\u201d identity: If Hitler is elected as Chancellor after the third fascist policy has already been enacted, the game ends immediately and the fascists win. This means Hitler will spend most of the game playing as a liberal to gain players\u2019 trust. Once the third fascist policy is enacted, anyone who has helped the group becomes immediately suspect; if the liberals make a wrong move at this point, they lose immediately. This creates incredible moments of tension and relief in the game.\nSecret Hitler is a love letter to hidden identity games like Werewolf/Mafia, The Resistance, and Avalon, but it's also a new design that fixes some of our biggest problems with those games.\nNo moderator: Secret Hitler doesn't require a moderator - everyone can join in the game.\nNo early player elimination: We love the suspense of player elimination, but Secret Hitler saves that drama for the very end\u2014assassinated players will rarely have to wait more than ten minutes before the game ends.\nIn games like Werewolf, you can only act on your gut feeling. Secret Hitler creates a much more heady experience - there's almost enough information that you can solve the game like a puzzle, but not quite enough. Players always have enough information to make meaningful choices, but we've simplified the decisions to avoid analysis paralysis; each round the President nominates a Chancellor, and the table votes yes or no to that ticket.\nSecret Hitler is enormously replayable because the ways the presidential powers are used and the table position of the players is never the same twice. We've played hundreds of rounds of Secret Hitler, and the metagame is still evolving in very exciting ways.\nWhy is Secret Hitler set in 1933 Germany? We believe that the theme and setting of a game work best when they help explain the story and mechanics.\nHitler\u2019s takeover was, for a dictator, surprisingly political: he wasn\u2019t a general who subverted a popular revolution, he wasn\u2019t backed by foreign interests, there wasn\u2019t a total collapse of government he took advantage of. He used the rickety systems of the Weimar Republic to gain power mostly legally; he was handed the Chancellorship by men who thought they could \"control\" him.\nHitler and his allies spent years manipulating the levers of democracy, accumulating power in a snowball effect. He divided and intimidated his rivals. He used national crises to strengthen his own position. His followers were organized and brutal, and his rise was equally engineered and opportunistic. There were good men who didn't understand how dangerous he was until it was too late, and there were bad men who wanted power for themselves but were outmaneuvered.\nSocial Deduction games are about a well-coordinated minority trying to convince a confused majority to vote against its interests. It's an inherently political genre.\nWe set out to make a game to help us reflect on the ways that others - good, bad, indifferent - were complicit in Hitler's rise to power. Our game doesn't model the specifics of German parliamentary politics. Instead, we try to model the paranoia and distrust he exploited, the opportunism that his rivals failed to account for, and the disastrous temptation to solve systemic problems by giving more power to the \"right people.\"\nSecret Hitler has a unique capacity to create intense, memorable play sessions. Frankly, none of us had ever playtested a game that gets this kind of a reaction before.\nAt Gen Con in 2015, we were shocked to see demo sets of Secret Hitler sweep through an industry party full of game designers. By the end of the night, every single table was playing, with people jumping out of their seats to shout and and cheer at the end of each game.\nWe played Secret Hitler at San Diego Comic Con 2015 with Richard Stevens (creator of Diesel Sweeties) who monitored his heart rate on a Apple watch throughout the game. By the end, he was registering 121 BPM - that's on the high end of what an astronaut will experience during a shuttle launch.\nRichard Stevens' heart rate during a game of Secret Hitler\nHere's what some of our playtesters had to say about the game:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe'd been playtesting Secret Hitler for nearly a year when we launched this Kickstarter, and we're so excited to get it into your hands.\n\nOur team has a lot of experience manufacturing and shipping games.

Check out their webpages, they're pretty spectacular.\nDepictions of nightmares contain some unsettling images. In particular the depictions of mutilation may not be suitable for children. There's also some mild nudity, which seems less important but we respect that there are some cultural differences in this regard.

The first attempts to explore inside it ended in disaster.\nGuide the remaining survivors through the sprawling passageways of the Nullpoint. Explore, scavenge, and survive long enough, and you may uncover the story of the ill-fated expeditions, and the dark secrets of the Nullpoint itself. \nFor anyone to escape the Nullpoint, sacrifices will have to be made. New survivors can always be found to replace the fallen. But beware: there are no reloads, and backup isn\u2019t coming. If your survivors all die, you\u2019ll have to start again from the beginning.\nQuick Overview\nPlatforms: PC / MAC\nReal-Time Tactics - Control up to 5 survivors with a scheme familiar to any RTS player.\nSurvival Horror Elements - Scavenge for limited supplies, but keep a lookout for things that lurk in the darkness. Gauge carefully whether to fight, run, or hide based off of your team's resources.\nShip-based & On-foot Exploration - Guide your ship between docks in the Nullpoint, then disembark and take your survivors on loot runs.\nShip Upgrade Meta - Use scavenged resources to upgrade & repair your ship's internal systems.\nRoguelike Gameplay Loop - Getting through the Nullpoint will be difficult, and the stakes are high. If all survivors in the party die, the game will reset and the dungeons will re-randomize.\nProcedural, Real-time Tactics Dungeon Crawling:\nCommand up to 5 survivors using RTS-style controls through the vast, procedurally-generated levels of the Nullpoint. No two runs will be the same unless you choose to share your world seed with a friend.\nScavenge for Resources:\nResources are scarce. Your band of survivors will rely on scavenging what supplies remain from the ruined expedition outposts scattered throughout the Nullpoint.\nExploring beyond the base camps could yield even better rewards, if you\u2019re willing to risk venturing into the deepest, darkest parts of the facility.\nUpgrade Your Ship:\nYour survivors have only one shelter - a transport shuttle left behind by one of the prior expeditions. This will be your teams\u2019 only refuge from the Nullpoint\u2019s punishing, hostile environment. Treat it with care. You only get one.\nOn board the ship, you\u2019ll navigate through the Nullpoint, re-equip, and heal your crew. However, the benefits your ship offers are limited based on where you invest resources.  \nDo you repair the healing systems or the item dispenser? Do you rig together a station to upgrade your weapons instead? Or, do you play it safe, and repair the ship\u2019s fraying outer hull?\n\n\nMourn The Dead, Protect the Living:\nThe Nullpoint is a cold, brutal place. Survivors will die, but as long as at least one stays alive, the story continues.\nThat sole survivor might go on to rebuild the team and keep the hope of escaping the Nullpoint alive.\nIt all began by chance. A deep space probe on its way out of the solar system reported a strange, blank spot in the background radiation scans. Follow-up scans confirmed the deadzone, but nothing could penetrate or identify it.\n\nWe didn\u2019t know what, but something was unmistakably out there, floating quietly in loose orbit just past Saturn.\nThe next probe was sent, equipped and prepared to photograph the dark spot, and the results were explosive. The Nullpoint, as the media called it, wasn\u2019t an asteroid or a gas cloud. It was a structure. Whatever it was, it was massive, capable of absorbing every wavelength outside the visible spectrum, and not built by human hands.\n\nThe prospect of alien technology prompted several governments and corporations to assemble fleets and make the year-long journey out to the Nullpoint, to lay claim to a piece of this new milestone in human history.\n\nThey ventured into the Nullpoint prepared for anything - diplomacy, research, war.\n\nThe truth of what they found remains buried in the Nullpoint with them.\n\n\nExplore at Your Own Pace:\nThe Superstructure is massive. Finding the shuttle doesn't mean finding a way out.\nThe Nullpoint\u2019s interior is broken up into two biomes: Superstructure and Substrates. The Superstructure is comprised of cavernous interior passageways big enough that humanity\u2019s capital ships were able to easily fly inside them.\nDotting the Superstructure are numerous access points to the Substrates: a maze of corridors and passageways that can only be explored on foot.\nAbandoned camps in the Substrates are a great place to scavenge.\nYou will guide your survivors and their ship through the Superstructure in search of docking points where your survivors can then disembark to search for supplies.\nSecure the dock when you first disembark... or risk being cut off from the ship on the way back.\nSome Substrates contain valuable forward base camps that can be looted, while others will contain the alien control consoles needed to unlock the next Superstructure layer and advance the game. It\u2019s up to you to which of these Substrates you\u2019d like to risk exploring, and how deep you venture into them before turning back to the ship.\nFight, Outsmart, or Sneak Past the Horrors of the Nullpoint:\nResources are scarce, and even the most basic monsters can be deadly. You will have to develop strategies for carefully managing your limited supplies. Your team's lives depend on conserving ammunition, and rationing your first aid kits.\nStrategic Monster Design:\nEvery being in the Nullpoint has a story, and a unique set of abilities and behaviors. Some monsters are deaf and blind. Others can hear a gunshot from a mile away. Some won\u2019t attack you at all\u2026until, for some reason, they do. Some monsters will even fight each other, given the opportunity.\nIt\u2019s up to you to study their behavior, and discover how to best avoid, fight or exploit them.\nCurrently we're targeting a PC and MAC release. \nWe're planning to release on Steam, but definitely want to provide a DRM-free option as well.\nWe are a group of veteran game developers working at Schell Games in Pittsburgh, PA. \nNullpoint is a project we\u2019ve been working on in our spare time for nearly a year. We\u2019re ready to share what we\u2019ve been working on with the world, and ultimately Kickstart a fully-realized version.\nThe Nullpoint team is bolstered by the circle of support here at Schell Games, including developers like Marc Tattersall (Diablo II), Michael Giam (Twisted Metal), Tim Sweeney (City of Heroes), Harley Baldwin White-Wiedow (Tomb Raider: Underworld), Matt Mahon (Dungeon Siege II), and Jesse Schell (Art of Game Design).\nAs a team, we\u2019ve been heavily influenced by games like Darkest Dungeon, Faster Than Light, The Binding of Isaac, and Dark Souls. We love hard games \u2013 games that force you to evaluate your choices carefully, and give your choices meaning by raising the stakes on what you stand to lose.\nSchell Games has agreed to cover two thirds of our development costs. That\u2019s enough for us to cover basic functionality like saving and loading, survivor persistence, AI, menus, and all the other things few people initially think about when imagining game development. After further discussion, we determined we\u2019d need more than that to really make a game worth playing.\nAll of the funds from Kickstarter (apart from Kickstarter\u2019s 8% cut, and the costs of our rewards) will go directly toward adding features and content to the game.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\n- The Risk of Making Something Weird.\nThere\u2019s always risk involved when building something completely new and different. Part of why we so badly want to make this game is because we\u2019ve never played something quite like it before. It\u2019s sitting in between a few genres, but doesn\u2019t quite follow any existing game formula.\n\nBecause of our game\u2019s uniqueness, we have already faced and will continue to face unique technical and design challenges. Things that sound fun at first might turn out to be annoying or repetitive. We\u2019ve been planning our features conservatively to make sure we have enough iteration time to pivot and adjust to feedback on these features as they become a reality.\n\n- Feature Risk.\nWe\u2019re building a systems-heavy game, and we know games like this thrive on having a robust feature set. That said, we\u2019re also committed to making a solid and compelling experience. Because of that, we\u2019re more willing to cut features than we are to cut the overall quality of the game.\n \nThis means if something goes wrong in development, some features might slip in the interest of making sure that what we do ship is fun to play.\n\n- Risk of Challenge vs. Frustration.\nWe\u2019re intentionally making a challenging game. Nullpoint is not a game that\u2019s meant to be beaten on the first try, and that challenge is what makes getting to the next level of (or beating) the game rewarding.\n\nOf course, the risk with challenging games is that they can end up being more frustrating than rewarding to play. We are reserving time to iterate and react to feedback from the early-access community for exactly this issue, to make sure Nullpoint doesn\u2019t become that kind of game.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Schell Games\n3 created \u00b7 6 backed\nSchell Games, an independent game studio founded in 2002 by world class game designer and award-winning author Jesse Schell, is made up of...See more"}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #11", "update_userinfo": "Thunderclap Link", "update_content": "Hey everyone,\nI apologize, but the link we sent out yesterday was broken.

In addition to these rewards ALL PLEDGERS will receive an extra free board gaming session for themselves! This includes the 'Supporter' and 'Your First Visit' levels.\nAdd-ons\nWe will be offering all physical rewards as add-ons, so if you want to get multiple rewards for family and friends, or you want to customize your order, you just have to over-pledge the amount for the items you want!

With the help of Kickstarter, and backers like you, that dream came true. Now we're back to do it all again!\nIgnacy has picked some of the best essays which he published on his Boardgames That Tell Stories blog from 2013 to 2014.

His aim is to entertain everyone who follows with candid tales of designing, publishing, exhibiting... and sometimes even playing games. His blog is featured on Boardgamegeek.com and has become one of the most followed blogs on the site. Ignacy also publishes additional content on a site dedicated to the blog, boardgamesthattellstories.com\nWe've hand-picked 23 of the best stories to include in this volume.

Or worse!' - Alan Ball\n'Really really like the look of this one.' - Mike, Who dares rolls\nFell is a cooperative board game pitting 2-4 players against the Chimeris: gigantic misshapen Beasts that require many men to bring down. The players will hire a group of ruthless mercenaries, equip them carefully and then send them to hunt these gigantic Beasts.\nIn Fell, you will work together as one of five businessmen (or women) to take advantage of the bounties the king has placed upon the Beasts of the land:\nThe Merchant\nThe consummate businessman, the Merchant made their money buying low and selling high and is looking at getting into the hunt. They bring expertise to the group, with an eagle eye for fine wares and an incomparable haggling ability.\nThe Pitboss\nThe Pitboss knows how to get things done, although they do sometimes use less than legal means. This is the person who can get you what you need when you need it. Just don't ask how they got it.\nThe Veteran\nThe survivor of many wars and a soldier who has seen a thousand men die, the Veteran brings their expertise as a drill sergeant to train the mercenaries and bring them up to scratch so that they can survive for an extra five seconds against the Chimeris.\nThe Huntsman\nThe hunt is never big enough for some people. Rabbits, deer and even bears are not exciting enough for this master of the wilderness. The money was the final push they needed to finally offer their knowledge of the land and wildlife to hunt the most dangerous game of all.\nThe Aristocrat\nThe high life: wine, tobacco and adventure! Young, impulsive but very well connected, the aristocrat makes up for their naivety with their overflowing bank account!\nFour shillings. Nearly a crown. Sem looked at the Beast in the distance, mismatched limbs noticeable even from here, unique in the way only \u2018Beasts\u2019 could be. The creature was a great shambling mass, with one gigantic furred arm helping to support its great weight, the four thin spider-like legs unable to hold up its mass as well as the stockier mammoth limb on the other side. Horns the size of spears jutted madly from its face at seemingly random directions, one even obscuring one of its hate filled red eyes. The thing was in the open, it would smell them coming a mile off, but at least it was where they could see it.\n\u2018Reckon he\u2019s thirty six\u2019 Kristoff muttered as he strung his wicked little bow.\n\u2018Forty hands at the least\u2019 Sem snorted, pinching the air in front of his eyes as if to crush the Beast between them.\n\u2018Four shillings worth anyway.\u2019\n\u2018Aye\u2019\nEach Beast or 'Chimeris' is randomly composed of several Beast cards depicting monstrous limbs, heads and torsos which come together to make a mismatched shambling horror straight from a madman\u2019s nightmare. These are not the classic monsters you may be used to facing as mighty heroes in other games, but then again you are not commanding the mighty heroes that you will wish you were. \nThis random generation means that there are thousands of combinations of Chimeris, each acting differently and each wickedly dangerous in their own unique ways.\nPLAY\n\n\u201cMany of yer have been to war before, to foreign lands and the like.

To help you with this are five Warrior classes to hire, each with their own unique roles.\nThe Brute\nThis mighty warrior wields a great weapon to hack away at the Beast, they deal the most damage and have a sundering attack that chips away the Beast's armour.\nThe Marksman\nArmed with a bow, these warriors can deal damage from afar. They can also utilise an accurate attack that has a chance of freeing their allies from the Beast's grasp.\nThe Shield Bearer\nWith weapon and shield held in mighty arms the Shield Bearer can take the most punishment from the Beast as well as bashing their shield to distract the Beast from their allies.\nThe Sticker\nArmed with a polearm, the Sticker's main role is to hinder the Beast's movement using their brace ability. They also attack the Beast from a safer distance.\nThe Cragsman\nWielding nothing but two long knives, the Cragsman is in his element when climbing the Beast to attack the most vital locations.\nWe have several rewards beyond a copy of the game for generous backers that will allow them to be added into the world of Fell through the hands of our brilliant artist: Lorinda Tomko (http://www.lorindatomko.com/illustration.html).\nWe will work with you to create a Sticker, Brute, Marksman, Cragsman or Shield bearer in your likeness, you must own the copyright to any images or names you send us and we reserve the right to refuse any names that are profane or vividly 'against theme' (no sir hacks4l0t or the like I'm afraid).\nIf you would like to support us further we can offer to work with you to create one of the five businessmen that players will play as in the game.

The campaign rules are still in early development but the general idea is to string together up to six skirmishes as you lead your band of warriors to riches or ruin. Each hunt will earn you money, which you can spend to buy equipment and upgrading your surviving warriors (or more likely replacing the fallen!).\nFor a quick summary of the rules and a full gameplay video head over to Grimejack.com\nGoal: We make the game and it will be beautiful. Even if we do not meet all of our stretch goals we fully intend to complete the finished game to a polished and professional level.\nNew identities: We will add a new player identity into the game with unique special rules. This will also allow one more portrait of a generous backer to be added into the game.\nNew Classes: We will add five new warriors into the game for you to throw at the mighty Beasts. This will also allow five more portraits of generous backers to be added into the game.\nTerrain: We really want to add terrain into Fell. To this end, we will design six unique overlays to place onto the battlemap. These will add a whole new layer of tactics into the game including rivers that might slow you down, scrub to hide in and rocks to climb so that you can challenge the Beast face to face!\nNew Beast body parts: These body parts will add new abilities or different values to the Beasts limbs as well as fantastic new art. Once we hit the total of 36 bodyparts, there will be over 45,000 different possible Beasts!\nOur stretch goals are simple. We have devoted a great deal of attention to what we believe is achievable, and as such, this is the complete list of stretch goals.\nMy name is Jack Caesar and along with Matthew Grimes we are Grimejack Games. We are British board game designers from opposite ends of the country who created Grimejack games smack bang between the two in Leicester.\nBoth of us come from an engineering background, but our gaming experiences are quite different. I have always enjoyed playing roleplaying games, many of which have been created by me. I have always enjoyed creating intuitive rules that tell a story and it fascinates me when simple systems manage to recreate complicated situations and themes. Matt comes much more from the wargaming scene and has great familiarity with the many ways rules and theme mix to create stories on a grand scale. Wherever we started however, we both have ended up playing a lot of board games and dissecting them to the very core, it was a natural jump from there to game design.\nTogether we make Grimejack Games, a very new company that has one goal:\nTo make fantastic games.\nThat\u2019s it, and it\u2019s a goal born from a love of games, whether its playing them or designing them. Furthermore, we are both perfectionists in the latter, meaning that all of our games will be high quality, unique and fun.

For a more detailed overview of the game, we will be running livestream demos with open chats on YouTube. \n[May 20 (Rules Explanation + Demo)]\n[May 28, 4:30 PM EST (Sample games + Strategy)]\nYou can also read the rulebook: [PDF]\nAnd if you want, you can download a free print + play version of the game and try it out yourself! [PDF]\nSome folks have made tutorials of their own for Mottainai, from the beta. A couple of the names for things have changed, but the game is 99% the same:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNGkrzV9w4w by 3Cubed.\nThere are two versions of Mottainai available. Mottainai Mini, which contains everything you need for a 2-3 player game, or Mottainai Deluxe, which comes in a larger box with a second deck allowing you to play with 4-5 (or two side by side) 2-3 player games. \nYou'll notice that we've provided a free PDF download of the entire game, and many of you have participated in the open beta test that's been going on for the past couple months. We think Mottainai is an awesome game, and that the best way to make it the best game it can be is to have it be played a lot, both ourselves and in the wild. Feedback from everyone has helped us fine tune the cards, and we're really happy with the process. Open beta testing of tabletop games is something we're committed to, we think it's a good concept.\nGen Con 2015\nThis year at Gen Con we will again be running our event room, the Department of Fun. We're running lots of Mottainai demos, and other fun events, and you can check them out on our Department of Fun page. We're looking for more volunteers to help out, and we do have downtown hotel rooms...\nIf you'd like to pick up your game at Gen Con, pledge $20 per Deluxe, and $12 per mini and select the $1 GenCon pickup pledge level.\nAdd-ons and Additional Games\nIf you'd like to add on extra games, either Mottainai or other Asmadi Games products (and save on combined shipping!) we'll be offering that option in July when it's time to deliver. When your shipping survey comes out, there'll be a link to a special version of our web store where you can purchase games with reduced shipping as add-ons. This way you can get whatever you want, and we don't need to make 100 different custom backer levels :)\nPlease note: it will take us an extra week or two to get through processing all of the add-on orders. We do the simple ones first, because they're easy to put on an assembly line that way.\nJinro: The Next Wind Master\nDo you like free games? I think you do! We made a fun little iOS arcade style game, and you can get it for free on the app store:\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jinro-the-next-wind-master/id919720300?mt=8\nThe Tapestry card in Mottainai depicts Jinro in all his legendary glory.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project, we have the risk of issues during production, and delays due to trucks driving west instead of east, or any other number of weird unforeseen things!\n\nTo minimize these risks, we are printing Mottainai within the USA, with Delano/EPI in Michigan. They're awesome, and we're confident that they can make the game without much trouble.

Forget the $50 k Stretch Goal, we are unlocking it early anyway!  Yep!  Any backer can now add a playmat to their pledge.  Remember, you are limited to the # of copies of the game you are backing though!  If you are pledged for 4 copies of the game then YES you can add 4 playmats at $7 each (+$1 shipping to Canada, + $2 shipping Worldwide).  Yes, these are huge 20\" X 20\" playmats and yes they will retail for $15-$20 or possibly more!  100% 1.5 MM Neoprene with full color cloth top, these are of the same quality as our other mats that have been so popular like our Dead Man's Draw Mats (long sold out) and our as yet unreleased Viceroy Mats.  Come and get 'em while their hot, we expect these to sell out quickly once we release them!\nForget $50 K, this is UNLOCKED NOW! Increase your pledge for a mat now!\n\nBut why a playmat?  \nOrganized Scoring: Each player has a place on the mat to keep track of their own bark/core (up to 6 Players) Single/Double Scoring Area: Each player has a separate place on the playmat to keep their single/double point bark/core. If you use the golden Axe or have another modifier in play then you need to keep a separate pile of your \"double point\" pieces, this helps a TON!  \nNeoprene = Less Lost Pieces: The mat will be a nice bouncy/soft neoprene with a 4 inch radius around the tree that is the \"fall zone\" where most of the bark/core fall. This means less hard bouncing on the table and less pieces bouncing off the table and lost. It speeds up the game and makes game play easier on the ears! \nMore immersive to the theme: Some of you have been asking for a redesign on the base of the tree because it isn't \"tree like\" enough, but we just aren't able to do that. Instead having a \"lumberjack themed\" mat will add to the immersion of the game and hopefully combat the asthetics of a less tree-like base. \nThis playmat will be pretty large, at 20 X 20 Inches, and we will retail it for $15-20 USD or more when we release it to the general public AFTER fulfilling the KS.\nAdd Ons!\n We just had a HUGE UPDATE!  You can now back for up to 6 copies of the game, add on Bling Bling Gemstone and several other Mayday Games' Games to your rewards!  Check out all the ADD ONs and more HERE.\nWhy back now?\nThe Platinum Level filled up in less than 2 days and the GOLD LEVEL is also sold out!  Only those at the Silver Level will get the Silver Level Sticker included in their shipment, designating their copy as one of the first 1,500 released.  The sticker will be nice and shiney and hand-numbered as X of 500 Silver Level Backers!  \n Note the Silver Sticker will come with your shipment but not attached to the game, you can apply it yourself to the box, rulebook, or anywhere you want.\n                                      We really wanted to use this video as our Kickstarter video, it explains Tok Tok Woodman in typical hilarious British fashion. If you only watch one video on Youtube this year, it should be THIS, but if you watch two, well, check this out:\n Yes, take all the brilliance of this video and add in grub stickers, multi-colored bark for more scoring/variant opportunities, take out the British charm, and you have Click Clack Lumberjack!\nSo what is different?  Here is a quick summary:\n                                                  Newly redesigned and improved packaging (more like Bling Bling and the reprint of Tok Tok Woodman)\nUpdated Artwork (check out the box and instructions below)\nAdditional variants and rules for even more replay-ability.\nSmaller shelf space for more portability and travel fun\nLower MSRP than Bling Bling and significant savings to KS backers!\nStretch rewards including the much sought after Golden Axe and Golden Bark/Core Expansions AND cards like we offered our Bling Bling project backers\nThree unique colors of bark for a great 3-player game or added variability and variations of play.\nThat's right, we've taken the original Tok Tok Game, added the grub stickers and extra variants of Click Clack Lumberjack (2013 version), and thrown in the 3-player and multi-level scoring of Bling Bling Gemstone, and put it all together with brand new packaging for a comprehensive game that offers the best of all three games!\n Check out the all-new revamped rules HERE.\nThere are so many positive videos and reviews of this system already, across all 3 games, that we hardly know where to start!  Here are just a FEW of them:\nClick Clack Lumberjack Reviews:\n\"I\u2019ll just come right out and say it: this one is a must-have...  I\u2019ve played this with my kids and with hardcore strategy gamers, and it\u2019s always a blast\u2014and it\u2019s hard to play just once.  ..so it\u2019s a great party game, and it doesn\u2019t take long\" -GeekDad as originally published on Wired.com\n\"Perfect for all ages, \u201cClick Clack Lumberjack\u201d is a fun, quick party game that won\u2019t disappoint\" -Dad's Gaming Addiction and Youtube video HERE\n\"I was amazed with the components that come in the game. They are extremely high quality with very thick pieces and when you complete the tree it just looks awesome.  If you were playing this at a party or with a large group, the game play and components will draw people to the game just wondering what you are playing.  This game also works quite well with kids. My oldest is a little young for this game, but she gets the idea and finds it fun. I think kids over 5 will have a blast with this game and so will their parents.\nClick Clack Lumberjack embodies the essence of what a filler game should be. It\u2019s simple to learn, a blast to play and doesn\u2019t take the whole night to play. I honestly think that Click Clack Lumberjack needs to be available for the masses in big chain stores and would easily take the place of Jenga in my collection if I owned it. Click Clack Lumberjack is a great vertical dexterity game that you can play with people of all ages and one I think most should own.\" -BoardGameQuest.com\n\"The Child Geeks LOVED Click Clack Lumberjack and asked for it again and again. And again. We played this game a lot. To a point where everyone but the youngest of Child Geeks was tired of it. But even after playing it many times in a row, it still brought smiles, cheers, boos, and high-fives. The game was a real pleasure for the Child Geeks and it showed. They were enthusiastic, engaged, and best of all, geeking out. According to one Child Geek, \u201cTHIS IS THE GREATEST GAME EVER!!!\u201d No, it\u2019s not, but that isn\u2019t the point. The point is that Click Clack Lumberjack was approved by the Child Geeks many times over.\" -FatherGeek.com\nTok Tok Woodman Reviews\n  There are TONS and TONS of videos and reviews of this game but that is all we will show you here!\n\"No one plays this without showing some emotions. Anger, frustration, humor but most of all laughing aloud about ones own inability to get that one easy piece. One of the best starters EVER.\" -Timo Schneider, Germany\n\"10/10\"  -Matthew M Monin (Octavian on BGG), USA\n\"Get out the Hatchet and ratchet up some fun. Timber!! have some bark Buster. A great simple to play, fun filler after a heavy night of gaming.!\" -Rick Stonebraker, Fort Wayne, IN, USA\n\"This was nuts too. It involved swinging an axe and weird Jenga style goals. It was so silly it was great.\" -Sheamus Parkes on BGG, Indianapolis, IN, USA\n\n\"A really crazy little game that was a big hit with the family. A strange game that was compared to Jenga, but really that is VERY superficial. The only real similarity is that it is a column that toppling results in an end game. Mostly, you will find yourself getting only one point per turn, but my son even got two and three points. Very fun, quick and addicting. I think this will be going on the wishlist!\" -Nate Downs, Granville OH, USA\nBling Bling Gemstone Reviews\n Check out the video review from the Dice Tower above.  To summarize though, Tom Vasel says if you are going to get one version of this game, that this is the version to get as it has the most variety to game play.  We are so happy to incorporate the variety of Bling Bling with the accessibility and broad appeal of Tok Tok!\nComments from BGG:\n10/10: \"Quick to set up, quick to teach, quick to play, and very engaging and fun in such a short amount of time. I think this is going to become one of my game night staples so long as I'm gaming with people that like dexterity games.\" -Edna Lindebury, Columbus Ohio, USA\n\"Great silly fun for the whole family! My six year old girl jusr loves it. Quick gameplay and lots of tension. Only drawback is the kind of fiddly setup.\" -Andreas Josefsson, Sweden\n\"Hilarious\" -Lief Klein Konijntje, The Netherlands\n\"Neat little dexterity time that catches the eye and plays in just a few minutes. I think this will be a keeper for me, because it's so unique and charming.\" -Zee Garcia, Homestead Florida, USA\nAdditional variants and three colored bark - by very popular demand/request we are including some specially designed GRUB stickers that you can attach to the bark for lots more variation on the game. You can assign each grub to be worth double points and put them on the inside or outside of the bark if you wish, you can make a rule that any player that hits a grub piece off has to skip a turn, or hit with their other hand for a turn or two,   The grub just add more options to the game and the possibilities are extensive! \nThe best thing about Bling Bling Gemstone is the three colors of gems.  These allow for great 3-player cutthroat style games but also allow for variable scoring for each color, bringing a new element of strategy to the game.  Play the game as one point per bark and negative five points for the core, or get all mathy and score each bark color as 1, 2 and 3 points and count the core as negative 10.  Either way, you have a game that has more variants and more replayability.  \nLower MSRP and sigificant savings to KS backers - If you check our original 2011 Kickstarter you will see the lowest price point was $27 for delivery within the USA, and it went up from there.  Tok Tok retails for $25 but this new version will have to retail for $30 due to increased manufacturing costs and exchange rate issues.  The savings for you on Kickstarter are HUGE and significant!  We are pricing this as low as we possibly can to save you off of the retail price!\nStretch Rewards - We have some excellent stretch rewards as outlined below and we think they will offer all of you backers a reason to support this project, in addition to all of the goodies mentioned already. OK, so having said all that, lets face it, this is Tok Tok revisited. If you already have Tok Tok Woodman you may not need this game, but if you don't... well here is your big chance!\nSo let's face it, we have had a lot of previous KS projects and all of the games have been successful.  In fact, we've never had an unsuccessful game on Kickstarter.  You'd think by now that we would be \"set\" and not need to do such a project any more, right?  Well, not so much.  While Mayday has been successful, we are still very small.  In fact we are just a few employees.  We are a very small game company and all of our cash is tied up in other projects.  In fact if you look at our history we introduced just 3 new games in 2010 and 2011 before Kickstarter.  Since KS we have had nearly 20 new games, but that is ALL thanks to backers like you. \n                                                  By doing the KS program we are able to gauge interest and get the game made in much larger quantities and with cheaper prices to our customers.  This is a large part of why we can offer our last few KS projects at such a low price point.  With this much stuff in the game and such a small company, this would only be possible with the support of the KS community. \nPlease note that we have priced the rewards at BARE BONES pricing, we can only offer the prices here that we are by keeping the extras to a bare minimum.  Rather than jacking the price way up and throwing in \"free stuff\" we have decided to keep the price as low as possible and let you decide which extras you want in your game as add-ons for the most part.  Here are some of our initial stretch goals for this campaign:\nGoal met, we will produce the game and all backers will receive their rewards!  We really hope this will be met without any trouble as all of our previous 20+ Kickstarter Projects have been successful!   \nLimit one axe per copy of the game you pledge for, sorry, supplies are very limited!\nWe reached the $15 K stretch goal in under two days and have unlocked the much-sought after Golden Axe expansion for the game. We retail these two nifty little expansions for over $8 for the pair, but we will make them available to you backers for just $1 each, and no extra shipping charge. These two expansions are GREAT fun and add a lot to the game. You can read about them HERE and HERE.\nLimit one core per copy of the game you pledge for, sorry, supplies are very limited!\nNote: This is just a $1 add on for all 7 cards. You are limited to just one set of bonus cards per copy of the game pledged for.\n+3 Bonus Cards added to the 7 Cards from the $30 K goal. That's right, anyone pledging the extra $1 for the 7 bonus cards will ALSO get +3 more bonus cards included at no extra cost!\nRead top of campaign for why this is ALREADY unlocked!\n20 x 20 inch NEOPRENE playmat!\nThis makes 16 cards TOTAL! That's right, anyone pledging the extra $1 for the 7 Bonus cards will ALSO get all extra Bonus Cards at no extra cost!\nWe have had a LOT of you ask about adding extra copies of the game because you want more than just 1-2 copies. We have heard you! You can now pledge for up to 6 copies of the game. Keep in mind that only your FIRST copy will be the limited edition (hand numbered Sticker) version, all other copies will be standard versions. You can add extra funds to your pledges for each copy of the game you get though for more golden axes, golden core, golden bark and the cards too. You can also add one playmat per copy of the game you pledge for too! So how does it work?\nThe first and 2nd copy you could always back for at $22 per copy, plus the applicable shipping to your area ($5 shipping for the USA, $8=Canada, $12= EU, $15=Worldwide). Note the shipping is for one or two copies, so you pay no extra shipping on the 2nd copy. Any extra copies work the same way, but you pay just $20 per copy for copies 3-4 and just $19 per copy for copies 5-6. You then just add shipping at the same rate for these extra copies. Complicated? Not really, just refer to the chart below!\nJust switch your PLEDGE TOTAL (dollar value) but NOT your REWARD SELECTION accordingly!\n                                       ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis project doesn't have any risks to speak of if we meet our goal. The factory is ready to publish and the art and layout has been completed. Any additionally needed changes should be completed prior to the end of the campaign. We have launched and distributed more than 20 prior Kickstarter Projects. .\n\nAnyone missing anything at all from any prior project please send us a message here on Kickstarter and we will get you replacements sent immediately. We have had over 15,000 backers so we expect a few of you may have slipped through the cracks. Thanks again for all of the support!\n\nWe have just one undelivered KS projects at present, Viceroy, which ended in December 2013 and is a couple of months behind schedule. We expect to begin delivering Viceroy in May 2014 and get it delivered as quickly as possible. \n\nWe have just recently delivered on Hold Your Breath, Dead Man's Draw, Coconuts Duo and Chopstick Dexterity Mega Challenge 3000, all of which were late. We purposely delayed this project to be sure all these other outstanding projects were delivered.\n\nAnother recent project, Meteor, has been shipped out to all domestic and non-EU backers and the EU shipment is on the way via boat to the EU now. We expect all of the Meteor rewards to be delivered while this campaign is going on.\n\nWe have had 20 Kickstarter projects complete and note that all but these most recent are totally fulfilled and we will strive to get this project completed and all rewards to backers in a timely manner. Due to the last several projects being late, we are putting extra time into our forecast for delivery to ensure this project will NOT be delayed beyond the estimated delivery date.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Click Clack Lumberjack is back on Kickstarter as Bamboo Bash and better than ever!", "update_content": "We know you all love your dexterity games and hope you've loved Click Clack Lumberjack!

Well, community is SUPER important to us. Our Facebook group is HUGELY active, we try to meet as many players as we can, our Tournament scene is growing fast AND we release tonnes of Lore completely free of charge to ensure that Lords of War feels as full and rounded as it can be.\nWe know that mums and dads out there read our Lore to their children at bed time. How do we know? Because they have told us, and it's something we are REALLY proud of.\nPlus, this our third Kickstarter campaign, with our previous campaigns having been delivered in a few short months to lots of happy customers - we will NOT let you down!\nWe have worked REALLY hard to keep Lords of War compact, but you can expand the game to an epic scale if you want to.\nTo see how the game looks and works during a standard game then check out the Let's Play Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen video above or check out the VERY FIRST unboxing video which we recorded with prototype cards back in November 2012!\nThe key things to remember is that this isn't any kind of card game you've played before. It's NOT that mini-game from Final Fantasy VIII, it's NOT another Magic: The Gathering clone, and it's DEFINITELY not Summoner Wars.\nAll of those games are obviously awesome in their own right, but when you pick up Lords of War you are picking up something truly unique.\nMoreover, we are regular people with full time jobs who have made this game because nothing out there quite hit the spot for us.\nWe wanted a game that was SUPER easy to learn but which offers a LOT more than the big LCGs, CCGs and TCGs already out there, and Lords of War does just that.\nAside from winning the UK Games Expo Award for Best Strategic Card Game, Lords of War has been widely critically acclaimed.\nBelow we have included a number of testimonial quotes from reviews, as well as video reviews from several online magazines and reviewers:\n\"This is a great game that is perfect for first timers or hard-core gamers because of the rules, the design, the art and the fun factor. 5/5\"\n- The Geek Syndicate\n\"Plenty of tactical depth and oodles of replay value... I can quite honestly say this is one of the best-looking games you'll ever play.\"\n- Beasts of War\n\"I cannot recommend this game enough. There is a lot of depth to it and by adding in the Terrain and Weather cards you get the feel of a proper tabletop war game without the cost.\"\n- Fanplastic Little Men\n\"For me, Lords of War has provided many hours of enjoyment and continues to do so every time it is played. Monkeys With Fire highly recommends this game!\"\n- Monkeys With Fire\n\"Lords of War is a really great game and it doesn't matter whether you're a seasoned card shark or totally new to gaming. The mechanics are simple enough to learn it quickly but the strategy is complex enough to make you want to play again and again.\"\n- No Pun Included\n\"Lords of War is shaping up to be one of the best games of the year and is just starting its journey; I suggest you get on board.\"\n- Polyhedron Collider\n\"It demands a lot more thought than some games ten times the size and four times the price, but one thing you won\u2019t need to consider is whether to grab a copy or not \u2013 your answer should be a simple yes.\"\n- The Little Metal Dog Show\n\"Lords of War absolutely SHINES at what it is trying to be. The design is tight and the restraint shown to keep it simple and fast playing is to be commended.\"\n- Boardgames in Blighty\n\"There's really quite a lot to the strategy of Lords of War, even though it is pretty simple to learn. It doesn't take long. Definitely check it out. It's a fantastic game.\"\n- How Lou Sees It\nHere's a video review from GMS Magazine:\n Here's another one from Board To Death:\n And here's one from How Lou Sees It:\nThese are the things we've made to date...\nThe Lords of War \"core\" games come packaged in double-deck packs which contain two Fantasy armies illustrated by the amazing Steve Cox (Danger Mouse, Count Duckula, Roland Rat).\nAll of our decks are cross-compatible, which means you can play all the factions against one another, with each army requiring a different play-style.\nAlternatively, can actually blend the decks together using our Ranking System to deck-build a Mercenary Army that plays exactly how you want it to, without the deck becoming overpowered.\nPLUS - with the Lords of War: Magic and Monsters Expansion Packs, you can expand the Core Game to include new Unit Types in your games including new Flying Units, Monstrous Creatures and Magic Units.\nYou can ALSO add more decks to Lords of War to increase the player count and, with The Lords of War: Weather and Terrain Expansion Pack you can experiment with two new game modes.\nOooooh! Terrain Cards!!!\nOn the one hand, you can also play the Lords of War: Terrain pre-building game to create your own custom battlefields and/or you can play with the Lords of War: Weather deck to make your battles (and the game's rules) dynamically change as battles go along!\nOooooh! Weather Cards!!!\nWe have worked as hard as we can to make it as easy as possible to support Lords of War - no matter where in the world you live!\nTo support us, you must first SELECT THE RIGHT PLEDGE LEVEL for you by picking one of the REWARD OPTIONS from the right hand side of the page.\nBut don't click that Pledge Level quite yet!\nNOTE: THERE ARE NO HIDDEN OR ADDITIONAL SHIPPING COSTS FOR THIS CAMPAIGN!\nYou should SECONDLY calculate the cost of any of our additional ADD-ONS (see the details below) some of which are Kickstarter Exclusive.\nFinally, you should then calculate the TOTAL COST of your Pledge, click the correct Pledge Level for you, and then enter the right amount for that Pledge Level PLUS any of the Add-Ons you have selected.\nOnce the campaign is over, and provided we fund (oh man, we hope we fund...)

Hop, hop. Brrrruum!!!\nAs soon as we cleared 250 Backers, EVERYONE who backs the campaign at the 'Give Me The New Thing' Level or above will get Kickstarter Exclusive General \"The Easter Bunny\" (who is obviously REALLY angry that we didn't launch the campaign in March...)\nHave you backed at \u00a310+?

As with all Lords of War core decks, the game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies - the Orcs and the Dwarves.\nThe Dwarves are a feisty race full of guts and rebellious tendencies. As a Faction in Lords of War, they are a great place to start, benefitting from fair amounts of defence, a balance of different card types and attacks that pack a lot of punch.\nThe Orcs meanwhile are a pretty foul and rowdy bunch. As a Lords of War Faction, they are all about sneaky attacks in which they deal tonnes of damage \u2013 and they actively enjoy sacrificing lots of Goblins along the way\u2026\nLords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen\nLike its predecessor Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves, Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen is a dual-deck strategic card game for two-plus players. It won the UK Games Expo Award for Best Strategic Card Game in 2013, the year of its release.\nIn terms of how they play, the Elves' deadly Archer and Cavalry Units form an exciting play style which is all about flexibility, light armour and cunning.\nAs for the Lizardmen, they are a wild and wily collection of vicious, cold-blooded beasts. Brightly coloured and extremely eye-catching, playing Lizardmen can often require some sleight of hand...\nLords of War: Templars versus Undead\nThe third in the Lords of War: Fantasy Battles series, Lords of War: Templars versus Undead was funded on Kickstarter and was released in May 2014. It was a nominee for the UK Games Expo Award for Best Expansion Pack last year, along with The Lords of War: Weather and Terrain Expansion Pack.\nAs for play styles, the Templars are a great deck for beginners. They are tough as old boots and have plenty of card-types which deal heavy damage!\nThe Undead meanwhile are gruesome, mean and cold to the touch, providing an awesome combination of multi-directional attacking cards, Moving Units and deadly Cavalry.\nLords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves 2 - The Magic and Monsters Expansion Pack\nThis game-changing expansion was brought into existence at the end of last year by our AMAZING Kickstarter supporters.\nAs well as expanding Army Decks to 54 cards, this expansion introduced new rules, units, unique spells and special abilities to the the Orcs and the Dwarves, including Fire and Ice-themed magic spells and LOTS more!\nLords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen 2 - The Magic and Monsters Expansion Pack\nThis is the reason we need your support - we are trying to fund this brand new expansion pack with this campaign. so please spread the word. Every penny matters!\nLike the previous Magic and Monsters Expansion Pack, this set will expand the Elves and Lizardmen decks to 54 cards while introducing new rules, units, unique spells and special abilities to the game, including Air and Poison-themed magic spells...\nHello there, new things!\n\nHere we have 4 Spells. On the left, the Elves have the blue shimmery ones while the Lizardmen have the freaky, psychedelic ones.\nThe Elves spells are:\nBless\n(The top left symbol) - When an Elven Mage Unit casts Bless, he casts a token onto an allied Ranged Unit. That Bless token enables that Ranged Unit to either Fire Twice in one turn or Fire Once even if engaged by an enemy Unit.\nPoison\n(The top right symbol) - When a Lizardmen Mage Unit casts Poison, they infect one enemy for 1 Damage. Once that enemy dies, that Poison spreads to all of their allied Units along any connecting Attack Arrows.\nAir Damage\n(The bottom left symbol) - When an Elven Mage Unit casts Air Damage, that Mage leaves 1 Air Damage token on an enemy card, effectively reducing their Shield Value by 1. Air Damage can be stacked and, like all Spells, can target Flying Units.\nParalyze\n(The bottom right symbol) - When a Lizardmen Mage Unit casts Paralyze, they effectively immobilize an enemy card. The Spell prevents that card from Moving (even via Berserking) or Retreating. \nAs was the case with the Orcs and Dwarves, the Elves and Lizardmen can cancel out or 'Cure' each others' Spells - HOWEVER - Orc and Dwarf spells cannot be cured by the Elves or the Lizardmen, and vice versa...\nAccessory Add Ons!\nThe Lords of War Custom Deck Card Tin!\nPerfectly sized to fit a fully expanded and sleeved custom Lords of War deck PLUS your Spell Tokens!

We love playing these games because they have a great theme and the storyline is different with each game play depending on where the mechanic of the game takes us. The games come with standard D6 dice among other components which is nice and all, but there is also a \"flaw\" with that. Why? A large portion of the game is based on rolling dice to complete tests, and the result of each test is primarily binary - either a success or a fail. So we thought that a dice with a simple indication of success and failure makes more sense rather than a standard D6. This is what we called our \"Dice Dilemma\"  \nHow many success is that?\nOur simplest solution to address the dice dilemma was to just purchase the official dice (ones that did not come with the original game). However, the official dice are still not 100% clear and you need to purchase 3 times the number of dice to have enough dice for the different status conditions. Additionally, the official dice were impossible to get as they are constantly out of stock, which added to the challenge.\nAfter doing all of this, we had this brilliant idea of designing and making our own dice to address our dice dilemma once and for all. \nThe solution - Introducing the Cucu Dice\nA one-size-fits-all solution for Lovecraftian themed Eldritch and Arkham games or any other games that require D6 dice roll for binary resolutions.\nNew Dice Layout\n   (Thanks everyone, especially KassFlak, for pitching in on the layout update)\nFirst Set of Samples (Sorry about the bad lighting)\nThe Cucu dice can be used for any game that requires the player to roll a D6 to produce a success/failure result from each dice. It is an all-in-one solution to clearly indicate the success and failure of dice tests. However, the main design was focused on performing attribute tests in Lovecraftian themed Arkham or Eldritch games. \nHow the CuCu Dice Works\nRoll xD6, 1 out 6 Chance for Success (For example, Roll for 6)\nSimply roll x number of the Cucu Dice, and count the number of Red Die Faces for the number of Successes.\n Roll xD6, 2 out 6 Chance for Success (For example, Roll for 5, 6)\nSimply roll x number of the Cucu Dice, and count the number of Green Die Faces for the number of Successes.\n Roll xD6, 3 out 6 Chance for Success (For example, Roll for 4, 5, 6)\nSimply roll x numbers of the Cucu Dice, and count the number of Blue Die Faces for the number of Successes.\n Other Rare Situations:\nAdd 1 to the result of a die\nSimply roll x numbers of the Cucu Dice, and count the number Successes as listed above. Then look at the corresponding coloured number on the non-success dice to and add 1 to the appropriate number. \nOn the corners of each face of the dice are number indicators, which allows bonus addition if certain condition permits. They are color coded to match the colored face you are rolling for. However, they are also small enough to not distract from the main design on the dice, which is what you will be paying attention to 99% the time. \nRoll xD6, 4 out 6 Chance for Success\nSimply roll x numbers of the Cucu Dice, and count the number of Non-Green Die Faces for the number of Successes.\nRoll xD6, 5 out 6 Chance for Success\nSimply roll x numbers of the Cucu Dice, and count the number of Non-Red Die Faces for the number Success.\nExample of a Roll 6D6, Success on 5 or 6 (rolling green):\nSample Dice Toss\nAbout the CuCu Dice\nThe dice will be produced on a 16MM black plastic dice base. \nThe side will be laser engraved to prevent the design from fading over time, maximizing dice longevity. \nThe dice face will have flat edges rather than traditional round edges to maximize design area (we want and you know you also want the largest possible picture on each dice face). \nRewards\nCucu Dice (1 set) $10 CAD (\u2248$8 USD) + Shipping: For ~$8 USD*, you will receive one full set of 10 beautifully crafted Standard Cucu Dice + 1x any unlocked stretch goals. \nCucu Dice (2 sets) $19 CAD (\u2248$15 USD) + Shipping: For ~$15 USD*, you will receive two full set of 10 beautifully crafted Standard Cucu Dice (20) + 2x any unlocked stretch goals.\nCucu Dice (3 sets) $28 CAD (\u224822 USD) + Shipping: For ~$22 USD*, you will receive three full set of 10 beautifully crafted Standard Cucu Dice (30) + 3x any unlocked stretch goals.\nCucu Dice (4 sets) $36 CAD (\u2248$28.5 USD) + Shipping: For ~$28.5 USD*, you will receive four full set of 10 beautifully crafted Standard Cucu Dice (40) + 4x any unlocked stretch goals.\nCucu Dice (5 sets) $44 CAD (\u2248$34.5 USD) + Shipping: For ~$34.5 USD*, you will receive five full set of 10 beautifully crafted Standard Cucu Dice (50) + 5x any unlocked stretch goals.\n* Conversion Rate is as of March 30th, 2015.

We had a great campaign, but you can still get in on all the Vault Wars auction action. Click here for more info on where to find Vault Wars now that the project is closed!\n--\nWhen heroes are slain, their treasure-filled storage vaults are abandoned and put up for auction. As an aspiring hero, you must outbid your opponents to win these auctions and acquire the gear you need. Will you triumph by collecting a chest of gems and artifacts, or go home with a trunk full of junk? Outbid, out-bluff, and master the auctions to be victorious in Vault Wars.\nWelcome\nHello, and welcome! We're Floodgate Games, the publisher of titles such as Legacy: Gears of Time and Epic Resort and we're so glad you're checking out our newest game!\nWithout skipping a beat from his success with Dead of Winter, we're incredibly excited to work with such a talented game designer as Jon Gilmour to publish his next game. It's been over two years in the making, and we're excited to have you join us in making this game a reality.\nBreak out your gavel, dust off your lock-box and get ready for action-packed auctions in Vault Wars!\nVault Wars is a tabletop auction game of bidding and bluffing for 3-5 players that plays in less than an hour. (There's a 2-player variant, too!) Check out the rule book, or follow the overview below:\nSetup\nPlayers are each given starting Gold, and two (secret) Aspiring Hero cards that give bonuses for finding specific kinds of items.\nVault cards are drafted before gameplay begins.\nGameplay\nEach round, players secretly select one Vault, revealing them simultaneously. Each Vault provides a unique experience, introducing new ways for the players to bid.\nTaking turns as the Auction Master, players lead a cut-throat bidding war to selling off their Vault's items to the other players.\nBidding\nPlayers bid until 1 player is the winner -- paying the Auction Master and gaining the Vault's Items.\nCollect gems for massive Victory Points, Weapons to gain a pile of Gold, or rare Artifacts to gain powerful abilities. In addition to valuable Items, there's lots of junk to fool your opponents into bidding on.\nSelling Items\nAfter all selected Vaults have been auctioned off, players may sell their items to gain Gold, or save them for Victory Points -- paying storage fees to keep them around. Players who are short on Gold can visit the Loan Shark, gaining Gold and taking a Corruption Token (worth negative Victory Points).\nEnd of Game\nThe player with the most victory points from Items and one Aspiring Hero after all the auctions will be the winner!  \nSide Note: Vault Wars is a standalone game thematically set in the same fantasy world as our previous game Epic Resort; you don't need to have any experience with Epic Resort to enjoy Vault Wars.\n We'll be releasing reviews over the first week or so of the campaign to help give each reviewer some time in the spotlight. Below you'll find some of our favorite reviewers -- if you enjoy what they do please be sure to let them know!\n\"This game is a really, really clever design... this is something that you're going to want to play with a lot of people, just because it's so cool and fun\" \nGameplay Runthrough\n Final Thoughts\nMore Rahdo Videos: 2 Player Variant Extended Gameplay\n \"There are so many things I like about this game... for a game that has some really basic mechanisms it's got a lot going for it.

Vault Wars challenges players to interact, with everyone possessing different amounts of hidden information, and yet it isn't a deduction game. It also encourages players to bluff and deceive their competition, and yet it isn't a game about lying. Instead, Vault Wars weaves seemingly disparate mechanics together in a way that\u2019s both psychologically and mechanically engaging.\"\nKickstarter Tabletop Alert -  \"I\u2019m impressed with the amount of game packed into a pretty simple set of components.

I thought the that inclusion of hidden information was a great twist that can sometimes pay dividends\u2026 or come back to bite you in the butt.\nVault Wars ended up being a fun game with a lot of creative twists on the auction genre. I think that the play time hits the sweet spot\"\nI Slay The Dragon\nEVERYTHING MUST GO! - \"Vault Wars also has a pleasantly high replay value for a design of its style, type, length, and depth .... If you like or enjoy bidding games, Vault Wars is right in your wheelhouse.  What\u2019s more though, it offers a few sophisticated, but not overly complex, aspects that will appeal more broadly.  It might not be filler material, but it\u2019s neither time consuming nor mentally investing.  It provides just enough challenge and has a fun thematic application that it should find plenty of space on many a different table.\"\nBoard Games with Flartner\nPreview - \"Vault Wars is a pretty simple game, but definitely does a lot of things right. It has a basic structure, and then adds to that structure in interesting ways by having the vaults change how much information players have and how the auctions work\"\n3D rendering of the box and components\nEach copy of Vault Wars will be packed with high quality components: thick punchboards for tokens, 280 GSM cards (STRETCH REWARD UPGRADE: 300 GSM Linen Finish) and a strong, portable box.

It's an exciting time for us as gamers with so many unique and interesting games, and I'm honored to have you consider Vault Wars as one of those options. Here are just a few reasons why we feel this project is worth your support.\nFast Moving and Fun - The rhythm of Vault Wars is quick to learn, and the thematic elements tie closely to their game impact; helping you stay focused on having fun and keeping an eye on your tricky opponents.\nUnique Auction Mechanics - Variable bidding rules, partial information on Vault contents and pay-the-player are all combined into a streamlined package that keeps your whole group engaged at every turn.\nYou're helping Independent Game Design and Publishing - Everything you see in this project is the product of a massive effort by several passionate, independent creators. The efforts that went into the game design, illustration, graphic design publishing are all crafted by individuals who absolutely love our hobby. Without you, we wouldn't be able to bring these creations to life!\nAs a backer, you have the chance to make it in the game! We're including a unique line of flavor text on all 30 of the Junk cards, and we want YOU to help pick what makes it on the cards.\nHere's how it works:\n1. Become a backer of Vault Wars (any level is fine)\n2. Go here to find the backers-only submission link.\n3. Vote on the submissions each week during the campaign. The best text will make it in the game!\nBackers help decide the flavor text for Junk cards!\nTo keep our costs low, we honed the game components into the smallest set possible without compromising gameplay. With your support, we'll hit our initial funding goal and we'll be able to publish a great game. \nIf we exceed that goal (Edit: WE DID, thank you!), it gets even better for everyone! We're excited to see how far this project can go and just how much great additional content and upgrades we can fit in the box for you!\nVault Wars works great as a pure auction game, but sometimes you need a little help finding the right gear... naturally you'll hire some workers!\nWith the worker expansion, a market full of skillful helpers are available to be hired each round. Every worker provides a unique ability that will give you an advantage during the game, but hiring them will cost you gold! The longer a worker goes un-hired, the cheaper they get... but don't wait too long or your opponents will snap them up first!\nIf you help spread the word about the Vault Wars Kickstarter project and we can reach our stretch goals -- including the Worker Expansion in every copy of the game!!

This time round we are giving you the option to upgrade your shipping if you wish. See 'Shipping' in the main description above for the link to full details of the service and additional cost.\n\nIf You Change Your Address\nWe'll be asking for your address details in the survey. If you change your address at a later date then let us know as soon your new address is known to you. It's important we get this information before we begin to ship (we will give you a heads up before we begin shipping). If we have to ship your goods twice due to a change of address we will have to charge you a second shipping cost before we send your rewards again.\n\nCustom Cards\nPlease note that custom cards may differ slightly in final colours when compared to the cards in the faction decks. This is an unavoidable part of the printing process.

I would really like to market my first board game.  But more like the Role playing game which people can play  and figure out how they will achieve their goals with their characters. \nThe following things I would like to do to really get this project started.\nBoard game Description:\nAn Island game played by each player.  Everybody will have a mission to complete depending on the character they play. \nStory goes like this:\nA bunch of survivors airplane crash landed on the island.  They suddenly found themselves stranded but they were not alone.  During their survival journey they realized they have to survive against two rival parties.  As you play a character in this game, each of the character has an objective.  You will face harsh events where your survival skills will be tested.  Pick up items to aid you in this journey as you will need to  complete your mission before the other party does.\nSurvivor - must try to find ways to escape the island.  Survivors goal is to work together to ensure their survival and escape the Pirates and indigenous.  Pirates will rob the survivors treasure while indigenous will use them as sacrifice. \nPirates - They are treasure hunters.  Pirates believe there is treasure on the island.  Their goal is to find number of treasure pieces which belongs to the indigenous.  Pirates are very powerful and they have battleships along the coast.  However their weakness is that they are unable to use traps in which survivors and indigenous uses.  \nIndigenous - The God's have been displeased that the totem has been lost.  The Totem is made of golden material which is extremely valuable for pirates.  However the items were lost and to satisfy their God's, they must make sacrifice until the curse is lifted.  They can hunt either the survivors or pirates to achieve their goal.\nYour character will be unknown to each other in the beginning until you start using items.  The each character will have their own advantage and disadvantages.  The island has many tunnels and event trigger which will test the survival of each parties. \nIn this game there will be many items to collect.  However only one group out of the three can achieve victory.  They can only achieve victory by reaching their goal or collecting enough treasure points, or items which will aid in their escape. \nWhat I need to complete this game:\nAn Artist  - Budget $1000\nModel designer (for tokens) - $2000\nCard Designer- $ 2000\nBoard - $3000 \nPrinting cost would be approximately $\nMy Goal is to print 100 of these for the market and testing. \nAnd venue to test the board game such as Meet up groups.\nI really like you to be part of my exciting adventure as I believe this board game will help challenge each and every one of you.  I plan to build more board games in the future however this would be my first one and I believe with adequate funding.  I will be able to spend more time and resource designing this.  I wish you all the best :).  Thank you for your support. As we go along I will provide more incentives and for those who provide bigger donations. \nCharles Lee", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk:\n\nFinding enough people who will want to play this exciting game\n\nChallenge\n\nFinding the right people and admin to help me develop this board game. I need to find people with certain expertise and also the right manufacturer. I will also need to find market and test them out. I have only tested the board game with a few people. Most of them find it interesting to play (honest feedback only). I will invite you to try this board game once I have a bigger picture how it works with very few people. \n\nI also have a vision of putting something like this online.

Learn more about us on www.lords-of-war.com!\nVery excitingly, we have recently done deals with Heidelberger Spielverlag in Germany and ACD Distribution in the United States, with the German Language version of Lords of War having been released on Thursday last week.\nThe German Edition had SOLD OUT by the Saturday of the world's largest game show - The Spiel - which happened last weekend. We were there and had a great time!!\nOur busy booth at The Spiel. See a full gallery of photos on https://www.facebook.com/BBG.lordsofwar\nWe also attended WynterCon in Eastbourne in the UK from Friday 31st October-Sunday 2nd November. If you came along and met us, THANK YOU - and if you were one of the people who pushed us over the 100% Funded line, THANK YOU SO SO SO MUCH!!!\nOur team of AMAZING volunteers.\nUp until now, every Lords of War game has been designed to work on its own, completely independently of the others, although you have always been able to play any of the armies against one another or mix the decks up to build balanced Mercenary armies!\nWith Lords of War: Magic and Monsters, we're adding a HUGE amount of new stuff to Lords of War in the form of our first full Deck Expansions!\nIf you know the game, you're going to love what we have planned. If you've never heard of us, now is the time to jump on board!\nWhat are we offering?\nOur first objective was to fund the first Lords of War: Magic and Monsters game THIS HAS BEEN ACHIEVED!!!

I'm new to the game! Explain the core Lords of War mechanic in 10 seconds!\nSee this diagram?\nThe full rules are also available through the Lords of War pages on Board Game Geek.\nSee how every card has a shield containing a Defence Value?\nSee how each card has a series of numbers in their Attack Arrows on the edges or corners?\nPlayers play one card at a time from their hand, using their cards' Attack Arrows to exceed the Defence Value on their opponent's cards.\nIn the above example, the Orc Butcher is DEAD (4 from the Chariot + 1 from the Spearman = 5 against the Orc Butcher's 4 Defence).\nThat's the mechanic in 10 seconds.\nThere's a lot more to the game, including special rules for Berserker, Spear, Ranged, Cavalry, Magic, Monstrous and Flying Units, but that's the absolute basics. \nLearn more about what these symbols mean on our website, www.lords-of.war.com!\nTry checking out these Rules Videos for a full explanation!\nIs Lords of War any good?\nSo far, Lords of War has won the award for Best Strategic Card Games at the UK Games Expo - the UK's largest gaming convention - as well as being reviewed very positively by several websites and magazines.\nClick on the following names to read some reviews from these reputable websites - The Geek Syndicate, Beasts of War, Polyhedron Collider, The Little Metal Dog Show and Boardgames in Blighty.\nHere is a review video from Board To Death:\nHere's another from GMS Magazine:\nHere's a brilliant Lords of War bit from Board With Life:\nAnd here are some testimonial quotes:\n\"This is a great game that is perfect for first timers or hard-core gamers because of the rules, the design, the art and the fun factor. 5/5\"\n- The Geek Syndicate\n\"Plenty of tactical depth and oodles of replay value... I can quite honestly say this is one of the best-looking games you'll ever play.\"\n- Beasts of War\n\"Lords of War, is a really great game and it doesn't matter whether you're a seasoned card shark or totally new to gaming. The mechanics are simple enough to learn it quickly but the strategy is complex enough to make you want to play again and again.\"\n- No Pun Included\n\"Lords of War is shaping up to be one of the best games of the year and is just starting its journey; I suggest you get on board.\"\n- Polyhedron Collider\n\"It demands a lot more thought than some games ten times the size and four times the price, but one thing you won\u2019t need to consider is whether to grab a copy or not \u2013 your answer should be a simple yes.\"\n- The Little Metal Dog Show\n\"Lords of War absolutely SHINES at what it is trying to be. The design is tight and the restraint shown to keep it simple and fast playing is to be commended.\"\n- Boardgames in Blighty\n\"Lords of War has consistently improved with each new army and now with this set they have issued a loud challenge to all would be contenders.\"\n- Who Dares Rolls\nWhat new Unit Types will be introduced in this edition?\nGhalt, the continent over which the Orcs and Dwarves are warring...\nAlongside more of the Unit Types and Ranks you know and love, we are introducing some new mechanics to Lords of War which are well and truly game-changing!\nLords of War: Magic and Monsters ALSO adds Moving Units into the armies which did not have them before, starting with - of course - the Orcs and Dwarves!\nMagic Units\nMagic Units are a major addition to Lords of War - not least because they introduce Tokens to the game!\nEach Lords of War Faction contains multiple Magic Units in its Magic and Monsters Expansion, with each Faction having unique spells that only they can cast.\nFor the Dwarves for example, harnessing the Icy Winds of the North, their Magic Units can either deal +1 Ice Damage to their foes (Damage which lingers, even if the Magic Unit Retreats or is Eliminated) or they can cast +1 Shield onto allied Units!\nThe Orc Magic Units meanwhile can cast +1 Fire Damage or they ALSO have the power to turn ANY Orc Unit into a Berserker, enabling them to rampage across the battlefield and achieve multi-elimination combos!\nMagic Units with Ranged capability have another MAJOR advantage: they can Fire even if Engaged!\n*Note: Magic Units can deal Ranged damage *OR* cast a spell in their turn, not both!\nHere's a Tutorial Video:\nMonstrous Units\nMonstrous Units bring a whole new level of strategic thinking to Lords of War. Not only can they all Move but, as you can see, they also have a Monstrous Defence Value.\nThe trick with the Monstrous Defence is that no Attack Arrow which deals EQUAL OR LESS THAN a Monstrous Unit's Monstrous Defence can damage that Monstrous Unit.\nWeaker Units might be able to Engage them but your heavy damage Units will be needed to actually Eliminate them.\nYou'll now need to really think twice before you play out your high damage Units!\nHere's a Tutorial Video!\nFlying Units\nFlying Units are crafty creatures primarily used to interrupt your opponent's strategies.\nWhat makes them unique is that, despite having low Shield Values, they can ONLY be damaged or Engaged by Ranged Units or other Flying Units.\nThey may seem small but they are MAJOR pests!\nHere's a Tutorial Video!\nOrc Mage Command Card Xnurl Firebelly, now in colour. He's disgustingly beautiful!!!\nWhat else is new?\nRagar Icebone - one of the new Dwarf Command Cards.\nIn addition to the above, each Faction will also be given more Special Units, more Elite Units, more Command Cards *AND* players will now hold 7 rather than 6 cards in their hand.\nThe Victory Conditions for Lords of War matches also change with the inclusion of Lords of War: Magic and Monsters:\n- With your deck expanded to 54 cards, players now need to take 30 cards to win a match!\n- With 8 Command Cards now in the deck, players now need to Eliminate 6 enemy Command Cards in order to earn a Command Card Victory!\nAnd now let's take a closer look at those T-Shirts...\nSo, \u00a316,000 is the new goal... will you help us make this happen?!?!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe're trying to get Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves 2 out in time for Christmas.

It will contain four pads of 10 double-sided sheets each with the following artwork:\nDice in the final version will be silkscreened.\nThe final dice will be silkscreened (colors printed on the flat die faces) instead of molded (colors applied into indentations on the die faces) due to the cost and complexity of creating molded dice with six different colors of ink on each die.

Your Heroes battle in the GALACTIC ARENA: an organized spectacle that is broadcast for the entertainment of the populace all over the galaxy.\nBefore the game starts, players secretly customize their Heroes.

CLICK HERE to join our newsletter for updates and reminders so you don't miss the next one!\nThe retail versions of Hostile Intent and Hidden Agenda will be available in stores by late November.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Resistance gets even bigger with a special edition expansion that combines the two upcoming Resistance expansions (Hidden Agenda & Hostile Intent) and includes promo items that won't be included in the retail versions.  One box - eight new ways to play!\nNew \"You are Awesome\" rewards added - CLICK HERE or HERE for details.\nAvalon & 1st edition compatibility questions? - CLICK HERE for answers.\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce these exciting expansions for all the fans of our hugely successful game: The Resistance.  The expansions include several different module rules that can be mixed and matched, so the permutations of how you can play is practically limitless.. A copy of Resistance is required to play these expansion modules.\nNew to The Resistance?\nThe Resistance was Indie Boards and Cards' first break through success when released in 2010.   The game is now available in over 20 different languages and enjoyed around the world.  The best way to experience understand this simple, but immensely enjoyablegame of deception and deduction is to watch it in play.  Wil Wheaton's TableTop episode featuring The Resistance is an excellent way to experience this game for the first (or thousandth time):\nYou will be able to add The Resistance to your rewards after the project ends.  More details can be found in the \"add-on\" section below.\nHostile Intent\nBoth the retail and kickstarter editions of Hostile Intent will include the Hunter, Inquisitor and Reverser modules:\nHunter Module: The battle between resistance and imperial has become more intense.  It is no longer enough to target facilities in missions - the target has become personal as both sides look to neutralize their opponent's leaders.  In this module both the resistance and spies must identify a specific individual among the opposing team to win.  Hunters introduces many new game concepts that bring a whole new level of deduction and deceit into The Resistance.\nReverser Module: Reversers have the ability to change the results of any mission \u2013 in the hands of the resistance this can make a doomed mission succeed, or turn certain victory into defeat. A very interesting and potentially chaotic twist that is certain to change your meta game forever.\nInquisitor Module: The Inquisitor is an optional player ability first seen in Avalon. The player with the Inquisitor will be able to look at the affiliation of another player and is a simple way to ensure every game is full of interest twists and turns as the Inquisitor uncovers the truth (at least their version of the truth).\n\nHidden Agenda\nBoth the retail and kickstarter editions of Hidden Agenda will include the Assassin, Defector and Trapper modules:\nAssassin Module:  Every since we announced The Resistance: Avalon the request has been to take the exciting new roles from Avalon and make them available for The Resistance.  We are very excited to now make that available - the Assassin module of Hidden Agenda contains all the Avalon roles, rethemed and renamed to fit into The Resistance Universe.\nDefector Module: Two variants in one, the Defectors were included as part of the Avalon promos.  In one variant, the Defectors can switch allegiance during the game - ensuring that players are never quite certain who to trust.  In the second variant version the two Defectors know each other - ensuring that the accusations of deceit begin from the very opening of the game.\nTrapper Module: Every proposed Mission Team includes an extra person that won't go on the mission.  The leader will isolate a team member and watch their every move - making sure they can't make the mission fail. If you are a spy on the Mission Team, you\u2019ll never know if you will cause a mission to fail or simply be giving your identity away. But resistance members will have to approve some missions knowing that a spy is on them and trust that the leader chooses to isolate the spy.\nKickstarter Edition Promos:\nNot included in either the retail versions of Hostile Intent or Hidden Agenda are the Rogue Agent and Sergeant Modules.\nRogue Agent Module: Rogue Agents march to a different drum, whether Spy or Resistance they have their own victory conditions and would rather win by themselves than see their side victorious. Rogues are the first players in The Resistance that have a unique victory condition and are very interesting play option.\nSergeant Module:  First seen in the Avalon promo as Excalibur, the Sergeant is designated by the leader with ability to change mission results.  A very tricky proposition and sure to have everyone second guessing when to use, and when to just threaten with this ability.\nWhat more than one?\nEach pledge level has text that says \"Add $x for each additional copy\", increase your pledge amount by x to get a second copy of the Hidden Agenda & Hostile Intent Kickstarter Edition (yes, that does include the promo items). For example - if you are in the US and want 2 copies, select the $20 level and pledge $36.\nEssen Pick up\nOur plan is to have Hostile Intent & Hidden Agenda Kickstarter edition ready in time for Essen. It may be the case that we have games at Essen several weeks before the kickstarter backer copies are sent. It may also be the case that we are unable to get games to Essen in time. If you want Essen pick up - DO NOT PLEDGE FOR THIS PROJECT - all you have to do is sign up for our Essen email list by giving an email address: http://eepurl.com/RzQE9. Shortly before Essen we will ask you what you would like to pre-order for Thursday pick up at Essen. All the specials & promo items will be available - your support is very valuable to Indie Boards and Cards and we look forward to seeing you again this year with lots of great new games.\nAdd-ons\nAs a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Hostile Intent & Hidden Agenda Kickstarter Edition. After this project is closed, we will open Add-ons via paypal for backers. DO NOT ADD $ TO YOUR PLEDGE FOR ADD-ONS. Add-ons are for retail editions of the games listed below (no promos included) and will be sent with your rewards from this project (in November). All of these games are available right now at your local game store:\nThe Resistance\nThe Resistance: Avalon\nCoup\nCoup: Reformation (Coup Expansion) \nFlash Point Fire Rescue\nUrban Structures (Flash Point Expansion)\n2nd Story (Flash Point Expansion)\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion)\nDangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansion)\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion)\nSnowdonia Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington (Snowdonia Expansion)\nHaggis\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 I am very excited about this special edition of the expansion - I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.  \nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, a bad thing for a small company.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio.   Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards currently has two other projects that are due to be shipped in August 2014 (Coup Reformation & Dragon Slayer). Those games have already been produced and are on ship heading to distribution centers before being sent out to backers.\n\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the expansions - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #26", "update_userinfo": "Resistance App Testing - Friday June 17th 4pm to 7pm at the Origins Game Fair", "update_content": "Testers wanted!\nWe are getting closer to the release of the Resistance App, and we'd like our backers to have the first look and help us test this ground breaking app. When we first discussed the app, I imagine that most everyone was thinking it would be a simple \"announcer\" - but I had always wanted more than that.\nThe Resistance app that we've been developing has an announcer - but it also allows you to play the entire game on your mobile devices.

There is plenty of opportunity for strategising\u201d\nWho Dares Rolls:\n\u201cHad I not sat down and given this a try I would have missed out on a brilliant strategic yet deceptively simple little card game. I loved this\"\nStak Bots LIVE\nI am currently working with a new development team to bring you the all-new incarnation of the Stak Bots video game! \nIt will be coming to Android, IOS and Facebook; if we raise enough money, also to PC/Mac and hopefully onto Steam. I'm aiming to be able to release it as a free game, which will mean more players so less waiting time for online match-ups! \nUse the effects and abilities of 50+ uniquely functioning Bot cards to destroy your opponent's army. The vertical gameplay allows you to setup chaotic combinations as you play, scrap and attack with your Bots; a fully open turn structure allows you to push your luck, or hold back and wait on the luck of the draw. \n(If you want to know more about the Stak Bots battling robots card game, or to get your hands on physical copies of the original and expansion sets, head to www.stakbots.com. You might also want to look at the previous kickstarter I ran for the physical expansion pack). \nYou can also try out the great existing asynch app on IOS to get an idea of where we're building from. Ipadboardgames.org's review gave the following verdict on it:\n\"7/10 \"(user score currently 8.2/10)\" An ideal starter game to bring younger gamers into the thrilling world of deck building. Good fun for all the family, but more seasoned players may soon lose interest. Fun graphics, a solid implementation, and lots of potential.\"\nWe're looking to fulfil that potential with Stak Bots LIVE, as well as provide plenty of replayability and features for the seasoned players! \nThe new game will be absolutely packed with features. We have worked very hard to cram as much in as possible, providing a lot of ways to play with oodles of replayability. We are aiming for release in October 2014. As the development progresses I will update the project! \nFeatures:\nLive online play (2-player) across different devices and a multitude of AI levels\nMulti-Stak and Single-Stak play to suit different levels of complexity\n50+ unique Bots, each with their own way of functioning\nCreate your own custom decks using the rank-building system; battle them against your friends' decks online, or against the AI decks\nReactive play - a game mode that allows you to play cards to defend against attacks\nRandom and endless AI levels for repeat play! Use your custom decks to try and progress further against each AI deck in endless mode!\nCrusade mode (AI and PVP) - Win as many matches as you can in a row against different opponents using the same deck; how good is your army of Bots?! \nAn interactive tutorial to ease you into the game\nLeaderboards and lots of achievements!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nDeveloping a game like this is very expensive; I have put in everything I have and am still coming up a little short! I was lucky enough to have a lot of support last year with the Kickstarter for the first expansion pack, so I'm hoping we can do it again!\nThere is a lot of time and effort going into making this video game amazing;  I'm trying to include a lot of the flexibility that makes the physical card game so versatile. Hitting our goal would mean we don't have to cut any corners because of a lack of funds and that the game can be finished soon, rather than at some unspecified time in the future! Hitting the stretch goals below would mean more functionality and more platforms! \nStretch Goals:\n\u00a32000 Making it this far means bluetooth will be added; play against nearby friends while offline! \n\u00a33000 If we hit this, then the game can be released for desktop as well! This will allow us to pitch through Steam's greenlight system to hopefully get released on there!\nAdditionally, every \u00a3500 over the goal will mean a new Bot being added to the game! \nThe Rewards:\nPlease take a look at the rewards on the right, pledge your support and help develop this game. As ever, there is a lot in the Stak Bots pipeline and having this project succeed will get us to our next goal that bit sooner!\n\u00a310 t-shirts!!!\nIf you'd like to add a t-shirt onto your pledge at any level, please add just \u00a310 (this includes postage in the UK. Add an extra \u00a35 for postage outside the UK), then message me to let me know! \nThe t-shirt will look like the image below (subject to final revision and with the silhouetted Bots revealed of course!). They're good quality Fruit of the Loom heavy cotton unisex tops. Adult chest size available from 35\" up to 52\". Children's sizes available as well. \nThe new Bots:\nThis is the biggest collection of Bots ever assembled! As we progress towards our goal, the newest Bots making their debut appearance in this game will be revealed! Every \u00a3100 raised will reveal the next Bot and what they do! \nWe've had a lot of fun play-testing these little guys; there are some game-changing entry effects, new damage and passive abilities, as well as a few combined ability cards! It also has my favourite card of all, the most chaotic Bot ever designed :) If you want to see these Bots in action, then please, please back the project!\nAvalanche Bot\nAvalanche Bot is pure chaos; it places a new card from the supply pile onto every single Stak when it enters! \nMace Bot\nMace Bot shows how much bad can happen when you give a tiny little Bot a giant weapon! When it damages a card, it will bash it and then also spike it!! Horrific. Goodbye Stak. \nShark Bot\nShark Bot uses its natural ability to seek out and destroy a damaged Bot on entry. It doesn't matter who it belongs to, it will happily eat its friends. \nBounty Bot\nBounty Bot is a Bountiful Bot gone rogue; it allows you to draw a card whenever it fells an opponent in battle. Setup lots of weak cards on the table, then punish them with Bounty Bot to get a full hand! \nNeedy Bot\nNeedy Bot forces other Bots to come and look after it; you'll have to play a card from your hand on top of it when it enters! It's great for defending yourself against Stomp Bots! \nSpike Shot Bot\nSpike Shot Bot is a brutal menace, often capable of destroying two cards with one shot! Be very careful how you defend your Bots! \nJuggler Bot\nJuggler Bot allows you to manipulate the top 3 cards of another Stak, putting them in any order you want! It's perfect for setting up combination attacks! \nElephant Bot\nElephant Bot is incredibly powerful. It is also very scared of tiny Bots; so scared that it scraps itself! \nRecall Bot\nRecall Bot returns whatever card is below it to your hand. Play a horrific entry effect card, then get it back for a second impact! Or reveal it in your Stak to boost your hand size and your options!\nPulse Bot\nPulse Bot senses which Bot or Bots in play are currently the most powerful, then emits a signal that causes them all to self-destruct! It's incredibly powerful, but be warned, it has the potential to backfire!\nNice Bot\n Nice Bot's entry effect makes you choose an opponent to draw a card. How\u2026 nice.

It never comes to boredom or breaks, because the players are constantly involved. The atmosphere and the wonderfully exaggerated graphics and texts stimulate the motivation to always step up and roll again, even if the opponent can so often get the better throw. There are very few dice games that can play on the happiness of frustration so well!\"\n- www.HeimSpiele.info\nFor most sport simulation games the results and the scores are delivered in gentle rolls and careful curating of dice. Sums are made and scores are decided; its all very British, it is all very gentlemanly, and civil. Luchador! sweeps all that off the table in one grand gesture...Luchador! deserves its space on your shelf for its simple casual play mechanics and its grand standing, mucho macho bravado, theatrics which it calls out for. For now if you spot a Luchador! box in the wild go ahead and grab it; its the filler your game group deserves.\"\n- Beasts of War\n\"With the theme it has, it\u2019s a great game to end the night. Light, quick, and boisterous enough to wake you up for the drive home. It\u2019s great fun. Loud fun, too \u2013 you better warn the neighbors.\"\n- Meople's Magazine\nI love everything this game brings to the table. Theme, components, gameplay, replayability, ease of tutorial, everything.

In the game you play surgeons aiming to create the finest bodies from the parts (cards) available. Points are gained for bodies that are made from parts matched for serum colour and gender. But it's more than a straight race to stitch parts together. Players can surgically remove parts from each other. But there is a risk of having these 'infected' and so become worthless. Master Surgeons can be brought in who offer extra expertise (points) and prevent other player's 'Surgery'. The game ends when one player has completed two bodies, or the draw deck runs through twice. \n'Frankenstein's Bodies' is quick to learn with it's intuitive design and game play that comes out of the premise of competitive surgery. But with steep competition and high levels of interaction every game is very different.\nEach player has one lab with two benches. Here are body parts on the benches.

We have a set of expansions ready that do just that. These will be rolled out and unlocked as funding allows. We will give more details when the time is right.\nBut the first one to aim for is The Shredded Peasant.\nThe First Stretch Goal will be The Shredded Peasant\n'Dark Harvest: The Legacy of Frankenstein' is an award winning RPG by Iain Lowson set in a world where Frankenstein had got it right. It is a gruesome and brilliantly challenging world of horror which has spawned extra supplements and a short-story anthology. \nWhen Andrew is not designing games he is a writer. He has 11 comedy fantasy/sci-fi books to his name and contributed to the fictional side of 'Dark Harvest'. As an avid games player and knowing Iain well, Andrew was invited to add a game to the 'Dark Harvest' portfolio. This is that game. You can find more information about Iain Lowson's 'Dark Harvest: The Legacy of Frankenstein' at www.darkharvest-legacyoffrankenstein.com\n There's nothing better than making sure you like a game before you back it. We feel certain that you will enjoy 'Frankenstein's Bodies' and will join a growing band of people who have played and come back for more. Feel free to follow this link to a print and play pdf of the game. Do be warned though, at 110 cards, boards and tokens it takes quite a bit of work and can be heavy on ink!. Enjoy.\nDownloadable rules, card images and player boards can be found at \nwww.frankensteinsbodies.com on the Print and Play page.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFrom the game testing and demonstrations we have put the game through we are very confident that we have a good game.

All we need now is basically to add a printer and ship the finished product. This costs money and the money raised from your backing will allow us to get over this hurdle and into production.\nWe already have high class printers ready to roll their presses, we have fulfilment and shipping routes researched and ready.

Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nFor two years I have been looking for a great dice game.\nDRAGON SLAYER is that game.\nDragon Slayer has everything I wanted in Indie Boards & Cards' first dice game:\nIt's fast playing, games take 15 minutes, so you can play while waiting for friends to arrive, in line, or over and over again all night long.\nIt has dragons that you are trying to kill.\nIt has dragon dice, dragons that are trying to kill you.\nIt's a \"press your luck\" classic, roll till you stop, go too far and you'll die.\nDid I mention that your friends are trying to get you killed?\nThat\u2019s right, it is a dice game with a twist \u2013 real player interaction! Think your friend pressed his luck too far \u2013 challenge him to keep going. If he does, he can score big \u2013 but if he fails or worst yet doesn\u2019t take the challenge, he\u2019ll lose points and you get some.\nDragon Slayer plays 2 - 5 players, but we are including everything you need to play with 6 in the box.\nFast, Fun and Full of spite \u2013 what more could you ask for?\n Dragon Slayer is a great game, but you can\u2019t know that yet. So if you are getting a reward from our recent Coup Reformation project, then we can add Dragon Slayer to your Reformation rewards and pass along the combined shipping savings to you. A great game at a fantastic price is good deal for everyone. Didn\u2019t back Reformation? Dragon Slayer is still a great game, and you can add extra copies at the same price. And you\u2019ll help us reach our stretch goals.\nIt\u2019s a dice game with 12 custom dice, nice art, detailed rules and six challenge tokens for 7 bucks \u2013 so you know that we can\u2019t get crazy. But I would like to give backers a few extras in addition to a fantastic price. And since this is mass produced, we need to make a minimum number to be able to offer special items.\nSo stretch rewards are based on number of backers (not counting those that aren\u2019t getting rewards, just counting those that are in at the $7 level and above)\n1000 Backers \u2013 Metallic Ink Dice: It looks cool, it is cool. Everyone will know that you got the special edition as soon as you take them out.\nAchieved!\n3000 Backers \u2013 Foil Box: We all like shiny, and a nice shiny game box is a great way to get your friends to play. We can\u2019t understand why, but we all know that it happens. So help us get more backers and we\u2019ll get a box that screams \u201cPlay Me!\u201d \nAchieved!\n4,000 Games - Battlemat: The Battlemat is a convenient way to track your turn during the game. It's been designed to help you quickly learn and teach the game by emphasizing the core game rules and steps in your turn.\nAchieved!\n5,000 Games - Score tracker:  a compact scoreboard with small cubes to track each player's progress and tokens to remind everyone what color they are!\nAchieved!\n6,000 Games - Score tracker for 6 players & and a 2nd copy of the Battlemat: Even though we are listing the game as supporting 2-5 players, there is no theoretical maximum number of players. We are including challenge tokens to support up to 6 (or have an extra if you lose one), so it makes sense that we could also include scoring markers for that 6th player as well. If we get 6000 committed games in this project, we will include the 6th player in green.\nACHIEVED!\nALL STRETCH REWARDS UNLOCKED!\nNote - These stretch goal upgrades won't be included in the retail version of the game that is sold via distribution.\nNick Hayes (a full time game designer, as well as a illustrator & graphic designer) did a great job on the box and game component art as you can see here:\nAs you might have expected in a PYL (push your luck) game, there are dice! 12 dice, 10 different with only the 3 warrior dice repeated. Each of the dragon dice have different head, wing and tail designs that really add to the \"wow\" factor. And yes these are molded dice - not silkscreened, so they will be durable. Also in the box are the challenge tokens - enough to support games with up to 6 players, though we are listing on the box that this will play 2-5.\nGame designer David Mortimer really made this game shine - creating a new PYL game is a deceptively difficult challenge, and he did this one right.  The rules can be found here. Like all great PYL games, the rules are simple, format of repeating the Dragon Hunt until you decide to stop. The very interesting twist is the player challenges. The ability to challenge, and rewards for passing or failing when challenged, add a dimension to everything that you do on your turn. What order do you go after dragons? When do you stop? When do you challenge? Who do you challenge? How do you get others not to challenge you?\nDon't get me wrong, it is still a classic PYL game with rules that are easy to learn and teach - it is just that the challenges really do add something very interesting to the genre and nicely complement the rest of the great design ideas that David has incorporated in Dragon Slayer.\nI really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the Indie Boards and Cards, and be able to offer this fantastic deal to those that helped us blow the roof off the Reformation project. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nThank you for supporting us!\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where it is ready; your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages. In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio. Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards currently has another project that is due for deliver (Coup Reformation expansion), that game will be produced at the same time as this game. As the artwork is already done for both games this should not present a great risk.\n\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nThis is a first edition of the game - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less.\n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #21", "update_userinfo": "Kickstarter Editions of Reformation, Extreme Danger and Dragon Slayer, available from Indie Boards and Cards via Amazon", "update_content": "Thank you for your support of this project, and many others from Indie Boards and Cards.\nEvery year we make more copies of the Kickstarter Edition than we absolutely need - we have to forecast for copies that are lost/damaged in delivery as well as supporting conventions that we attend and often times have to place the final orders before projects end to try to get games to you as quickly as possible.

Be sure to subscribe to our newsletter at www.IndieBoardsAndCards.com to be informed of our next project.\nHave a question? Be sure to \"Contact Me\" to get an answer >>>>>\nCoup gets even bigger with a special edition expansion.\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce this exciting expansion for all the fans of our hugely successful Coup kickstarter last year. That project exceeded even our highest expectations and I am confident that almost every one of our backers got a great game that they enjoyed and played with their friends.  It was clear that many of those friends ended up buying a copy for themselves because we went through a bunch in a very short amount of time (and are still waiting for the reprint of the retail version to arrive).  That kind of response is amazing, Rikki and I couldn't be more excited than to have so many people enjoy this great game.  Making games that are fun to play and get enjoyed around the world is why we make them!\nReformation is exciting expansion to Coup, and to celebrate the successes of the game we are launching a special edition of the expansion via kickstarter.  Reformation KS Edition starts off where our last project finished - it is a special version of the expansion that won't go into distribution and it already has all of its stretch goals unlocked.  If you want to be the first to get this special edition and get it at a great price then you will want to pledge for this project.\nAnd if you missed getting Coup last year, or want to get both the Reformation Expansion and the Coup base game at the same time we are also offering a special combination package (Reformation & Coup KS edition) that has many of promo items that you might have missed.\nIn addition to developing great games, we have also been focused on improving our US & international shipping processes.  That means we can offer even lower shipping costs to almost everywhere in the world and we are offering a special \"add on\" rates for those that might have missed out on one of our earlier releases.\nSo thank you in advance for your support - we are super excited to be able to bring another great title to your gaming table.\nDriven by their successes, the resistance has gained popular support and entire regions are in open rebellion.In a desperate attempt to stay in control, some government leaders are publically supporting the reforms demanded by the resistance.But allegiances are constantly shifting, and can be bought for the right price.\nThe opportunity for intrigue and bluff has never been greater.The cost of failure couldn\u2019t be higher.Even with talk of reformation, only one can survive.\nReformation is an expansion to Coup, a copy of Coup is required to play.Reformation adds Allegiances \u2013 players are either in support of the government (Loyalists) or the resistance (Reformists). Reformation also includes the Inquisitor variant, and additional role cards to expand play up to 10 players.\nOriginally introduced in a very limited edition at Essen 2013 that sold out in hours, Reformation is a perfect expansion to an already great game adding a new layer of manipulation and deceit for Coup fanatics. If you\u2019d like more information about Reformation please read this review posted here.\nIn the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new \u201croyal class\u201d of multi-national CEOs.Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of The Resistance have created discord, intrigue and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse.But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.\nTo be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.\nCoup is a lightning fast game of bluff and manipulation for 2-6 players.If you are not already familiar with Coup - here is a quick overview and review from Tom Vasel, an industry leading reviewer:\n If you don\u2019t already have Coup, you will need to get it in order to use the Reformation expansion.The Reformation & Coup KS pledge levels (starting at $30) is a great way to get both at the same time or to upgrade your retail copy to include all the nice little extras of the kickstarter edition (alternative art cards & foil coins).\nWant to combine the two reward levels and get one (or more) copies of the Reformation & Coup Kickstarter Editions with one (or more) of the Reformation Kickstarter Editions?  See update #6 for details by clicking here.\nWe made this very easy for everyone and reduced the chances of a project delay at the same time!Based on our past kickstarter projects we are going to include all the stretch goals as soon as the project funds \u2013 we have everything ready to go to the printers to reduce the time between your pledge and when you receive your rewards.That might sound like a cope out, but this isn\u2019t a project where you get the planned retail version of the game and a few extras \u2013 the rewards in this project are a very special edition of this expansion that won\u2019t be available through game distributors.This project is really intended for the Coup fanatics out there!\nSo as soon we reach our funding goal, every copy of rewards will include these stretch rewards that won\u2019t be part of the Reformation expansion retail edition:\nGold Foil Box \u2013 To keep costs as low as possible, the retail version of Reformation is packed in a blister card and everything fits in your original Coup box.That won\u2019t work if you have either of the kickstarter editions; it certainly won\u2019t work if you have both the Reformation kickstarter edition and the Coup kickstarter edition.We\u2019ve redesigned the Reformation box in a very attractive gold finish that is sure to grab everyone\u2019s attention that sees it.But it isn\u2019t just a pretty face \u2013 we\u2019ve made the box slightly wider and taller so that it fits all the cards and coins with just a little extra room.It is still a compact box so you can bring it everywhere that you might want to enjoy Coup.\nMore Alternative Art Cards \u2013 The alternative art cards from kickstarter last year have been a huge success, so we are doubling down here and introducing two more sets of alternative art cards for all 6 characters \u2013 two new dukes, two new contessas, two new captains, two new assassins, two new ambassadors and two new inquisitors.These alternative art cards aren't just pretty to look at, they serve a functional purpose as they make slight modification to how the game is played with the potential to introduce more logic into the game.When combine with Coup kickstarter edition (or via the Reformation & Coup KS pledge levels) you will have enough alternative art cards to play up to 10 with unique art on every card.\nGold Foil Coins \u2013 Reformation doesn\u2019t really need any more coins to play than what comes in the Coup box, and the retail version won\u2019t have any additional coins.But these new gold foil coins really do shine, and they are so much fun to play with.Just don\u2019t let the other players target you because you have one!\nAnd if you back at the Reformation & Coup KS levels ($30 and above) you\u2019ll also get these stretch goals from our past Coup kickstarter rewards:\nAlternative Art Cards \u2013 The original set of alternative art cards for all 6 characters two different dukes, two different contessas, two different captains, two different assassins, two different ambassadors and two different inquisitors.In total it is enough to play up to 10 players with different art on every card \u2013 quite a fun experience especially combined with the Allegiance mechanics in Reformation!\nSilver Foil Coins \u2013 The shiny coins were a big hit and we are bringing them back for those that missed them the first time.These are something that the printer wasn\u2019t sure they could do, but they turned out great and add just enough to the game to really make it stand out on your table.\nFor a complete diagram of what comes in each version of Reformation - please see UPDATE #2 by clicking here\nAs a special reward for kickstarter backers and as a result of the advances we\u2019ve made in reducing shipping costs, we are able to offer great prices when adding some of our older titles when you pledge for Coup Reformation.Prices for each of these add-ons are shown as $X / $Y / $Z.US and Canadian Shipping address add $X for that item, EU addresses add $Y and every else in the world adds $Z to their pledge to get that add on.All add on items will be shipped at the same time as your Coup Reformation rewards and to the same address.These special prices are for the retail versions only and do not include promotional items from past kickstarter projects.\n The Resistance: $14/$19/$21 \u2013 watch it played on TableTop: \nThe Resistance: Avalon: $14/$19/$21 \u2013 Watch it played on Shut Up & Sit Down:\nFlash Point: Fire Rescue: $28/$35/$42\nUrban Structures or 2nd Story or Dangerous Waters (Flash Point Expansions): $10/$14/$15\nExtreme Danger (Flash Point Expansion):$28/$35/$42\nVeteran & Rescue Dog (Flash Point Expansion):$8/$10/$10\nWatch Drakkenstrike's video review:\nSnowdonia:$50/$60/$65 \nJungfraubahn & Mt. Washington (Snowdonia Expansion): $10/$14/$15\nWatch Rahdo\u2019s Video review:\nExamples of \u201chow to\u201d for add-ons:\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $15 (US Shipping) and wanted to add The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon - you would select the $15 reward level and pledge $43 ($15 + $14 + $14).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $20 (Canadian Shipping) and wanted to add Flash Point Fire Rescue and Urban Structures - you would select the $20 reward level and pledge $58 ($20 + $28 + $10).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $23 (International Shipping, EU Address) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $23 reward level and pledge $97 ($23 + $60 + $14).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $23 (International Shipping, non-EU Address) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $23 reward level and pledge $103 ($23 + $65 + $15).\nIf you back Coup Reformation for $29 (Brazil Shipping) and wanted to add Snowdonia and Jungfraubahn & Mt. Washington - you would select the $29 reward level and pledge $109 ($23 + $65 + $15).\nWe will ask which add-ons you wanted in the project survey that will be sent out shortly after the project ends.\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of the first edition of Coup were good, and I am very optimistic about this special edition of the expansion - I am only able to offer it (with all the extra costs that it has) if I get a minimum number of committed backers.  \nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of at this time of the year.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game. Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you. We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production.\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools and in 2013 we added Coup and Snowdonia to our portfolio.   Be sure to look for all these great games wherever you shop. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like Amazon, the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. Other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner. \n\nThis is a first edition of the expansion - by pledging to this project you are agreeing to be an early adopter and the extra items that are included in this edition (that aren't in the retail version) are your rewards and incentives for being an early adopter. But even with multiple edits, and constant proofing there may be minor typos, or grammar usage that is annoying to you in your rewards or other little things that would have been nice to have avoided but don't affect how the game is played. Mistakes that materially affects game play will of course be addressed but sometimes there are are minor errors that might be distracting but do not affect game play that I can't justify correcting. So if minor errors get under your skin and make it itch then you probably don't want to be an early adopter and are better off waiting till you've had a chance to see the final product and then buy it in your local hobby store. Kickstarter is not for everyone and I leave it to you to decide if you should be getting in on a first edition of this expansion.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less. \n\nRefunds - things happen and sometimes you need to get your money back. If you ask (before it's been submitted for shipment to you) , I'll refund your pledge less 20% to cover the costs that I can't recoup and costs of processing that refund. So think before you pledge - you can of course always remove your pledge before the funding deadline - but don't expect to get a 100% refund just because you forgot to remove your pledge before the project end ;)\n\nChanges - Images shown here are of the final art - however while it is not expected changes may be made before final production both to the art work and game contents. Variations in the production process and monitor calibration may cause alternations from the screen images to what appears in physical form.\n\nHave an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you. Nothing would make me happier than having 100% of my supporters be 100% satisfied with their pledge rewards!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Our Quest ends tomorrow!", "update_content": "Our latest social deduction game by Don Eskridge, designer of The Resistance and Avalon is ending soon on Kickstarter!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #29", "update_userinfo": "Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition", "update_content": "Just a short update to let everyone know that the kickstarter for Coup Brazilian Art Deluxe Edition is up (and in it's final hours).

Battles are fought by skillfully flicking different types of wooden pieces across the game board.  The board and obstacles are setup according to the instructions on a series of room cards. \nPlayers shoot their Heroes across the board, trying to kill all the monsters in the room. Once all the Heroes have completed their actions, the Overseer performs all the monster actions in retaliation. When all the monsters are dead, the Heroes collect their treasure and move on to the next room.  Items to upgrade your Hero can be purchased from the Merchant.\nIf the Heroes have survived all the rooms, they will battle their most powerful opponent, one of the Catacomb Lords. The Heroes win when the Catacomb Lord has been defeated.\nCheck out the Kickstarter Exclusive Add-Ons at the bottom of this page!\nHeroes\nCatacomb Lords\nGame Play Video\nA quick introductory video of what it is like to play Catacombs that we put together at our office.

Receiving a BFA in Illustration from Art Center College of Design, and working steadily illustrating a variety of projects since, he has a particular love for that space where art meets gaming.\nWhy use Kickstarter?\nWe've been building the Catacombs world since 2009 and are very proud of the original game and expansions. We are now looking to improve on the original and make the best possible version.\nWe will be doing this in various ways. The first is by updating the art. While the original game art is dark and gothic, we will be moving to a brighter and more playful style. Some aspects of the original game were created by an artist but much of the graphic design was done in-house. With this new version, we will be hiring a professional artist to do a complete art conversion.\nThere will also be upgraded components including new pieces and improvements to the boards which will be bigger and have new graphics.\nWe are also trying to be more environmentally responsible. The FSC, or the Forest Stewardship Council, is an international organization that strives to improve forest management on a global scale. This can mean protecting biodiversity, areas of environmental sensitivity and worker's rights among other things. Although we can't be 100% FSC compliant, we will be striving to get as close as possible. \nIt takes a lot to design and deliver a board game. Not only are the costs of manufacturing and distribution on the rise, but the time and effort needed is a full-time job.  Without your help, we won't be able to make this project happen.\nThanks so much for your support!\nStretch Goal List\nThese Add-Ons are available starting at the $55 Level and will be available in both English and German.

Hide in shadows. Make theirs yours.\n\"Dark's intense focus on stealth, combining intricate maps with deeply specialized characters, breathed life into a whole shadowy world in play \u2014 one I'd never seen before, usually being too busy blundering around being a hero.\" \u2014Jason Morningstar, creator of Fiasco and Durance\nIt seems like forever sometimes.\nI've long been captivated by games based around the exploration of fictional worlds \u2014 roleplaying games especially. And while lots of games let you move through fictional spaces, games focused on sneaking and stealth have always held a special place in my heart and my imagination. Great stealth games are partly about experiencing an imaginary realm \u2014 overhearing snippets of life, whether mundane or incredible, that bring the world to life \u2014 and partly about solving the puzzle of how to move through that world to accomplish key goals.\nI love to design imaginary worlds as a tabletop GM. I love to play sneaky, stealthy characters as a player. I wanted a game that emphasizes that kind of play throughout. I wanted a game that wasn't necessarily about storming dungeons and fighting everything. I wanted a game that brought a fictional world to life in different ways.\nSo I set out to make it myself. It seems like forever sometimes.\nProject: Dark is an umbrella term for one endeavor that encompasses several game worlds in the same style: stealth-adventure games for tabletop roleplaying. \nAlong the way, I've cultivated a few different worlds to explore. This fundraising campaign starts with one of them \u2014 the core, fantastical game world of Dark \u2014 and expands out to include other settings, if you like. They all use the same main game rules and emphasize the same focus on stealth and intrigue but each world puts that central play activity into different contexts.\n\"My hands are shaking,\" said one play tester. \"Can I save? Are there save points? This is seriously intense.\"\nI designed Dark from the ground up to cultivate the tension and suspense of stealth gameplay. For the players, the game hinges on regular playing cards, rather than dice. This allows players to better plan, make both dramatic and tactical choices, and benefit from patience and precision in tangible ways. The better hidden your character, the more cards you have in hand.\nCharacters themselves are described by the cards players place in their deck and the skills they train. Each player needs their own deck of regular playing cards to play.\n\"Pulse-pounding tension and riotous cleverness combined with a deck-building flourish.\" \u2014 John LeBoeuf-Little, play tester\nHere's what Dark looks like in play:\nA game of Dark in play\n1) The rules guide\n2) The draw deck\n3) Player's hand (usually hidden)\n4) Character cards and abilities by suit\n5) Character background and skills\n6) Character's wound spaces\n7) Disguise spaces\n8) GM's area with dice (and captured Joker)\n9) Player's discard pile\n10) Character's bag of loot\nOver the course of this fundraising campaign, I'll use updates to share more information about the game and how it plays.\nThe game plays wonderfully with even just a single player and a gamemaster (GM). With one or two players, it feels like an infiltration game about sneaking into forbidden places and capturing loot or secrets. With more players \u2014 I play it with up to 4, plus a GM \u2014 it sometimes feels more like a fantastical heist, with lots of moving parts and a delicate balance between plans and opportunities.\n\"Most RPGs 'support' a single player and GM as an afterthought, or with a lot of clumsy system hacking. Project: Dark *features* an amazing two-player experience that is unlike any other. The clever combination of deck building, collaborative character generation, and tense cat-and-mouse exploration promises tremendously satisfying gameplay for players and GMs alike.\" \u2014 Wil Wheaton, author and gamer\nDark adventures can take the form of detailed environments, with pre-written conversations to overhear, or they can be randomly built by the GM as you play, using dice to inform the environment and determine the threats to the players' characters. The Dark text contains complete guidelines on both kinds of play \u2014 and I look forward to offering complete and detailed adventures for the game(s) throughout the year.\nThe worlds of Project: Dark are built to emphasize the dramatic and gameplay potential in playing thieves, spies, intruders, and trespassers in perilous worlds. Some adventures are about petty thievery \u2014 but sometimes this is a game about revolutionary skullduggery, internecine intrigue, shadowing enemies, and changing the world. Will your tales be gritty sagas of street-level survival or sordid crime epics about nefarious antiheroes?\n\"Brutal, clever, and exciting. This was amazing. So fun and tense and I've already bought fancy cards.\" \u2014 Austin Bookheimer, play tester\n\"Will Hindmarch is one of the most insightful roleplaying thinkers I know and is without a doubt one of the best writers in all of RPG gaming. Back this project, and do it now.\" \u2014Jeff Tidball, designer of Horus Heresy\nList of Additional PDF Content\n A few folks have asked for a complete list of the PDF/ebook content that's now coming from the campaign, and rightly so! Here it is:\nThe Player's Guide\nThe House Book\nThe Dark|Net setting expansion\nThe Dark Planet setting expansion\nThe Saturnine Codex (PDF)\nTwo adventures for Dark\nTwo adventures for Dark|Net\nTwo adventures for Dark Planet\nThis content will roll out throughout the coming months. For example, I don't expect all six adventures to get released at once. Additional adventures may get released still through my Patreon site and DriveThruRPG, after these initial adventures are wrapped up. These first adventures also contain expansion material for their game worlds, such as new abilities to train (after, say, you steal the spellbook from a local wizard in the Dark setting). This will keep me busy for a while \u2014 and I'm delighted about it!\nAdd-Ons For Cards\nNow that we've passed the milestone for custom playing cards, let's look at exactly what you need to add to your pledge to get those cards. These prices are based on known costs (printing, warehousing) and estimated costs (shipping, packaging), so they were a little tricky to arrive at based on estimated weights and envelope sizes \u2014 but they're what we're using. Have a look:\n1 deck: $10 (US), $13 (International)\n2 decks: $18 (US), $22 (International)\n3 decks: $28 (US), $33 (International)\n4 decks: $36 (US), $42 (International)\n5 decks: $44 (US), $54 (International)\nOther Rewards\nLet's look further at the loot you get for backing Project: Dark and how that funding's going to work.\nThis campaign aims to buy me time to complete development, production, and writing of the core rulebook, the Dark setting, and a sample adventure. Most of this money goes to art and a lot to writing. (Note that I'm including layout costs in the writing, because I lay out these books myself.) Here's a breakdown for you:\nEstimated breakdown of funds\nThe core book is fully outlined and about a third of it is written. The book will be about 70,000 words and I'm budgeted to get about a nickel per word \u2014 a bit less than my usual rate in the RPG market. This campaign, if successful, allows me to take time off to finish writing and laying out the text while commissioning the art for the book. \nI'm working with some terrific artists on this project, too:\nRay Fawkes (portfolio)\nRachel Kahn (portfolio)\nLeah Huete (portfolio, NSFW)\nLukasz Gac (portfolio)\nPhil Reeves (portfolio)\nBeno\u00eet Blary (portfolio)\nBackers at most levels get the game's beta kit at the completion of the campaign. That features a demo adventure, four ready-to-play characters, sample character abilities, and the game's basic rules.\nThe game ultimately sees publication in two books: The Player's Guide, containing player-facing rules and character-creation information, and The House Book, containing everything in the Player's Guide plus all the information on adventure design, background on the world of Dark (and why it's been designed the way it has), and complete rules for playing the Inspector who investigates the players' characters' crimes.\nAdditional material, especially adventures and new worlds for play, may be unlocked over the course of the funding campaign. These largely take the form of PDF products added on to existing backer levels.\nThe thumb drives for the talisman-level rewards are leather-and-chrome-looking USB drives with a 16 GB capacity. They'll come pre-loaded with PDFs of The Player's Guide and The House Book, plus other PDF content available at the time the drives are prepared. (You'll be able to get all owed content online, too, of course.)\nTo avoid shipping books out of my house and wrestling with the woes of international shipping, which have stymied and vexed a lot of campaigns, I offer physical books available at cost from DriveThruRPG. You'll pay a small printing cost and whatever the apt shipping rate is for your home in addition to what you pay to fund this project. Because DriveThruRPG can produce and ship books from the US and the UK, this should save both you and I on shipping rates and shipping times.\nIt's impossible to know exactly what the printing cost of these books will be at this date, but it looks to probably be around $3-4 for the Player's Guide and $4-5 for the House Book (priced in US dollars).\nRemember, you're not just buying the game, you're helping bring it into existence. To thank you for that, I'm also offering a few unique backer rewards, such as hand-bound codices describing the game worlds we successfully unlock (containing information unlocked throughout the funding campaign) and a chance to play the game early with me via a Google hangout. Be sure to come back as new backer rewards may appear over the run of the campaign.\nUpdate to the \"Learn the Game\" level! Backers at this level now do receive codes for print books from DriveThruRPG and the thumb drives, in addition to a Google Hangout to learn the game. International backers, please add $15 to your funding for international delivery of that thumb drive; if you just want the codes and the Hangout, but don't want to shell out shipping for the drive, you can back at $85 and skip out on the drive. No worries.\nRetailers! The retailer levels are now live! Please note: (1) Proof of purchase for customers is ideally a receipt and an emailed photo of the customer with the book; if you can take that photo with a cell phone in the store, just so I can see the books in their temporary retail homes, that's great. (2) We'll be verifying retailers during the fulfillment process, so if you see me say \"verified retailers\" at some point, that's what I'm talking about. (3) I don't know which Dark adventure your customers will get, yet, but whichever it is all the campaign backers get it too.\nThis is my first time composing retailer reward levels, so I welcome your feedback on them. Thanks!\n\"This is definitely my most anticipated game of 2014.\"\u2014Stras Acimovic, ace play tester\nIf we raise enough funds, we'll start unlocking additional art and adventures for the game. Update! You've smashed the first stretch goals. Onward!\n$9,500: This first stretch goal for the game earns us a full-color map of the fantastical city at the heart of Dark, rendered by Mark Richardson, a game designer, graphic designer, and professional cartographer from Ottawa, Canada.\nAt $11,000, we unlock original cover art for the Player's Guide.\n(Somewhere between $12,000 and $14,000, I got to give myself a pay raise for the Dark books and take some additional time off from freelance work to devote just to them.)\nIf we raise $16,500, I'll follow up Dark with the setting guide for Dark|Net, bringing the game into a post-collapse dystopian future where electricity is scarce, oil is gone, and our modern cities are lit mostly by fire. In this setting, the world's broken into isolated states warring over next-gen energy tech while guerilla-run dark-nets coordinate clandestine would-be Robin Hoods who consider themselves revolutionaries \u2014 and might even have a chance to change the world. Dark|Net introduces electronic countermeasures, new gadgetry, and new abilities into the game, and I'll demonstrate the world with a complete, detailed adventure in the setting. All of this debuts in PDF.\nIf we raise $24,000, I'll write up the setting guide for Dark Planet, taking the game to an extrasolar colony world oppressed by an alien menace that has sheathed the planet in darkness. Sunlight falls only where they say, when they say. It's up to renegade humans to infiltrate alien compounds and palaces, to undermine alien tyranny, to bring down the artificial sky that holds the planet hostage. Dark Planet takes the game into a grim and gritty retro future of high-tech treasures and alien monsters where secrecy is the key to survival and infiltration is the way to victory. This setting comes with a detailed adventure to get your campaign going and it all debuts in PDF.\nWe're still examining printing solutions for a Dark-specific deck of cards, but I am happy to report that we have a new stretch goal for the card art! Past the threshold of $25,500, artist Rachel Kahn will create original card art for the royals, aces, and jokers in our Dark deck. These cards will eventually be for sale via DriveThruCards, so even if we don't raise any more money, we'll be able to order special Dark decks in the future.\nThe next stretch goal is a big one: At $35,000, we get custom-made Dark decks printed by the US Playing Card Company, as described in this update. That'll unlock new backer levels and the ability to add on decks to existing backer levels. Think we can do it?\nMore Commentary About the Game\n\"WARNING: If you pick up Project: Dark for a quick two-player one shot when you can't get your entire game group together, don't be surprised when you don't want to go back to your regular campaign.\" \u2014 Wil Wheaton, author and gamer\n\"Dark and Dark|Net capture everything brilliant about stealth action games and distill them into tabletop form.

He is the producer and editor of the feature length documentaries The Inventor and the Daredevil and Pauly Shore Stands Alone. He loves games, and has designed and refined over a dozen card games, board games, and RPGs. Chaosmos is his dream project, and the response to it inspired him to start Mirror Box Games.\nMatthew Austin is the Lead Developer at Mirror Box Games. He developed the navigation iPhone app Falcon, which has successfully partnered with Insomniac Events and UCLA to provide walking navigation to festival attendees and incoming students. Prior to working on Falcon, Matt started and ran a successful home improvement company.\nDanny Vigour is responsible for the graphic design of Chaosmos. In the past, his mixed-media short films have earned him awards from companies as diverse as Sony Creative Software and Lea & Perrins Steak Sauce. Danny offered his help long-distance initially, but once the project got serious enough, he moved to California to join the team.\nSam Vest defines himself as a \"Freelance Videographer by day, artist all the time.\" He started as a Chaosmos play tester, but eventually became the demo runner at conventions, recognizable from a distance thanks to his signature top hat.\nChaosmos began as a personal project for me many years ago. I've completed several finished game designs, but this one is special to me. The response to the game convinced me that it was worth spending months testing and balancing, and ultimately publishing.\nIn January 2013, I decided to produce the game with my friend Matt. Old friends came out of the woodwork with endless love and support for the project, and my brother Danny moved to Los Angeles to work on it with me. We met with three major publishers at the Gama Trade Show and Gen Con, but ultimately decided to form a company and self-publish.\nFor a detailed history of the origins of the game, click here.\nWe've invested our own money into producing the prototypes and reviewer copies. With Kickstarter, we will have the flexibility and support we need to finish our art and components, and to deliver Chaosmos in a way that will stay true to our vision and make our fans proud.\n-Joey\n                                                                                                                               Rulebook:http://mirrorboxgames.com/ChaosmosRules1-5.pdf\nPrint & Play:http://mirrorboxgames.com/ChaosmosPnP.pdf \nLow Ink Rulebook: http://www.mirrorboxgames.com/rules.html\nPress Kit: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0gy6rau6ij3hvft/hCuieoI6sX\nDisclaimer: Art and design for Chaosmos is not final and is subject to change.

In the shadow of the Copper Peaks, a battle for control of the realm has begun. Will you further the expansion of The Royal Kingdom of Heads or will you help The People\u2019s Republic of Tails fend off the threat of an invading empire?\nIn Coin Age two players attempt to control the land of Agea using a single card map and a handful of pocket change. Players take turns placing their forces (coins) on the map to control spaces, outmaneuver their opponent, and score victory points.\nCoin Age is a quick-playing area control game with lots of player interaction that uses an innovative \"coin slap\" mechanic to determine available actions. On your turn, you will take one of each of your remaining types of coins into your hand (1 quarter, 1 nickel, 1 penny, and 1 dime), shake them up, then slap them down on the table. \nDepending on the number of coins that match your \"side\", you are then able to either place coins on the map, move previously placed coins to an adjacent space, or remove them altogether. \nWhen placing coins, you may also place your coins on top of your opponent's coins if your coin's size/rank is smaller, so while a quarter will give you the most victory points at the end of the game, it is the easiest for your opponent to cover.\nI know that it can become confusing with Stretch Goals what exactly you might be getting for making this pledge.  First and foremost, you get the awesomely fun game play of Coin Age.  \nThe materials in the envelope however are:\nOriginal Coin Age map card\nDurable \"credit card\" like material with original Coin Age map.\nDoubloon Lagoon Map\nFrozen Assets Map\nLave Map (Cool Name Pending)\nRules\nCardboard coin tokens.\nStickers to apply to real currency if desired\nZip baggie to hold all of the stuff.\nWant to try Coin Age before you support this campaign? (Or want to play it while you eagerly await delivery of the official version?) Download the Print & Play version from BGG or by clicking here. It\u2019s free!\nOr just read and check out the rules at those links above.\nAt TMG, we REALLY love games and publishing games.  Towards the end of 2012, we wanted to be able to provide fantastic games that are also micro.  Not just micro components and a micro footprint, but also a micro price.\nIt wasn't until about September of 2013 that we figured out a viable method for providing games like these at a quality level fans of TMG have come to expect.  Sure, we could provide fancy print-and-play games, but that doesn't scream high quality and high value.\nSo, we have embraced a pay-what-you-want methodology with one modification, a minimum level.  $3 is very close to our actual cost to get the game to you.  At the suggested pledge level of $5, then we (TMG and the game designer) make a decent amount from your pledge.\nMost of all, we want to be able to bring these great tiny games to you, your friends, and your family.  If this project goes well, then we will be able to bring more like this to you in the future as well.  So, please share this project with your friends.\nWe want Coin Age to be as good as it can possibly be, but that requires us to make more copies of the game, which means that we need more funding.\nSo, as we pass certain levels of funding, we will unlock the following increases in the quality of the final game that EVERYBODY will be getting:\n \"If I want to mail a simple letter in Demarks it costs me a dollar and a half. Creating a game and shipping it worldwide for 3 dollars is some kind of super power.\" - Potential Coin Age Backer\nHi everybody! Thanks so much for checking out my game. Coin Age has been a passion project of mine for the past year, and I\u2019m blown away by the overwhelmingly positive feedback I\u2019ve received since debuting it at Gen Con. \nI wanted a way to get the game in front of as many people as possible, and when Michael approached me with his \u201cPay What You Want\u201d idea, I felt like it was a perfect fit. I love Kickstarter. I\u2019ve backed over 70 projects with no sign of stopping. I think Kickstarter can be an incredible tool for games like Coin Age that would otherwise never be published by the traditional model.\nI didn\u2019t set out to make money with Coin Age. It came out of the desire to always be able to carry a small, engaging game with me and be able to play it wherever I go. Something that could fill the time before everyone showed up at a game night, or something I could play with a friend while waiting for our dinner at a restaurant. \nI started with the idea of \u201crolling dice\u201d with coins, playing with multiple uses for their double-sided-ness, and evolved these ideas into an area control game with a fun/silly theme. Coin Age has been playtested over and over and over and over, then again and again, and after that more and more and more to make sure it was as tight, streamlined, and as minimal as possible while maintaining enough choices to make it interesting. \nI have a special place in my heart for the game, and I really hope you will see it the same way.\nAdam was the illustrator for the hit microgame Council of Verona, and won the Boardroomers 2013 game design contest.

Meet Backer Bot!\n(Its card still needs a little tweaking, but it's basically there!)\nAs a thank you, every single backer will be getting a Backer Bot card.  If you've pledged for more than one pack (original or expansion), you'll get an additional copy of the card for each extra pack.\nBacker Bot is exclusive to this project, it will not be in the expansion pack. \nYou will be the only people with this card!\nWhat's so good about its entry effect? Surely I'm just losing a card to another player?! Well yes, but think of the damage you can do by putting a weak card on top of their Stak and then bashing them! It also gets a power boost so is stronger than its rank would normally allow, and if you have no other cards in your hand when you play it, there is no penalty! \nStretch Goals\nFor every \u00a3300 we make past target, there will be an additional Bot card added to every pack that is sent out. \nLike Backer Bot, these will not be included in the normal expansion pack, but unlike Backer Bot they are not exclusive, so eventually they may well make an appearance somewhere else. You just get them a great deal sooner than everyone else! \nOnce the project is finished I'll put up a list of new Bots to choose from and let you all vote on which you want to receive. The one that gets the highest number of votes will be added to each and every pack. If we have reached enough from pledges, then the top 2 or 3 etc will be included. (If you are getting original packs sent to you as soon as the project finishes, then these additional cards will be sent to you later with the expansion pack, or on their own if you pledged for the original on its own). \nI've lined up some great potential Bots for you to vote on, so please keep spreading the word about the game. Remember, the more packs you pledge for, the more copies of each Stretch Goal card and Backer Bot you will receive. :) \nStak Bots is a fun, deceptively simple and sneakily strategic battling card game suitable for all ages. \nIt can be a quick and casual filler game, or it can take up your evening with repeated battles and customisation.\nYou can try out the 2 player version NOW by playing the free IOS app, see what reviewers think further down the page, or watch Tom Vasel's video review.\nYou can read the instructions here, or there's a 'how to play' video at the bottom of the page.\nEach turn you try to do as much damage to your opponents as possible, then leave yourself in a good defensive position for when they retaliate. \nAbout the game: \nEvery Bot is unique - Some are destructive, some manipulate the other cards. Some are just plain quirky. They all affect the game differently.\nIt is novel - The game is played vertically; where cards are in the Stak are as important as what the cards are. \nYou get full control - A fully open turn structure lets you combine and repeat actions as much as you are able to on your go.\nYou are always involved - Your revealed cards can trigger decisions and you can play from hand to defend yourself, even when it's not your turn.\nIt is quick to learn - But it takes a while to master how the Bots interact and the shifts in power that they create between players. \nIt grows with you - As you get more competent you can add more Staks, more rules and more Bots. Play how you want.\nThere is a lot to discover - After playing thousands of games, I am still encountering new situations, combinations and tactics. \nGreat multi-player game dynamics - Plead rationally with your attackers, victimise players, bear grudges and expose others' weaknesses.\nYou can read in more detail about the features of the game on the front page of the Stak Bots website. \nNumber of players: 1+ players or teams. Play solo, free for all or in teams. \nRecommended age: On the box it says 11+, but we've taught kids as young as 5! The younger ones don't necessarily understand the strategies, but they love destroying each other's Bots! There is no upper age limit. \nTime to play: 5mins - 20mins per game. Once you are familiar with the game it plays very fast. The more players and Staks there are the slower it will be as the decisions get trickier! \nThe original game launched in May 2013 at the UK Games Expo.               \nIn the Box: \nEverything you need to play, for up to 5 players! 60 x Bot cards featuring the 16 Bots shown above. Full instructions (including game variations, glossary, guide to each Bot)\nReviews:\nHere's what the reviewers and bloggers had to say about the original game:\nPlay Board Games:  \n\"Stak Bots is a hidden gem that you really should check out. It is a great filler for game nights and fun for families.\"\n\"Stak Bots is a quick, fun card game that can be enjoyed by a variety of ages. It is easy to teach and learn and very portable. Plus all the different play modes keep this game fresh.\"\nPlayer Interaction: 6/6. Overall: 5/6.\nThe Dice Tower: \n\"I was pleasantly surprised by this game... It's fast, it's quick, it's really easy to teach and play... It has a good amount of replayability.\"\n\"I like Clumsy Bot. Clumsy Bot is my friend.\"\nWho Dares Rolls:\n\"Had I not sat down and given this a try I would have missed out on a brilliant strategic yet deceptively simple little card game. I loved this, this is the sort of filler game my group eats up.\"\nUnboxed:\n\"Stak Bots has easily become my filler game of choice\"\nFather Geek: \n\"The Bots were well-loved by the little geeks who went to war with them again and again.\"\nChild Geek Approved.\nCard and Pixel:\n\"StakBotS is one of those rare games that almost demands to be replayed the minute you have lost.\"\n\"This game has already become a firm favourite in a very short period of time, and we heartily recommend it.\"\n\"The gameplay is frantic, exciting and engaging.\"\nBoard Game Geek Forum Review - Stack and Attack: The battle of the Bots is in your hands:\n\"There is a delightful element of randomness, but you do have to work out when to play a certain card, when to hold back or even sacrifice a card for the greater good. (Don\u2019t worry, these bot's sole purpose in life is to fight for your own insane pleasure.) Play well and you can unleash a chain of \u2018robo fury\u2019 that will decimate an opponent\u2019s deck in seconds.\"\nThe expansion set brings 16 brand new Bots! They have been carefully selected and balanced to work well with the original Bots. They can be added one at a time into the original set or thrown in all together for maximum variety. Read more about them here. \nThey work as a deck on their own, but for new players we would highly recommend playing with the original set first. \nWith more cards there is also much more scope for deck-building; create individual balanced decks based on the cards' rank value or a point system.\nIn the Box: \n60 x Bot cards featuring the 16 expansion Bots shown above. Instructions (explaining trickier situations, more game variations, guide to each expansion Bot)\nIf we fund successfully, then there are many, many more unique and exciting Bots waiting for the next expansion (or as stretch goals)!! \nThe more Bots there are, the more possibilities and combinations there are! Please help by supporting this game.\nWhat the money is for:\nThe funds will go towards the cost of the expansion print run with Cartamundi UK and then shipping the cards to you, as well as any associated fees.\nGet the Original Pack, Expansion Pack or both! \nBuy more packs to save money! - Give them to a friend, play with more people or get into custom deck building! \nYou can also get a signed postcard of all of the Bots (add \u00a33 to your pledge and message me.

Let's go for it!\n\nAnyway... where were we? Oh yeah!\nLords of War: Templars versus Undead is a standalone card game from award-winning, completely independent, UK-based games publisher Black Box Games.\nAlthough Lords of War: Templars versus Undead is the third game in the Lords of War: Fantasy Battles series, chances are you won't have heard of us. That's because we're a tiny company and we have been around for less than a year. Also, Lords of War has until very recently only been available in the UK!\nThankfully, you don't need to have even heard of the other Lords of War games to enjoy Lords of War: Templars versus Undead. Every Lords of War game has been designed to work on its own, completely independently of the others - that said, if you like, you can mix the decks up or play any of the armies against one another too!\nEverything you need to know about the game should be contained in the various sections below - so, what do you want to know?\nExplain the mechanic in 10 seconds!\nSee this diagram?\nThe full rules are also available through the Lords of War pages on Board Game Geek.\nSee how every card has a shield containing a Defence Value?\nSee how each card has a series of numbers in their Attack Arrows on the edges or corners?\nPlayers play one card at a time from their hand, using their cards' Attack Arrows to exceed the Defence Value on their opponent's cards.\nIn the above example, the Orc Butcher is DEAD (4 from the Chariot + 1 from the Spearman = 5 against the Orc Butcher's 4 Defence).\nThat's the mechanic in 10 seconds. There's a lot more to the game, including Spear and Ranged Units, Cavalry and more, but that's the absolute basics. There's a lot more at the bottom of the page about how it works!\nIn the meantime...\nWelcome to Lords of War!\nHow is the Campaign Going?\nWe created this bespoke piece of artwork to track the progress of our Kickstarter Campaign. Like an advent calendar, a new section is unlocked (with bonuses at the different stages) as we hit certain targets...\nWE ARE FUNDED and have reached our first Stretch Goal of \u00a321,000!!! \nEVERY pledger from the \u00a312 Battle Mat pledge upwards will now receive 100 transparent Lords of War card sleeves for FREE!\nAlso, the internet's largest, independent RPG website EN World recorded this interview with Martin at the weekend!

They are going to be STUNNING!!!\nAnd, because we were going to show you this at 100% Funded and make it available as a Stretch Goal, but we thought we'd show it to you early just in case we don't make it...\nThe Concept Box Artwork for the Lords of War: Weather and Terrain Expansion!\nWho knows - we might still get there... but it's getting very tight!\nTomorrow we'll be at Dragonmeet in London spreading the word, next week we'll be on The Dice Tower. With all the coverage out there behind us and your support if you pass the news on, we might still make it deep into Stretch Goal territory...\nAnyhow - thanks for your support everyone. The next big reveal will be at 100%, so here's hoping it's not too long until we're updating the page again!\nNick & Martin \nBut before we go any further, on December 3rd, the fantastic online sitcom Board With Life released this...\nWhich blew our minds. Incredible.\nAnyway - where were we? Oh yes:\nWhoa! We hit 75% Funded! \nThank you so much everyone - this is incredible! Let's take a look at a tonne of new stuff!\nLet's start with a Templar character sheet...\nWhich cards do what?!\nAnd now let's talk a little bit about mechanics. Well, one mechanic - the NEW mechanic.\nLet's talk about Attack & Move Arrows! \nThose who have been following the campaign will be familiar with this character - the Zombie Gnasher. Well, let's take a look at him in his card frame...\nOh yeah - the Undead colour is BLACK. Did anyone predict that?\nNow, just to emphasise, this card is NOT FINISHED ARTWORK. It's just a very simple mock-up - there's plenty more to do on him!\nAnyway - what you've probably noticed is the new Attack Arrow variation: Attack & Move.\nWhat this symbolises is that this card, once played, can:\nIf the player chooses to and the card is unengaged, the Unit may move into an unoccupied space as indicated by its Attack & Move Arrows.\nThese cards cannot move more than one space per turn. If their Attack & Move Arrows do not point backwards then they cannot retreat. Players do not have to move their cards if they do not want to.\nAnd that is that...\nNow, onto the main event. The deck itself is still locked up until Stretch Goals, but let's talk about...\nThe Lords of War: Terrain & Weather Expansion!!!\nLet's take this a little bit slow - there's heaps to talk about!\nFirst off, let's look at some Terrain...\nWe're starting with absolute basics here - the card design is its own beautiful thing!\nTerrain is laid as a pre-game to a Lords of War battle. The cards are landscape-oriented and can be laid to form Skirmish Scenarios - a kind of story battle - or in a range of ways dependent on player preference.\nSome terrain, such as Castle Walls or Gates can form structures for sieges, Goldfight! (or Capture the Flag) matches or King of the Hill games. \nFor today though, we're talking about three Terrain types and how they effect the game.\nEach Terrain type has two effects:\nHill\nRanged Units placed on this card enjoy +1 Damage from their Ranged Attacks.\nAll Units placed on this card enjoy +1 Defense.\nMarsh\nNo unit placed on a Marsh card can be attacked by Cavalry and Cavalry cannot be placed on a Marsh card.\nUnits placed on Marsh cards cannot move or be retreated.\nRiver\nNo unit can be placed on a River and no unit can cross a River.\nAny Ranged Attacks which cross a River suffer a -1 penalty.\nSound fun? Puzzled? Let us know!\nMoving on to Weather:\nHow does THIS work?!\nUnlike Terrain, Weather Cards are played during Lords of War matches.\nAt the start of the game, after initial units are laid by players, Player 2 draws two cards from the Weather Deck. He looks at both cards, chooses one to play and discards the other face down.\nThe chosen Weather Card then comes into effect and lasts for every player's turn until it play returns to Player 2. At this point, Player 2's Weather Card is placed on the discard pile and, if it is a two player game, Player 1 draws two Weather Cards (or in a 3+ player game Player 3 draws two Weather Cards).\nThe cycle continues until the Weather Deck is depleted, with each player taking turn after turn to draw and play from the Weather Deck. \nOnce the deck runs out, the Weather Deck is shuffled and play begins again.\nAnyway, let's get specific about some Weather Effects:\nThunder\nDuring Thunder, Cavalry units deal no damage and Ranged Weapons cannot be fired. \nMist\nDuring Mist, no cards may be retreated and Berserker Units enjoy +1 Defense.\nBeating Sun\nDuring Beating Sun, all cards suffer a -1 Defense penalty (cards with 1 Defense do not die automatically). \nObviously these are just three examples of many - but they're a taste. If we can get this campaign into Stretch Goal territory then making this deck could become a possibility.\nThank you so much for getting us up to 75% everyone - we're over the moon! Let's keep the momentum up!\nNick & Martin\nWe're over 62% of the way there now!\nIt has felt like this week has lasted forever - \u00a312,500 has seemed so close yet so far away! Now we're here, and thank you for your support.\nIt's time for a bonanza of unlockable stuff! \nFirstly, let's take a look at our first sheet of character sketches. Meet some standard Undead units!\nCool hey? Plenty more to come! Let's hit that next Funding goal!\nNext, let's take a look at the Lords of War: Templars versus Undead Battlemat.

So long as we're successful that is!!\nWe just leapt up to over 50% Funded!\nThank you SO MUCH everyone for the massive drive that's currently underway, and particularly to our friends at Arcane Tinmen for their very generous pledge!\nNow, let's celebrate by nerding out with another continent map - Nuviel, where Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen is set - and the Lords of War: Templars versus Undead box design, which is below!\nFor a digital copy of this map, please email info@lords-of-war.com.\nCheck it out!

In the meantime, look at this lovely piece of newly unlocked Templar concept art!\nTemplar Longsword Concept Art\nOh, and, here's an initial concept for the box cover, alongside the Orcs versus Dwarves and Elves versus Lizardmen versions...\nIt's likely to change, but here's an early version. Beautiful, no?!\nThe first, award-winning pack...\nAnd the second. Now available in over 12 countries and over 80 UK retailers!\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe success of Lords of War in the UK means that we're expanding, which is great, but we're a tiny company - just two teachers! - so while we would love to self-fund Templars versus Undead there's no way the game would see the light of day for at least another year if we didn't have help from you!\nOur friends helping us run demo games for new players in Birmingham. When we go to Expos we tend to be really busy - we're working really hard to spread the word!\nThat's why we need your help! \nYour support is fundamental when it comes to getting the game out into the world, helping us to build a global Lords of War audience whilst maintaining our independent status.\nWe really believe in building a community around the game, with tournaments and prizes and all the rest. Without your help, frankly, it might not happen. So this campaign really matters - and we're so excited about it!\nWhat is Lords of War, because I've never heard of it!\nMartin shaking hands with Olly James, winner of a free Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen pack at the first-ever Lords of War Tournament in Brighton, organised by UK gaming club Gambit Games and local retailer Kids Dreams.\nLords of War is an award-winning card game from Black Box Games in the UK.\nIt sees fantasy races engage in dynamic, tactical card battles which surge across your table top, taking between 30-45 minutes per game.\nSome example cards.\nEach of double-deck pack is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies, all of which are ready and eager to engage in gratuitous acts of fantasy mayhem. The game also scales up from 2 to 6 players, with multiple rule sets including Basic, Intermediate and Advanced. \nThe Lords of War armies are differentiated by their exclusive cards, which feature distinctive playing styles according to the characteristics and qualities of that particular fantasy race, and each card boasts stunning original artwork by award-winning artist Steve Cox.\nTo see the a bit about what comes in the box, here's the ORIGINAL unboxing video we recorded back in November 2012 (with the Digital Proof cards). Note the square corners!\nIs it any good though?\nWe would like to think of ourselves as a safe pair of hands!\nSo far, Lords of War has won the award for Best Strategic Card Games at the UK Games Expo - the UK's largest gaming convention - as well as being reviewed very positively by several websites and magazines.\nClick on the following names to read some reviews from these reputable websites - The Geek Syndicate, Beasts of War, Polyhedron Collider, The Little Metal Dog Show and Boardgames in Blighty.\nOr, alternatively, here are some testimonial quotes:\n\"This is a great game that is perfect for first timers or hard-core gamers because of the rules, the design, the art and the fun factor. 5/5\"\n- The Geek Syndicate\n\"Plenty of tactical depth and oodles of replay value... I can quite honestly say this is one of the best-looking games you'll ever play.\"\n- Beasts of War\n\"Lords of War is shaping up to be one of the best games of the year and is just starting its journey; I suggest you get on board.\"\n- Polyhedron Collider\n\"It demands a lot more thought than some games ten times the size and four times the price, but one thing you won\u2019t need to consider is whether to grab a copy or not \u2013 your answer should be a simple yes.\"\n- The Little Metal Dog Show\n\"Lords of War absolutely SHINES at what it is trying to be. The design is tight and the restraint shown to keep it simple and fast playing is to be commended.\"\n- Boardgames in Blighty\nAlso, to listen to an interview with Martin on The Little Metal Dog Show podcast, the UK-wing of The Dice Tower Network, please click here.\nThis is us, with our friends and family, after winning Best Strategic Card Game at the UK Games Expo 2013 for Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves and Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen.\nSecondly, like many of the best games, Lords of War is simple to pick up but very hard to master. Plus, it's pocket-sized, so you can take the battle wherever you like!\nPlus, everything you need to start playing comes in the box!\nMartin's sister, Rachel, with one of the youngest Lords of War players ever at Colours Wargames Show 2013. He was aged just 5! Naturally, he went on to beat his Dad...\nOver the last year, we've made tonnes of instructional videos about how to play the game, all of which are available here, and since Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves launched in December of 2012 we've had everyone, from 6 year old girls to 66 year old hardcore gamers playing and enjoying Lords of War.\nHere's an interview Martin gave almost a year ago, to UK gaming website EN World, at the launch of Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves.\nAnd to see a brief mention of Lords of War on On The Table, please skip to 8 minutes 28 seconds of this:\nCompared to Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves and Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen though, this new double-deck pack offers lots of new stuff - not least, new, original, awesome artwork by the award-winning illustrator Steve Cox!\nSo, what's new in this pack?\nLords of War: Templars versus Undead was developed at the same time as Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves and Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen. It was our hope to release all three at the same time, but as we've funded Lords of War ourselves so far that just wasn't possible!\nIn fact, if you want to learn more about the development of Lords of War, check out the Crafting of a Card Game series Martin has been writing for Beasts of War, which details some of the challenges involved in the process!\nAn early piece of concept art for one of the Undead Commanders.\nLike Orcs versus Dwarves and Elves versus Lizardmen, should this campaign be successful, Lords of War: Templars versus Undead will contain two complete armies, plus a brand new (and enhanced) battlemat and some all-new instructions.\nOur original thinking was that Orcs versus Dwarves, Elves versus Lizardmen and Templars versus Undead would offer 'Easy', 'Medium' and 'Hard' modes of Lords of War respectively. That's because, strategically speaking, Templars versus Undead contains a new mechanic - our first-ever 'moving' units - as well as crazy new combinations of attack arrows, the addition of which will be game-changing!\nThe two games out at the moment...\nIn terms of how they behave as armies, the Templars are the most heavily armoured army to appear in a Lords of War game so far (that's right - even tougher than the Dwarves!) with some new, super-long range archers.\nThe Undead, meanwhile, are just plain weird - the most varied army in terms of their shield and attack values, with some hard-as-nails units designed to suck up attacks and others that are all about the vicious multi-kills! \nOf course, like all the Lords of War armies, the cards are ranked and balanced, meaning the game is still fair and the armies can still be tweaked or blended together.\nHave no doubts though - these two new factions are forces to be reckoned with!\nWhat about the Lords of War extended universe?\nA piece of Lords of War: Templars versus Undead artwork, for your viewing pleasure!\nOf course, as with Orcs versus Dwarves and Elves versus Lizardmen, the release of Templars versus Undead would be supported by the release of a new season of 10 short stories telling the back story to the conflict (and tying their war into the Lords of War world).\nFurthermore, as the Kickstarter campaign progresses, new elements of the Lords of War Extended Universe will become unlocked - provided things go well!\nTo read the Orcs versus Dwarves stories, please click here.\nTo read the Elves versus Lizardmen stories, please click here. \nAdditionally, as those who follow us on Facebook will know, we would love to create a Lords of War graphic novel, some Lords of War animations and to release a Lords of War audiobook. \nIf the Templars versus Undead Kickstarter campaign is successful, all of these things, and much more, could become possible as part of our Stretch Goals...\nLords of War isn't available where I live! Tell me more about the Lords of War races which are already available...\nHere's some short introductions we filmed about the races we've released so far:\nAnd, lastly, I want someone who isn't you to teach me how the game works...\nYour wish is our command! Here is Mark Grimtree of Grimtree Games with an instructional video. Take it away Mark!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are three main stages to releasing Lords of War: Templars versus Undead, and these are:\n\n1) Finishing the Artwork\n\nWe have a painstaking attention to detail when it comes to the artwork - we believe each card should be really unique and special. We have already started roughing out the cards, but it will take some time to take everything to colour and make it print-ready.\n\nOur goal is to get this stage of the project completed in February.\n\n2) The Printing Process\n\nDepending on how successful this campaign is, we will need to inform our printer as to quantities, ensure that we're happy with the finish (so, signing off on the 'proofs') and pack up the various different combinations of Pledge Rewards for all the different people who have supported the project - hopefully from all over the world. This will take some time, but we hope that we will have this stage of the process done and dusted during March and into April.\n\n3) Shipping!\n\nDepending on where everyone is across the world, we will send out Lords of War: Templar packs as soon as we can. We would expect everyone to have them in April, with the main launch of the game taking place at the Salute Wargames Show in London on 12th April 2014.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #31", "update_userinfo": "Lords of War - the Templars and Undead Factions NEED YOU!!!", "update_content": "We have Templar and Undead armies who risk being overrun...\nJOIN US on our Fantasy Battles Kickstarter to not only get AWESOME new Lords of War Stuff, but ALSO - Kickstarter Exclusive Boosters which we are adding to pledges of over \u00a310 as we hit Stretch Goals..\nWith your help, we could get to 200% Funded and be able to afford EVEN MORE new Templar and Undead cards!"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #30", "update_userinfo": "Our NEW Lords of War Campaign NEEDS YOU!!!!", "update_content": "Hello you!

This includes the additional copies in the combo packs and international combo packs.\n*Dr. Boom is a game originally printed as one of our wallet-sized micro-games. Dr. Boom can be played using specific character cards that come within the box of Two Rooms and a Boom. All of our backers will get the instructions on how to play this devilishly clever 2-5 player social deduction game. That means this box now supports 2-30 players instead of just 6-30 players!!!\nTwo Rooms and a Boom! is a social deduction, hidden role game. Unlike other hidden role games, there is no need for a moderator. Each game is timed (so you know it won't last too long) and you can do whatever you want with your character card, including showing it to other players (that's identity verification). \nAt the beginning of a game, players are equally distributed between 2 separate playing areas (usually 2 separate rooms) and then each player is randomly dealt a facedown character card. There are 2 teams, the Red Team and the Blue Team. The Blue Team has a President. The Red Team has a Bomber.\nEach room has a leader selected by the players in that room. The leader chooses hostages (players who will be sent into the other room at the end of the round). \nThe game consists of 3 timed rounds. Each round is shorter than the previous round. At the end of each round, the hostages selected by the leaders will be traded into opposing rooms. If the Red Team\u2019s Bomber is in the same room as the President at the end of the game, then the Red Team wins. Otherwise the Blue Team wins. \n\"After demoing it for about eight hours, I can safely say that Two Rooms and a Boom is game of the year material.\" - Quintin Smith, Shut Up and Sit Down\n\n\"If you read my previous review for the recently released Mascarade, you will remember I suggested that it would likely be my top game of 2013. While I still love Mascarade, that previous comment only remains true because Two Rooms and Boom will not officially be released until next year.\" - Charlie Theel, 2D6.org\n\n\"Personally, I\u2019m eagerly awaiting the Kickstarter release of the game, and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a oft-played alternative to other late night gaming activities.\" - Ted Alspach, designer of Ultimate Werewolf, owner of Bezier Games, reviewer for Opinionated Gamers\n\"Taking party gaming to the next level...\" - Michael Fox, Little Metal Dog Show\n\n\"Unique take on hidden roles...\" - Drew, Giant Fire Breathing Robot\n\nRead some more great reviews and testimonials.\nThe reason Two Rooms and a Boom was nominated as \"the most anticipated party game of 2013\" on BoardGameGeek.com is because the game has been played worldwide by hundreds of people. The game is currently available for Print-n-Play (PnP) for free on our website, and will continue to remain free for all.\nAlso, we have an amazing group of loyal players that play Two Rooms and a Boom on the BoardGameGeek forums regularly. Chances are really good that they're playing a game right now! So go check out the game there and get in on a Play-By-Forum (PBF) action by clicking here. They're a friendly bunch that are always looking for more players.\nOne of the greatest things about Two Rooms and a Boom is that the game can get as complicated or simple as you want it to be. Besides the basic character cards, there are 36 advanced character cards that come with the base game! These advanced cards can drastically alter the way the game is played. Each of these characters have been thoroughly playtested and refined for your pleasure.

A group that consists of people of all ages and backgrounds, who are big into games that are super fun and super easy to host.\nBefore the launch of Two Rooms and a Boom, Sean and Alan successfully funded their first Kickstarter campaign for the documentary Boom or Doom, which chronicles their journey as a company and as friends to bring Two Rooms and a Boom to market.\nWe hope you like Two Rooms and a Boom as much as we do, and we really appreciate you taking the time to take a look at our project.

We've spent a whole heck of a lot of time planning the production of the game, choosing manufacturing and logistics partners, getting the most affordable shipping, and working out the minimum acceptable amount that we need to fulfill our promises to you. Whilst we are aware that Kickstarter campaigns have no guarantees, we just wanted to let our backers know how much we appreciate placing your trust and goodwill in us with your pledges. This is something we do not take for granted. Thank you for your support and thank you for being awesome.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThere are numerous risks associated with the process of delivering published games. If there is a delay in delivering our game, it is likely to come from one of 3 main sources, artwork, manufacturing quality control, and freight logistics. We have taken steps to ensure that delivery will be on time, but that cannot always happen on time. We see a wider release at Origins (Columbus game convention) as critical to the short-term and long-term sales success of Two Rooms and a Boom. We will not sell Two Rooms and a Boom at any game convention before our Kickstarter backers have been shipped their copies. It is therefore critically important to us that Two Rooms and a Boom ships before Origins! The sooner the better.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: This project is also part of a documentary. Tuesday Knight Games recently finished a succesful campaign called BOOM OR DOOM. This separate project was to fund the filming of \"the making of Two Rooms and a Boom.\" While Two Rooms and a Boom is our first \"game\" project, BOOM OR DOOM is our first \"film\" project.

Keep Running is Horror. Keep Running is a silly game about friends being chased by very hungry bear...\nAll these cards can (and will!) be yours. If you'd like extra copies of the game, simply add \u00a316 per copy to your pledge.\nDesigned by Sprocket Games' own Michael Fox, it's a quick-playing game based around the apocryphal tale of the two guys being chased by a bear in the woods. One of them briefly pulls up, grabs a pair of running shoes from his backpack and hastily throws them on. \"What are you doing? You'll never outrun it!\" yells the guy who is still moving. \"I don't need to outrun the bear,\" replies the first (who by now has rapidly overtaken his friend) - \"I just need to outrun YOU.\"\nSo, yes. This is the game of that, where players will be able to force and fight their way to the front of the pack, leaving their friends in their wake as The Bear gets ever closer (we've called him Harold, but just because he has a silly name it doesn't mean he's not hungry and terrifying). Each player has a rapidly diminishing hand of cards, one of which must be played every turn. Roll a die to see how fast you're going, but don't forget the modifier on the card you've put down! Some cards allow you to get more in your hand, keeping you in the game longer, while others will let you attack your opponents, pushing them ever closer to that ever-chasing bear. Run out of cards and you're no longer running - you're dinner! \nThere's no room for gentlemanly conduct when a bear is in pursuit.\nWe'll be using the funds raised in our Kickstarter campaign to get Keep Running! produced to the highest possible quality. Here at Sprocket Games, we really want to do our best to keep the whole project in the UK; everything possible will be sourced from providers in this country. This not only supports businesses here, it also means that we can keep an eye on things and deal with any issues that may crop up during the production process in a much quicker period of time (plus we've delivered Fox & Chicken and FrogFlip on time using these suppliers, so we trust them!). With all the cards, dice, instructions and shipping, those funds will be depleted pretty quickly! \nOh yeah. We also have to make bears.\n\"Portrait of the Designer with Harold the Bear\" (2013)\nWe've had a bunch of people ask us about getting add-ons for Keep Running, and after going through some numbers we're now able to offer the items you see above. First of all, if you've been involved in any Sprocket Games project previously you'll be well aware that we love our Button Badges - so we're doing a mini-set for this campaign! Witness the terror inducing Harold the Bear as he scares Pinky and Orange witless! Three badges will set you back \u00a33.\nOur previous campaign, FrogFlip, was a cracking game that really deserves a lot more attention. Not played it? It's the tale of a hungry frog (named Jake E. Bughop by the game's three-year-old co-designer) who is looking to eat as many flies as possible through the medium of flipping a wooden disc. It is awesome, and you can get a copy added to your Keep Running for \u00a35.\nFinally, our most popular request - Card Sleeves! You'll receive enough card sleeves for the whole Keep Running set, whatever level we hit and however many cards are included! Get them added to your package by increasing your total pledge by \u00a35.\nWell, yes. We tried to run a campaign for the game last December, but our dreams were a little too lofty. In response to that, we've worked hard to scale back the game to just four players, but have plans in place to expand it all the way up to eight players if the Kickstarter goes well. This means that we'll be able to create the game for a much lower amount, but the option to add more players will be entirely down to you, our backers. In fact, rather than hiding the numbers, we'll tell you exactly what targets we need to hit in order to add more players right here.\nWe've run games from four players all the way up to eight and are happy that it retains its balance. The base set will come with 68 cards and four dice, and for each additional character that we add to the game, you'll receive extra cards, specific dice in their colours and their own double-sided Flippy Card which represents their current status in the game - it's a terrible name but it seems to have stuck.\nWe've currently reached the point where we can produce a version of Keep Running that can handle eight players - our next target is \u00a34000 which will bring our bonus character, Purple, into the game! This will also mean we get to include some Kickstarter Exclusive cards that will allow Purple to enact sweet revenge upon her frenemies!\nAlso, as you're an intelligent person you'll realise that if all the characters are unlocked we'll be looking at nine of them. Nine? In a game that maxes out at eight players? Well, yeah - Purple is an extra character who you can switch out for any of the other runners to play the game, and if she's unlocked you'll also get extra cards to add to your set. These will be exclusive to backers of the campaign, so you can show off and say that you were there from Day One. We've also got plans beyond the Purple Promo Pack - here's hoping it's a huge success!\nOh, and if you'd like a quick How To Play, here's a video (using the first version of the prototype that doesn't have any art):\nPretty much everything is good to go. The art is done. We have our quotes from the printers and suppliers, so know precisely how much we'll be spending. Assuming everything goes well, we're aiming to get Keep Running! to your tabletop by January 2014, and having now run two successful projects (Fox & Chicken and FrogFlip), we reckon Sprocket Games can be trusted to deliver a quality game in a decent time period.\nYup - we've got a basic Print and Play version of the game available for you to try out for nothing. There's not much art in there - it's the version you see in the How to Play video, and we've got to hold back something... - and you'll have to provide your own dice and a few sheets of paper plus printer ink. It's recommended that you sleeve everything before you play. Click on this here link for the PDF and rules, have a play and let us know what you think in the comments! And if you really like it, consider pledging for the finished product!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAs with any project where you're relying on suppliers to deliver, our timescales are dependent on others doing their work. However, we've developed a great relationship with our printer over the last year and know that they do excellent stuff. The fact that they're in the UK also means that any issues can be dealt with in a matter of hours, not days or weeks! Our last project, FrogFlip, is currently shipping to backers worldwide, and we're really looking forward to seeing what people think - we're very pleased that we've managed to deliver it on time and are excited to show it off at Essen Spiel in Germany in late October!\n\nWe've worked hard to build a reputation with our previous games and will do our level best to continue that with Keep Running! - it's been tested thoroughly and we're sure you'll enjoy it.

This army doesn\u2019t use guns, or bombs, or even knives. Instead its weapons are speed, stealth, size, and rows of flesh-tearing teeth. They gather each year at the same location to eat and mate, then break up again to traverse the oceans until the next cycle. \nThis army poses no danger to those who stay out of its way. They make no organized attacks, lead no incursions into new territories\u2026 That is, unless they have leaders.\nNow, they have three. \nAs a group or researchers, wealthy teenagers, and Vietnam veterans make their way up the coast, the army of great white sharks gathers to feed on seals. The sharks, however, soon find themselves besieged by ruthless predators. As the sharks attempt to flee, three of their kind; bigger, deadlier, and more cunning than the rest, rise to the occasion, whipping this pack of great whites into a feeding\u2026\nWHAT?\nFrenzy is an original illustrated horror/thriller novel about one of the world\u2019s most beloved animals... sharks!

Additionally, the hardcover edition of the book will receive a new cover from a top talent in the industry (to be decided later).

That is why we have allocated an entire year to complete the book, making it available for late summer 2014. In addition, the artists chosen for the project have a reliable history and/or relationship with the production team, and are extremely excited about... sharks!\n\nThe only \"delay\" that we do expect is if we meet our stretch goal and are printing full color, hardcover books as well as the regular goal incentive versions of the book. The stretch goal rewards would have to be released later than 1 year as printing overseas and shipping takes additional time, but this would not affect the timing of the standard goals (The digital edition of the book and the black and white limited edition paperback).\n\nWe will be updating our backers on a regular basis to keep them in the loop. If we do run into delays, we will make sure that everyone is aware of them, but we are confident that we have allocated enough time in this project to see it come to fruition as planned!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Andrew E.C.

Each player picks their own superhero team from the many different heroes in the game, and then takes on their opponent in an exciting tactical battle with all sorts of crazy super powers! Combat is resolved with the unique \"power card\" system, designed to have all the excitement of dice-based combat, but with far less randomness. Whoever has the last hero standing wins control of Power City!\nGame design by: Phil Walker-Harding (Designer of Archaeology: The Card Game, Sushi Go!, Pirates of the Spanish Main: Shuffling the Deck and Dungeon Raiders)\nArt and graphic design by: John D-C (See more of John's awesome artwork at www.johnd-c.com)\nAdventureland Games has been publishing board and card games for over 5 years, and has recently released their latest game, Sushi Go! via a crowd-funding campaign.\nWhat you get: 35 hero cards, 18 power cards, 7 team cards, 10 weapon cards, 2 reference cards, 25 wound markers, 4 stun markers, rule book, hero almanac (including origin comic)... plus 3 Kickstarter-exclusive chrome foil hero cards and 2 Kickstarter-exclusive badges! And a wall chart poster featuring every hero! And a standalone mini comic (not pictured)! And you'll get it before anyone else in the world!\n\"As soon as I was done playing it, we played it again and again because it just has that quality of well, what if I had this team? The drafting is very fun! Gameplay is simple and easy.\" - Tom Vasel, Host of The Dice Tower and prolific game reviewer\n\"The game is fast and satisfying, you will be playing matches in a row. It has the right amount of depth without being complex, it's elegant in its design and it looks beautiful. The game really nails it in every aspect.\" - Yiorgos Golfinopoulos, review on BoardGameGeek\n\"There is plenty of re-playability in having different teams match-up against one another and the added depth of team drafting. I can also see it becoming something of a cult-classic beer 'n' pretzels kind of game at universities and gaming conventions.\"    - Neil Thomson, BoardGameGeek gold reviewer\nCheck out Tom Vasel's full video preview of the game:\nThe heart of the game is the hero cards.They represent one hero in the game, and are modelled after vintage trading cards. On the front side is a picture of the hero, and all the gameplay info about their powers. On the back are fun stats and an origin story! Sorry, we couldn't include a stick of gum!\nThe game comes with 35 unique and originally designed heroes, each with their own powers, personality and strategies. Each hero really does feel like a totally different character! Check 'em out:\nThere are 7 superhero teams in Power City, each with their own unique background and personality:\nAt the start of the game, each player assembles their team. You can either pick one of the set starting teams, or draft your team. Drafting allows you to put almost countless sets of heroes together to try out all sorts of crazy combos and synergies! Drafting works almost like a mini-game before the main event, as the players try to put their best possible team together.\nOnce you have picked your team, it's time to fight! There is a very simple structure to gameplay. The players take it in turn either bringing a hero into play, or using their hand of power cards to trigger one of their heroes' amazing super powers! \nAt the start of each turn, you may also move a hero, based on their movement ability. Getting your team into the right positions to attack is a big part of the tactical play. At the end of each turn, you'll draw a power card. You'll need to manage your hand and watch your opponent's power card discards carefully to attack at just the right time!\nClick here to download the full rules to read!

He is an international hacker who is believed to have been captured and handed over to the U.S. Government, suspected of leaking confidential governmental information.\nOleg has been incarcerated in one of the most notorious prisons in North America and stands accused of killing two innocent people. Oleg has been sentenced to serve two life long prison sentences. He has refused to join any organised gang.\nFor a full, in depth back story then don't forget to check out the back story DVD; see pledge levels for further details.\n4 Tile Map board (Board game)\nThe Oleg Story\u2122: Survival Back Story DVD\n6x40 Attack Cards\n6x40 Defence Cards\n1x40 Mission Cards\n1x40 Special Cards\n1x6 Gang Cards\n1x60 Commodity Cards\n24 Miniature Figures\n12 Dice\n2 Shuffle Pouches\n24 & 21 Prison Cell draw cards\nGuide Book\n1 Poster\nNote: A FREE The Oleg Story\u2122:Survival mobile/cell phone app is available to download. (You can play the game without the app, refer to rulebook)\nSee below in the app section for further information.\nFrom cell block invasions, to dealing with snitches, this game aims to give you an experience unlike anything you\u2019ve ever seen before. You can trade commodities, settle fights, create temporary alliances, shank opponents and more!\nThe Oleg Story\u2122: Survival is a character driven prison survival game, with a wide range of comprehensive detailed miniatures. You and six other friends can control and co-operate with 6 different rival gangs.\nThe stories of 618 Nation, Ryder Brotherhood, The Asian Family, The Mobsters, Russian Spies and, finally, non-gang members, also known as NGM, who are led by Oleg, are all in your hands. Remember, the NGM are a group of people who are not associated with any organised gangs; they are called the non-gang members.\nCan you survive the harsh realities of prison?\nPlay the game that allows you to control individual gangs and conquer other gangs. You will be able to play as existing gangs and engage in their active and ongoing battles. If you possess the right cards, you can also join an alliance with a fellow player and plan your attacks on other players.\nAccording to your gang's card, you start from a random cell, either a maximum-security cell or a general cell.\nYour starting cell is determined by the prison cell draw cards. If you are unlucky, one of your miniatures may end up in a cell that is in a territory controlled by a rival gang.\nMaximum-security cells can only house 2 inmates (2 miniature figures), so gangs that are confined to a maximum-security cell may end up with a displaced starting location that makes them more vulnerable.\nThe outcome of your dice establishes your movements on the map board. If you get a 6 and a 4 on your dice, then you have 10 grid movements, which you can share between your 4 miniature figures or, alternatively, give it all to a singular miniature figure.\nMission cards may instruct you to invade a territory, avenge an attack, organise a fight or start a riot. Be aware that prison snitches are everywhere and each mission card is revealed to everyone.\nOther gangs are in it too; it is up to you to ally or antagonise your opponents.\nWill you trade cigarettes to stay one step ahead of your opponents?\nDo not be fooled as each player will have attack, defence and speciality cards that they can use to fight. You won\u2019t know what they have so you\u2019ll always be in for a surprise.\nThe purpose of the game is to survive; the fall of all your miniatures means the fall of your gang. To win, you must eliminate your opponents and be the last one standing.\nP.S. Do not trust anyone!\nEach player will have their own agenda. While a mission card will instruct you about what to do, how you do it is all up to you. \nEach round lasts between 10 and 20 minutes, depending on the game difficulty that you choose; you can either download the app or do this manually. How long the game lasts depends on how quick the opponents fall.\nGame lasts for approximately 120min.\nThe Oleg Story\u2122: Survival has 24 colour coded, detailed inmate miniature figures, with each gang made up of 4 different figures.\nDetails\nEach player controls 4 distinctive miniatures and there are 6 gangs; that's 24 unique figures per game.\nYou can apply to become one of these miniatures by pledging (Look in the pledge section). Each group and gang has 4 miniature figures.\nThis free app simply allows you to time and monitor your progress\nRemember, The Oleg Story\u2122: Survival takes place in a secret, high security prison. Therefore, inmates are only given a 1 hour break each day; they are always locked down for the other 23 hours.\nDepending on the difficulty level that you choose, each 1 hour break can last between 10 and 20 minutes. Once this round is over, a new day begins.\nThe Oleg Story\u2122: Survival app is also compatible with the Android, Blackberry and windows tablets.\nThe Oleg Story\u2122: Survival app will be free to download once the campaign is over. This app is your timer and your journal; it will record how many days you have played.\nNote, you can play the game without the app. It is just an extra perk for all the backers who do not wish to manually time themselves, but rather wish to use the app to time their rounds.\nBefore you know it, months have passed.\nYou can always adjust your pledge level by clicking on the \"Manage Pledge\" button in the top right corner.\nIf you have reached this far then we thank you greatly for your time, we're almost finished :)\nWith your help, we can complete all the necessary artwork needed.

Developers can run out of time, producers can run out of money, key personnel can run out the door to join the circus, early ambitions can turn out to be impractical, and there's the situation where everything goes to plan but the plan stinks.\n\nWell, I don't think we're going to run out of time, because all the hard slog has been completed and we're now into perfection phase. I don't think we're going to run out of money, with your help, because the development, the music, the translations and the artwork are all paid for, and this funding is about putting you, the backer, into the game, and about putting the votes of our most loyal Kickstarter backers into practice. And our team is stable, experienced and besides we've already joined the circus.\n\nSince I started the first ever video games company in the UK, my team has never failed to deliver on time every time. This time it's no different and I believe the risk of failing to complete the project is very low indeed. If I happen to drop dead, go mad or disappear, then my colleagues will take over seamlessly.\n\nEssentially, this is the game I have wanted to make since 1983, ever since I ran up against the technical limitations to my future-vision first time round. All I had to do was wait 30 years for the technology to catch up, and for Kickstarter to put me in touch with you. I want to make this game not for myself, but for all of us. So, maybe the only real risk for you to consider is that Deus Ex Machina 2 stinks. \n\nRight at the start, thirty years ago, I took the risk of defying the norms and busting the templates of conventional gaming, by producing Deus Ex Machina as an interactive movie, played in real time to a perfectly synchronized rock music soundtrack. And now I pledge to do everything I can to turn that original vision into reality at last.\n\nMy heartfelt thanks to you for taking the time to read this. If you're considering backing the project then I hope you enjoy the ride and I look forward to welcoming you aboard with open arms.

(There's still time to get a few more pledgers for a bit more production value!) Oh, listen to me. I sound like a studio exec. 'More, more more!'\nTom and I want to thank all of you for contributing your hard earned money to this crazy cause. In these tough times it's especially significant that you gave so much. It underscores how important this mission is. We intend to uphold our part of the bargain with as much passion and zeal as you've shown in supporting this effort.\nMonsters are important. They've been with humankind since we became human. We're going to do everything we can to keep them with us, and most importantly, to keep them real.\nThank you. Thank you. Thank you.\nHD Posters are Here!\n Jeffrey Birch...

Our little movie's crew actually has 10 Oscar nominations, and 4 wins! It just gets better and better.\nPat McClung \nThis Academy Award nominated (ARMAGEDDON, TRUE LIES) VFX Supervisor is also a world-renowned model builder. Pat and I go back to the Roger Corman days! \nRobert Skotak\nThis guy is a master of table-top miniatures and has 2 Oscars to prove it! (ALIENS, TERMINATOR 2) Another Corman alum, Robert will assure that our miniature-scapes have all the texture and ghostly beauty the story requires. \n Dennis Skotak\nHe's also an Oscar winner (THE ABYSS) and the DP of of the duo. I learned a lot in my days as a young punk working for Corman. These 3 gentlemen taught me most of it! \nWhat is Harbinger Down?\nIn the spirit of sci-fi/horror classics, Alien and The Thing, Harbinger Down is a tense, claustrophobic full-length creature film that will feature only practical Animatronic and Makeup Effects. \nIf you're a fan of the art of Animatronics and Makeup FX, you know that this technique is overlooked by the big studios. I'm hoping that you will help us change that by supporting this labor of love. I will write and direct and ADI co-founder Tom Woodruff, Jr. will produce. \nOur company, Amalgamated Dynamics, will create the kind of Oscar caliber Creature Effects for which we are known.\nThe Story\nA group of grad students have booked passage on the fishing trawler Harbinger to study the effects of global warming on a pod of Orcas in the Bering Sea. When the ship's crew dredges up a recently thawed piece of old Soviet space wreckage, things get downright deadly. It seems that the Russians experimented with tardigrades, tiny resilient animals able to withstand the extremes of space radiation. The creatures survived, but not without mutation.\nNow the crew is exposed to aggressively mutating organisms. And after being locked in ice for 3 decades, the creatures aren't about to give up the warmth of human companionship.\nADI Concept Art by Paul Komoda\nProduction Philosophy\nWith over 60 years combined experience in the movie business, Tom and I have worked on many features big and small. On the big movies when there's a challenge, the solution is often to throw money at it. Response cards unfavorable after a test screening? Change the ending and spend 3 million on re-shoots. Smaller films have challenges too, but the solution is never to throw huge amounts of money at them. So you have to be smart. You have to pre-plan a bit more. And you certainly can't spend money on costly digital effects aimed at distracting the audience from noticing that the film just isn't working.\nHarbinger Down is a small film. A mere speck by today's studio standards. Sci-fi/horror films like John Carpenter's The Thing and Ridley Scott's Alien are our models. They're films that tell contained stories about characters you care about who are trapped in enclosed environments. When flight is not an option, the fight is more desperate. \nVisual Effects limitations back in the 80's meant that those sci-fi/horror filmmakers had to tell more psychologically engaging stories. They didn't have CGI to show expansive worlds, so they told stories that relied on well-developed characters in intense situations. It was those very limitations that made their films better.\nListen To Sir Ridley\nWhile we designed makeup characters for Ridley Scott's aborted version of I Am Legend, he told us that the original Alien suit restricted the performer's movements more than expected. That limitation led him to change the way he shot the creature, to a more horror-based approach. For instance, appearing in the flashlight beam held by Tom Skerritt was a way of avoiding having the Alien climbing or running. According to Ridley, embracing this limitation actually improved the film.  These days the 'solution' would probably be to digitally replace the Alien with an over-nuanced, hyper-active, CGI creation that looks like it belongs in a video game. And it wouldn't be as nearly as scary.\nThat won't happen in Harbinger Down. What some would call 'limitations', we will embrace. And the film will be better for it.\nNOTHING Digital at All?\nWe love digital effects. Digital FX artists are going through their own tough times and we support them.  But we do real FX, and we think they're still very powerful tools of film storytelling. Harbinger Down is our homage to the films that put this art on the map. Having said that, this is a contemporary film, so we'd be foolish not to take advantage of the latest digital tools. Shooting digitally saves money. We'll also use digital tools to help our animatronics look better. Rod/Rig removal and compositing of miniature puppets are acceptable uses of digital. Other appropriate uses of digital would be adding breath vapor, snow fall, compositing skies, etc. But please allow me to repeat: There will be NO digitally animated Creatures in this film. \nMiniatures are Awesome!\nYou bet they're awesome! We had great success in Tremors and Aliens with miniature creature puppets. Remember the Queen vs. Powerloader fight? We do! Tom and I were there! We also plan to use miniatures for exteriors of the trawler and the frozen sea scape. \nStop Motion Can Still be Scary\nLike most Makeup and Creature Designers Tom and I are huge fans of the late Ray Harryhausen. Aside from innovating new stop motion techniques, Ray was an unconventional artist who worked mostly outside the studio system. He was our idol when we were kids, and he's even more so now.  Don't be surprised if stop motion finds it way into Harbinger Down!\nWhere Does the Money Go?\nEven though 350k is a lot of money, when you're talking big studio VFX features, it's a pittance. The money will pay for equipment rental, cast and crew, the creatures, costumes, sets, sound editing and post production, etc. Keep in mind that we give up some funds in order to use this website. That's reasonable. And of course, it'll also cost us to fulfill our promises to our supporters, which will take resources too. This is a labor of love, but the more money we're able to raise, the more we'll be able to put up on the screen.\nWhere Will We Shoot?\nOur setting of a fishing trawler is a perfect, isolated location for a sci-fi/horror film. Cramped corridors, oily engine room, dank hold, frozen deck. Ice, steam and snow make for hauntingly beautiful set decoration. If you've ever seen the TV show Deadliest Catch, you know the kind of ship and setting we're talking about. \nA location shoot in Alaska will root us in reality and look really cool, but it'll cost more money than if we shoot on a dry-docked dinghy in San Pedro. If we can raise enough to build sets, we'll shoot most of the interiors right at ADI, like we did the trailer. Sets give us more control over creature FX rigging and lighting. It's up to you!\nADI Artists\nTom and I are fortunate to have the most incredible crew that can be built over 25 years. We've been on the front lines with these folks on many a project, and they always deliver. They are the ones who do the heavy lifting at ADI. The sculptors, illustrators, fabricators, painters, mold-makers, PA's, and office personnel who knock themselves out to bring you the coolest and craziest creature effects. \nLANCE HENRIKSEN!  \nIndeed. Genre legend Lance has been a huge supporter of our work since 1985. We created the effect of him getting split in half by the Queen Alien when he played Bishop in Aliens. He's not only a great actor, but a real friend. Did you know that Lance is also a ceramic artist? The man appreciates art built by hand. He loves the craftsmanship of what our ADI artists do so well. That's why he's so committed to star in Harbinger Down. Schedule permitting, of course. He's in demand for a reason!\nTom Woodruff, Jr. \nIn addition to being ADI co-founder, Tom is known as the premiere Suit Performer in the world, having worn and acted in films like the Alien franchise, X-Files: The Motion Picture, Pumpkinhead, Monster Squad and more. This time around Tom will be stepping in as Producer, bringing his considerable skills as an in-the-trenches-veteran film maker! \nAlec Gillis\n\nCheck out my full bio for the mundane details. What I really want you to know is that I will bring to this project all of my cumulative experience of 33 years in the industry. Not just as a Creature FX Designer, but in directing Second Units, Creature Units, short films and TV shows. It doesn't hurt to have worked along side luminaries such as James Cameron, David Fincher, Paul Verhoeven, Ridley Scott, Neil Blomkamp, Robert Zemekis, Joe Johnston, Nora Ephron, and Mike Nichols to name-drop a few. But what will really make Harbinger Down special is passion. I can't wait to get started!\nDoes My Pledge Help Save an Art Form?\nI don't know if Harbinger Down will impact the way studios see VFX. Then again, I feel we're on the verge of a renaissance of Practical FX. Either way, we can't abide by the status quo and let simply allow our art to die a whimpering death at the hands of dispassionate corporate functionaries. Pledges are immensely important, but so is spreading the word. Shout it from the rooftops! But do be careful. Only go on rooftops with railed balconies and non-slip flooring. You know what, maybe just stick to social media.\nThe important thing is to step up in whatever way you can. That's what Tom and I are doing. We hope you'll join us! \nADI Artist Jen is only happy when making monsters. If you buy this T-Shirt she can make monsters and we'll all be happy!\nActress, Camille is so happy just to be wearing the Limited Edition Crew T-Shirt!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMaking a feature is in itself a challenge, let alone one with limited resources. But we have a few things going for us that many others don't. We don't have to learn the process of film making, we know it already. And aside from having a top-quality Creature Shop at our disposal, we have a network of talented friends from our long careers who want to see this project succeed. We'll have support from professionals in all areas, including UPMs, Cinematographers, Set Builders, Sound Designers, Post Production facilities and more.\n\nIs our goal to get a theatrical release? Yes! Can we guarantee it 100%? No. But we can guarantee that we will do our level best to give fans of sci-fi/horror and Practical Creature FX what they've been yearning for. Giving you what you want actually increases our chances of a theatrical release. To studios who summarily ignore the wishes of the fans, that's crazy-talk. To us, it's a self-evident truth.\n\nMeticulously crafted Practical Creature FX can be expensive. We'll be putting in a lot of our own sweat equity to cut down on costs. This means we might take a bit longer to create the monsters than usual. Having said that, the more you pledge, the faster we'll be able to complete the film. We'll be able to afford to pay our crew overtime!\n\nWe think that you all get what we're trying to do here. But at the risk of being obvious, there are some things we need to say:\n\n-Gifts requiring your presence (tours, tickets to the screening, face/body casts, a role in the movie, etc.) mean you must pay for your own travel/lodging.\n\n-Some prizes include shipping. Some don't. If you buy one of the Creature prizes, you'll be responsible for shipping costs. Those costs are determined by size, weight and destination. Again, we suggest you swing by ADI and pick up your creature in person. You'll save dough! \n\n-We're pretty fun people, but we reserve the right to refuse the use of an inappropriate photo, character name, business name, etc. If we can't come to terms, we'll refund your money. But we'd rather come to terms!\n\n-Any age can attend the ADI tour, as long as minors (under 18) are accompanied by an adult (over 18 years old). Accompanying (paying or plus one) adult will be held responsible for the minor.\n\n-Must be at least 15 years old and up for castings (face/half body), or to attend the after party. Minor must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Accompanying (paying or plus one) parent/guardian will be held responsible for minor AND SIGN A RELEASE. This includes: casting (face or body) and/or after party.\n\n--Must be male and at least 25 years old to purchase the on screen death. \n\nWe hope you're excited to help us not only make a cool movie, but also to uplift an art form. Animatronics and Makeup FX have been pushed aside not because of audience disinterest, but because studios prefer an assembly line approach. You know that the traditional techniques still have a place in modern genre films, and so do we. We ask you to give us the opportunity to show it.

Developers can run out of time, producers can run out of money, key personnel can run out the door to join the circus, early ambitions can turn out to be impractical, and there's the situation where everything goes to plan but the plan stinks.\n\nWell, I don't think we're going to run out of time, because all the hard slog has been completed and we're now into perfection phase. I don't think we're going to run out of money, with your help, because the development, the music, the translations and the artwork are all paid for, and this funding is about knocking everything into shape. And our team is stable, experienced and besides we've already joined the circus.\n\nSince I started the first ever video games company in the UK, my team has never failed to deliver on time every time. This time it's no different and I believe the risk of failing to complete the project is very low indeed. If I happen to drop dead, go mad or disappear, then my colleagues will take over seamlessly.\n\nEssentially, this is the game I have wanted to make since 1983, ever since I ran up against the technical limitations to my future-vision first time round. All I had to do was wait 30 years for the technology to catch up, and for Kickstarter to put me in touch with you. I want to make this game not for myself, but for all of us. So, maybe the only real risk for you to consider is that Deus Ex Machina 2 stinks. \n\nRight at the start, thirty years ago, I took the risk of defying the norms and busting the templates of conventional gaming, by producing Deus Ex Machina as an interactive movie, played in real time to a perfectly synchronized rock music soundtrack. And now I pledge to do everything I can to turn that original vision into reality at last. \n\nMy heartfelt thanks to you for taking the time to read this. If you're considering backing the project then I hope you enjoy the ride and I look forward to welcoming you aboard with open arms.

But now we need your help to pull it off. \nEvery dollar we raise here will go directly toward enhancing our initial non-profit production. For instance, we want to increase our rehearsal time by two full weeks. We'd love to use a live band instead of pre-recorded sound. Even the wardrobe costs are high - what can I say, Patrick Bateman and his Pierce and Pierce colleagues don't wear cheap labels. \nSeriously, every single contribution (no matter the size) will make a tangible difference to our show. We hugely appreciate your support.\nThe Almeida Theatre\n\"ABANDON ALL HOPE YE WHO ENTER HERE....\"\nAMERICAN PSYCHO paints the shocking, funny and unsettling portrait of Patrick Bateman, a 26-year-old Manhattan investment banker with a designer lifestyle and a twisted mind. The novel was originally published in 1991 and has remained a part of contemporary pop-culture ever since. In 2000, Lionsgate released the celebrated film version directed by Mary Harron and featuring Christian Bale in his star-turning performance.\nA stage musical gives us the unique opportunity, through song, to go even deeper into the characters\u2019 psychologies than ever before. And what better character to investigate than one of modern literature's greatest and most enigmatic anti-heroes -- who also happens to be an avowedly passionate music-lover?\nOur show remains faithful to Bret Easton Ellis' world and his satirical treatment of the materialism and greed in this era of late capitalism. Roberto, Duncan and Rupert traveled back to Patrick Bateman's New York City of synth-pop, haute cuisine, and killer style; they returned with a musical's worth of '80s-tinged tunes to reinvent AMERICAN PSYCHO in this thrilling new medium.\nThe 1GB \"Patrick Bateman\" business card, pre-loaded with \"You Are What You Wear\" (featured in the video) plus TWO MORE original American Psycho demos by Duncan Sheik + high res iPhone/iPad skins of ALL THREE posters (below)\nTEST TEST\n\"THIS CONFESSION HAS MEANT NOTHING....\"\nThe Almeida Theatre and Headlong are two of the UK\u2019s most impressive non-profit theatre companies. They make extraordinary work and keep it universally accessible through funding from public agency Arts Council England, charitable grants and the generosity of individual and corporate donors.\n\nThey are the ideal partners for us on AMERICAN PSYCHO, with the artistic expertise and theatrical track record to be able to fully realize the vision and ambition of our creative team in the exclusive intimacy of the Almeida\u2019s 325 seat auditorium.\n \nThe budget for a new musical production of this scale is significant. As the commercial production company, we at Act 4 Entertainment are responsible for pulling together the extra funds to enable everything to take place at an enhanced scale, from extending rehearsals from the traditional five to seven weeks, to having a live band instead of pre-recorded sound.\n\nSo we\u2019re asking YOU, the fans of AMERICAN PSYCHO, to participate in making this production a huge success.  \nWe hope as many of you as possible will be able to see the World Premiere in London this December. Meanwhile, here are some awesome rewards to kick things off: original music from the show, exclusive T-shirts, limited-edition artwork, Patrick Bateman's \"business card\" and even a personalized and signed copy of the novel AMERICAN PSYCHO by Bret Easton Ellis himself. \nAmerican Psycho T-shirt, created exclusively for Kickstarter - choice of 3 designs\nLimited-edition Knife, Ax and Chainsaw 17\" x 33\" gicl\u00e9e prints (your choice), signed and numbered by artist Tony Yates\nLimited \"Red Knife\" series of the Vintage paperback copy of American Psycho, signed and personalized by Bret Easton Ellis\n\"THIS IS NOT AN EXIT....\"\nWe\u2019re also excited to be opening the doors to a behind-the-scenes \u201cmaking of\u201d the production in a new way that's made possible by Kickstarter.

The name of the game is whaling, but who can say what other mysteries the sea holds? Hunt whales to earn oil and work to assemble a personal crew of sailors; they will be needed as the journey unfolds. Cooperate with your shipmates; the dangers of the sea are less daunting to the sailor with true bosom friends. Oil is the currency of the game and it will prove dear, but what is material worth in the face of the white phantom? When the time comes for the final chase, only one player will earn the right to say \u201cCall me Ishmael\u201d.\nThe game is played using three custom decks with over 100 unique cards, two dice and 40 oil markers.\nThe Sea Deck contains adventures, creatures and chapters adapted directly from the book. These cards are drawn at the beginning of every turn and represent what the players encounter on their dangerous voyage - everything from whales and giant squid to foreign ports-of-call and pirates attacks.\nThe Sailor Deck contains the various sailors from Moby Dick, including Ishmael, Starbuck, Queequeg, and the infamous, monomaniacal Captain Ahab. Three cards from the Sailor Deck are dealt out to each player at the beginning of the game, representing their individual crews. As gameplay progresses, crews grow and shrink through the cunning of the player and the fickleness of the open ocean. Each Sailor has a physical strength and a unique ability that will help players successfully hunt whales and gather oil. Finding sailors with sympathetic abilities is key to crafting the ultimate whaling crew.\nThe Whale Deck contains the actions, defenses and attacks of the hunted Whales. When a hunt is initiated, players will draw cards from the Whale deck and must react to the raging leviathan. Only after dodging, negating, or surviving the actions of the Whale can a player attempt to strike the beast.\nHidden in the Sea Deck are various key Chapter Cards from the book which modify gameplay until the next Chapter is drawn. These Chapters also serve as a measure of progress through each game; players can decide the length of a game they want to play based upon how many Chapters they want to explore.\nGameplay is a mix of strategic decision-making, social brinksmanship, crew-building, and the sometimes cruel, sometimes glorious hand of fate. In the end, no player truly \"wins\" the game, but the last survivor of the Final Chase does earn the right to say, \"Call me Ishmael.\"\nIn-Progress Ruleset PDF\nJust as one of Melville's goals in writing the book was to bring landlubbers like us into the glorious and tragic world of the whaler at sea, our game encourages players to interact with the text in a new, exciting and immersive way.\nEven without a knowledge of the novel, playing the game will clue you into the relationships between key sailors and the various perils and processes of hunting whales in the 19th century.\nFor our art style, we scoured public and private collections for key imagery that would further bring players into the glory days of whaling. Found illustrations, daguerreotypes, prints and other imagery were integrated into many of the cards throughout the game, creating an important visual record of the world that Melville drew from.\nAs important as the visuals are, the game could not exist without Melville's voice. Every card features a choice quotation from the book, tying the action at hand to the grand tale itself.\nThe game features: \n-The Sea, Sailor and Whale Decks, containing over 100 unique cards\n\n-40 Custom Oil Markers\n\n-2 Dice\n\n-4 Fast/Unfast/Out Of Hunt cards\n\n-1 Measure/Final Chase card\n\n-Rulebook/Glossary\n\n\n  Anyone that donates the minimum amount will receive a printable PDF version of the game shortly after our campaign is completed.

See the FAQ section below\nHelp bring the smash indie hit of 2012 back!\nIndie Boards and Cards is very excited to announce a collaborative effort with Rikki Tahta & La Mame Games to make this fantastic game more readily available for everyone to enjoy.  We have everything ready, including the incredibly amazing artwork that this game deserves - all we need now is some help to fund the production and shipping to get games to you.\nThe Resistance: Coup\nIn the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new \u201croyal class\u201d of multi-national CEOs.Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of The Resistance have created discord, intrigue and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse.  But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.\nTo be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.  In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.\nIf you are not already familiar with Coup - here is a quick overview and review of the 1st edition from Tom Vasel, an industry leading reviewer  Note - this is 1st edition of the game. Rewards for this project will be for the same game (no changes to the rules), but the artwork & box will be different.\nThere are a number of other great reviews for this game, including these links:  Undead Viking Video Review, Trent Hamm - Written Review, I Slay The Dragon - Written Review\n\nRikki Tahta - the designer of Coup explains his game to the BGG team at Essen 2012.  Note - this is 1st edition of the game.  Rewards for this project will be for the same game (no changes to the rules), but the artwork & box will be different\nPromos\nCoup Promos - Every pledge reward level will include a set of cards for \"The Inquisitor\", an alternative role card that can be used in place of the game's \"Ambassador\" role.  And as a stretch reward, we are also including an Inquisitor token for The Resistance.  Note - Each copy of Coup you pledge for will come with a set of these promos. \nThe Resistance promos - Also included in every reward package are dsytopian themed Merlin & Assassin cards. If you are a fan of the art from The Resistance, and want to add these roles from The Resistance:Avalon, you'll love these promos.  Note - Each copy of Coup you pledge for will come with a set of these promos.\nThe Resistance Avalon Promos - if your pledge rewards include The Resistance: Avalon, you'll also get a copy of the cards needed to play the Excalibur and Lancelot variants of this game.\nAlso included in every reward level will be the two fixed cards for The Resistance Avalon.  These cards correct the misspelled word \"Unkown\".\nAdd-ons\nExcalibur/Lancelot promos - these are included at no additional cost for each copy of Avalon you are receiving as part of your rewards ($35 & $50 pledge levels). If you want to add the Excalibur/Lancelot promo cards on their own you can do so by adding $6 to your pledge, as an alternative you can get these from the boardgamegeek.com store for the same price.\n\nMayDay Premium Sleeves in the 65mm x 100mm size can be added to all reward levels for an additional $3.99. These are high quality sleeves perfect for keeping secret information secret. The sleeve packs contain 80 sleeves - and Coup with promos is at 30 cards now, so you will have some extras to share with your friends or to use on a second set of cards.\nExtra copies of Coup for the ten packs - The highest of our reward tiers, you can add additional copies of Coup for $12 (US shipping) or $15 (Anywhere outside of the US). This is only available on the ten pack.\nExtra copies of Coup for the $35 & $50 reward levels - US SHIPPING ONLY!!!! - You can add additional copies of Coup for $13.  This is only for shipping to the US, the reason is that this causes a big jump in international shipping rates as the package would now weigh more than four pounds.\nAdding The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon for the six & ten packs - you can add either of these games for $15 (US Shipping) or $20 (Anywhere outside of the US). This is only available on the six & ten packs. These copies will be sent at the same time as your copies of Coup.\nAdding extra copies of The Resistance & The Resistance: Avalon for the $35 & $50 reward levels - US SHIPPING ONLY!!!! - you can add either of these games for $15 These copies will be sent at the same time as your copies of Coup.  This is only for shipping to the US, the reason is that this causes a big jump in international shipping rates as the package would now weigh more than four pounds.\nTo include any of these add-ons - first click the \"manage pledge\" button, then increase your pledge amount without changing your reward level.\nAt the end of the project kickstarter will send you a project survey (about 6 weeks before games are ready to ship) - in that project survey I will capture all the information I need to get all the information that I need to get your rewards to you including numbers and composition of your add-ons.\nAll the Add-ons are priced per unit (eg, Add-on The Resistance $15/$20 is for one copy of the game).\nStretch Rewards\nWe'll introduce a limited line of stretch goals for this project - a combination of promos and exclusive promos cards featuring alternative art.  These promo cards will highlight your contribution to this project and I am sure will be highly sought after the project ends.  \n$10K - Box upgrades - see update #1, we are upgrading the game box with a very elegant and attractive foil finish box.\n$15K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Captain - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$20K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Contessa - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$25K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Ambassador - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$30K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Duke - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game.\n$35K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Assassin - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game. At this point your copy of Coup will have enough cards to play 7 or 8 players!\n$40K - Exclusive promo - alternative art card for the Inquisitor promo - this is an extra role card with unique art that won't be part of the retail game (the Inquisitor promo won't be in the retail game either!). At this point your copy of Coup will have enough cards to play 7 or 8 players with either the Ambassador or the Inquisitor roles!\n$50K - The Resistance token of \"The Inquisitor\" - This is an optional role for Don Esridge's The Resistance, familiar to Avalon fans as the \"Lady of the Lake\".\n$70K Extra Set of Coup Roles -  a second set of the Exclusive Promo role cards that have already been unlocked.  With these extra cards you can play up to 10.\n$90K More alternative art - We'll replace the 6 role cards from the $70K reward with new alternative art cards.  This means that you can either play up to 10, or you can play up to 6 with unique art on every card.  These are also Exclusive Promo cards.\n$110K \"kickstarter edition\" game box -  Final details aren't worked out, but I am thinking that we would include the kickstarter logo on the box side and on the box back (in place of the bar code).  This will only be done for the first printing - so it will be another very unique item that you can only get if you were part of this project (or getting this game in Essen 2013).\nKickstarter editions of the game will feature a dual sided player aid. One side will have the all the roles for the retail version and the other side will replace the ambassador with the inquisitor. Just another small way to thank you all for your support and distinguish the version of the game that you are getting as backers.\n$130K Coin Upgrade - an upgrade to foil backed coins that feel very futuristic. We are still experimenting with different holo foils to find the one that is going to work the best - but here is what we are looking at for the $130K stretch reward upgrade coins:\n\nNew stretch rewards are added as they are unlocked.  Promos are things that aren't going to be included in the retail version of the game. Exclusive promos are items that are even more limited than our standard promos, and will only be available through Indie Boards and Cards (at events like Essen for example) or our direct representatives. We aren't limiting any of these promos to kickstarter, but it's still not going to be easy to get the exclusives outside of kickstarter.\nWhat is the \"World of The Resistance\"\nIndie Boards and Cards started by publishing three games in 2010 - the biggest success of those games was The Resistance designed by Don Eskridge.  The Resistance is a game of secret identities, deduction and deception for 5-10 players.  The game play instill a deep sense of mistrust among the players, and makes for a great time among friends and families.   The setting for The Resistance is a dystopian future, but a rather bland future.  As the popularity of The Resistance continues to grow there have been more and more requests to develop a comprehensive back story for the game.  Coup is the first step in this direction, and I am optimistic that we will see the story behind The Resistance provide more background for future games from Indie Boards and Cards.\nIf you are not familiar with the game play of Don Eskridge's The Resistance, you can get no better explanation then watching this celebrity filled cast playing the game:\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThree reasons really. First \u2013 while sales of the first edition of Coup were good, and I am very optimistic about this edition of the game - I am just not sure that the game is going to be  popular enough to print in the minimum required print runs and sell them via distribution.  \n\nSecondly, it is all about cashflow. The time between when I pay for games (now) and when I get paid for them is upwards of 7 months, and that is in the best of circumstances. That takes a lot of money sitting in inventory, and that isn\u2019t something that we have a lot of right now.\nThirdly, I really wanted to be able to get a lot of little extras made for the biggest fans of the game - the promos for Coup, The Resistance and The Resistance: Avalon.  Kickstarter really is a great platform to do that through.\nWhat are Kickstarter Funds used for?\nYour pledge dollars go directly into making the pledge rewards, and shipping them to you.  We have invested in getting the project to this point where its ready, your support ensures that we have the cash to pay our printers to make the games - the most costly part of game production. \nWhat are the shipping costs to Canada?\nKickstarter only lets you list one international shipping charge, so if you are getting the $35 or $50 pledge rewards sent to Canada - please select \"Ship to the US\" (this is a manual process) and then add the extra $ to your pledge as follows:\n$35 Pledge Levels - $15 extra (Pledge $50 respectively for this reward level)\n$50 Pledge Level - $20 Extra (pledge $70 for this reward level)\nInternational Shipping - Outside of Canada - Kickstarter should Charge this automatically\n$35 Pledge Levels - $20 extra (Pledge $55 respectively for this reward level)\n$50 Pledge Level - $30 Extra (pledge $80 for this reward level)\nAbout Indie Boards and Cards\nIndie Boards and Cards started in 2009 as an independent publisher of great game designs. In 2010 we released three games, all of which have been well received by critics and fans alike. Our biggest seller has been The Resistance - a game of secret identities, deception and deduction that is now or will soon be available in 20 languages around the world. In 2011 we released Flash point: Fire Rescue, which has also been very well received and now available (or soon to be) in 10 different languages.  In 2012 we released the humorous game of certain death - Gauntlet of Fools.   Be sure to look for The Resistance, Flash Point: Rescue, and Gauntlet of Fools wherever games are sold. If your favorite game store doesn\u2019t carry our games, please ask them to!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nIndie Boards and Cards has successfully delivered a number of previous kickstarter projects to thousands of supporters. We expect that our previous experiences will enable us to also deliver this project on time. That said there are always complexities and considerations in a project of this scope that may cause delays. Indie Boards and Cards will use contract manufacturing to make this game, freight forwarders to get games through customs and 3rd parties like the US Post Office and FEDEX to ship the games to you - we don't control everything and there are lots of opportunity for delay. other conditions may also cause delays - earthquakes, alien invasions, asteroid attacks, zombie plague are but a few of the myriad of reasons we may not be able to deliver this project in a timely manner.\n\nMy pledge is that I will deliver what I said and have written this project page as concisely and clearly as I can. So please read everything on this page - every kickstarter project is unique, and the commitments I am making to you regarding this project are completely defined here.\n\nA particular challenge to a project like this is negativity - I love your input, and really enjoy all the great suggestions that come from the large majority of our supporters. I promise that if you keep your comments positive and proactive that the project will get more in the way of stretch goals and get your rewards to you sooner. I can't include all the suggestions that I get, nor can I give you specific feedback other than noting that I do read all the comments and messages sent to me. So think before you post - threats, ultimatums and entitlement are unlikely to get you what you are asking for, and very likely that everyone else (myself included) will get less. Have an issue? Send me a note - and please don't support us if you aren't satisfied with what the project is returning to you.

Many gamers may have seen and enjoyed recent examples of great turn-based gaming, but might not be aware of classics like Battle Isle or Advance Wars. Have you ever wondered what games of that calibre would look like today?\nWell, we did. And as a result, we decided to bring back this great genre with its unique gameplay experience. For ourselves, for you and for all other gamers out there interested in turn-based strategy.\nPre-Alpha Screenshot (February 2013)\nSo, let's do this. Let us develop something we are all passionate about: turn-based gameplay, pure and simple; a strategy game for experienced gamers. A stand-alone game for PC, Mac and Linux, that can also be played in all relevant browsers via plug-in.\nWith Battle Worlds: Kronos you'll get:\nTrue, challenging turn-based strategy gameplay.\nGet the FULL game in a box or as a download, nothing less.\nNo DLC scheme, no micro-transactions.\nNo DRM.

For the Rebels,  make do with what you\u2019ve got and fight a guerilla war. Together both campaigns will allow for more than 30 hours of gameplay. \nSingle Player Challenge Maps - Test your skills in different combat scenarios and keep track of your progress.\nLive Multiplayer - Battle your friends live on the interent or via hot-seat.\nAsynchronous Multiplayer - Take all the time you need and consider your moves .

The system allows you to continue the match anytime and anywhere you want.\nStrong AI - A clever AI that considers gameplay on various tactical and strategic levels as well as individual enemy characteristics will challenge even experienced commanders. \nMap Editor - A powerful editor to create your own maps and missions (Windows only).\nThere will be around 40 different units and buildings in the game, many of which can be upgraded to obtain new capabilities\nWhat Are The Core Gameplay Mechanics?\nStaying true to turn-based strategy, Battle Worlds: Kronos is all about using your units and resources to the greatest possible effect. In order to win, you will need to consider factors like the positioning of units, attack range, armament and equipped upgrades.Victory or defeat - your tactics will decide.\nWe are using in-game cutscenes to tell the story of the campaings.\nAll units in the game have a unique character, setting them apart from all other units and giving them well-defined strengths and weaknesses. You can further individualize them by assigning specific upgrades. Most units allow for two leveled upgrades, each with two options to choose from. The campaign sometimes allows you to take some of your victorious units with you and improve them over the course of several missions.\nUpgrade units according to your personal needs and style of play!\nMultiplayer, Community & Tournaments\nMultiplayer: While you will be able to battle your friends (and foes) in realtime, just like you are used to in other games, it's the asynchronous multiplayer mode that really gets us going. Playing Battle Worlds: Kronos across platforms and in asynchronous mode means that the game is with you anywhere, anytime. You can spend days and weeks fighting epic battles against opponents all over the world. Play a turn, transfer it to the server and let your enemy make his move. Take your time while taking turns and fighting for victory! For us, this is the coolest aspect of the game.\nCommunity: We will gather a community of turn-based strategists around the game, supporting it with a forum, a match-making system and a game ladder system. Additionally, we will provide a game editor, which will enable the community to create their own maps for single or multiplayer battles.\nTournaments: As a recurring highlight for the community we are planning tournaments of different sizes, where players can compete beyond the game ladder.\nWhat is the schedule?\nAs early as one month after the successful close of the Kickstarter campaign you can play your first alpha version of the game - if you backed the project with $75 or more. Other backers will be able to join the closed beta version before open beta starts. We are planning to release the game end of 2013. \nOur Stretch-Goals\nThanks to the community for providing ideas for our stretch goals!\nWho Is KING Art And Can You Guys Really Do It?\nKING Art is an independent game developer from Bremen, Germany. KING Art was founded 12 years ago and we have worked on over 40 games projects, around 10 of them the same size or bigger than \u201cBattle Worlds: Kronos\u201d. So yes, we can do it. We have extensive experience with projects of this kind. Most of our projects had been contract work for publishers. But as often as possible we do projects close to our heart like the adventure game \u201cThe Book of Unwritten Tales\u201d and now \u201cBattle Worlds: Kronos\u201d.\nMost of us have worked together for years - oddly enough we still like each other.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nOnce upon a time we created an alpha stage version of the game and tried to find a publisher to finance the project. Unfortunately, most of the industry did not see the potential, or if they did, they offered us a budget that would have been too low and meant cut-backs on our vision of what the game could be. Kickstarter offers us the opportunity to make the game we have envisioned - all options included. And not by order of a publisher, but backed by you, the players! If we can realize this, it was well worth the wait. \nAbove: Artworks of units from the first Battle Worlds: Kronos prototype\nIs The Budget Big Enough To Make A Great Game?\nNope ;-) Sorry, it just isn't. The full game with all the features we want will cost more than the sum we want to raise through Kickstarter. The Kickstarter share is only about 1/3 of the whole thing.\nWe've spend as much of our own money on the game as possible and we'll work long evenings and on the weekends for this project. But for outsourcing costs (music, effects, some of the arts, voice acting) we need cash. And that's where we need your help. Your contribution will make this project possible, it will ensure our vision of a great game.\nI Want To Help! What Can I Do?\nFirst of all we have to mount the financing of the game. So: Please back the project generously, and spread the word about it!\nAs a backer you have the opportunity to actively participate in the development of the game and collaborate with others on our homepage  www.battle-worlds.com.

Nobody knows just how it works, but it\u2019s always, always right. (You may recognize this concept from our #1 bestselling short story collection, which is also titled, COINCIDENTALLY, Machine of Death.)\nThe book was about exploring the existential ramifications of the existence of the machine in worlds otherwise much like our own. It\u2019s a thoughtful, sometimes funny, sometimes sad, meditation on fate.\nThe GAME is about flinging SHARKS from CATAPULTS in order to kill imaginary people. It\u2019s basically a game of Mousetrap or a Road Runner cartoon, except that it\u2019s TOTALLY WITHIN THE RULES to create a QUICKSAND GENERATOR in a TREEHOUSE in order to DROWN A CHILD. (That was a real game we played.)\nAn example death prediction.\nSo if you can know, cryptically but with 100% accuracy, how a given person will one day die...\nAnd you\u2019re an assassin, and you want to make that day today...\nThen you have a puzzle to solve. Given a person who is slated to die by BANANA PEEL, but is currently in (let's say) a space station...how do you make it happen?\nOh, and I forgot: all you have at your disposal is a tool, a liquid, and a piece of furniture.

They will go free (digitally or physically) to every backer. They will not become part of the permanent game; they'll become a separate expansion pack, but if you pledge during the Kickstarter, you'll get that pack tossed in your shipment for free. They will be of various different card types.\nBlank game cards \u2013 these were unlocked by the 90K goal and are now part of the permanent game! These allow you to customize your own copy of the game, if you like. Each base game will come with 20 blank cards of various types, and you can buy extra packs later on too.\nExpansion cards \u2013 these are six sets of 50 additional death cards that can add variety to your game, and 100 Intel cards featuring target details. You can get them \u00e0 la carte on our Add-On page, or get the SIDECAR tier, which gives you a second game box containing all the expansion cards that this campaign creates. (The Deluxe Box gets you all these cards as well.)\nBacker-created cards \u2013 these are cards created by backers to the INFAMY, TYCOON, and FROM ABOVE tiers. They're permanently added to the game as well!\nAll told, right this moment there are over 900 total cards available!! Here's a more detailed description and breakdown:\n\nFeel free to take advantage of our Add-On page! This is in case you want some stuff \u00e0 la carte, things we haven\u2019t included in the rewards \u2013 different T-shirts, multiple copies of the game, etc. If you want to Add On something to your pledge, here\u2019s how:\nFirst, start with a pledge tier that has some of the stuff you want. For example, if you want the game plus a different T-shirt, you\u2019ll want \u201cGOT PLAYED\u201d, which is just the game itself. This is your \u201cbase tier\u201d.\nGo to our Add-On page and select the other stuff you want. (In this example, you\u2019d select the different T-shirt.) The Add-On page will then show you the amount you need to ADD ON to your pledge to get the T-shirt.\nCome back here and make or increase your pledge. Select your base tier \u2013 in the example, \u201cGOT PLAYED\u201d \u2013 and then manually add the additional amount from the Add-On page. This way your single pledge can cover both the base tier and your add-on stuff. (International buyers do have to pay both shipping charges, sorry!) Go on to confirm your pledge.\nBack on the Add-On page, submit the form there so we get your Add-On information! This is transmitted to us separately, but we need both that form and your Kickstarter pledge, otherwise we can't match things up and matters get all sideways.\nIt\u2019s a little complicated, but so is life. If you have questions you can message me through Kickstarter, or leave a comment on this update. Or, email us via the MOD site.\nYou can also use the Add-On page to calculate how to make a pledge to the campaign via PayPal, if you can\u2019t (or would rather not) use Kickstarter. But those pledges won\u2019t appear on our Kickstarter page, so we\u2019d prefer that method to be a second choice, and used only if necessary. \nHooray for TECHNOLOGY!\nI\u2019m David Malki ! \u2013 I\u2019m the creator of the comic strip Wondermark, as well as one of the editors of the original Machine of Death book and its upcoming sequel, This is How You Die (coming out in July). Ever since I first designed and printed a series of death prediction cards as a promotion for the book, I knew it felt like there was a game in this concept eager to come out. Over the last year and a half, I\u2019ve been writing, play-testing, tweaking, play-testing again, conferring with friends and experts, tweaking further...and now, I have something I\u2019m really, really proud to share with you.\nMy friend Kris Straub, the creator of Chainsawsuit and Broodhollow and one of the talents behind Penny Arcade\u2019s Blamimations, helped me refine the rules, and did a ton of original art for the game. All the characters and logos on the cards are his. Kris and I have had a lot of fun playing this game \u2013 it can get really wacky really quickly.\nIt didn't work.\nWe\u2019ve also enlisted our friends to write jokes and help playtest: Ryan North, Zachary Sigelko, Matthew Bennardo, James Sutter, and many others. So tucked into one tidy package is the combined creative efforts of many fine individuals!\nMachine of Death, the book, was a 2010 story collection, based on a Dinosaur Comic by Ryan North. It contained 34 short stories by writers from all over the world, and the day it was released, it shot to #1 on Amazon \u2013 the first independent anthology ever to do so. It was later named one of Amazon\u2019s Top 10 Customer Favorites for sci-fi & fantasy in 2010.\nThis photo is from when we offered the book to a bird\nSince then, the book\u2019s gone through seven printings and been translated into eight languages! We\u2019ve gone on to stage fun events all over the US and Canada, and at one of them in 2011, we opened submissions for a second volume. \nNow, after receiving nearly 2,000 stories from writers on all seven continents, we\u2019re excitedly awaiting the release of This is How You Die, due out this July from Grand Central Publishing.\nNever were there a more handsome pair of siblings.\nSo the game\u2019s an adaptation of the books?\nYes and no. Every story in the books is independent of the others \u2013 each individual world explores the idea of the death-predicting machine, but doesn\u2019t otherwise share continuity with any of the others. Machine of Death stories have been set in the past, present, or future; have featured machines large, small, or in-between; have told stories of the machine\u2019s invention, or postulated a world in which the machine is old and forgotten.\nThe game is the same way. It doesn\u2019t reference any existing story in particular. If you can picture a machine that can predict how you\u2019ll die, that's all you need! You\u2019re now 100% caught up and can dive right into the game. (Of course, if you\u2019d like to read our book anyway, it\u2019s available as a free PDF and audiobook podcast on our site.)\nThe game where you can do ANYTHING, including THESE THINGS\nObviously you can get the game itself! We also have a digital-only version in case you want to print it yourself. Above that, you can get copies of our book; a Kickstarter-exclusive T-shirt & poster; and even a fancy Deluxe Edition game box.\nIn the game, you get \u201cBlack Market Gift Cards\u201d to obtain various types of items to use in your assassination plans. For example, you can buy animals using a gift card to the smelly beastporium known as Zoo-in-a-Can! (Just off I-210 at Haven.) While allegations of health code violations at Zoo-in-a-Can have yet to be proven, our Zoo-in-a-Can T-shirt may have started its life as white.\nOur custom-made wooden Deluxe Edition game boxes feature individual laser-etched numbering and come with, in addition to the base game and any stretch goal cards, all expansion cards available separately (in other words, every single card, no matter what). It also comes with a Certificate of Authenticity signed by me & Kris, and a blank Assassination Mission Log for you to record the best details of all of your games \u2013 fitted into a hand-crafted box that holds everything perfectly!\nWe've also added the Sidecar Box \u2013 a second game box containing all the expansion cards. The base game comes with ~300 cards, and now thanks to stretch goals, every backer will be getting Webcomics Pals cards too. The Sidecar Box gives you a place to put the Webcomics Pals cards, and also included will be every expansion card available \u2013 no matter how many are added \u2013 for a flat price. Currently this is 300 additional death cards + 100 Intel Cards.\nSo either the Deluxe Box, or the base game + Sidecar Box, will get you every game card we offer in this Kickstarter!\nthe can would have to be quite large\nmmm, needs more stuff going on\nEvery box is HAND MADE by a FUTURE CORPSE\nThere are also ways that you can INSERT YOURSELF into the game, by contributing new death cards that'll become part of the game itself, or getting a likeness of yourself (drawn by Kris) in the manual as a victim! And perhaps MOST EXCITINGLY, we\u2019ve gotten approval from Grand Central to offer a small handful of ADVANCE COPIES of This is How You Die. :O\nFirst off, we\u2019ll be really, really thrilled! Creating the game has been such a fun process and I'm so excited to share it with you in this way. But we\u2019re hoping this game can become EVEN MORE great, through stretch goals. We\u2019re hoping to improve the packaging with a cooler box; add cards to the game; get comics artists to contribute special cards; and be able to print & give away additional stuff to all backers (including previews of the upcoming book This is How You Die).\nBut one thing at a time. We\u2019ll cross that bridge if we come to it! If it does happen, THIS IS THE POINT ON THE PAGE WHERE WE\u2019LL DISCUSS IT.\nUPDATE: IT HAPPENED \u2013 and we moved the stretch goals up near the top of the page!\nZach wrote this joke.\nOver the nearly a decade that I\u2019ve been doing webcomics, I\u2019ve designed and shepherded to production dozens of books and different types of products \u2013 mostly my own, but I also work for TopatoCo heading up their book production department. I\u2019ve had a hand in designing and printing books for Questionable Content, AmazingSuperPowers, Dinosaur Comics, Nedroid, Gunshow, This Modern World, Homestuck, and, most elaborately, the recent Sweet Bro & Hella Jeff super-weird limited hardcover. So I\u2019ll be using that experience and vendor contacts to make this game something really nice that you\u2019ll be proud to own.\nI\u2019ll also be working with TopatoCo\u2019s new subsidiary, Make That Thing, a dedicated fulfillment agency specifically for campaigns like this. TopatoCo has a warehouse full of people who do nothing but receive pallets and ship packages all day long for over fifty of the internet\u2019s top artists (including me, Kris, and Ryan). So they and I will be working together to ensure that all the products and rewards from this campaign will be produced and shipped to you as quickly and efficiently as possible.\nI AM! I'm GONNA make that thing!!\nThat\u2019s cool, I totally understand! I\u2019m the same way. Here\u2019s the deal \u2013 I wanted to make a game that lets me do the things I like to do anyway: tell crazy stories with my friends, make up ridiculous and absurd scenarios for us to laugh about, and generally GET CLOSER AND BOND with OTHER HUMAN BEINGS through the HEALING POWER OF LAUGHTER.\nIt may be shocking to assert that a card game that is essentially about MURDER can accomplish that. NONETHELESS, I HAVE ASSERTED IT. I\u2019m the sort of guy who can\u2019t let an idea go \u2013 when it occurs to me, I have to chase it, I have to wrestle it into submission, I have to make it real. And I\u2019m a perfectionist. So it is SO gratifying to start with a vague idea, spend a lot of time and effort carefully crafting it into something that I think is really fun and special, and then see it come to fruition. \nThrough this campaign, I\u2019ll get to see if people agree with me that this sounds like a pretty fun thing! I\u2019m nervous but EXCITED because I know this game is great. I really hope you think so too!\nWith YOUR help...this game WILL exist!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI\u2019ve got a lot of experience working with complicated designs and printing companies, so I\u2019m confident that I can shepherd this from prototype to actual finished product. However, one of the doors we\u2019re leaving open is the option of adding extra content to the game (depending on how the campaign does), which means it might take some extra time getting all that created & collected. In the last couple of years, I\u2019ve put together two anthologies with over 60 contributors each, so I understand the coordination this sort of thing requires, and I'll be doing my best to stay on top of it.\n\nIn addition, because we\u2019ll be printing overseas, it\u2019s possible there will be shipping delays, due to customs or other elements out of our control. To try and mitigate that risk, we\u2019ve built in some buffer time to our expected delivery dates, and so if all goes well, we\u2019re in a good position to beat those estimates. In addition, we\u2019re working with a manufacturer who does this sort of thing all the time, so hopefully there shouldn\u2019t be many surprises.\n\nIf this campaign does extraordinarily well, we\u2019re ready for it -- the warehousing and fulfillment staff at TopatoCo/Make That Thing has been shipping hundreds of packages a day since 2003.\n\nIf a meteor falls on my house the day the Kickstarter ends, I don\u2019t know that I have a plan in place to surmount that particular challenge \u2013 but I will certainly have a long list of people (all of you) who should definitely NOT IN ANY WAY be considered suspects.

If you haven\u2019t backed it yet, you should give it a try...all the cool kids are doing it. \nAnd it feels good.\nA SUPERHERO NOVEL WITH A TWIST\nThe Mark Millar endorsed, sci-fi superhero novel ARENA MODE is currently one of the most popular publishing titles on Kickstarter! Wanna know more? Read on, true believer...\nYOUR TOP 5 QUESTIONS:\n1. So this is what, a book?\nThat's right. When I was your age, television was called books. \n2. Has it got any sports in it?\nAre you kidding? Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, explosions, chases, escapes, four letter words...and it\u2019s written by none other than Blake Northcott.\n3. Doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake. So who the heck is Blake Northcott?\nShe\u2019s a writer, Twitter-er, and occasional blogger. She wrote two Amazon Kindle bestsellers: 'Vs. Reality' and 'Relapse'; both debuted at #1 in the sci-fi/superheroes categories in the Unites States and the U.K.\n4. Alright, so what is this book about?\nYou can check out the Prologue here, or read the summary below:\nIn the near future the government announces that superhumans are real. But unlike the iconic heroes of comic book fiction, they never put on capes and venture out to save the world; most keep to themselves in an attempt to blend in with a society that fears their abilities, and considers their very existence a terrorist threat.\nOne day, billionaire Cameron Frost makes a shocking announcement: the latest in his series of increasingly-violent sporting events will be a no-holds-barred fighting tournament. It will take place in a secured urban combat zone \u2013 known as The Arena \u2013 where 13 volunteers battle for the largest cash prize ever awarded.\nThe catch? To participate, you have to be a superhuman.\nComic book enthusiast and lifelong underachiever Matthew Moxon is excited to watch real-life superheroes clash for the first time, but a series of unforeseen circumstances find him tossed into the tournament, forced to fight the most dangerous human beings on the planet. When the game begins his only chance of survival is to outwit the competitors, all while he tries to unlock the mysteries buried within The Arena itself. \n5. That seems pretty cool...so who are these Marvel and DC Comics artists involved, and what are they gonna be doing? And are they famous and stuff?\nWhoa, take it easy there bub. That\u2019s like three questions all at once!\nFirst of all, here are the amazing artists involved:\nBARRY KITSON (Incredible Hulk, Amazing Spider-Man, Fables, Fairest)\nBILLY TUCCI (Shi, Sgt. Rock, The Wolverine: Weapon X 100 Project)\nDAN PANOSIAN (Spawn, X-Men, Green Lantern)\nDAVE JOHNSON (Deadpool, Punisher, Superman: Red Son)\nDEREK LAUFMAN (Marvel vs. Capcom, World of Warcraft)\nMARK McKENNA (Star Wars, Justice League, Combat Jacks)\nPlus:\nCOMICBOOKGIRL19 (The Comic Book Girl 19 Show)\nJOHN 'ROC' UPCHURCH (Vescell, Image Comics)\nNATASHA ALLEGRI (Adventure Time)\nTHOR MANGILA (Iron Age Animation, Advent Comics)\nThey're going to be illustrating some of the characters that appear in the book; you'll be able to flip to a special section of the novel and see their designs.\nTheir artwork will also appear on Kickstarter-exclusive desktop wallpapers and other rewards. This is my vision to blur the line a little between traditional novels and graphic novels, and add some extra value for the reader. \nAnd yes, they're totes famous. \nYou've probably either heard of these guys, or are familiar with their work. In case you've been living under a metaphorical rock and haven\u2019t heard of them, check out some of their stuff below. \nDan Panosian (Serafina the Butcher, character design for ARENA MODE)\nNatasha Allegri (Brynja, original character design for ARENA MODE)\nMark McKenna (Darth Vader vs. Aliens)\nDave Johnson (Deadpool)\nDerek Laufman (Marvel vs. Capcom)\nThor Mangila (Daredevil)\nBarry Kitson (Batman and Catwoman)\nDan Panosian (X-Factor)\nWHAT MAKES THIS BOOK SO SPECIAL, AND WHY SHOULD I CARE?\nAll I can say is that so far, it\u2019s my best work to date, and I think it\u2019s a very unique blend of sci-fi and superheroes that has some interesting twists on a familiar genre. \nAnd combined with the design work of some truly amazing illustrators and their input into the characters, I believe the world of ARENA MODE will really jump off the page. If you're a fan of action, adventure, science fiction or fantasy, this might be the book for you (it has a Ready Player One, Joss Whedon-y vibe to it, if that gives you any indication...?)\nWHAT IS ALL THE KICKSTARTER MONEY GOING TOWARDS?\nThe goal is to create the most amazing book possible; with professional typesetting, professional editing, and a professional design.\nTo make this happen I need your help to commission the artists who will be creating the character designs, the cover and logo designers, and the geniuses who will be creating everything visual involved in the book.\nI also need a very talented (and patient) editor, who can fix the multitude of errors that will no doubt litter each and every page of my manuscript. Even with spell cheks my spelling is not good, and grammarz not goods either.\nI will also be printing the book in both perfect bound paperback and deluxe hardcover versions, AND I\u2019ll be creating some other cool items to give as rewards \u2013 like bookmarks and t-shirts.\nSTRETCH GOALS\nNow that I've hit my goal for funding, I will start adding all kinds of bonus stuff to this book and make it even awesomer - and I'll throw in some additional bonus stuff for everyone who has already backed the project.\n$6,500 = UNLOCKED!!! The base goal has been reached. The book, along with character illustrations from 6 Marvel and DC artists, will be included.\n$7,500 = UNLOCKED!!! A new artist will be added, bringing the total character illustrations to 7. I will also be sending a free 'Full Contact Swordfighting Logo' sticker to everyone at the $25 level and higher! \n$8,500 = UNLOCKED!!! Another kick-ass guest artist and another character illustration. That's 8 so far!\n$10,000 = UNLOCKED!!! Yet another artist, bringing the total to 9! How much more awesomeness can be packed into a single book?\n$12,500 = UNLOCKED!!! Another free sticker - in addition to the 'Full Contact Swordfighting Logo' sticker, everyone at the $25 level and higher will receive an 'Arena Mode Logo' sticker! (You know the secret to making an awesome sticker? SWORDS.) \n$15,000 = UNLOCKED!!! All 13 superhumans in the book illustrated. Wow, so this is like a novel and an entire art book now...that is crazy! AND there will be a profile included with every character, including their stats, power ratings, and a look at their back story. This will add 30+ pages of additional content to the book!!!\n$17,500 = UNLOCKED!!! A print-ready version of the stunning HD Arena Mode cover. Print your own poster in almost any size!\n$20,000 = UNLOCKED!!! Every character illustration in the book professionally colored! Color pages will be included in all hardcover books, and HD wallpapers + digital images will be included for everyone at every pledge level (even $1!)\n$25,000 = UNLOCKED!!! A tabletop RPG!!! A role playing game with rules, an all new combat system, 13 superheroes you can battle with, and printable sheets so you can make your own characters. This will included as a free bonus, starting at EVERYONE at the $10 pledge level or above. You will receive a digital pack containing the rule book in PDF format, including color illustrations of the characters.\n$27,500 = UNLOCKED!!! Another character design by a special guest artist - and for everyone at the $25+ Pledge level, a copy of 'Kickstarter: Tips and Tricks for your Campaign PDF' that I will create after my campaign is over.\n$30,000 = UNLOCKED!!! Even MORE art, and more awesomeness in the book!! A map of Manhattan in the year 2041 (post-tsunami), to go in the front of the book. Also, expanded profiles for all 13 superhuman characters, with power ratings (strength, speed, etc. all rated from 1-7) and a special weapons section, detailing some of the swords, firearms, and other nifty toys that are used in Arena Mode universe.\n$33,500 = LOCKED. An over-sized, full-color collector card to be included with every physical order ($25+). This card will be a limited print, and include a never-before-seen superhuman that will appear in the RPG (!) - the art will also appear in the back of the book as well, expanding the supplementary section even more.\n$38,500 = LOCKED. All new t-shirt designs, so you can support your favorite superhuman in The Arena! Order the shirt of your choice, or upgrade to a new design if you're already getting a shirt with your package. The logos, designs and artwork will appear in the back of the book as well, expanding the supplementary section even further. Whoa!\n$45,000 = LOCKED. ???\n$50,000 = LOCKED. ???\n$75,000 = LOCKED. ???\n$99,000 = LOCKED. ???\nLET\u2019S DO THIS, PEOPLES!\nBacking this project will not only make you happier, healthier, and more attractive to the opposite sex, but it will give you seven years of good luck.

Clarke Award for science fiction literature and taking place at the Royal Society in London. \nWe're launching this event on Kickstarter to help raise awareness and funds, and to offer the chance for all of you early adopters, creative-thinkers and future geeks out there to book super-discounted advance-priced tickets before the event is publicly announced. \nWe've put together a great line-up of speakers, a fantastic and deeply historical venue in the Royal Society, and all we need now is you - an amazing audience - to help make this a truly inspirational event. \nWhat will Write The Future be like?\nWrite The Future is a micro-conference designed as a programme of creative short talks on the transformative power of science, technology, communication and speculative fiction - drawing parallels between these interconnecting disciplines and showcasing the power of the human imagination.\nThe concept is inspired by the life and work of science fiction author, inventor and futurist Sir Arthur C. Clarke, with each talk seeking to encapsulate a single inspirational and innovative idea from the fields of scientific research, digital disruption, creative communications and science fiction publishing. \nWe're drawing our speakers from a deliberately eclectic range of disciplines and backgrounds, including Royal Society Fellows, senior publishing industry experts, digital innovators, renowned science fiction authors and filmmakers, and we will be updating all programme details here as soon as they're confirmed. \nThe event will take place from 12.30pm - 5.30pm on Weds 1st May, and here's a taster of some of the ideas from our confirmed speakers so far: \n(Updated 09.03.13)\n- Kinking Reality and Imagining the Future\n- Botworld, a printer that prints its own face, and how the web won't stay trapped behind glass\n- Wrangling Shamans, Snake Oil and Science Fiction\n- The Bionic City of the Future  \n- Don't Feed the Lizard Brain. Surviving the social media comedown \n- Free Your Words and Your Mind Will Follow: Language as Technology and Ludwig\u2019s Talking Lion.\nWho should come? \nIf you work in the creative industries, publishing, social media, science communication, advertising or trend forecasting, this is the event for you.\nIf you're a science fiction writer who wants to know more about who your readers are, new ways to promote your work or the next big thing in science research, this is the place to be. \nIf you like attending author talks, research presentations, museum and gallery events, science fiction conventions, experimental conferences, listening to new ideas and talking to like-minded people, we'd love to meet you. \nWe want this event to be inclusive, inspirational and affordable, which is why we're keeping the price of tickets as far below typical conference rates as possible so it's easily accessible to both innovative individuals and curious companies. \nWhy Kickstarter? \nOne of the main reasons for launching on Kickstarter is the chance to gather early support while we're still building the event, and to be able to offer advance tickets at a greatly reduced price to those people who want to get in early. \nMore importantly though we thought it would be lots of fun and a great way to make the experimental, start-up nature of the Write The Future idea as real as possible while plans were still in motion. \nThe chance to run this event came together very fast, and now we're pulling everything together on a very tight timeframe. The concept is solid, the venue is booked, but we weren't keen to wait around until we had a proper website ready or each and everyone of our speakers confirmed before we started getting out there and telling everyone about our plans. \nA big part of our theme is the collision of inspirational ideas and experimental thinking, so launching on an innovative platform like Kickstarter felt like exactly the right place for us. \nFables from the Fountain\nOur Fables from the Fountain reward is an anthology of original fiction written as a homage to Arthur C. Clarke's famous short story collection, Tales from the White Hart, and we're delighted to be able to offer everyone who pledges their support a copy of this great collection. \nThe book includes eighteen original stories by top genre writers including Neil Gaiman, Stephen Baxter, Charles Stross, James Lovegrove, Adam Roberts and Ian Watson, and is published by NewCon Press in partnership with the Arthur C.

Do whatever it takes to upgrade your ship\u2019s hull, engines, weapons, defences, cargo hold; constantly improve your capabilities and influence on your journey towards the most coveted rank in the history of gaming - \u2018Elite\u2019.\nFight, trade, hunt your way across a giant galaxy of billions of star systems, starting with a basic starship and a few credits. You can make money from trading goods between the many star systems, by destroying pirate ships (and collecting bounty), or even by attacking traders and collecting their cargo (which in turn will get a bounty on your head!). There will be missions too, and exploration. Most people will do some combination of these things. Upgrade your ship and specialise in one activity - have a trader with a huge cargo bay, or use the space for weapons and maneuverability.\nReal Freedom - Go where you like, be what you like - pirate, bounty hunter, trader, assassin, or some mix of all of these.\nTrade - Buy low, cross dangerous space lanes, evade or destroy pirates en route, then sell high, if you make the journey!\nFight - Take on the pirates or be one yourself\nProgress - Get your pilot rating all the way from \"Harmless\" to \"Elite\"\nExplore - Head out to the far reaches of space and discover amazing sights\nAnd the best part - you can do all this online with your friends, or other \"Elite\" pilots like yourself, or even alone. The choice is yours...  \nIn \"Elite: Dangerous\" you fly a spaceship using a first person from-the-cockpit view, building on the elements from the previous games, with sumptious graphics enabled by the performance of modern PCs - all made possible using procedural techniques (see video on 'Procedural Generation' below). \n Scavenger Hunt Teaser\nDev Diary Video #1: Multiplayer - showing unedited work-in-progress gameplay footage:\nDev Diary Video #2: The Galaxy and How it Evolves:\n Dev Diary Video #3 - More multiplayer footage and discussion of player roles in the game:\nDev Diary Video #4  - Trading\nElite: Dangerous Development Plan\nPodcast Part 1- Gary Whitta interviews Chris Roberts and David Braben about Kickstarter, Star Citizen, and Elite: Dangerous:\nPodcast Part 2:\nPodcast Part 3:\nPodcast Part 4:\nPledge upgrades are unlimited and available to all tiers of \u00a330 or more.

To add a gift pledge follow the same procedure as for the pledge upgrades.\nWe have announced a stretch goal for a Mac version of the game. If we reach the stretch goal of \u00a31.4 million through the Kickstarter we will release a Mac version approximately 3 months after the Windows PC release.\nNew stretch goal announced, if we reach \u00a31.5 million then we'll add another 10 playable ships to the game.\nThe initial release of Elite: Dangerous doesn't mark the end of development. We intend to continue expanding the game both with new content and new features. A good example of this is planetary landings. We have an ambitious goal for landings to include new gameplay and a rich variety of worlds to explore. To achieve our goal we want the planets to come to life. We also want to add leaving the ships so you can explore space stations or board enemy vessels or even just to look around your own.\nThe main reason for treating these as expansions is so we can approach these with the proper development resources that we require to do them well. We don't plan or desire to just tick a box, we want to make these additions something significant.\nAnother avenue we intend to explore is other platforms, but for now the focus is very much on the Windows PC release. Only once the initial game is done will we start to look at other platforms.\nReally big expansions are likely to be paid for while we also intend for some smaller free updates. If you have pledged to to \u00a380 tier or above you will receive all expansions for free.\nPress Links\nThe POD  Delusion (Podcast)\nhttp://poddelusion.co.uk/blog/2012/12/21/episode-167-21st-december-2012-end-of-the-world-special/\nBBC News:\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20205555\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20165344\nVG24/7:\nhttp://www.vg247.com/2012/11/23/elite-dangerous-brabens-square-peg/\nEurogamer:\nhttp://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-26-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-multiplayer-gameplay-as-kickstarter-pushes-past-500k-mark\n BeefJack:\nhttp://beefjack.com/features/david-braben-elite-dangerous-interview/\nPC Gamer:\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/03/new-elite-dangerous-dev-diary-shows-off-galaxy-evolution/\nIncgamer\nhttp://www.incgamers.com/2012/11/credits-cobras-and-crowd-funding-david-braben-tells-us-about-elite-dangerous/\nInternational Press Links\nDeveloper Diary 3:\nhttp://www.playm.de/2012/12/elite-dangerous-drittes-entwicklervideo-mit-neuen-spielszenen-66215/\nhttp://www.eurogamer.it/articles/2012-12-12-news-videogiochi-un-nuovo-filmato-per-elite-dangerous\nDeveloper Diary 2 / Interview part I:\nhttp://www.gizmodo.de/2012/12/06/elite-dangerous-hat-die-halfte-seiner-kickstartersumme-eingespielt.html\nDeveloper Diary 2:\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73093\nhttp://www.gry-online.pl/S013.asp?ID=73209\nhttp://www.gamesblog.it/post/75423/elite-dangerous-in-un-nuovo-video-diario-di-sviluppo\nIntro video:\nhttp://www.gameplorer.de/elite-dangerous-kickstarter-projekt-fuer-die-fortsetzung-eines-klassikers/\nhttp://www.stern.de/spiele/vorschau/neues-elite-dangerous-entwicklertagebuch-zeigt-evolution-der-galaxie-12101.html\nGolem.de:\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-dangerous-raumstationen-schiffe-und-planeten-besuchen-1212-96386.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/elite-macher-david-braben-ich-mag-keine-zwischensequenzen-1211-95684.html\nhttp://www.golem.de/news/frontier-developments-david-braben-stellt-elite-dangerous-im-video-vor-1211-95630.html\nBooks Set in the Elite: Dangerous world:\n\"Elite - Reclamation\"  by Drew Wagar.

This is currently part funded on Kickstarter here:\nhttp://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1483152934/elite-chronicles\nMostly Harmless.\n\u201cElite\u201d has gone down in history as one of the most successful games of the 1980s. It was the first \u2018open world\u2019 game in which the player can freely roam a vast space. It was the first true 3D game too, and set many other benchmarks. Ian Bell and I set out to make a game for ourselves rather than for some imagined market. We were sick of games with three lives then a new life every 10,000 score; we wanted something new.\nThe original \u201cElite\u201d fitted into around 22K of memory, out of a total of 32K on the BBC Micro Model B computer on which it was launched (8K was needed for the screen, 2K for the system). This is less than a single typical email today. In it were eight galaxies each with 256 star systems. Each planet in those systems had its own legal system, economy and so on. Clearly some magic had to happen to fit it into 22K, and that magic was procedural generation.\nCombat in the original \"Elite\" on the BBC Micro\nCompetent\n\u201cFrontier\u201d followed in 1993 on 16 bit computers, and pushed these procedural techniques further. In it I made a model of the whole of the Milky Way galaxy with all 100,000,000,000 or so star systems, and many more planets and moons, each of which you could visit. It is something I am really proud of, as it was as scientifically accurate as I could make it, and provided a great backdrop for a game. I loved the richness of the galaxy, but with the benefit of hindsight I think the way the ships flew detracted from the joyous immediacy of those in \u201cElite\u201d.\nData on the Fomalhaut system in \"Frontier\" on the Amiga\nDangerous...\nImagine what is now possible, squeezing the last drop of performance from modern computers in the way \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d did in their days? It is not just a question of raw performance (though of course these elements will make it look gorgeous), but we can push the way the networking works too \u2013 something very few people had access to in the days of Frontier.\nFrontier Developments, the company I founded in January 1994 (and whose first product was a version of the \u201cFrontier\u201d game for the CD32 console), is now a very well established game development company with 235 people in the UK and Canada, with its own technology and tools and a great team of game developers.  We have a long track record of delivering high quality games on time and to budget, both published by ourselves and through big publishers like Microsoft, LucasArts, Atari, and Sony.\nElite: Dangerous is the game I have wanted Frontier to make for a very long time. The next game in the Elite series - an amazing space epic with stunning visuals, incredible gameplay and breath-taking scope, but this time you can play with your friends too. I want a game that feels more like the original \u201cElite\u201d to fly, and with more rapid travel (to allow for the multi-player nature of the game) \u2013 so you travel quickly using local \u2018hyperspace\u2019 travel rather than by fast-forwarding time \u2013 but with the rich galaxy of Frontier \u2013 and more, so much more.\nI\u2019ll be frank - we have had a couple of false starts on this over the years, where progress wasn\u2019t as good as I wanted. Also, understandably, other projects have been prioritised \u2013 projects with announced dates or other commitments. Up to now \u201cElite\u201d has been worked upon by a small team as a \u2018skunk-works\u2019 activity in the background as availability permits. Nevertheless, we have been preparing; laying the technology and design foundations for when the time is right. And that time is now.\nWe\u2019re using Kickstarter both as a means of test-marketing the concept to verify there is still interest in such a game that extends beyond the individuals who regularly contact me about the game, and raising the funds to do so. There is also the fact that as long as we hit the threshold, it commits us to making the game. From where we are now, $2M/\u00a31.25M will get us the minimum game, but I am hoping we can get more than that as it will allow us to be more ambitious with content and platforms; something the design decision forum members (the \u00a3300 reward tier and above) will be part of a discussion about.\nWe will rely heavily on artist-directed procedural generation, using techniques that are a logical expansion of what was done in the previous \u201cElite\u201d and \u201cFrontier\u201d games. This will greatly reduce the required budget \u2013 bringing it to within reach of Kickstarter. It also means it becomes a viable project to avoid the conventional publishing route \u2013 something that I don\u2019t believe can deliver a game like this successfully.\nProcedural generation of content is a technique where content is generated from rules. It abstracts repetitive or arbitrary elements of content creation in a very efficient way. Imagine a medieval landscape. Laying out towns, roads, castles, farm land, forests and so on can be done by a system of rules \u2013 putting castles widely spaced out on vantage points, towns near rivers but under the protection of such a castle, roads between them, then with farm land to support them all. An artist can still design the castle, the houses in the towns, but this approach greatly magnifies the content that can be created. \u201cFrontier\u201d did this for the star systems, and planets, and with Elite: Dangerous, we will go further.\nFor those who are interested in further information on procedural generation, here is a video talking some more about it. It is not everyone's 'cup of tea' as it is quite detailed, but there is some more game footage in the background...\nIn the game, you will of course begin with a spacecraft and a small sum of Credits. You will be able to trade, pirate, bounty-hunt, explore, and salvage your way to wealth and fame, building on those key elements of the previous games, and with sumptuous graphics only now possible with the performance of today\u2019s machines. Only this time some of the ships out there will be other players like yourself \u2013 other members of a secret \u2018Elite\u2019 group of space-farers\u2026\n\u00b7         Multiplayer: you will be able to control who else you might encounter in your game \u2013 perhaps limit it to just your friends? Cooperate on adventures or chase your friends down to get that booty. The game will work in a seamless, lobby-less way, with the ability to rendezvous with friends as you choose. This technology is already working, using a combination of peer-to-peer (to reduce lag) and server connections.\n\u00b7         Play it your way: Your reputation is affected by your personal choices. Play the game your way: dangerous pirate, famous explorer or notorious assassin - the choice is yours to make. Take on missions and affect the world around you, alone or with your friends.\n \u00b7         Trade: Buy low, sell high and discover the most profitable trade-routes. Keep an eye on the markets, supply and demand may create opportunities for quick profit. Unscrupulous players may even try distorting those markets.\n \u00b7         Fight: take on the pirates, or become one yourself. Engage in combat missions within a rich and dynamic simulation to earn a reputation, or perhaps you want to become a famous bounty-hunter \u2013 feared by those that you chase, but staying the right side of the law.\n \u00b7         Travel: Travel across star systems and between them. Risk leaving the relative safety of the Corporate-run space station to explore distant planets or stars. Space is big and you never know what you might find; perhaps a salvageable freighter wreck or some valuable asteroids? There are secrets and startling beauty waiting to be discovered by the intrepid explorer.\n\u00b7         Ships: save your credits and upgrade your ship. Get new weapons, engines and equipment and customize your ship the way you want it. Check out the body-kits and paint jobs on offer, give your ship that personal touch.\nA render of just the mesh of a heavily damaged Anaconda\nThe game is planned to be released on the PC in March 2014. Make no mistake \u2013 this is a massive game, but by using procedural techniques that we have been cultivating over the years, a new approach to multiplayer, and bringing the raw power of today\u2019s machines to bear, it is astonishing what is possible. This is your chance to help make it happen. Become one of \u201cThe Elite\u201d once more.\nDavid Braben\nConcept Art\nPlease note: the Kickstarter system reduces the resolution of these images.

Projects can run out of time or money, people can leave, assumptions that were made at the start may prove to be mistaken, or the results may simply not be as good as expected. Games development is no different.\n\nLooking at all the high quality games we at Frontier have produced, from RollerCoaster Tycoon 3 to Kinectimals to LostWinds to Disneyland Adventures, I think the risk of non-delivery is small. We already have a large team who are very experienced at delivering complicated projects, and the key high-risk components (like networking) are already in place. If necessary then we will delay the release beyond March 2014, but I do not believe we will need to do so.\n\nFundamentally this is the game I want to make and have wanted to make for a long time. I want to make this game for myself \u2013 it is the sort of game I want to play. There are many more like me at Frontier that want this for themselves too, and, I hope, out there in Kickstarter-land. Right at the start, Ian and I took that risk when making the first \u201cElite\u201d amidst cries that it needed three lives and a score \u2013 but we took the risk that others wanted what we wanted \u2013 and the result was a great success. If Elite: Dangerous is something you also want, then let\u2019s all take that risk together and help make the fantastic freedom of the \u201cElite\u201d series return to our screens, in current state-of-the-art glory!\n\nDavid Braben\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #61", "update_userinfo": "Dev Diary #12 Released", "update_content": "Hi all,\nas I'm sure you all relaise, it's a busy time here with the release of Alpha 4 and the upcoming Premium Beta launch!

Not just a movie, Valiant is a full original world, a unique cast of characters, and the potential launch of multiple story lines and a trans-media universe.\nValiant follows the Valiant Three - three wanted Air Pirates in a nuclear devastated Europe - who stumble across a mysterious lost child princess that may be the ticket to their freedom.\nShorty, Ronnie, & Fred. The Valiant Three.\nOur Story\nStoryboards & Script Excerpts\nOriginally started as a graduate thesis film and a partnership between USC and Chapman students, Valiant has propelled itself into an independent film of a whole different caliber.  Through the incredible amounts of hard work and dedication of hundreds, we're well on our way to create a film and world that looks and feels like a multimillion dollar creation - all for a tiny fraction of that.  Our team consists of students & amateurs working hard, learning and accomplishing incredible things, combined with professionals donating their time to make this dream a reality.  Many said we couldn't do it, but thanks to the countless hours of time and work by so many talented artists, we're well on our way.  However, like any complex artistic work, projects grow and evolve, and now we need you to join our team.\nConcept Art of The Valiant, our mercanaries airship & home.\nOriginal CG Model of The Valiant being built.\nTo bring such an original and unique world to life, we originally planned to follow the route of relying mostly on computer graphics and digital animation.  But as things progressed and others saw what we were attempting, we realized that this just wasn't good enough.  Our goal has always been to pay homage and recreate the feel of the classic adventure films & worlds, such as Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Firefly and more.  These films combined classic art forms, such as miniatures, motion control, matte paintings, and more, bringing a wide range of artists together to create these special worlds.  We grew up on these films, the opportunity to work with some of the people that made them happen was something too amazing to pass up, and this was the artistic process and art we want to help keep alive.\nThe Plan\nFon Davis, one of our minature artists, working on Star Wars.\nValiant is now changing course.  Our team has already accomplished so much, we're going to take this film to the next level, bringing the classic together with the new to finish this project the right way.  True professional Hollywood artists have come on board, impressed by our work and goals, and this in an awesome opportunity we want to share with our cast, crew, and audiences like you. \nCombining classic, but sadly fading techniques like miniatures, motion control, intelligent camera techniques and practical effects with modern artistry like CG and digital animation, our goal is to create an iconic, immersive world, true to it's roots and cutting edge at the same time.  They're the artistic methods we grew up watching that are now slowly dying, and we want to show again how well it really does work.  But to do this and push our project to this new caliber, we need your help.\nGreg Boettcher, one of our miniature artists, working on The Dark Knight.\nGreg Boettcher helps transport another one of his projects, The Serenity.\nWe've pitched the project to such Hollywood miniature greats such as Fon Davis (ILM Practical; Star Wars, Transformers 3, Nightmare Before Christmas) and Greg Boettcher (New Deal Studios; Dark Knight Rises, Inception, Serenity, etc) who have kindly come on board, largely donating their time and work to help us realize our vision.  We've assembled a team of student, amateur, and professional composition & digital artists, all here to work and learn together.  All that's left is you.\nYou\nGreg Boettcher works on The Valiant, our first major miniature!\nYour contributions will go to helping us finish our miniatures, shooting them on the motion control rig we need, additional CG components, composting everything together, and finishing Valiant the way it should be.

Kickstarter will keep it open the full 30 days, so anyone can donate up to the 27th of September.  And any extra money will just go into the film (festival applications, promoting the film, extra hard drives to protect against disaster, etc.)  So I'm setting two new goals.  I want to show broadcasters and film festivals that there is an audience for this film, and the best way to do that is to show interest from the wider public.  At present 231 people have backed this project.  I want to see if we can get that number to 1,000.  It doesn't matter if you only give a single $1 (which is about \u00a30.63), I've reached my financial goal, I just want to be able to show that there is an audience.\nMy other goal is to see if we can double my original ambition and hit $20,000.  (I'm still hoping someone is going to jump at my $1,000 reward to get a date with me, because that would make an amazing scene in the film.)\nIf we hit either of those goals, I'll release a new clip on YouTube that I otherwise plan to save for the film.\nThe Beginning\nI've always wanted to make a film about my hair.  I know, it sounds crazy, and everyone laughs at me when I say it, but little things happen all the time and I've always known that there was a funny story in it.  The problem was that I didn't want to just rant about how people tease me.  Then one night, almost two years ago, I was chatting with some friends, and I realized that people are always telling me that they have this friend who just loves guys with red hair.  But it's always their friend.  In my entire life I'd never actually met a woman who had a thing for gingers.  So I decided I'd start looking for one.  And Being Ginger was born.  In my last six weeks of graduate school I made a 24 minute long documentary.  It was the hit of the degree show and it won the 2012 Creative Scotland Student Media Award for best documentary.  So I decided to keep working on it and turn it into a feature film (70-75 minutes).\nI should also say that Being Ginger is not just about my hair.  It's about modern dating and the insecurities that we all face.  (Only my insecurity is pretty much universally considered funny for some reason.  All you have to do is call me ginger, and someone will laugh.)  The fact is, it seems like every week I meet someone who'll say something crazy without realizing there's anything wrong with it.  For example, take a look at this deleted scene:\n(I should explain why this scene was deleted.  First, that's a real woman, and the interview with her lasted 25 minutes.  So the two minutes that are the most important are in the film, and this is what I was sadly unable to keep.  If that tells you anything about what made the cut.)\nThe Middle\nSo in the year since I've graduated I've expanded the film.  I currently have a 50 minute rough cut and I am getting ready to shoot the last big sequence.\nEvery year thousands of redheads from around the world descend on a small city in The Netherlands for the world's biggest redhead festival.  It is not a film festival.  It is simply a weekend long celebration of redheadedness.  This year, my original short film will play at the opening night event.  I am also going with my camera woman to shoot the epic conclusion to the feature film (while surrounded by thousands of redheads, and more importantly, several thousand \"lovers and supporters of redheads.\")\nWhich makes me wonder if I'll meet someone like the fan who sent me this letter:\nThe End\nI am spending every penny I have on this trip, and when I get back I am going to be unable to edit the film, which is why I'm here asking for help.  With the $10,000 that I am asking for I will be able to put the film through post-production, which means hiring an editor, a sound editor, hard drives, color correction, everything.  It will also let me spend all of my energy focused on making the best possible film, instead of having to take random odd jobs to support myself.  My hope is to have the film finished and released online by November 20th, which is \"Hug A Ginger Day.\"  If I don't raise the $10,000 I'll have to go on working odds jobs and it will take me at least another year to finish.\nThis is a 30 day campaign, and it is my hope that I can find 1,000 people who are willing to say, \"I want to see this film, here's $10.\"  In return they will each receive an HD digital download as soon as the film is finished.  (And of course there are other levels of donation in case you really want to get involved.)\nThis is also an all or nothing campaign, which means I only receive the money if I reach my goal.  The money you donate will only leave your account once I make it to $10,000.  If I fall short by even a dollar, I get nothing.\nI understand that times are tough for most of us, so if you can't afford even a dollar donation, please at least share this page and my website with your friends.  I have a channel on YouTube with a few funny videos related to the film and I just want to share them with as many people as possible.  The film has a Facebook page and a Twitter account, so there are lots of ways to get involved.

I'm in the process of working on the final chapter which will complete the full 300 page story.\nWhat is reMIND?\nreMIND is an all ages sci-fi about faith, underwater lizard-men and brain transplantation. I was inspired by comic artists in the 90's when I refined my drawing style and then was influenced by Miyazaki's movies and storytelling over the last decade.\nFeel free to read through as many pages as you want on my website here. I post new pages every Monday online and will continue to post pages until they are all live towards the end of 2013. \nThe first printing of volume 1 was printed in spring of 2011 and is currently sold out but you can see some customer reviews of it on Amazon here.\nreMIND has already won a few awards which include:\n2010 Xeric Grant Winner\n2012 Great Graphic Novels for Teens List (GGNT)\nBook Specs.\nreMIND Volume 1 (second printing) is 152 full color pages and hardcover that includes Chapters 1 - 3 of reMIND. The interiors will be exactly the same as the first printing. The cover will have an alternate coloring job so it will look different than the first printing but with the exact same cloth binding. The retail price is $24.95.\nreMIND Volume 2 (first printing) will be 176 full color pages and hardbound with a cloth binding. Vol 2 concludes the story of reMIND containing Chapters 4 - 7. All limited Kickstarter copies will be signed and numbered. The retail price will probably be $29.95.\nWhat is Phobos?\nPlease see update #5 for a detailed description of Phobos.\nPublication Date\nreMIND Volume 2 and the reprinting of Volume 1 is scheduled to go to the printer in October if everything goes according to plan. The printing process will take about 3 months for the proofs, printing and shipping to happen. This means I'll probably be getting the books around January or maybe February if the holidays get in the way (which I assume they will)\nI put April as the shipping date as an absolute worst case scenario if I can't get the printing started when planned. But I am estimating that the books will be in my garage by January so I can start shipping them out soon after.\nWhy Self-Publish?\nPeople ask me why I chose to self-publish remind. Well, when I started this my dream was to get the best agent and publisher and take the world by storm with my graphic novels. What I learned is that nobody cares about what you want to do until after you prove yourself. So I started posting my pages online in 2009 to try to grow an audience and sure enough a small group started following my progress. Later I applied for the self publisher's Xeric grant in 2010 and won $5000. This convinced me to fully commit to self-publish and it was then that I launched my first kickstarter back in 2010. To my surprise I raised over 12 thousand additional dollars to help print the first volume. Now I HAD to self-publish as well as learn to distribute and sell my books. My original kickstarter campaign has been essential in getting reMIND where it is now and it has opened up doors that I never thought possible.\n\nThe funny thing is now that I have a beautiful book published I am approached by big publishers regularly as well as distributors. I could easily sign a contract with a good publisher but in being forced to self publish, I have also fallen in love with it. I can make the books exactly how I want them to look and reprint them whenever I want. I can focus on what's important to me instead of a publisher who is mainly focused on the bottom line. It's a ton of work and I still have a lot to learn about things like distribution and marketing but overall I love self-publishing as well as owning all the rights to my stories.\n\nMy business plan is to get to the point where I can make a living off of my self-publishing by always printing high quality first printing books that are numbered, rare and sending them directly to my customers. The second and third printings will be manufactured more with mass distribution in mind once I figure that part out a little better.\n\nI hope the quality of my books are apparent as soon as you see it on the shelf and even more so when you slowly flip through the pages. My goal has always been to make a coffee table book that also happens to be a comic.\nMoney\nNow lets talk about where the money will go. Since the first Volume of reMIND is out-of-print, I need to reprint it at the same time that I print the new Volume 2. The first Volume cost me a little over $11,000 to print 2500 copies. On top of reprinting Volume 1, I will need to raise an additional $13,000 to print Volume 2 which costs more because it has more pages. I want to print both books with a nice cloth binding again exactly like the first printing of Volume 1. So to add it all up, I need a bare minimum of $24,000 to print both books and I think it's attainable now that Kickstarter has gained popularity.  \nI have about $5000 saved but that will all end up going to kickstarter fees, taxes and shipping. Actually, $5000 won't even cover it all but I'm hoping to raise enough to take care of the extra unseen bills.\nRemember that Kickstarter is an All-or-Nothing system. If I can't raise the full amount in the time given then I won't get anything. :(\nIf this campaign goes over it's funding goal, I already have lots of ideas for additional rewards for everyone who backs it so please help me spread the word if possible.\nPledge Options\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\n____________________________________________________________\nBe sure to check back because I plan on adding new rewards regularly!\nInternational Shipping Chart\nPlease add the additional shipping if your books will be sent outside of North America.

And everyone receiving a physical copy of the book gets a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS bookmark.\n$120k - Either a second 6-8 page supplemental story, or the first supplement will be expanded to 12-16 pages. PDF/digital delivery only; every backer $9-PDF level and above will receive this exclusively. And everyone receiving a physical copy of the book will get a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS postcard and a full color LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS bookmark.\n$150k - Jim will shave his head. (Pretty sure we're not making this one, --I hope-- but if we do, it will be filmed and put up for viewing.) (PS: There's no allowance here for back-outs and denied credit cards; if my hair is going, it's at 150k for real)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\nONE LAST REWARD\nIt's the final days of the campaign, and we've come up with a high-end unique pledge reward to -hopefully- give us a significant boost towards our final stretch goal. We're offering a one of a kind edition of Jim Calafiore's script notes and layouts. \n\"When I begin a new book, I print out the script one script-page to an 8 1/2 x 11 page. On these I make my notes to myself, and questions to ask the writer. I also do a pen thumbnail of how I'll lay out the page. The next step is a rough pencil sketch on layout paper about half the size of the final art board, which -for the final penciling- is blown up and transferred to the full size art board using a light box.\" \nThis is an opportunity to own all of Jim's script pages with notes and thumbnails, and all the original layout roughs for the whole main story of LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS. The volume will be over 160 pages (more if we exceed the 105k stretch goal), more than 80 pages of Jim's original pencil layouts, showing his creative process. Also included will be Jim's original layouts for both the regular and alternate covers for the graphic novel, as well as a selection of the original character pencil roughs. \nThis will be bound in a single hardcover volume, a little larger than 8 1/2 x 11. The cover will feature the same art as the regular graphic novel. There will be a foreword by Jim, and an afterword by Gail, and the book will be signed by both Gail and Jim. Being all original art, this will of course be a single edition. The pledge level will be $4,000. \nWe are limiting this to CONTINENTAL US ONLY because, to be honest, it scares the willies out of us to think about shipping a one-of-a-kind out of the country. If you are outside the continental US, but plan to attend a convention in the US that Jim or Gail will be attending, you can pledge for the book and pick it up there. (Jim's website jimcalafiore.com lists his con schedule, and he usually does at least the same shows each year. And both Gail and Jim definitely do San Diego Comic Con.) \nAs an additional bonus, for any backer who pledges for this volume, if you are attending a convention that either Gail or Jim or both are attending, you can choose to receive the book personally at a lunch with the creator(s).\n------------------------------------------------------\n112 PAGE STRETCH GOAL\nWe exceeded $92k!\nOnward and upward. Our next goal is more pages. The stretch goal to increase the page count to 112 pages is $105k. These would be story pages, not filler. We'd love the opportunity to put even more into the story. And we think we have a serious chance of reaching the next goal.\nThe support has been amazing; and just looking at the number we've reached already is extremely gratifying. Shows not only what the fans can do, but what Kickstarter can be for so many creators. Direct connection with no middlemen.\nThanks\nSTRETCH GOALS\n$86k unlocks the Comixology digital comic. We're contracting with Comixology to help fulfill our digital rewards commitment. They will take our book and convert it to a digital comic that works with their app, and feature all the functionality like double-tap zoom. (All backers at the PDF level and above will get a code to use at Comixology to download the digital comic for free. We will still be sending the PDF to all those backers.) Comixology will also host a small preview of the book for free download when it's ready.\n$92k As mentioned below, we've been hoping to reunite the Secret Six team, and bring the excellent colorist Jason Wright on board. We definitely had a great working rapport with him, and he brought so much to the series. Jason won't have any personal stake in the book, so he'd be hired basically as an independent contractor. And in this same goal, we'll be looking to bring on a separate letterer who will also be handling our pre-press file handling, getting it ready for the printer, freeing us up creatively.\n(Folded into both of those is also an accommodation for the fact that we've happily exceeded our 3,000 book print run estimate, and are into the next level of printing costs.)\nWe're looking into the goal after that, and hoping to expand to 112 pages which will let us open and deepen the story even more. We're looking into budget and pricing for that (besides printing, there's the added freight and shipping costs because of increased weight). We figure that will be somewhere over 100k; we'd be beyond thrilled if we can get that far, but don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We're grateful for how far you've gotten us already.\n                                  ---------------------------------------\nAs of the $81k goal, the book is now hardcover; all copies shipped will be hardcover.\n                                    -----------------------------------\nWe are also offering a signed bookplate to be included with the book. If you'd like that, you have to add $10 to your pledge (to cover our printing, shipping and inserting of the book plates). A few of the rewards have it listed, but it applies to all rewards. Any reward pledge that includes the actual book increased by that $10 will get the bookplate included. (The $10 does not apply to the two 10-book bulk rewards; those backers add $25) There's more explanation in the FAQ and UPDATES.\nLEAVING MEGALOPOLIS is a thrilling, original 80 page graphic novel of suspense and terror in a superhero universe gone horribly wrong, where a small band of survivors face the horror of both their formerly beloved protectors, and the dark secrets within themselves. Featuring the creative talents of writer Gail Simone and artist Jim Calafiore this is a story of violence, fear, hope and --if they're lucky-- survival. \nLEAVING MEGALOPOLIS will be brought to you by the team behind DC Comics' critical smash, SECRET SIX. IGN.COM called the final issue of Secret Six, \"the best single comic issue of 2011,\" and in this dark ride of a story, we go even wilder! LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS is a journey, by two professional creators, with no holds barred and no limits imposed. Our groundbreaking work on SECRET SIX was only the beginning. If you thought that was dark...\nLEAVING MEGALOPOLIS will be a new and complete story in a single 80 page volume. Bonus materials will include development sketches, single page illustrations by some of the biggest names in comics, a forward by industry legend MARK WAID, and a short prose story in the LEAVING MEGALOPOLIS universe by Gail Simone. \nInitial plans are for the graphic novel to be available only through this Kickstarter drive. We're handling everything, including shipping of the individual books to pledges of $15 or above. There's additional goodies to be had with higher pledge incentives, listed down the right side of the page. The rewards will ship at different times. Some incentives, like the print or commission art, will ship within months; the graphic novel will ship in early 2013. \nThis an example of the 9x12 commission\nThis is an example of the 11x17 commission\nPlans are to keep the printing in the US, (the same printer and specs as the last Secret Six trade, THE DARKEST HOUSE), and if possible to reunite with another of the SIX team, colorist Jason Wright. And if we're lucky, and the funding goal is exceeded enough to afford it, we hope to expand the page count. \n We're working on the book now, so please check back for more preview art as it's done. Thanks so much for considering our project.\nABOUT THE CREATORS\nGAIL SIMONE is the multiple award winning writer of WONDER WOMAN, BIRDS OF PREY, DEADPOOL, THE SIMPSONS, and many other classic runs of some of the world's most popular comics. She has also written for animation, prose and video games. Known for her strong character work and dark humor, this book shows Gail at her most ferocious and untamed.\nJIM CALAFIORE has been working in the comics field for over twenty years, and been lucky to work with some great creators. He's best known for his work on AQUAMAN, EXILES, GOTHAM UNDERGROUND and SECRET SIX.\nThis is the first KICKSTARTER project for either creator.

I\u2019m John Kricfalusi (creator of Ren and Stimpy). I have a new cartoon I need your help in producing. It stars one of the original Ren and Stimpy characters, Mr. George Liquor, AMERICAN! You loved him in Dog Show and Man's Best Friend. Now bring him to life in CANS WITHOUT LABELS!\nGeorge is an old school, manly, Republican sort of guy. He thinks today\u2019s Republicans are wimps. He\u2019s leathery on the outside but all mush in the center, at least with his dear ones. He believes in \u201ctough love\u201d and lives his life according to the rules. \u201cIt\u2019s Discipline that begets love!\u201d\nHOW DID I COME UP WITH THIS PREPOSTEROUS STORY?\nIT REALLY HAPPENED - THAT'S HOW! George is largely inspired by my own manly Dad.\nDad believes in the old values: hard work, rules and most important of all \u2013 SAVING A BUCK! Wasting money is a sin against Almighty Bejeezus. Hang on to every last penny and put it away for a rainy day, or face the consequences!\nLike my Dad, George craves a bargain. He'll not pay sticker price for anything. He ONLY buys stuff on sale and refuses to buy any brand name products.\nBrand Names are a Commie Scam!\nDad didn't allow us to drink Coca Cola on principle - maybe because it tasted too good for the price. \"Tasting good is an advertising gimmick!\" Instead he would buy generic supermarket brands like \u201cLoblaws - cola\u2013like drinkable substance\u201d which tasted like motor oil and had no fizz: \u201cYou know what fizz goes for these days?!\u201d  \nWe had \u201cCatsup\u201d instead of Heinz\u2019 Ketchup. He\u2019d buy a 6 year\u2019s supply of red paste in huge crusty bottles for a 10th of what the regular sized brand name cost.\nOf course we couldn\u2019t have KLEENEX so we blew our noses in our poodle\u2019s clipped torso fur. NOTHING was wasted at the Kricfalusi home \u2013 at least not while Dad was watching. \nNo Labels at all\nAs much as Dad loves his generic brand labels, there are products he loves even better \u2013 products with no label at all!\nOur local supermarket \u2013 LOBLAWS again, used to sell damaged can goods on the bottom shelf at the back of the store. They would tear the labels off the cans and discount them. Then they\u2019d take a marker and write 5 or 10 cents on them. These super cheap mystery cans brought Dad to the heights of ecstasy.\nHe'd grab a cart and mow down all the old ladies who were trying to get at the cans and he\u2019d snatch up every can on the shelf. He loved these cans without labels so much he built his own wooden shelves in the basement to honor his collection of tin treasures.\nHe nailed two-by-fours right into the concrete with his fists. \u201cDo you know how much HAMMERS go for these days?!\u201d  My whole family was terrified by the shelf of naked cans. Mom refused to eat any of them. She was the only one in the family who was allowed to have brand name products.\nWe always knew when Dad was going to feed us one of these mystery cans cause we\u2019d hear him downstairs sliding the cans around the rough wood and concrete and chuckling to himself.\nAs he stomped upstairs with an armload of cans, we\u2019d try to escape, but he\u2019d locked all the doors and windows. Trapped!\nHe'd dump the cans onto the kitchen table, call everyone in for lunch and we\u2019d drag ourselves to our fate.\nHe always swore there would be something really tasty in a can and thought he could deduce what was it was using the scientific method. He\u2019d count the rings and look at whether the lid was silver or gold and then conclude...\n\u201cI think there are some nice peaches in this can!\u201d .\nLet me tell you something\u2026  There were NEVER any Goddamn peaches in these things. It was always something gruesome \u2013 like a whole plucked chicken carcass with staples in its ear holes; its limp stubbly skin hanging off mummified crumbling bones.\nOne time he opened up a can of pickled kittens.\nIt didn\u2019t matter if he guessed wrong about the contents of a can because he believed in not wasting anything the Lord has blessed us with.\n\u201cHERE\u2019S THE RULE \u2013 ONCE WE OPEN THE CAN \u2013 WE HAVE TO EAT WHATEVER\u2019S IN IT!\u201d\nWe\u2019d scream and try to crawl out the windows but he\u2019d wrestle us to the ground and force us to eat the pickled pets. We couldn\u2019t waste food at our house, because otherwise\u2026 \u201cDO YOU KNOW HOW MANY STARVING BIAFRAN KIDS WOULD KILL FOR A NICE PIECE OF KITTEN LIKE THIS?\u201d\nAnd thus...\nIn this cartoon, George introduces his innocent little nephews Slab N Ernie to his collection of Cans Without Labels.\nThere will be a special appearance of Spumco favorite CIGARETTES THE CAT and also a cameo from another beloved cartoon character.\nTHE CREATIVE TEAM\nGeorge Liquor is voiced by the great Mike Pataki, who, sadly, passed away last year. This is one of his last recordings for me.\nThe storyboard and layouts were drawn by hand by me and fellow Spumco Bigshot Jim Smith. \nEddie Fitzgerald of \u201cUncle Eddie\u201d fame is the voice of Cigarettes the Cat.\nEric Bauza is Slab. Gabe Swarr is Ernie.\nI am also employing my latest young talents who helped me with the Bobby Bigloaf cartoon, The Simpsons Couch Gag and Cartoon Network IDs: John Kedzie and Sarah Harkey\nIf you help me make the cartoon I will train some new cartoonists and animators as well and the world of animation will be that much richer.\n    EDIT: For international shipping refer to the following:\nFor the $30 and $50 pledges please add $5\nFor the $300 and $500 pledges please add $10\nFor the $1,000 pledge please add $15\nFor the $100 and $3,000 pledges please add $20\n\nEDIT: There is now a $1 reward so ALL of you fine folks will get a digital copy of the cartoon!\n    Be the first in your neighborhood to own one of my new digital toys.

Join the esteemed ranks of top celebrities I have animated. You - yes YOU will make a cameo appearance in the cartoon. That's right!  I will personally do a caricature of you and animate you into the credits of the cartoon and thank you for being the philanthropic high-roller that you are!

We will paint the backgrounds and build a cg set and some props. Then we need to pay for music, sound effects and final editing.  The whole process will take about 7 months.

Launch the offensive! (About the Project)\nCinemaware is planning to bring this unique, emotion-charged, action-packed gaming experience back to life \u2013 in full, glorious HD graphics & sound!\nFor that to happen, we are looking for the support of all our fans and gamers in general who want to relive this classic game once more on modern platforms!\nPrize: The Art of Wings booklet & graphic novel (artistic rendition, subject to change)\nIf we achieve the minimum funding goal, we will recreate the original game in all its glory \u2013 but this time, with full HD graphics & sound, enhanced animations, a revised UI and enhancements to the control interface in order to support current input methods such as touchscreen control. Our target platforms are iOS & Android devices (tablets and mobile devices) and Windows PC. Potential future platforms are Macintosh and videogame consoles. The game will be DRM-free and no additional content will be up for sale \u2013 you get the whole game in its entire, original glory! \nThen\nNow\nHowever, and this is where it gets most interesting \u2013 help us achieve higher funding levels and we will add NEW missions, NEW diary entries and story elements, NEW landscapes, MORE & BETTER animations, ADDITIONAL music tracks, and maybe even MORE COMBAT SEQUENCE MINI-GAMES - making it a truly rich, ultimate DIRECTOR\u2019S CUT! But don\u2019t worry \u2013 we won\u2019t screw around with the classic gameplay \u2013 it will still be the Wings you know and love! (We will be posting our stretch goals in a future update as well as on the Wings: Director's Cut hotsite).\nRaylight Games of Naples, Italy (the experienced developer behind Wings for Game Boy Advance, as well as Amiga classics Speedball 2 and Wing Commander: Prophecy for GBA!) will have the honor of taking on this project under the production leadership and coordination of Cinemaware. They will take on development responsibilities (we anticipate approximately 6 months post Kickstarter funding) to deliver the same impactful experience fans have come to fondly remember.\ntarget in-game 3D assets (subject to change)\nIn addition, Ken Melville, one of the original writers of and composer for the classic game, will also be involved in the production and will help us design & write new content for the project if we are able to achieve our minimum goal! Exciting indeed! \ntarget in-game screenshot (subject to change)\nLike most Kickstarter campaigns, we\u2019ll be posting regular updates about the progress of the project as it moves along, posting new video updates, graphic and sound developments, concept art and developer interviews. But we\u2019re going the extra mile to make our fans and backers feel they are an important part of the process of creating a great game.\nThen\nNow\nWe\u2019re going to make available a private, backers\u2019 only forum where you will be able to contribute ideas and provide feedback, review upcoming artwork and sound, and discuss the evolution of this great project directly with the game\u2019s developers! A Beta test version will also be made available on a first-come, first-serve basis. Once the game is finished, backers will receive the completed version in the available format of their choice (at the US$15 level and above). \nPrize: Wings logo caps (artistic rendition, subject to change)\nPlease help us prove that there is still a great demand out there for the unique games that Cinemaware has been so famous for producing, and that inspired so many of us working in the industry today. We have put all our available resources towards creating this Kickstarter campaign and associated materials, with the goal of bringing this classic gaming brand back to life \u2013 but now we need your direct help and support to make Wings: Director\u2019s Cut a reality! \nColonel Farrah says: \u201cSupport the 56th - Buy Wings Pledges!\u201d (Rewards)\nWe have aimed to create a variety of pledge levels and rewards in order to fit all sorts of budgets!\n56th Aerosquadron Journal replica (artistic rendition, subject to change)\nYou can pledge as little as one dollar on Kickstarter, but pledges that include some kind of reward start at US$15 (that includes the game and a set of desktop wallpapers), and can go as high as US$10,000 (which includes an acrobatic ride in a real double-decker, WWI-style airplane!).  In-between we are offering awesome T-shirts, caps, posters, a calendar, in-game credits and\u2026some of the most exciting collector\u2019s items we could think of: a real-life replica of the Wings 56th Aerosquadron Journal (as seen within the actual game), an authentic aviator bomber jacket and a poster featuring the classic Wings box cover with YOUR own face featured in it! How cool is that???!\nPrize: Wings Director's Cut Poster (subject to change)\nAll pledges from US$15 and up include one (or more) copies of the game, on the platform of your choice.

(The rebirth of Cinemaware)\nWings: Director\u2019s Cut marks the first title in development from Cinemaware since 2003\u2019s Robin Hood: Defender of the Crown. We know very well that thousands of our fans have been clamoring for a new product, and that frustration was mounting. However, financial constraints have become a reality of the videogame business \u2013 with the major publishing labels having a stranglehold on the market.\nPrize: Wings military logo Special Tee (artistic rendition, subject to change)\nThe industry had become very competitive, financial backing very limited, and publishers\u2019 support for unique gaming experiences such as those that Cinemaware intended to produce disappeared.\nNow, with the advent of Kickstarter and the opportunity that our fans have to directly support us, we can look forward once more to bringing you great, story-driven, character-rich gaming experiences! And proclaim our motto to the skies: Heroes Live Forever!\nWe have also proudly and enthusiastically joined the Kicking it Forward movement started by Brian Fargo during the Wasteland 2 project! Please visit: http://kickingitforward.org\nIn doing so, we pledge that a share of all future profits we are able to generate with this title (and any other Kickstarter projects we launch) will be distributed back to other Kickstarter projects - creating a virtuous cycle of sharing and helping others which we believe is the true spirit of this great funding platform!\n\u201cCurse you, Red Baron!\u201d (Summary)\nA quiet revolution is slowly developing in the games business.\nSeveral years back, the ability to fund projects directly from your fans and customers was unheard of. Fortunately, the internet and social media have changed all that. Linking fans to game developers like Cinemaware directly through a platform like Kickstarter brings tremendously positive creative liberty and financial independence to an industry that has, historically, faced the danger of creative stagnation. Long-established publishers and investors do not cater to a lot of niche interests and classic gaming brands; ever-dwindling retail outlets squeeze out the variety of products even further. Thus the game-playing public is increasingly stuck with the same-old big brands and the same-old game franchises suffering terminal sequelitis.\nBut fight back for more imaginative games!
