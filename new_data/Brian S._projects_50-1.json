[{"backer": "Brian S.", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "TidyBoard streamlines your food prep by placing strainers, catches and containers on the end of the cutting board. Easily chop fruits or veggies without mixing scraps. Strain hands-free and effortlessly clean up with a swipe of your hand.\nThe hanging design and collapsible containers maximize countertop space and make food prep fast and fun!\nDo you cook in a tiny kitchen?\nBy hanging off the edge of the countertop or over the sink, TidyBoard utilizes previously unused space. \nIn addition, the collapsible containers save over 50% of drawer and cabinet space, making it compact in use and in storage. \nThe cutting board acts as a lever to help hold the weight of the catch. TidyBoard\u2019s bamboo is antibacterial and maintains durability for years on end. TidyBoard is lightweight and made from the finest eco-friendly materials.\nThe large catch and containers have volumetric and measuring marks. Put food waste or chopped up food directly into containers for quick cutting and prep. The containers are also collapsible for efficient storage.\nThe strainers nest into the end of the board for cleaning or straining directly into the sink or catch \u2014 hands-free. The Strainers are all collapsible making them compact for storage.\nLids come included to make food storage easy in the containers. The lids snap-on directly to the containers and have a vent which allows them to be microwavable. Clean it. Cut it. Store it.\nThe lids also have a vent release for steaming veggies in the microwave.\nThe TidyBoard was mindfully influenced by math and physics. Our board is engineered as a lever to stay steady even with a heavy load in the containers.\nTidyBoard can hold up to 9 lbs of food in its container while hanging off your counter.\nCook and prep with ease. TidyBoard scientifically brings perfect balance to your prep. \nWe\u2019ve all experienced the cluttered counter and prepped foods mixed with food waste.\nTidyBoard keeps you organized and your kitchen clean. Never worry about where to put scraps or discarded produce \u2014 keep your space clean and orderly with TidyBoard.\nSee the difference TidyBoard makes. Say goodbye to chaotic cooking and welcome spick and span prep.\nNot only is TidyBoard cleverly designed, the quality of materials is nothing but the best.\nTidyBoard uses eco-friendly Bamboo. The lightweight 4 lbs of the bamboo wood won't dull knives, harbor bacteria, or absorb unwanted flavors and odors.\nThe containers are constructed out of BPA-free Food Grade Silicone and are microwave friendly, convenient for storage and organization. \nYou can choose your color once the campaign is over. We will send you a survey to pick your color of choice! \nTidyBoard cares about healthy eating, and we want to encourage everyone to cook fresh ingredients! We see TidyBoard making it easier to cook at home and helping prepare meals to-go, saving money and eating better when away from home.\nWe want to help connect people to their food and Mother Earth! Buying food locally at Farmers Market\u2019s helps reduce the carbon emissions during long transportation journeys as well as the added packaging materials you typically see at markets.\nWith TidyBoard, cooking and eating locally grown foods can be easier and faster. Plus, the catch makes it super easy to compost all your food waste. Cut it, clean it, store it, compost it, and make our world more sustainable!\nThe TidyBoard Team are friends from college who lived together in a small apartment with a small kitchen counter to work on. It was constantly a mess with ingredients and no space, so we came up with TidyBoard! Next came testing different prototypes and many hours of us doing 3-D drawings on Auto-CAD and patent research. We bought a 3-D printer and started testing. We then met our main man Eddie, a master of manufacturing. He helped us turn our original solid plastic design into a collapsible silicone design and here we are now!\nWe are happy to bring this vision to reality!\nMatthew is a goofy engineer who loves all things outdoors and creating new inventions!\nMark is a master of making businesses successful and loves spending time with family making delicious dinners!\nWilliam is the beloved brother who helped prototype and came up with the name TidyBoard!\nA global team of Certified Kickstarter & Indiegogo Experts.

I get to be an explorer, an inventor, a biologist. An adventurer. Through my years playing D&D, working for TSR, Wizards of the Coast, and then freelancing, I had the privilege of revealing wonders to people who share my love of the fantastic. I dissected dragons to see how they work. I found friends and companions\u2014from spacefarers in distant solar systems, to pirates and thieves and magicians, to a certain dark elf. Whole cultures, entire races, emerged into the light. Along the road I discovered a world of my own, which is still unveiling. Many of you have been with me every step of the way. Your appreciation of my efforts made it all possible.\nUPDATE: Thanks to the overwhelming support, the page count is now 336. Depending on how these last two days go, I may be able to push it to 352! That includes most of the paintings I've done plus some essential process and concept art.\nFound Worlds will be a record of our excavations together, a compilation of every world we\u2019ve uncovered. I want to put it all in this book, and that's why we're here. It\u2019s going to be big, and I want to share art and process for everything from the beginning of my career to all my finished paintings\u2014Dungeons & Dragons, Drizzt, Magic: The Gathering, Warcraft, The Evertide, and countless other realms. I'm asking for your help to make it happen. Are you ready to take another journey with me?\nIntroduction by artist and friend, John Avon, with commentary by Donato Giancola, Mark Nelson, Marie Brennan, R.A. Salvatore, and others.\nSample pages\nFound Worlds will be 9\"x12\", with over 290 pages of illustrations printed at the best quality modern printers can achieve. The time and finances it takes to make a book this size possible can skyrocket quickly, and you know I'm a perfectionist, but I want this to be a beautiful and lasting portfolio of my work. In the meantime, I'm halfway done with my second novel in The Evertide series, but illustration still pays the bills; Found Worlds may give me room to continue building this universe with story and art.\nBesides the book, I'm offering quite a few rewards as a thanks to backers. Some of these are brand new or expanded compilations of my art, while others are discounted or rarely-offered items. Take note below that we'll charge for shipping after the campaign and before the books ship next year. \n THREE 8.5\"x11\" Prints - printed on premium luster photo paper with an archival 8-color process.\n Sketchbook Vols. 1 & 2 - I've done so many black & white drawings and concept pieces over the course of my career that there's no room for all of them in one book, so I'll include them as sketchbooks instead. I'm still finalizing their contents, but one will likely feature my concept work for 3rd Edition D&D. The other will collect finished pen and ink illustrations. Between the two I\u2019ll also share additional process on some of my favorite paintings.\nNo dragons were harmed in the making of this book...\n The Special Edition - Found Worlds, but wrapped in a dragonskin textured leather and stamped with a silver foil title. Each of these books will come signed and numbered. Each edition of this book comes with a hand-drawn sketch, or Remarque, inside\u2014unique to that book.\nPLAY\n\nOur printer showcases the wonderful \u201cDragonskin\u201d leather I\u2019ve picked out for the Limited Edition slipcase and book cover. Dragons have scales in armored areas, but skin more like that of an elephant or rhino over most of their bodies. This was a perfect match. \n The Collector's Portfolio- These 13\"x19\" prints are usually convention-only. For the first time here online I'm offering collections at a reduced price. Choose from Drizzt, Dragons, Magic: the Gathering, Dungeons & Dragons, D&D Monster Manual Dragons, and the Lady Trent Collection.\n\nFor the wyrm that needs everything\n Limited Edition Metal Evertide Print* - Offered only through this Kickstarter as a thank you to my highest backers is this 20\"x20\" Metal print of the iconic Evertide statue. Signed & limited to a number determined by this Kickstarter.\n*The metal print will ship in a separate category from all other tiers.\nI've received the proofs for the metal print in the Dragon's Hoard tier, and they are gorgeous!\nPLAY\n\nOther Limited Edition Prints - I'm only offering the metal print through this Kickstarter, but most all of my paintings are available as limited edition prints through my website toddlockwood.com \nSHIPPING- I\u2019m going to charge for shipping AFTER the campaign when the books are ready to ship. Which means you'll likely receive a survey from our Kickstarter with an opportunity to enter your address and pay for shipping then. I'll keep everyone updated with reminders when that survey is open / emailed. I've done my best to estimate realistic shipping for different countries. Again, these are just estimates, and I've tried to design the rewards so that they will ship to your door easily in one container, all except for the Metal Evertide Print. For this, and thus for the Dragon's Hoard tier, we will have to charge shipping separately from the other tiers. I'm working with some European services to decrease these costs, but please be aware of the shipping before you pledge, and feel free to email or contact with any questions. See \"regular shipping\" for all other tiers besides Dragon's Hoard, below:\nRetailers\u2014If you want to purchase 5 or more books for your own storefront, please email me: todd@toddlockwood.com\nAdd-ons - If you would like to combine tiers or purchase multiple versions of a tier, you can increase your pledge to cover the total amount of them added together. After the campaign ends, we will reach out to anyone with extra funds pledged to survey them about the additional rewards they are interested in.\nThank you so much for taking the time to visit this campaign. Thank you for believing in what I love. Thank you for coming with me on this journey.\nThe best is yet to come!\n\u2014Todd Lockwood", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe've tried our best to talk with the printer in detail and hammer out a deadline for this book.

High above him, across the gorge, stands a castle. It is clear that the castle is very attractive, but the only way to get there is to first go downward. The man, terrified of what lies below, never ventures further, and wakes up soon after. \nThe game is an exploration of what strange things someone might find if they did enter the gorge, what might confront them inside, and how they might make their way out to reach the castle - if they have what it takes.\nWho am I?\nSeveral years ago I started a meme page on facebook and began writing comedic content for the internet. Since then, things I've made have spread far on pretty much every social media site out there - if you use them much, you may have seen something I've made, including many comedic images of retro-styled game scenarios.\nHow will the money be used?\nThe funding will be used to support myself while I build the game and compensate artists for any help I may need.

There\u2019s no month we would\u2019ve preferred to release Freakpocalypse more than October, but unfortunately the pandemic has thrown a wrench into those plans. Not only has it delayed routine aspects of development like voice acting, QA, additional polish and localization, but it\u2019s also delayed several aspects of game marketplaces. We won\u2019t be able to release this month like we planned and it\u2019s beyond our control.

This patent pending device brushes all your teeth at once, fully automatic, and finishes in just ten seconds. All you have to do is press a single button, wait ten seconds, and you\u2019ll have perfectly clean teeth!\nLet's face it: brushing your teeth is not exactly the sexiest thing on Earth. You have to squeeze, scrub, gargle, spit, rinse and floss every morning and evening, every day of your life. Many of us hate brushing our teeth so much that we avoid doing so whenever possible\u2014even though we know we shouldn\u2019t... Brushing our teeth at least twice a day maintains good dental health. This is why we invented Amabrush\u2014a device three years in the making with a single goal: to make toothbrushing quicker, automatic, and more efficient so you have more time for the relevant things in your life.\nAmabrush is not meant to be better than your regular toothbrush. Wait, what? That's true! Regular toothbrushes (manual and electric) are tools. And tools are only as good as the person using it! The key thing is that most of us use them wrong, or even worse, are not using them at all. \nBrushing teeth is a job where you must be highly concentrated. Toothbrushes should be held like pencils, so that pressure is as light as possible. The bristles should be soft, in order to not damage your gums. And you should just wiggle the toothbrush with subtle vibrations, instead of doing long strokes. Electric toothbrushes are handled differently than manual ones. With them, you shouldn't stroke at all. These toothbrushes are designed to be held in place, so that the micro vibrations of the bristles can do their job (they wiggle for you).\nAmabrush covers all of the recommended methods. The bristles are aligned in a 45\u00b0 angle against the gum line, and are soft enough in order to rub instead of scratch (like nylon bristles). And the pressure against your teeth is light. Subtle vibrations move the bristles back-and-forth, which allows them to remove plaque and keep your gums undamaged.\nAmabrush is for people like us - who just brush their teeth because they have to, and not because they want to.\nAmabrush was designed to make toothbrushing less annoying. Some of us hate toothbrushing so much, that we brush not concentrated enough, not long enough, not good enough, or not at all. And some of us simply can not brush correctly at all, because they are not able to do so. It is still under development, and currently for people with healthy gum and teeth. This is our goal. Right toothbrushing for everyone and automatically!\nAmabrush is made out of three parts:\nThe Mouthpiece\nThe Handpiece\nThe Toothpaste Capsules\nAntibacterial Material\nThe flexible mouthpiece has built-in micro-channels that transport the toothpaste to your teeth. The mouthpiece is made of antibacterial silicone that kills 99.99% of all bacteria and features 3D-arranged bristles on both sides to clean your teeth. It\u2019s soft enough to prevent gum damage but strong enough to clean your teeth precisely. It can be cleansed by normal rinsing, as you would do it with regular toothbrushes.\nBrushing Technique\nThe bristles are directed in a 45\u00b0 angle against your gingival cuff. This simulates the Bass method, which is recommended by dentists and experts. The bristles are comparable to soft-bristled toothbrushes. This ensures the most comfortable, safest toothbrushing and makes gum-damage impossible. We work closely with dentists and dental universities to address two concerns: clean teeth and no gum damage.\nSingle Size\nWe analyzed over 2,000 different jaws from adult females and males. The small difference between both genders is smoothed out by the flexible material of the mouthpiece. The used material has the characteristic to fit every jaw with no abnormal teeth displacements.\nReplacement\nAs with regular manual toothbrushes and electric toothbrush heads, the mouthpiece should be replaced every 3-6 months. Many studies prove that used bristles are not as effective in terms of plaque removal, as new ones. A single mouthpiece will cost \u20ac6.\nElectronics\nThe handpiece contains all of the complex technology. It creates strong vibrations with an amplitude of 9.5G to oscillate the bristles and clean your teeth. A clever algorithm ensures the generation of different vibrations. This results in a coordinated movement of the bristles, which are designed to have different resonant frequencies.\n10 Seconds\nAmabrush can brush your teeth in just 10 seconds, because all your teeth are cleaned simultaneously. Even in this 10 seconds, every tooth surface is cleaned longer compared with common toothbrushes. If you brush your teeth for the recommended 120 seconds with a regular toothbrush (manual or electric), every surface gets brushed for just 1.25 seconds (given the fact that you have 32 teeth and every teeth has three surfaces). Amabrush brushes all your surfaces for whole 10 seconds. This means: every tooth surface gets brushed 8x longer and the total toothbrushing duration is 12x quicker.\nPump, Battery & Charging\nA built-in mechanism foams and delivers the right amount of toothpaste to your teeth, and the integrated battery lasts for 28 sessions of toothbrushing. So if you go on vacation without the charging station, you can brush your teeth for at least two weeks twice a day.\nThe handpiece also comprises a low-energy wireless charging module (Qi). So yes, you could even use your wireless smartphone charger to charge Amabrush.\nSharing\nA magnetic connection on the handpiece gives you the opportunity to use Amabrush with different people. Simply put the mouthpiece near the handpiece, and the strong magnet will automatically do the rest for you. We were told that \"it really works like magic,\" and we think the same.\nNotice: if you want to share Amabrush with different people, you just need a single handpiece! Everyone needs their own mouthpiece, but you don't have to get a separate handpiece for every person!\nReplacement & Varieties\nThe toothpaste capsules are simply placed into the handpiece, automatically providing the perfect amount of toothpaste each time you brush your teeth. A single capsule lasts for more than a month, costs \u20ac3 and is available in three different, FDA-approved varieties: Extra Fresh (blue), Whitening (white) and Sensitive (rose - without fluoride). The toothpaste is specially formulated as it needs to be more liquid than regular ones.\nManufacturing\nThe toothpaste is formulated and produced by a major toothpaste manufacturer with a history of over 100 years. This manufacturer fulfills the quality norm DIN EN ISO 13485 and the requirements of IFS Household and Personal Care Products, and was one of the first manufacturers in Europe retrieving the IFS-HPC certificate.\nMagnetic Connection\nToothpaste Foam\n                                   Magnetic Connection\nVideo of using Amabrush prototype. Plaque was buildup on teeth by not brushing them for 30h. This is not meant as a proper clinical trial or plaque test, but as a demonstration of brushing teeth with Amabrush.\nPLAY\n\nPLAY\n\n          \n           Amabrush with Wireless Charging Station (included in Amabrush Pro packages)\n                                                                                                                           Further questions?\nPlease feel free to contact us any time via email or Facebook.\nPlease choose your package on the top right of this page.\nUSB-C instead of micro-USB! We got this request really often, and we too think that this is a great way to build Amabrush with top-notch technology right from the beginning. Many of you demanded such an upgrade, and your request is our command!\nFurthermore, we will offer a lid with integrated UV light as an add-on. This protects the mouthpieces of Amabrush from dust and other environmental influences, and sanitizes the mouthpieces with UV light. This is able to store and sanitize two mouthpieces. This is an accessory for the mouthpiece-storage-attachment (that comes included in the pro version). It features a door with a hinge, a mirrored interior panelling in order to get the most out of the UV lamp, and is a great addition in order to keep Amabrush hygienic and clean. You can add the add-ons to your order after the campaign ends.\nChoose between various different add-ons. The images above shown are for illustration purpose only! We'll offer a traveller case in order to store your Amabrush conveniently and hygienic when you are on vacation. Furthermore, our charging station will be modular. That means, if you use Amabrush on your own, you can simply detach the mouthpiece slots that are designed to store additional mouthpieces. All pro versions come with a charging station and two slots included. What's more, we will offer a tongue cleaner made out of the same antibacterial material, in order to keep your tongue smooth and clean. You can find additional details and choose these items after the Kickstarter campaign.\nYou requested this, we deliver it. All Amabrush units come equipped with a sound and light indicator, that is able to signal various different information about the current battery status, finished toothbrushing sessions, errors and other scenarios! Furthermore, we'll offer our specifically formulated toothpaste in big bottles, along with more durable and stable refillable toothpaste capsules. This will save shipping fees and total cost for you. Please have a look at our add-on section below the reward section for further details.\nYour request is our command! We will integrate Bluetooth to all of our rewards at no additional cost. With our Amabrush App for iOS & Android, you are able to connect to your Amabrush unit and make use of various possibilities. You can set different vibration modes (gum massage, whitening, burst mode, ...), configure cleaning time, reorder replacement parts and do many things more!\n                                                                                                 We truly believe in Kickstarter as a platform, where like-minded entrepreneurs and early adopters bring together innovative, disruptive and sophisticated projects to life. We already supported a dozen projects from other people on Kickstarter on our own.\nAmabrush is a completely new device and needs to be \"understood\" in the first place. Kickstarter connects us with people like us; fact-interested, early-adopting and technology-enthusiastic people.\nAmabrush needs your help to fully come to life. Prototypes and pre-production units were financed by ourselves. But the time has come, that we currently face high upfront expenses regarding tooling, certification, studies and minimum quantity purchases. \nWe strongly believe that we've created a product that many people are craving for, ourselves included. Without your support, we can not achieve the vision of future oral care.\nWe do also highly appreciate every feedback and requests regarding Amabrush. If you have something you want to share with us, please feel free to write us any time at feedback@amabrush.com\nWe came up with the idea of an automated toothbrush, simply because we are annoyed by brushing our teeth. Standing in front of the mirror for at least two minutes twice a day, was not really satisfying for us.\nMarvin Musialek, the founder, came up with the first prototype in 2015. Together with Martin Forstenpointner, a talented mechanical engineer, and Alexander Stummer, a sophisticated biomedical engineer, we brought the project to life. Advised by Dr. Hady Haririan, a professional dentist and member of the Medical University of Dentistry in Vienna and Austrian Society of Parodontology, we developed and tested Amabrush to the form it represents now. We've established an enthusiastic and interdisciplinary team, and we work closely with medical universities, dentists, and a lot of test customers, in order to make Amabrush as perfect as it can be. We are supported and funded by the Austrian government, private institutions and the European Commission.\nOur core team:\nWe at Amabrush love high quality products. They are durable, simple and \"just work\". We are proud to say that Amabrush is designed, developed and produced in Austria, Germany and USA. This ensures high quality, quick development and low delivery costs.\n                                           ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nOne part of Amabrush is highly complex; the mouthpiece. Such a form is not available on the market, as it is build out of a single material and the sophisticated arranged bristles can not be produced by every random injection molding company. We have a close dialog with our suppliers, who have a lot of experience with such complicated structures, and we implemented their feedback early into our development process.\n\nDespite that, we kept the internal parts simple. This allows us to develop quickly, and to choose between various different suppliers.\n\nOur team has a very strong background in management, product design and mechanical engineering. We have already defined our manufacturing flow and our sourcing of the various different parts. Not only this, but we are also in talks with several manufacturers for every part of Amabrush. This allows us to scale production and logistics accordingly, even if we encounter high demand or supply shortage.\n \nWe believe that we will start shipping Amabrush to our first supporters in the pilot-tester section in October 2017.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge \u20ac1 or more", "title": "THANK YOU", "descp": "You're truly awesome!\nYour full name will be listed on our main website in our supporter section, and of course we'll keep you updated on the progress of Amabrush.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}], "stat": ["330 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac9 or more", "title": "PERSONAL POSTCARD", "descp": "Thank you very much for your support!\nWe will send you a personal postcard with behind-the-scene images of our headquarter.\nFurthermore, your name will be listed on our main website in our supporter section and of course we'll keep you updated on the progress of Amabrush.", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Aug 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["35 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac79 or more", "title": "AMABRUSH BASIC", "descp": "Support us now and receive a basic version (Kickstarter special) of Amabrush for just \u20ac79.\nChoose your toothpaste variety after the campaign ends.\nINCLUDES:\nHandpiece\nMouthpiece\nToothpaste Capsule\nBasic Charger", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2017"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["3,945 backers", "Limited (35 left of 3980)"]}, {"amt": "Pledge \u20ac99 or more", "title": "AMABRUSH PRO -

Hit one of the buttons below and tag a friend or coworker who can't stop fidgeting!\n        How do I use it?\nIt's simple. Fidget Cube (patent pending) has six sides. Each side features something to fidget with:\n              Fidgeting that matches your style.\nFidget Cube is available in 10 different color schemes:\nDice, Graphite, Midnight, Aqua, Sunset, Berry, Fresh, Retro, Kickstarter Edition, and Backer Designed (design voted on by the Fidget Family!).\n            Why fidget?\nWe love this question. It's not uncommon to hear fidgeting being spoken about negatively. It's often labeled as unprofessional and deemed as anti-intellectual behavior.\nBut in reality, the exact opposite has been suggested to be the case. Below are just some of many resources highlighting the work that's being done to learn more about this behavior:\nThe Science Of Why We Fidget While We Work\nSquirm With Purpose\nStress Toys: Mindlessness With A Purpose?\nThe Benefits Of Fidgeting For Students With ADHD\nWhy Do We Fidget?\nUsing Stress Balls To Focus The Attention Of Students\nWe believe that the way we look at fidgeting needs to change.\nThis behavior isn't one that should continue to be stigmatized and mocked as unbecoming or inappropriate. We are passionate about the idea that fidgeting is a process that, with the right tools and outlet, can have positive and real-life applications.\n  Where can I use Fidget Cube?\n  It was incredibly important to us that the design of Fidget Cube was one that would look great on any desk, whether that desk belonged to a student or a CEO.\nThere are really no limits to when and where you can use Fidget Cube. Use it while listening to a lecture, or while studying for that upcoming test. Use it in the next meeting you have to attend (or lead). Use it at your desk while working on projects. Enduring a lengthy commute and need to relieve some stress? Fidget away. Marathoning a Netflix series? Yep, you can fidget then too.\n  But I already have a pen. Do I really need Fidget Cube?\nPens (and the wonderful clicking they do) were a huge inspiration in the design process of Fidget Cube. They are probably one of the most commonly used fidget \"tools\". We like to see Fidget Cube as more of a fidget \"toolbox\". You don't have to be constrained to simple clicking, you can pick your poison based on your mood. Yes... We are very serious about our fidgeting.\n  I don't really fidget. Would I enjoy Fidget Cube?\nWe think so! Not everyone fidgets the same amount. But spending the last few years deeply interested in the process of fidgeting, we've observed the fact that almost everyone fidgets to some extent, in a variety of ways.\nMaybe you're not the type of person who uses objects like paper clips or pencils to fidget with. If that's the case, it's very likely you fidget in some other way, such as bouncing your knee up and down, tapping your foot, or picking at lint in your pocket.\nWe believe that Fidget Cube provides a tangible way to capture your floating attention, regardless of whether you fidget consciously or subconsciously.\n  Rewards.\nFor believing in our vision, we want to thank you! Check out our rewards below:\n    Stretch Goals.\n         The Team.\n  We're Antsy Labs, and more specifically, Matthew and Mark McLachlan - brothers that have a passion for designing solutions to problems we come across in daily life.\nWhere are you in the process?\nAfter handfuls of prototypes, we've tweaked every last detail to arrive at the Fidget Cube you see today. We've got a number of working units, but in order to make enough for you to have one as well, we need to place a substantial minimum order for the first production run of Fidget Cube. That's why we're offering Fidget Cube to this awesome community before anyone else.\nWhat does your timeline look like?\nFidget Cube has been an idea we've been dying to bring to fruition since it was first conceived in 2012. The product you're seeing in this project is the result of innumerable hours of iterating and reiterating. We're perfectionists, and we wanted to make sure we got this one right.\nBelow, you'll see a brief outline of the journey we're on with Fidget Cube, starting from the first discussion about it to when all of you joined the story (and where we go from here)!\nWe are insanely excited to get Fidget Cube into your hands. So you can be sure that we're going to continue to work day and night until the very last Fidget Cube has shipped.\n  Help Out By Sharing Fidget Cube With Your Friends! (#fidgetfever)\nLike what you're seeing? Great! Don't be shy about sharing Fidget Cube with your friends. We've made it super easy. Just hit one of the buttons below (or at the top of the page).\nThe more people who know about Fidget Cube, the larger our community will become! And the larger the community, the better we'll be able to make Fidget Cube!\nWe can't do this without you!\n        Questions?\nAsk away! Shoot us a message or post a comment and we'll do our best to get back to you with an answer.\nFeedback?\nGot a creative idea you think we should implement with Fidget Cube? Don't hesitate - let us know! Fidget Cube is being made possible by you, and we want you to be a part of the creative process as well.\nInternational Backers\nThis project isn't just for backers in the United States. We'll be shipping Fidget Cube worldwide!\nThat being said, there are unique processes that apply specifically to international backers that we'd like you to be aware of. Please note that there is no way for us to charge any additional amount on our end for any applicable VAT/duties that may be a result of a specific country's local tax code. Therefore, these fees may be incurred upon receipt of your reward. These fees are the responsibility of each backer, and additional information regarding VAT/duties can be found in our FAQ below.\nIn addition, due to first class shipping fees and the dimensions of Fidget Cube, shipping rates may seem a bit high for some international locations. We calculated shipping rates beforehand, and are able to swallow some of the shipping costs on orders of 1 or 2 Fidget Cubes. Please note that shipping becomes completely free when you pledge for 5 or more Fidget Cubes.\nSome Final Thoughts.\nWhile we strongly believe in the many benefits of fidgeting, we aren't claiming to cure any illness or condition. Fidget Cube is a fun, unique way to customize your fidgeting. When designing Fidget Cube we were inspired by research that claims fidgeting might actually help individuals focus their attention. We have personally found that it helps us stay focused in boring meetings and while working on projects.\n   ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis isn't our first rodeo. We've brought several Kickstarter projects to life in the past, and have learned from our experiences. While we have been relentlessly concerned with the details throughout designing, prototyping, and planning for production, there is always the chance that pesky Murphy guy may make an entrance with that law of his.\n\nIn the event that things don't go as planned, whether it's a delay in the manufacturing timeline, shipping date, or something else, we promise to communicate honestly with you and work around the clock until we correct the issue.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Show Some Love", "descp": "You love the look of Fidget Cube.

in infrastructure, professional and business offerings with features that cost us $$ to provide, and the long term future of Chocolatey itself.\nChocolatey is the Alternative Windows Store for the thousands of programs and tools that are not able to be part of the Windows Store. Do you hate finding the right downloads? Do you spend hours getting your apps on a fresh install of Windows? Do you spend fruitless amounts of time checking for updates that make apps more secure? Chocolatey sweetens your Windows software management experience by automating away hours of work!\nWhy a Kickstarter?\nTo invest in non-free features we believe bring more stability, safety and security to Chocolatey. We talk more about this in the next section.\nTo support improvements to the infrastructure. We currently spend under $1K/month and see a need to more than double that to support a staging environment, a build/test infrastructure, and load balancing needs as Chocolatey continues to increase steadily in popularity. Right now the costs are paid by me and the tremendous generosity of others, including AppHarbor. We believe there is a crucial need for Chocolatey to become self-sustaining to reduce unforeseen risks.\nTo give the Chocolatey team more freedom to concentrate on Chocolatey so we can get these features to you faster.\nStretch goal: To ramp up a full time staff that can support your needs and continue to deliver awesome features to you. We can't do that at the current goal, that will help but it won't be enough for any of us to be full time. \nWhat Do You Get For Backing this Project?\nMost backers get professional/business at least 2 months ahead of everyone else! T-Shirts for some levels. And chocolate, like real chocolate goodness at one level!\n$5+ Level\nA heartfelt thank you and we'll keep you informed with all the backer updates!\n$25 Level\nBacker updates\n+ A T-Shirt with \"The Chocolatey Experience\" on it - available ONLY through the Kickstarter!

That's a very special offer available only through the kickstarter and only to 5 businesses!\nAt $1,200+ - + Beta access! +Workshop!\nAt $4,000+ - + Listed!\nChocolatey Professional / Chocolatey for Business \nWe have a number of features coming. Most of these will be done by the time we deliver the professional version, but some of them will follow shortly after.\nHighlighting a few things:\nPro/business only feed(s) supporting packages that are only available to professional and above customers. \nAlternate permanent download location - A private location that contains the installers for most packages, removing the instability of downloads that are removed from their distribution point (or updated to newer versions).\nVirus checking during runtime.\nExtensions - you will be able to extend Chocolatey functionality beyond the core offering, either from your own extensions or from community supported extensions (either free or for a reasonable fee). Eventually we are going to have a store front where you can install these extensions. And eventually we expect this feature to roll down to the free version. \nThe biggest features here are more safety, trust and predictability.\nNEED MORE DETAILS?\nWhat is Chocolatey?\nChocolatey helps good developers and system administrators become outstanding developers/sysadmins. Chocolatey goes to eleven.\nChocolatey is something you need if you've ever installed, upgraded, or removed software on Windows. It is an existing, proven, almost 4 year old project. For those familiar with *nix package managers, it is a binary package manager, sort of like yum or apt-get, but for Windows. The words \"binary package manager\" can be confusing for those who don't know what that means, but bear with me for a few minutes. Chocolatey is a tool that automates all the mundane getting and installing software work for you. You just select what you want installed and within a few minutes, Chocolatey has downloaded and installed (or upgraded) that software without need for further input from you. So while Chocolatey does the hard work, you can go get some coffee. Or sleep. Or do other more important things.\nThis may not seem very powerful at first, but imagine when you want to upgrade all of the software on your system to the latest, most secure versions, how do you do that now? Right. Manually:\nSearch for most recent version\nPick (hopefully) the right download\nWait for it to download\nUnblock it\nInstall it manually (next, next, next anyone?)\nHope it didn't install any malware\nNow do it again for EVERY piece of software on your system.\nNow let's talk about doing that same thing with Chocolatey:\nType \"choco update all\"\nImagine that. That you could type \"choco update all\" and simply walk away while Chocolatey goes to work upgrading everything you have installed and keeping your system safe and secure. But don't just imagine it, you can do this today. Right now. And it doesn't matter if you have 1 or 1,000 computers to do this on.\nChocolatey allows you to be extraordinary. While your friends and coworkers are stuck in the past doing all of that work manually, you are getting other things done. At the end of the day, automation allows you to do more. This is the power of Chocolatey.\n This is a really exciting time for the future of Chocolatey, so let's talk about where we are, where we want to go, and how we get there.\nWhere We Are\nToday we have an active and growing community with 2300+ packages and over 5 million downloads on the community feed (https://chocolatey.org)! Microsoft recently announced they are bringing Chocolatey to Windows proper through OneGet, a package manager aggregator. This validates Chocolatey as a longer term framework for package management on Windows going forward!\nAlmost four years ago I started working on an experiment that is now known as Chocolatey. I started the project because it gave me something I'd never had, the ability to automate the installation of software with just an internet connection and a set of simple commands. It was the solution to something I needed with Windows that I didn't see other projects fulfill in the same way. It has since grown into a stronger solution to the package management problem for Windows. I never imagined that so many other folks would find it as useful as I have!\nAs we look around the community, Chocolatey has some folks really excited about working on Windows! If you meet the right folks, they will tell you Chocolatey is awesome! And Chocolatey is awesome! But Chocolatey does have some rough edges. Chocolatey has a lot of potential, but it needs some definite improvements to infrastructure, some things need to be redesigned, etc. Chocolatey has also grown in popularity at a rapid pace, something that necessitates the need to support a higher amount of users. Chocolatey is completely free for users, but that does not mean it is without cost. Many of these costs are related to just keeping the lights on and making sure when you try to install a package there is something on the other end that responds.\nWe are seeing tools like Boxstarter build on top of Chocolatey and provisioners like Puppet, Chef and Salt all have Chocolatey providers for package management on Windows.\nWhere We Want to Go\nWe'd like to see Chocolatey around long term, so it really means we need to take things to the next level. We have realized that we need a freemium business model to support the continued existence of Chocolatey. For the long term viability of Chocolatey we need to be able to support business needs and professional users who want more predictability, stability and a safer user experience. \nMany of the major improvements will flow back down to the community at large who uses and benefits from the free version of Chocolatey and the community feed. \nAs we have seen with Chocolatey, the experiment worked. We're ready to move forward from the Chocolatey experiment to the Chocolatey experience!\nHow We Get There\nNow it's your turn. I need you (yes you, the one reading this), you the community, to tell me you want Chocolatey to stick around, to get better, and become something bigger than any of us ever intended! To become the project that everyone wants it to be. If you don't know how much you value Chocolatey, I want you to try an experiment: What if you turned on your computer tomorrow and Chocolatey was no longer available?\nGet involved. Even if this is the first project you've backed. Get your company involved. Get your friends and family involved. Let's make this happen! Let's Get Chocolatey!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery software project has risks. \n\nThe biggest question folks want to know before they get involved with software is will this work? If you go out and look at https://chocolatey.org now, you can see that we've had over 5 million downloads of software and have 2,000+ unique packages. So we're pretty sure this will work.\n\nIs OneGet a risk? Some people may be looking at OneGet and wondering if that is a threat or a complementary tool for Chocolatey. It is indeed a complementary tool, it uses Chocolatey, and a few other package managers. It itself is a package manager aggregator. Microsoft has had how many years to really solve this problem? I'm qualified to overcome the issue of Windows package management as I design things based on the most pragmatic methods, not necessarily what the shiniest new tools are. The Chocolatey framework was designed in a way that made the most sense and has proven itself to be the proper path forward. We'll continue to make small adjustments along the way as we continually get better. We are qualified to overcome the issue because we already have.\n\nWe are likely moving forward with a professional version whether we are funded or not. Funding means we get there much, much faster. And you get to take advantage of special rewards that are lower than the pricing for the general public.\n\nThe risk with any business is that we won't become profitable. We think we provide a much needed service to the community and we would like to continue to do so. And evolve what we are doing.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #70", "update_userinfo": "Renewal Link is Ready 2021", "update_content": "Howdy folks!

Ambitheater includes dynamic LED backlighting behind your television to compliment the in room lighting and extends the viewing area of the screen beyond the perimeter of the television.  These effects immerse the room and the viewer into the entertainment system and your favorite games, movies or TV shows. Ambitheater is already equipped with the software necessary to provide the lighting effects described, that means there is no need for a PC like some of the other devices out there!\nOur goal in designing the Ambitheater lighting system is to fulfill a need where all others did not go.  We have spent a significant amount of time searching for the right components and writing software to incorporate the desired licensing to allow for HDMI pass-through with HDCP support in an affordable commercial solution.  Along the way we were able to add some great features that are missing from the currently available systems on the market.  Have you ever asked one of the other ambient lighting system developers if their products worked with the PlayStation 4? Or any other HDMI input? What about HDCP? Well, their answer was always NO! Even if they claimed that they would, setup requires three or four devices to configure and many hours searching the internet for answers as to why it doesn\u2019t work.  With Ambitheater, the answer is YES.  No computer is needed for Ambitheater to function. Ambitheater will support any HDMI source even with HDCP.  With your help we will make this a reality!\nWhat is HDCP you ask.  HDCP stands for High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection.  It is designed to protect copyrighted media from being saved from an HDMI cable.  This is done by encrypting the signal on HDMI cables.  HDCP requires that manufacturers design their products to a certain set of rules and also pay a hefty fee to become an adopter.  We have created our software and designed our hardware to work within the guidelines set out by these HDCP rules.  \nAmbitheater provides support for WS2812 LED strips for TV backlighting.  These strips are the latest and greatest when it comes to LED light strips.  The strips have the controller IC built into the RGB LED to allow for each LED to individually be any color.  This allows the backlight to dynamically change with the action on the screen for the area that each LED is placed.\nWS2812\nThe Ambitheater controller has built-in support for Philips Hue lighting.  This extends the viewing experience beyond the two dimensional experience around the television.  The controller allows for up to six groups to be assigned and customized to set the color of each group of lights specified on the area of the screen.  Due to Philips\u2019 lack of reseller support for the Philips Hue, the Philips Hue lighting system must be purchased separately.\nPhilips Hue\nDue to backer requests there will be two lighting options for the in-room lighting effects.  Ambitheater will support both the Philips Hue and LimitlessLED bulb standards.  Due to limitations of the LimitlessLED system the in-room lighting will only be able to be setup into 4 groups when using LimitlessLED bulbs rather than the 6 that Philips Hue can support.\nLimitlessLED Lighting System\nThe future of television is changing.  With the latest 4K Ultra High Definition televisions gaining more support it would just be a matter of time before a mere 1080p will not suffice.  To prepare for this we have included 4K UHD up-scaling support.  In our search for the best way to implement HDMI pass-through with HDCP licensing we have found an affordable chip solution that will add 4K upscaling features.  Now you won\u2019t have to replace the Ambitheater controller when you upgrade to the 4K UHD standard.  As a side effect of this feature all 720p sources will be up-scaled to 1080p or 4K UHD if the TV can support it.  Imagine being able to stream Netflix, Hulu or Amazon at 4K UHD.  Can't beat that.\nWe have tried to incorporate every feature that we could think of while designing Ambitheater.  Here is a list of some of the features that we have incorporated into the controller:\nIn room lighting global dimming to adjust the brightness to your preference.\nRemotely configuration of the Ambitheater controller.\nAbility to enable or disable the in room lighting for those times when you would rather not be immersed in your entertainment.\nAdjustable update intervals for the in room lighting.  This enables the user to adjust how often the in room lighting will change to account for Phillips Hue limitations on advertisement rates.\nUp to 6 groups to set for the in room lighting to allow for multiple locations of lighting within the room.\nExpansion of LED TV backlighting for larger displays (may require an additional power adapter)\nSupports any HDMI input (PS3, PS4, XBOX360, XBOXOne, Wii, Wii-U, Computer, Blue Ray player, Cable Box, Streaming devices)\nThe video below showcases Ambitheater with in-room lighting disabled and auto detection of black bars on top and bottom and the sides.\nPLAY\n\nBacker Rewards\nWe have considered the fact that some of our potential backers have already invested in some of the other do-it-yourself and consumer options that are on the market and may already have the WS2812 LED strips but do not support HDMI with HDCP.  For this reason we are offering an early bird option for the controller only so you are not swimming in LED's.  Also Ambitheater can work with just the Philips Hue lights or LED's on their own if you so desire.\nBacker Rewards\nWhat\u2019s So Great About Ambitheater?\nWe can go on about how the lighting effect created by Ambitheater provides less strain on the eyes by allowing the pupils to relax rather than constantly adjusting to the variations in lighting caused by the television.  We can discuss how the human eye has a wide viewing angle beyond the focal point of your attention and Ambitheater will immerse your mind by adding a couple of feet of lighting around the perimeter of the screen and beyond into the room; but to get to the point, Ambitheater surrounds you with your entertainment by extending the viewing experience and incorporating the entire room into the viewing experience.  It just looks good.\nHow is the Project Going?\nWe currently have created a development prototype environment with the key components of Ambitheater.  With the weighty restrictions of HDCP and the cost of the licensing we are in need of some assistance to move forward.  Until we can become an HDCP Adopter we are not able to put the final piece into the design to complete the circuit board.  The manufacturer of the needed HDMI chip (that is just out of reach due to these restrictions) has worked closely with us to ensure that once we are considered an HDCP Adopter, all that is needed is to drop the chip in and make a couple of tweaks to the software to manage the chip.  Currently we are using a similar non-HDCP replacement for the HDMI chip that produced the effects in the video.  We have created and tested the software for the processor that will be used in the Ambitheater controller.  We have sourced all of the components that will be implemented in the final product and we have created a preliminary PCB design using all of the components including the much needed HDMI chip.\nDevelopment Board Prototype\nCase Conception\nWhat\u2019s In the Box?\nWith our current design, Ambitheater will come with the HDMI pass-through controller, 5 meters of 30 LED's/meter WS2812 LED strips, and a power supply for your country specification.  If you found us in time for the backing option for the controller without the 5 meter LED strip then the LED's will not be in the box as you would prefer.\nInstalling Ambitheater\nIf you choose to get the LED strips from us, the strips will have double sided tape for the whole length.  No cutting is required for installation.  Just stick the strip to the back of the television around the perimeter.  At each corner simply fold the strip at a 90 degree angle and continue sticking the tape around the television.  Lastly plug the three pin JSP connector into the Ambitheater controller.\nTo install the controller, simply plug an HDMI input into the Ambitheater controller from an HDMI source and an HDMI output from the Ambitheater controller to the television.  Plug the provided power supply into the controller and allow it to boot up.  The controller will allow for simple configuration settings from an Ethernet input.  For Philips Hue support the Ethernet connection will need to be connected to your home network.\nHardware Setup\nFollow directions for setting up the Philips Hue system to include the specific bulbs into up to six groups by following the Philips Hue instructions provided by Philips.  Enter the group names into the Ambitheater controller web configuration page for each of six areas of capture.\nThe Ambitheater controller can officially support up to 200 LED\u2019s with the included power adapter.  If more LED\u2019s are needed a separate power supply will be required and connected directly to the LED strip.The Ambitheater controller can support 450 LED\u2019s for data control only, but will require the additional power supply.\nSchedule\nCurrently we have done all of the research, component selection, software creation, PCB design and initial prototype testing.  We are now running the Kickstarter campaign immediately followed by HDCP licensing and then PCB prototyping, case creation and other certifications such as UL and HDMI. We will be shipping to Early Bird backers starting June 1st 2015.  Slow Bird shipments will follow shortly after on July 1st 2015.\nSchedule\nWhat We Will Do with the Money\nWe have priced out all of the components, manufacturing costs, certification and the other various items that typically come up with the design and manufacturing of a product.  The below chart shows the amounts that we have calculated in order to manufacture 1000 Ambitheater systems.  Why so many? Well, this is the minimum order quantity that best suits the need to keep the price of Ambitheater as reasonable as possible.  As you can imagine the components needed to bring the advanced features included in Ambitheater to life require certain commitments to keep them affordable.  The LED strips alone typically retail between $60-$75.  We intend to beat this price to ensure a better deal for our Kickstarter backers.\nCosts\nWho is Ambitheater Technologies?\nWe are hobbyists, we are tinkerers, we are movie lovers, we are gamers and we are people just like you who want a product like this and we want to share it with you.  We chose to build Ambitheater and not allow a simple license to stop innovation.  We waited for years for this device to be made and when it didn\u2019t come, we decided to do it ourselves.\nWho's Our Competition?\nAlmost all ambient lighting systems on the market right now do not support HDMI input. They require the video source to be generated from a computer. This works well for some people, but there are many other common sources of video which are not supported.\nOne of the closest competitors to Ambitheater is a do-it-yourself project which requires various components that may be difficult to find. The solution for HDCP that this program has created is to purchase an HDMI splitter which strips HDCP on one output port. These splitters are not readily available. Once the HDCP license issuer becomes aware of a manufacturer creating a device that does this, all HDCP licenses are pulled from the manufacturer so no further devices can make it to market.  The cost of creating this DIY setup could be up to $150 once the $70 LED strip and the other components are purchased.  This DIY setup has no video up-scaling included. Video up-scaling products on the market would be a $40 value in the cheapest scenario. This does not address the time that it takes to set everything up in Linux not to mention the troubleshooting that comes once it becomes apparent that it doesn't work correctly.  Ambitheater has a simplified configuration page for easy setup and the price is comparable to this do-it-yourself project.\nThe second similiar product on the market is the AmbX system.  It is not really a competitor because it is meant more for a concert hall. Although it is feasible to build an AmbX system in your home. The price makes it an unreachable option for most. These products cost upwards of $6000. Ambitheater will bring this experience into your home for far less. \n Thank You for your consideration! I hope you find Ambitheater as interesting as we do.  We have worked hard to get to this point. Please consider backing Ambitheater so we can all have our own immersive entertainment system. Please join us on this journey to create a great product.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe feel that the risk is low. We have set out to make this product and we have setup our network of suppliers and manufacturers. We have researched the HDCP/HDMI certifications and licensing and have planned accordingly to be within those guidelines. We have planned our schedule to mediate any delays that may come up. There may be some redesigns of the prototype to ensure signal quality but we are prepared for this and will get Ambitheater to a final product. We just need your help to get us over this restrictive hurdle and into production.\n\nWe have considered every aspect in getting Ambitheater to you at the lowest price possible and also ensure our success. The current price in this campaign is a discounted price compared to our market analysis and retail projective pricing. Please don't hesitate to back this project. When we get closer to our goal we will role out our stretch goals to make Ambitheater even better.

I got to Tokyo and despite years of study I could pick out maybe three spoken words a minute. It was a painful experience, so when I got back I started thinking of ways to solve that problem. Over seven years, I developed this game that simplifies Japanese by making its most confusing concepts (sentence structure and particles) into a simple card game!\nEarlier this year, Japanese: The Game had its public debut right here on Kickstarter. Now over 10,000 decks have been printed and thousands of people are learning Japanese by playing a card game. Japanese has a reputation for being difficult to learn because of its differences from English. But when you learn the language from its own perspective, it's relatively simple, logical, and consistent. Japanese: The Game lets that simplicity shine. And it's fun to play!\nI believe strongly in bringing the world together. With tools like Japanese: The Game, I think we can make a better effort. The Tokyo Edition Core Deck and the Expansion Decks on this page teach the basics of Japanese grammar and a lot of vocabulary in a way that helps students have fun learning. If you've ever wanted to learn Japanese, or you know someone who does, I invite you to join in the fun!\nMost cards in Japanese: The Game are actual Japanese words, like mizu meaning Water or nomu meaning Drink. You play the cards by following a color pattern explained in the instructions (and an Easy Reference Card) that makes your sentence automatically grammatically correct. Here's an example from the Japanese Food Expansion (of the first Kickstarter):\nWhen you put these cards together they form a grammatically correct sentence.\nIn this case we have a sentence meaning \"(I) drink water.\" But you could play a different red-topped card, like sell, to sell water instead.\nThe cards have English letters, Japanese phonetic letters (hiragana and katakana), and Japanese Kanji so you can improve your Japanese no matter your current level, even if it's your first encounter with the language. A mobile app is also available on Android (and soon iOS) that will scan the bar code at the bottom and pronounce the word for you in Japanese so you know you're getting it right!\nIf you want to see a demo of the game being played, here's a video of the competitive play mode. You can get a good feel for the gameplay even if you only watch the first two or three minutes.\nPLAY\n\nThere are also solo and collaborative modes, so you can learn on your own or in a non-competitive group setting.\nThis Kickstarter introduces the new Tokyo Edition Core Deck, themed after my favorite city in the world! It contains a selection of simple words from the various parts of speech (nouns, verbs, etc.) that will help you learn vocabulary at the same time as Japanese sentence structure. The backgrounds of the cards will be photographs of the city and many words in the deck will be of a Tokyo-specific flavor. The words in the Tokyo Edition will be different from the Original Core produced earlier this year so you can increase your vocabulary whether or not you have the Original.\nA Core Deck has 72 cards--enough for two players. Either Core is sufficient to play the game and get comfortable with Japanese sentence structure and grammar. You need at least one Core Deck to play the game. Either a Tokyo Edition Core or an Original Core will do, or you can use them both in the same game. Expansion Decks usually have 36 cards, which is enough to add another player. (More detailed explanations of how these decks work together are in the FAQ at the bottom of the page.)\nExpansion Decks follow a specific theme or concept. The first Kickstarter project included: a Business Expansion with office vocabulary and photography by Travis Feldman, an Anime Expansion with words common to anime and art by WickedAlucard, and a Monsters (Kaiju) Expansion with classic movie monsters and art by Micah Hornung. It also had Expansions for Travel, Japanese Food, and an Intermediate-level Expansion for Conjugations. These are still available as options if your Backer Level includes Expansions, or as add-ons, by increasing you pledge by $10 per Expansion.\nArt sample from first Kickstarter\nSo the last Kickstarter had these six Expansions:\nThis time around we're going to have a whole new set of expansions to help you learn new vocabulary and concepts!\nAbout a hundred people have asked me for a deck about animals, so we're totally doing an Animals Expansion. A lot of people don't know how awesome and complete the Japanese list of animal sounds is. Rabbits, dragonflies, and foxes actually say something in Japanese, and their sounds will be on the cards!\nFor those interested in the beauty of the language, we'll have the first Advanced Expansion: Calligraphy with brushwork by the amazing Japanese calligrapher Yamasaki Sho with cards that will look like this:\nThis deck will help players learn Japanese kanji and gain points by building words made up of several characters. The kanji's meaning and dictionary-style examples of each character will be in the rules document, as will many word-building options and the bar codes to scan for pronunciation. So the cards will have full functionality, and will definitely still be usable by less advanced learners with some effort, but the card faces will be minimalist, focused on the beautiful art of written Japanese.\nSpeaking to children requires a kind of Japanese that is both loving and authoritative. The Children Expansion will teach you words you don't use when talking to adults... unless they're acting like children (which happens). It will also help you tell them to sit still, play nice, take turns, and brush their teeth.\nPeople love learning vocabulary that's easy to remember, which is why one of the most requested decks is a Household Items Expansion. You'll learn the words for things you see every day so you can repeat them in your head. You could even place the Fridge card on the fridge with a magnet. But don't put the waste basket card in the waste basket.\nThe Martial Arts: White Belt Expansion is also rolling out with this Kickstarter. Words valuable in martial arts will be included for study and hilarity. Mixing and matching it with other expansions can result in glorious sentences like \"If Godzilla attacks, our honorable grandfather will roundhouse kick him into an office building.\"\nJapanese culture has a strong social structure that is reflected in their language. You use different pronouns and verbs when referring to people of a higher or lower social level. The Intermediate Expansion: Respect will include names, titles, and verbs with varying degrees of respect to help you speak appropriately in different situations. And you can even be in it! See pledge levels to the right.\nThe surprise SLANG EXPANSION is an amazing deck. In a survey during the original Kickstarter it was the second-most requested but the one wanted most emphatically. It is now available as an option for Backers at Gakusha Level and up, and is FREE for all backers at the Samurai Level ($80) and above!!\nBecause we hit $46,000 in funding, we also get the Fantasy Expansion! With artwork by Alice Bessoni, this expansion will help you learn how to make sentences like \"The young warrior defeats the evil wizard.\" Here's a sample of her art (or see this link for more information):\nThe Fantasy Expansion will feature Western-style fantasy art. You can look forward to a Japanese-style Fantasy deck called the \"Storytelling Supercore\" next year.\nThe Counting Expansion was unlocked when we reached our $80,000 stretch goal! Counting is a little different in Japanese and this Expansion Deck will help you learn your numbers and how to count people, cards, bikes, books, and other every-day objects!\nIf we reach the $90,000 Stretch Goal, we'll also get an Anatomy Expansion with nouns like Arm, Shoulder, Leg, Neck, and verbs like Turn, Reach, and Point. This is very useful vocabulary and the explanations and example sentences will help you make sure you're using them properly.\nHere's a helpful table of the reward levels available:\nJUST UNLOCKED: THE COUNTING EXPANSION! See \"Decks\" section above for details!\nAnd now a new Add-on is available--a wooden Double Box! This black-stained wooden box will hold up to four Core Decks plus 12-14 Expansion Decks. It has a divider running the length inside and is sized to accommodate sleeved cards. The red Japanese: The Game logo is screen-printed on top. It is available as an add-on for $28.\nIf you have any questions about these backer levels, please feel free to message me at any time!\nFIRST STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: Now we can have the beautiful art for a much-requested Fantasy Expansion! It will be available to anyone as an add-on for backers under the Samurai Level, but from Samurai Level up, it will be included at no charge!! So when you share the project, let everyone know that certain tiers get all the new Expansions, because I've got a feeling it's not going to stop here!!!\nSECOND STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: There are a whole lot of backers who are going to want a box large enough for both the previous Kickstarter and the current one. When we reached 500 backers we unlocked a Double Box with enough room for 4 Core Decks and 12-14 Expansion Decks! This is now available as a $15 add-on.\nTHIRD STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: At $65,000 we bumped up the Martial Arts: White Belt Expansion to be an Expansion and a half!! Instead of the standard 36 cards, it will have 54 cards. That's 50% more punch, kick, and throw in Japanese!\nFOURTH STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: At $80,000 we earned the Counting Expansion, which will not only teach you how to count in Japanese, but also to count objects. Every time you count things in Japanese you use a \"counter.\" This expansion teaches a very important skill a lot of English speakers have a hard time picking up, so congratulation on unlocking this one!\nFIFTH STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED: At 1,000 backers, the Tokyo Edition Core Deck got a Wild Card! If you're playing and your hand is one noun away from an amazing combo or one particle away from an amazing, game-changing sentence, this card will hit the spot automatically. I think you're going to love the little twist this gives the game.\nSIXTH STRETCH GOAL: If we reach $90,000 we'll get the Anatomy Expansion! It will contain nouns like Arm, Shoulder, Leg, Neck, and verbs like Turn, Reach, and Point. This is very useful vocabulary and the explanations and example sentences will help you make sure you're using them properly. I hope we can break this barrier because that would be AWESOME!\nJapanese: The Game is helping people learn Japanese in 45 countries already, but this is just the beginning. More target languages like Korean and Mandarin are in the works, and producing the game in more home languages like German and French will allow all millions of people to enjoy greater understanding.\nBut in the near future, I'd like to put some free study games on JapaneseTheGame.com. I also want to roll out a Lost Words Expansion with some words I really wish I could have included in the Original Core and the Original Expansions, as well as a handful of others.\nIf you like what's happening with this project, I invite you to back it and share it. If you're in a board gaming group or a Japanese class or an anime club or you know people who are, I'm sure they'll at least be interested to know this exists. There's a Share button right below the main video at the top!\nThanks for your support! Let's change the world!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe first Kickstarter for Japanese: The Game had a much greater than anticipated response, funding at over 2200% of the campaign goal. That made every bump and hiccup in the process much more consequential, and the expected three- and four-month delivery dates ran all the way to 8 months. Almost 10% of the original backers are still waiting for their cards, which have been printed but are bound up in distribution complications. I've chosen a new distribution contractor for this project.\n\nSince then I've rearranged my life to dedicate full time to Japanese: The Game. I've also stretched the delivery dates to six months even though I have more time every month to work on it.

That means the files I loaded into the previous Chinese printer were also bad, but I didn't work with them long enough to find that out. And with the current, American printer I got so frustrated when I found this out that I had a sense of dread every time I'd think about the project. In the last couple of weeks I went back to find out where the files started being useless and was relieved to find that at least my source material is mostly intact. Our developer Jacob has created a tool to recompile the source material. He also made one to create the PnPs. So the fact that I don't have to do it all myself is a positive.

The project is literally about \"reading\" the earth for letterforms, or alphabet shapes, \"written\" into the topology of buildings, roads, rivers, trees, and lakes. To do this, we will traverse the entire planet's worth of satellite imagery and develop the tools and methods necessary to map these features hiding in plain sight. \nThe entire letterform database will be made available as a \u201cusable\u201d dataset for any of your art/design/science/textual projects and selected letterforms will be made into a truetype/opentype font format that can be imported to your favorite word processor.\nOnly with your support can we turn topography into typography and bring Aerial Bold to you!\nWhy Kickstarter? \nContrary to popular belief, much of the world has not been mapped. While satellites orbit around the earth taking thousands of images each day, we have limited idea about what unique features actually live on those photographs.\nAerial Bold is as much about developing new methods of mapping features on the earth\u2019s surface, as it is about generating the first map and typeface of the planet. It is our intention to offer non-domain experts (e.g. artists, designers, citizen scientists, etc.) a set of tools to source their own datasets and inspire people from all backgrounds to explore geographic data. The importance in kickstarting Aerial Bold is to showcase the creative and technical process of \u201cmaking your own data\u201d.\nAs a two-man army, we will be experimenting with \u201cnew\u201d ways to train image processing algorithms to find geometric patterns and use these scalable methods to find the shapes of the alphabet over the entire earth.\nOn a small scale, such as in a community or small city, image processing tasks don\u2019t pose a big challenge, however on a large scale (e.g. the entire earth, or the entire US), the computational requirements can be paralyzing. This is why we\u2019re asking for your help.\nWith your support we will be able to purchase dedicated computing/server space to run our satellite image based alphabet searching algorithm. The funding support will help keep the typeface, the maps, and the alphabet metadata (e.g. geo-coordinates, address, etc) alive in cyberspace for people to download, use, view, and explore.\nWho Are We?\nBenedikt Gro\u00df\n@bndktgrs\nBenedikt is a computational and speculative designer from Germany with over 12 years of experience in design, digital media, and computer programming.

While we are dedicated to deriving earth\u2019s letterforms by developing the best possible methods using computer vision, there will most certainly be some cases in which more manual labor will be employed. This will be especially true for regions of the world where imagery and data are of lower resolution and less available and when validating each letterform (e.g. is what the computer thinks is an alphabet shape indeed an alphabet shape?). \n\nThrough brute-force approach (manually finding letters), we\u2019ve already compiled a complete alphabet dataset, and in many cases have found multiples of each letter. We know there are more out there and we want you to have access to all of them. \n\nLegalise:\nDeriving data from satellite imagery is and can be a tricky thing from a legal point of view. All of the companies that provide aerial imagery online (e.g. Google, etc) have specific terms and conditions, which almost always forbid any data mining of the imagery. For some aerial imagery providers, however, there are provisions that allow you to derive data from their imagery (e.g. if the data is contributed to OSM, openstreetmap.org).\n\nThese are indeed important considerations, but we\u2019re optimistic and have already planned out ways forward. First, we approach one of the aerial imagery providers and they simply allow us to use the data for this project (we\u2019ll keep you updated!). If we have no luck in accessing pre-made global imagery tileset, no problem! We can start with the parts of the world where imagery is available at high resolutions under public domain (e.g. in the United States) and continue from there. Regardless of the imagery source, we will combine the imagery data with OSM data which includes quite a comprehensive global database of vector buildings, roads, trees, lakes, rivers, etc. Together, these will serve as the basis of our alphabet shapes. \n\nNone of these approaches are mutually exclusive. \n\nWe are confident that we can bring Aerial Bold to you!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [], "updates": [{"update_no": "UPDATE #15", "update_userinfo": "Reward Shipping", "update_content": "Aerial Bold is Finally Here!\nDear Backers and Friends of Aerial Bold,\nPLAY"}, {"update_no": "UPDATE #14", "update_userinfo": "3...2...1...

Earth has sent a team of explorers to investigate them, but after an accident, you are the sole survivor. Your mission remains the same: survey these worlds and write the only accounts of them that outsiders will ever know.\nThe game is now in development, and will launch in the first quarter of 2015 for Windows, Mac, and Linux on Steam. Beta keys will go out as soon as the Kickstarter ends.\nIf you are unable to pledge on Kickstarter, or missed the Kickstarter period, you can still pledge and get most rewards here.\nWe created Elegy so that everyone can write. As you explore, the game helps you create the narrative. You begin on Shelley's World, now devoid of life. A bloated, red sun scorches a landscape of towers, sculptures, and cryptic machinery.\nAs you encounter these elements, Elegy will cue you with a series of writing prompts. Here, for instance, the game asks you to describe the landscape:\nThere are many stories to write and many places to visit, from the crumbling museum, stone faces, and sweltering plains of Shelley's World to the central planning station on Keats' World to the desiccated shores and frigid tundra of Byron's World.\nEach world offers multiple sets of prompts, each intended to inspire you to write a different story about it. Elegy might ask you to write a short story about an individual's final days, a song about resignation, or a poem about war. In the more advanced levels, you'll sometimes get new information halfway through your story which casts a new light on things and forces you to take your story in a different direction. We like to think of those as puzzles -- writing yourself out of a corner, so to speak.\nWhen you've completed your narrative, you have the option to share it with other players through Steam Workshop or reproduce it in digital and print media.\nShare your stories and read other players' stories.\nYou can read other players' works, browsing through the most-recent, the best-loved, and recently-trending stories.

Here's some of the kudos we've received:\nSelected preview articles and other mentions:\nEurogamer: The write stuff: Elegy for a Dead World preview\nRock Paper Shotgun: Shelley They Can\u2019t Be Serious\nJoystiq: Elegy for a Dead World turns players into poets\nMashable: 8 Breathtaking Indie Games Stealing Hearts at E3\nBBC: E3: What video games to expect for the new-gen consoles\nPC Gamer: The Best PC Games of 2014\nNew Scientist: Storytelling beats action in new games\nEl Pa\u00eds: Jugar con versos en el planeta Byron\nAnd here's a Gamespot video interview from the E3 convention in LA, with project leads Ichiro and Ziba.\nDevelopment started in October 2013 on what was initially a week-long experiment. It has since grown into a passion project that we've been self-funding. We're committed to finishing this project, but we need your help to give it the final push.\nTo create a world, the game's designers, Ichiro and Ziba, sit down to consume British Romance-era poetry, and sketch them as stories. Illustrators Jonathan and Luigi interpret that to create flat-colored mockups, which Luigi spends months turning into the beautiful hand-drawn scenes and layers that you see in the game:\nArtwork, from concept to completion\nWe still have a lot left to do:\nPainting and animating additional artwork for each world\nCreating lush soundscapes\nComposing multiple writing prompts and puzzles\nYour pledge will help us take the time we need to achieve our vision.

Save stories locally, and create images you can share on your website, blog, or an image hosting site. If you've selected a Steam key as a reward, you'll receive a link to download the DRM-free version after version 1.0 of the game launches.\nGOAL REACHED: 1,000 Stories\nEducators have approached us about using Elegy to teach creative writing and language skills. Help us reach this goal, and we'll give a hand-picked group of schools 1,000 copies of the game for free.\nDejobaan Games has been making games since 1999, and is approaching its 20th commercial launch. The multi-award-winning studio is best known for its BASE jumping game AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! \u2014 A Reckless Disregard for Gravity, visual novel Monster Loves You!, and bullet-hell FPS Drunken Robot Pornography.\nPopcannibal's awards include an IndieCade E3 Selection, IGF Honorable Mention 2014, Official Selection Gamercamp Toronto 2013, Unity Awards Finalist 2013, Official Selection PAX East Indie Showcase 2011, and \"Most Meaningful Game\" at the International Academic Conference on Meaningful Play 2008.

During the summer, the ebook of the first year of stories appeared regularly in the list of Amazon's top 100 selling superhero novels. It's been positively reviewed as a serial on Web Fiction Guide, and as novel at Goodreads, and Amazon.\nThe Legion of Nothing: Vol. 1, Rebirth\nI'd like to make more of the Legion's adventures available on Amazon, but 1889 Labs, the small press I was working with, is not currently publishing new fiction.\nTo bring the books to readers at the same level of quality as before, I'll need your help. \nWhere the Legion of Nothing Came From:\nBack in 2007, I'd decided I wanted to publish a story on my blog. It couldn't be a story that publishing houses would want because then I would have lost out on a chance to become a published author.\nFortunately, superhero fiction (stories about superheroes without the comic) was completely impossible to publish. It didn't even have a section where you'd expect to find it in the local bookstore.\nIf it appeared at all, it would be the novelization of a movie in the science fiction section.\nThe Story I Wanted To See:\nOnce I knew that, I began to think about the superhero stories that I wanted to see. I wanted to write stories consistent with the years of time I'd spent learning Tae Kwon Do. I wanted to write stories where the fights felt realistic, but also fights where the violence wasn't glorified.\nIn my view at least, I'd read too many stories where one tough guy fought another tough guy, and both of them were completely used to the idea that they'd probably completely destroy a city's downtown when they fought.\nI wanted to write about people who wouldn't be used to it, people who would feel guilty if they destroyed somebody's small business during a fight, and people who would be bothered about how much they'd have to hurt somebody to stop them.\nIn the end I came up with Nick Klein and his friends, teenagers who'd inherited their powers and equipment from their nearly legendary grandparents. They're simultaneously kids of whom great things are expected, but also kids who are connected to cape culture, but not part of it.\nThis means that the life of a superhero is familiar to them, but it's not normal.\nWhere We Are Now:\nIn the past seven years, the Legion of Nothing has gone from a series of stories on my blog to a story that people outside my family and friends have actually heard of.\nI'd like to turn the next two years of Legion of Nothing stories into ebooks and print, and I'd like to do it with the same standards as before.\nWith $1,500, I'll be able to publish the second Legion of Nothing book (Powers) and the campaign will be fully funded.\nWhat I'm Asking For:\nI'm asking for $1500. This is how it breaks down.\n$500 for creating a cover and formatting it for print and ebook\n$250 for proofreading\n$250 for ISBN numbers\n$500 for rewards and taxes\nIf we make $3000, it will be pretty much the same for the second book except add $500 for editing the second book and skip the $250 for ISBN numbers.\nStretch Goals: \nWith $3000, I'll be able to publish the third book (Dueling Powers).\nTo help encourage people to donate and reach $3000, I've made a few changes.\nTo rewards:\nAs of now, anyone who donated $25 or more automatically gets all three ebooks in their preferred format--Kindle, epub, or pdf.\nAlso as of now, anyone who donated more than $150 gets signed print versions of the first three books. \nIt's worth noting, however, that book 3 ebooks and printed books will come in April rather than January.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe only challenge I see is shipping out all the physical rewards. While I've chosen reliable suppliers (Createspace for books and Vistaprint for everything else), there's still a chance that there will be problems.

I've been furloughed from my job during the month of May and have been using the time to work on the third book. It's been part of an overall pattern I've noticed.

The other part, though, was to ask if anyone had any questions that they'd like to see answered before the serial ends. To be clear, that won't happen soon, but it will happen.\n\nRelated to that, I began the process of plotting out the rest of the series today. The way it's looking right now, that'll be six additional novel length works plus assorted short stories and novellas. At my current writing speed, that'll be six years of work. We'll see what actually happens. My hope is to put out at least one novel per year, possibly more. I've got roughly eight novel length works on the site right now (one of which is a short story collection), so we could see 14 Legion of Nothing novels before all this is over.

We spent hours pretending to be wizards and casting epic imaginary spells.\nNow, we want to bring that kind of creative freedom to video games.  Instead of giving the player pre-packaged spells, CodeSpells allows you to craft your own magical spells.  It's the ultimate spellcrafting sandbox.\nWhat makes it all possible is code.  The game provides a coding interface where you can specify exactly what your spells will do. This interface is intuitive enough for individuals (young and old) who have never coded before.  But skilled coders will also enjoy using their coding skills in new and creative ways!  Even children can use this interface to make mountains out of the terrain, make an impenetrable force field around yourself, or even make a golem creature out of the surrounding rocks. The sky is the limit!\nSpell-crafting sandbox: Craft and test your spells on the surrounding landscape - lift rocks, whip a river up into a tornado, anything!  The spells are cooler spells than in any video game to date -- because you and the rest of the CodeSpells community have complete control over them.  If you'd rather use \"boxed\" spells (maybe for inspiration before designing your own spells) these will be available too!\nUnlimited creative expression: With 4 different elements (earth, fire, water, air) and the ability to combine those elements in complex ways, the number of spells you can create is literally infinite.\nLearn some coding: If you already know coding, great! If not, CodeSpells uses an intuitive drag-and-drop language that even children can use.  As they become more proficient, they can code in typed Javascript!  It's the coolest way to learn one of the world's most valuable skills. \nShare spells with friends: As soon as you create a new spell, send it over to your friends for them to try out! CodeSpells will have community forums where users can show off their favorite spells with other wizards or work collaboratively on spell projects.\nPlay Online: Create new game modes to play with and against your friends. We'll give you the tools to make anything from a survival game to a new magic-based sport!\nFor the CodeSpells world we will be creating procedurally generated levels that change over time as you affect the elements and their distributions throughout the map. We've come up with a system for simulating the effects of elements in the world that will dynamically change as the environment changes. An area in shadow will be less hot than an area in direct sunlight. Altitude will change the weather. Land close to a water source will be humid, so more vegetation will grow there. Hot and dry areas will be more prone to catching fire. We'll be able to simulate fire spreading, water flowing through new areas, and constantly changing biomes. The world will feel truly dynamic and alive.\nFor the sandbox version of CodeSpells you'll be able to freely use any spells you create to affect these environments and understand the way the systems work together. You'll be able to redirect rivers and play with the environment as a living system.\nYou will be able to level up from experience gained through gameplay. Each element will be bound to a different mana bar that can be increased so that your character can be customized.  Specialize in one element, or learn them all.\nWe are developing several game modes that make full use of the generated areas of CodeSpells, but we'll also be opening up the ability to make new game modes to you. If you want to make a game about surviving in the wilderness, you'll have all the tools to do that. If you want to create a game mode that's purely about balancing an eco-system, you'll also be able to do that. You can even create a new multiplayer magic-based sport to play with your friends. You'll be able to share these and discover game modes that other people have create around the world. At the core, CodeSpells is about creative expression. We want you to be able to customize the experience and give you the power to use your magic in the worlds you create.\nThe statistics about coding education are alarming: \nPart of the reason kids choose not to pursue coding is because it doesn't sound \"fun\": working in a basement, dealing with syntax errors... We hope to make an impact in the world by showing kids (and adults) that coding can be a tool for creative expression.\nStudents can learn to code, syntax-error free using a Blockly spell-crafting interface that has all the tools available in Javascript. When they've learned all the programming concepts from Blockly, students can move on to typing Javascript code.\nThe wizards of CodeSpells will be able to master each of the 5 elements. As you grow more powerful, elemental magic can be combined into even stronger spells.\nEarth\nEarth is aligned with geological forces and a deep understanding of the physical world. Earth magic users understand the geological timescale. These wizards are both powerful builders, building castles and deforming terrain, but also powerful foes, with the ability to hurl boulders and create secret pitfalls.\nEarth orbs use the physical forces of the world to attract and repel objects away from each. They can apply directional forces or torques to objects they touch. With Earth magic you could create a rock fortress that only you know the secret way into or you could create a Rock Golem to defend you as you explore the world.\nFire \nFire is the spark that started the universe. While fire users appreciate a fire's simple light and warmth, they can also unlock its more destructive potential -- burning forests and melting glaciers.\nA fire orb has the ability to burn things in its path, but it also has the ability to reconstruct things from ashes at a high mana cost. A player could teleport themselves by turning themselves into ash, having the orb fly through an un-walkable area, and reconstructing themselves on the other side.\nWater \nWater is an ever-changing substance, and water wizards are aware of water in all its forms: water, ice, and vapor.\nWater orbs are primarily about interacting with the flow of the environment. You can redirect rivers or put out fires. You can affect the world in a sustained way to flood an area or to create new forests.\nAir \nAir ties everything together and is combined with the other elements to amplify their precision. Because of its broad area, air is often used as a defensive art.\nAir orbs are about sensing the world. They have a wide radius and have a more defined understanding of what they touch. As a wizard you can capture sounds from one area and alter the way they manifest themselves. If you wanted to be stealthy, you could use an air orb to suppress your footstep sounds or emit them elsewhere to confuse creatures or other players.\nLife (The 5th Element) \nLife is the most powerful element, and therefore the most difficult to master (See stretch goals). Life magic can be used to grow forests and affect creatures.\nLife orbs represent a deeper understanding of programming and being able to deconstruct prebuilt code. Creatures will have code that through observation and Life orbs you'll be able to open up and explore. With that, you can alter their behavior and tame them. If you see a creature defending its home, you can cast a Life orb to study the creature and expose the concept of 'defending a target'. You then have access to the defend function for a creature and can redirect it to defend you.\nAdrian Lopez-Mobilia, Lead Video Game Developer - Adrian has been developing video games for several years. He was the Lead Programmer for the indie game God of Blades and has done robotics research.\nJason Rosenstock, Lead Video Game Artist - Jason has been an Illustrator & Environment Artist for 15 years with a specialty in Fantasy Art.

With Kickstarter, we feel like we can connect with you and get feedback immediately from people truly interested in seeing CodeSpells succeed.\nCurrent Status\nWe have a system for crafting spells in a drag-and-drop language. We have an early version of gameplay for earth magic completed, and we've started prototyping the other elements, but we still have plenty more to develop.\nPost-Kickstarter Timeline\nThis Kickstarter will fund the development of three more elements (Fire, Air, and Water) and the polishing of the final game over the course of 1 year. We want CodeSpells to be an experience with AAA game quality.\nDecember 2014: The Alpha of CodeSpells will be released to our \"$80 & up\" backers on Christmas Day of 2014.\nJune 2015: The Beta of CodeSpells will be released to our \"$30 & up\" backers. We look forward to using the feedback from our Alpha & Beta Kickstarter backers while we improve the gameplay. \nSeptember 2015: All Kickstarter backers will receive a copy of the Creative Mode of CodeSpells.\nIf we get funded beyond:\nEarly 2016: We'll polish and release the multiplayer game creation tools so you can create your own new multiplayer games within CodeSpells.\nSummer 2016: First release of Life as an element in the game. There will be creatures, plants, and NPCs to interact with in the world.\nHolidays 2016: We'll give you the tools for a new Artificial Intelligence system for the NPCs that populate the world along with a dialog system so you can create new story based adventures within CodeSpells.\nEarly 2017: Create your own new species and custom characters with new tools and an in-game character creator.\nWe want CodeSpells to be a game with AAA quality but that requires time and money. We need to purchase licenses and be able to pay developers. Each new feature in CodeSpells needs to work not only as a clearly defined system, but also one that's fun to play with. Making a world where you have infinite freedom to bend the rules requires attention to details that you could usually cheat or mask in the development of other games.\nWe also need to be able to pay people for new sounds, music, animations, and all of the things you'd expect from a fully realized game!\nAfter we release CodeSpells to Kickstarter backers in September 2015, we plan to sell copies of this version of CodeSpells. This revenue will be used to make further enhancements to the game. (See our stretch goals below.) We want to keep adding these new features to the game to enable you even more creativity. We would like for CodeSpells to continue to evolve and grow as we get more feedback and people playing it.\nAdditional Backer Rewards:\nStephen & Sarah, researchers at UC San Diego, knew they wanted to create a video game that taught young students how to code. They knew that coding should be completely immersed in the gameplay, but how? They decided to use a metaphor for coding in the game: magic. They decided students will play the role of a wizard, and they will craft magical spells in Java code.\nWhile developing this first iteration of CodeSpells for their research at UC San Diego, Sarah & Stephen published several academic papers about the educational aspects of CodeSpells:\n\"From competition to metacognition: designing diverse, sustainable educational games.\"\n\"On the nature of fires and how to spark them when you're not there.\" \n\"CodeSpells: embodying the metaphor of wizardry for programming.\"\n\"Codespells: how to design quests to teach java concepts.\"\nWord soon got out about this game that attempted to teach young students how to program. CodeSpells was featured in Wired, RockPaperShotgun, and UC San Diego news, after which it was picked up by bloggers across the internet. KPBS even filmed some local San Diego students trying out the game. \nAmidst all this, Sarah & Stephen teamed up with Lindsey to co-found a company (ThoughtSTEM) to educate local San Diego kids in coding through after-school programs, summer camps, and more. ThoughtSTEM soon expanded across San Diego into other cities in California and is now branching out into other states.\nThe ThoughtSTEM team always had bigger dreams for CodeSpells though. For this game to educate the most people possible, they knew CodeSpells needed a makeover. Everything from the look & feel, gameplay, and even the coding interface left something to be desired. They had a great concept, but they needed expert Game Designers & Coders to make the dream a reality.\nThat's where Adrian & Jason came in. Having worked in the game development industry for several years, they brought new vision & inspiration to the CodeSpells project. We're excited to turn this vision into a reality with your help!\n                                                                                                                      ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe risks inherent in a video game development project are self evident, but ThoughtSTEM has a history of following through on successful projects (including LearnToMod, a software that teaches kids to code in Minecraft), and we plan to do the same with CodeSpells. With Backer funding, we have an excellent team with the skills necessary to create a fun & exciting video game. In addition, ThoughtSTEM has been previously funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and we plan to apply for NSF grant funding again to further improve CodeSpells as a coding educational product. Therefore, CodeSpells development will not suddenly stop when development for the Kickstarter is completed.

But if you invite your friends, you won't just be bashing enemies, you'll be creating legends together. \nBuild your mythology: Your actions show if you are more of a Trickster or a Saviour or something else entirely. At the end of your journey worthy heroes become a constellation in the night sky, your deeds recounted for the ages. \nDifferent worlds, persistent myths: Seeing one aspect of the mystery in its entirety only takes a couple of hours, but to truly understand what's happened, you'll need to play a few times. Meanwhile, each time you play, the constellation of your character's legend carries over, as part of your tribe's developing pantheon.\nYou could describe the game as \u201cLegend of Zelda meets Castle Crashers\u201d, or maybe \u201cKing of Dragon Pass meets Gauntlet\u201d. We empower players to experiment with their personality through the reputation and tribe-management, while combat challenges punctuate the journey as chances to prove their skill.\nWe already have permission to create the game on Steam for PC and Mac, due to our previous success with Shattered Planet. A DRM-free version will be available on the Humble Store. We're hoping to release Moon Hunters in Summer 2015. If you want to be notified of Moon Hunters updates and development progress, sign up here!\nIf you're a little confused, you can also try out Dungeons of Fayte, by Brent Ellison and our designer Tanya Short, available for free download. It has the co-op action RPG and town-management components. We're taking the Dungeons of Fayte design as a base, adding mythology/reputation and a randomised world as icing on top, like a delicious RPG cake!\n More stretch goals will be revealed as the campaign progresses!\nEach \"journey\" takes only a couple of hours, allowing you to explore one small aspect of the story. Upon completing each journey, if you're worth remembering, your hero will be remembered as a constellation in the night sky, symbolising their contribution to the world's history.\nAlong your journey, your decisions show your personality and create your reputation. Donating blood to a dying stranger shows you are Selfless. Flirting shamelessly with everyone demonstrates you are Flirtatious. And so on -- we will support over 50 different personality traits in the final game, each of which has its own effect on the world around you.\nIn the real world, as in Moon Hunters, legends are rarely about merely defeating villains. More often, folktales are the story of the Clever hero that tricked the gods into giving humans fire. Of the Loyal hero that ventured into the underworld to save a loved one's soul. Of the Brave hero that declined a god's advances, and suffered for impertinence.  \nYour choices determine how you are remembered, and what you embody to those who hear your story in ages hence. The reason why you do something can be as important as the act itself.   \nIn the world of Moon Hunters, the holy Moon is the source of all life and good, worshipped by every tribe as the central goddess of the pantheon. When the Moon does not rise one evening, heroes across the land take up the search, hoping to uncover the truth before the evil Sun's power grows too strong.\nThe world of Moon Hunters is randomly generated every time you play, but there are certain key elements of the setting and lore that are constant.\nFor example, while the individual members and conflicts of the Dustfolk village will be different depending on your generated world, the Dustfolk will always be the tribe of the sands. Learning their general beliefs and customs will give you an advantage in negotiations.\nThere are three major biomes (desert, mountains, and forests), and one minor (cave systems), each with their own local tribes:\nThe Dustfolk tribe keeps turkeys and camels when prosperous. The deserts are unforgiving, but the Seeker's Blood magic mastery helps the tribe find life-giving water.\nThe High Tribes live in wind-blown canyon country, looking down on the rest of creation from their high vantage point. The mountains are desolate but rich in minerals.\nThe Wolf Clan is the most secretive of all tribes, closely guarding their knowledge of Wild magic, so as not to lose the trust of the creatures they ally with.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Celestin are nomadic traders, following the rivers from source to mouth and back again in annual patterns. They are said to have over a thousand rituals to govern their decision-making, but most are invisible to outsiders.\nStretch goal unlocked! The Reefwalkers follow the Moon's tides and bring a wide variety of ingredients and goods to trade from their distant island homes.\nCalled the First People by some, the Silkhood are the only non-humans in the world of Moon Hunters. Although they welcome visitors, their customs and hierarchies are nearly incomprehensible at first.\n All player character classes wield all of the elements, but start with an affinity. You can customise your character's name and colour palette from the start. As you play you'll discover new special attacks to choose between.\nThe Witch trains under the Dustfolk Seeker in the ways of Blood magic. Blood is the element of life and death. When the world was created, the blood of the Goddess flowed to form the rivers and oceans.\nThe Witch has a basic melee attack and a high-damage ranged attack, making her useful in just about any situation.\nThe Spellblade learns the art of Bronze magic from a High Tribes expert smith. Bronze magic allows the shaping of metals, following the rhythm and grace of war as technologies develop. When the world was created, the bones of the Goddess broke to form the mountains and metals.\nIn combat, the Spellblade is a fierce melee fighter and has the highest endurance.\nThe Occultist's connection to Shadow magic allows her to bend the fabric of space and time to suit her whim. Somewhere between math and poetry lies the truth of the human condition. When the world was created, the Goddess's hair draped over the world, darkening the night sky.\nThe Occultist is a long-range, quick fighter with the most control over enemy positioning and movement.\nThe Druid is the prodigal child of the Wolf Clan, who closely guard all secrets of Wild magic. Wild magic is the primal knowledge from before fairness and language, back to the laws of instinct. When the world was created, the Goddess told stories and from her words, all of its wild creatures sprang forth.\nDruids are the most flexible fighters, sometimes even shape-shifting to meet the unique demands of each encounter.\nStretch goal unlocked! As an initiated priestess of the Moon, the Songweaver understands each of the elements, bringing together Wild harmonies, Blood rhythms, Dark dissonance, and Bronze strength. When the world was created, we invented music to remember and mourn.\nThe Songweaver is a complex support class. It is not technically impossible to play as her alone, but without a friend, you're in for a challenge.\nAs for non-player-characters, Teller Roa is the most widely-respected priestess of the Moon. It is she who decides whether your journey's tale is worth keeping for future generations, and what role you play in the legends of our time. Moon worship is a largely oral tradition, depending on the telling of stories to keep its ancient knowledge alive.\nMeanwhile, self-appointed \"King\" Mardokh believes he has seen a greater Truth than the Moon has to offer, and his fine writings have caused chaos in nearby territories. \nThe music is nearly as important to us as the art style, and luckily, we have some unique talent lined up. The soundtrack will be an all-original collaboration by Ryan Roth and Halina Heron, combining orchestral compositions with delicate vocals and a wide variety of percussion.\nThe trailer offers a sneak preview of the main theme song, \"G U I L T Y M O O N\": \n If the embedded track above doesn't work, or you want a more permanent bookmark for continuous repetition, here's a Soundcloud link!\nIn our latest update, we also included two more track previews. Listen to \"Blue\":\nAnd \"Solar Flare\":\nThe lovely voice you hear is actually important to the story and setting of the game, but we don't dare spoil anything...\nIf there's one thing that creators fight, it's obscurity.  \nMoon Hunters was one of the very first games on the Square Enix Collective. Both we and Square Enix were happy that it went on to earn over 1,000 Yes votes, with an 83% approval rating.\nFurther, following a thorough Team Assessment conducted by Square Enix, they concluded: \"Kitfox Games is a small and vibrant team with passion and drive, matched by a high level of ambition. They seem to be hard-working, diligent and professional and Moon Hunters looks engaging, unique and accessible. Square Enix Collective is very happy to support the team\u2019s crowdfunding campaign, and we believe that Kitfox have the skills and capabilities to make the game they\u2019re describing in this pitch.\u201d You can download and read the full Team Assessment at your leisure.\nWe're not getting money from Square Enix. Square Enix is just helping us find our players -- you! We're just four devs trying to scrape by and make a game. Without a big marketing budget, we need all the help we can get! \nYou can read a deeper discussion of why we think partnering with the S.E. Collective is worthwhile at CinemaBlend. Essentially, we want to make a game, and we want to make sure that the people who would love it get a chance to hear that it exists.\nIf you are into RPGs and/or mythology and/or old-fashioned co-op fun, Moon Hunters is the game for you. \nWe are four upstarts that, despite our modest successes in the game industry, don't have savings to fall back on in times of need. To put it bluntly, we're poor, and Moon Hunters is our dream game to make. We can't do it alone. \nPhoto credit: Belziir Photography\n We need your help to make Moon Hunters the best game it can be. We'll use your money to develop the game's programming, art, music, and design for longer and with more help than we could normally dream of affording. Besides, if nobody likes it and we don't get funded, we might be heartbroken, but at least it saves us from spending a year eating cans of beans making a game that people don't want! Win/win! \nThis is also a great opportunity to get feedback and input from players that would normally be impossible. We look forward to working with enthusiastic fans to make the game of our dreams together. \nWe try not to let the Canadian winter keep us down...\nSo, if Moon Hunters seems like the kind of game you might want to play, please consider chipping in and spreading the word! \nWe're still in the prototyping phase of production, so there's a lot of game left to make. But we're covering most of it! We decided to take the sales money from Shattered Planet and our company savings to help cover licenses, software, traveling to conferences, and most of the core team salaries, if this Kickstarter succeeds. \nThe money will be spent as follows:  \nFirst, 5% goes to Kickstarter, 3% goes to Visa/Mastercard/Amazon, and 19% goes to Quebec/Canadian taxes.\nThen, 5% goes to Square Enix. \nWe estimate it will take between $5000 and $7000 to handle production and shipping of all of the backer rewards (depending on which tiers are more popular), or about 12%\nThat leaves us the remaining $22,000 or so to spend on audio, more art, a content designer, and additional programmer time.\nThe core team members of Kitfox are the same core team from developing Shattered Planet, which was developed from idea to release on four platforms in 13 months (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android). It received praise from The New Yorker, CNET, and others, and remains highly praised on Steam. It was also chosen to be at the Indie Megabooth at PAX Prime 2014!\n And who are we? We're Kitfox Games!\nThe limited edition T-shirt design is on charcoal grey cotton and features a Spellblade design.\nClick to view a higher-res version!\n We're offering 4 different 12x18\" poster designs, signed by the core team for a limited run, unique to this Kickstarter.\nClick to view a high-res version!\nIf you purchase a fabric print, you can choose from one of five different 10x13\" designs (one for each character class and a cloth map representing one possible world configuration), printed directly onto Belgian linen. They are safe to wash, though we don't recommend using them as a BBQ bib, okay?\nThe Digital Art Book will include the concept art of Moon Hunters. You will get a hand-picked collection of beautiful watercolour artworks in a neatly designed PDF file. It includes some exclusive early concepts that we haven't shown to anyone!\nHere's a visual guide to all the tiers and rewards in their pixel glory:\nIf you can't find the perfect tier, why not build your own?\nDuring checkout, add the following amounts manually to your total pledge. If you've already backed us, go to \"Manage Pledge\" and add the appropriate amount (or more) to your total. Keep your original pledge tier the same. After the Kickstarter is over, we will contact you and you can specify your desired add-ons.\nAdditional digital copy of the game: add $13\nCopy of the original OST by Ryan Roth and Halina Heron: add $8\nLimited edition \"Moonblade\" T-shirt: add $45 (shipping included)\nPoster print, design of your choice: add $30 (shipping included)\nThe Digital Art Book of Moon Hunters: add $14\nDigital copy of Shattered Planet: add $10\nBlack Cat familiar: add $5\nIf there's something you're desperate to ask or tell us, please do let us know!

Married couple crazy in love. Made in the 80s. Kansas based roamers. \nHow do you make this music?\nLSDJ software on an original Nintendo Game Boy, Korg R-3 synthesizers (and occasional other instruments).  The album was recorded and mixed by Matt using Ableton Live and will be professionally mastered. \nWhat's your favorite video game?\nMatt: Halo or Goldeneye 007 (N64)\nCarolyn: Does Tetris count?\nWhat inspired you to start playing music this way?\nWhile he was playing guitar in a pop-punk band, Matt started making electronic music as a joke and it grew on him.

You know I play keys, right?\" So, here we are. \nHow/when did you guys meet?\nKindergarten/first grade. Field trips. It's a pretty long story and we'll tell you next time you want to meet for coffee. \nWhat do the rewards look like?\nSo glad you asked. \nPhysical CD:  Round disc, shiny on one side, art on the other.
