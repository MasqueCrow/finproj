When something goes horribly wrong and the magician gets himself into a bind he can\u2019t escape, you must step forward to claim the gifts that have been yours all along, before it's too late to help him \u2014 or anyone else.\n\nThe Shape Of Shadows is a connected path game about show magic and true magic, the tension of asserting yourself as an equal to someone taking you under their wing; and the price you are willing to pay to fly on your own.\nThe Shape of Shadows can be adapted for players who prefer to write with brevity, using a bullet journal style of notation.\nThe Shape of Shadows is about a magician's assistant who, for their own reasons, dedicates their career to pursuing stage and close up magic through the mentorship of the magician. Through the eyes of the character they create, players will learn how the magician's assistant started the path they're on, how they chose to work with the magician, and why the risks and danger of learning true magic were not enough to deter them from their studies. Through intricately constructed journaling prompts, image- and word-based puzzles, and utilizing a mundane day planner to create strange alchemical rituals, players will explore the magic of the world they move through, in and out of this connected path game. The core game is played solo, but alongside everyone else who opens the door to the adventure and mystery at the heart of The Shape of Shadows. No two players' stories will be the same, but every player will walk their connected paths together through their play experiences.\n\nA sampling of letters from former assistants for the players to discover in-game.\nConnected path and keepsake games are two terms coined by Shing Yin Khor and myself during our collaboration on our previous game, Field Guide To Memory. In a connected path game, players experience unique, solitaire games while simultaneously sharing in a community of others engaging in the same creative spirit alongside them. \n\nThe joy of playing a connected path the joy of show and tell: our intuitive desire to show each other what is precious to us, why we treasure it, and why we'd like to feel compelled to share it with the communities that are precious to us in turn. \nPlaytester feedback on The Shape of Shadows was almost unanimous in its enthusiasm.\nBoth the narrative and core game experience in The Shape of Shadows center on a day planner. As the magician's assistant, much of your time in character will be spent interacting with the magician's planner, scouring it for keys to the doors he\u2019s always kept closed to you, in order to learn what you need to restore him. \nAn example of how some players answered game prompts in their planner by using color-coded index cards.\nAs the player, you will choose one month in a weekly planner to keep track of your character's increasingly strange appointments, while the rest of the planner undergoes a metamorphosis in your hands. Every day of play offers something new. Some days are contemplative, focusing on memory and observation in the form of journaling; others are adventurous and may lead you outside to find a token you need for a ritual circle; and still others involve trying your hand at more tangible crafts. \n\nWhether you're learning the nuances of different forms of sigil magic and how to work them into the trick locks you use during your close up magic shows; reviewing the finer points of talisman crafting to shield you from hecklers at the comedy club; charming your playing cards so they never tumble from your hands during a waterfall shuffle; or developing alchemical formulas for transmutation (that you can actually make in real life at home during the game!), it all goes in your planner to turn it page by page into a true magician's spellbook.\nAs far as you can tell, the magician devoted the entirety of his life to seeing how far he could push his skills in the practical application of true magic, and honing the craft of his show magic. Alchemy, cardistry, divination, illusionism, close-up, conjuring \u2014 nothing is off the table for him. \nVarious letters from former magician's assistants over the years.\nOver the course of his life the magician accumulated a veritable dragon's hoard of research materials, ritual components, flotsam and jetsam both figurative and literal (an avid beachcomber, the magician uses his findings often), and piles and piles of correspondence (some of it quite personal).\nAlmost every day during the game, you will receive 1-2(or more!) photographs and documentation of these objects as part of your gameplay prompts.\nTwo reward levels (the ILLUSIONIST and the CONJURER) include physical packages of these curiosities, mailed to you as part of the game's closing narrative.\n\n\nLOCK, $15 (UNLIMITED) \nAt the $15 KEY level, you will get added to the player list for The Shape of Shadow's live run in late summer. For the duration of the game's run you'll receive an email with story and activity prompts Monday through Thursday. The game lasts for four consecutive weeks.\n\nKEY, $25 (UNLIMITED)\nAt the $25 LOCK level, you'll get everything associated with the live game, and a high resolution PDF of the full game text, sent to you after the live run wraps up. After her superlative layout work on Field Guide To Memory, Ruby Lavin will return to design The Shape of Shadows' PDF as well.\n\nSLEIGHT, $40 (UNLIMITED)\nAt this level backers will get entry into the live game and the full game PDF for two recipients. \n\nILLUSIONIST, $60 (UNLIMITED)\nPLAY\n\nAll digital versions of the game, including the emailed live game experience in late summer, the full PDF, and large envelope of strange and beautiful paper ephemera, as described in the \"Artifacts, Art, and Ephemera\" section. Includes ephemera from the game narrative that your character or others may encounter during play, a sheet of custom-illustrated sigil stickers, and a sheet of holographic stamps showing a white rabbit popping in and out of a magician's hat. I am mountaineering up an exciting new learning curve and making this reward level unlimited.\n\nCONJURER, $350 (LIMITED TO 60 BOXES)\nAn example of what a recipient of the Conjurer's box might receive.\nIn addition to everything at the ILLUSIONIST reward level, you will receive a literal one-of-a-kind collection of beautiful flotsam and jetsam just like the talismans and treasured detritus in the magician's office. Each box is numbered, since no two boxes are exactly the same, and all of them will have at least 1-2 pieces of my original art, in different mediums.\n\nWhen I conceptualized this reward level, the thought that came to mind was \"if a cabinet of curiosities could be ordered through delivery.\" The high level of care, craftsmanship, and artistic expression I want to put into each of these boxes is the kind of experiential feast I adore creating and sharing with people; and, in order to keep it sustainable, there is a strict limit of 60 of these boxes. \n\nEach collection box will be made, packed, lovingly fussed over, and shipped out a few at a time in order to avoid bottlenecking my home studio and office. If you back at this level, please note that another backer may receive their box long before you, depending on how many people end up supporting this level.\n\nCreative Contributors\nAmal El-Mohtar is an award-winning writer of fiction, poetry, and criticism.

Both this and the previous stretch goal will be made available to backers at all game levels.

The campaign's second stretch goal is to hire a cover artist to create a memorable, beautiful piece of art to capture the spirit of the game.\nIsip Xin's conceptual sketch of their cover for the game\nMET! The third stretch goal is to award a 50% raise to every contributor I asked on board for our first goal. This stretch goal is about getting money to people I love and admire, and about building a fair and sustainable model for indie game compensation.\n\nMET! The fourth stretch goal is $50K, at which point I'll be able to make the Compendium: an appendix of supplementary mini games and multi-player ttrpgs that take place in the same world.\n\nMET! The fifth stretch goal is $54K, which is where I'll be able to afford creating two sets of sigils for all backers: one set of full color, high resolution digital downloads for players who are joining the live game or buying the PDF text, and high quality sticker sheets for players who are backing the physical ephemera reward levels.\n\nMET! At $60K, I'll be able to triple the base pay for all of the creative contributors on the game! \n\nMET! At $66K I'll be able to pay a bonus to literally everyone contributing to the game!\n\nStretch Goal no. 8: $72K Mid-week Intermission Game, live on Twitter!\nAt $66K, I'll make time to write a play-by-poll game on Twitter that dovetails with the core game experience, and is also run in real time. Each intermission game will consist of three parts, and be open to the general public!\n Jeeyon Shim is a second generation Korean American game designer, multimedia artist, and outdoor educator based in California.

This game builds further on the scaffold of everything I\u2019ve learned from those experiences.\n\nThe game is fully structured and written, albeit in an unedited late-stage draft. The Kickstarter funds will cover the cost of copy editing by Ryan Boyd, and layout design by Ruby Lavin (whose previous layout credits include Field Guide To Memory and Wanderhome), as well as giving me the time I need to attend to the creative and administrative tasks associated with the multifaceted nature of connected path games like this one. Short of Mailchimp\u2019s server going down or a street magician accidentally turning me into a rabbit, I anticipate fulfillment of the text and live game to stay on schedule.\n\nI do not currently have a fulfillment partner for the Illusionist reward level (the flat art and ephemera), but I'm in touch with two or three companies and will contract the most suitable once I know what quantity of printed goods I'll need to ship. While the USPS is generally reliable for domestic US mail, with any physical reward there is always the risk of packages getting delayed or lost in thin air. \n\nAdditionally, the future of international mail sent out of the US is currently hard to read in the cards. I fully intend to work with my future fulfillment partner to send out every single package that is backed and accounted for, but be aware that it could take a very long time for your rewards to reach you. (Due to various plant pressings and organic materials in the Conjurer's boxes, I cannot ship that reward level internationally and it will be limited to US backers.)\n\nMy aim is to fulfill this Kickstarter from late July to August, well before the stated delivery dates. Still, I left myself enough buffer to weather most unexpected changes. Overall, I anticipate a strong, efficient, and invigorating Kickstarter campaign, and I am already looking forward to it!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nLong-lasting design\nI design my games and the skills that I teach through them to be meaningful to the player, and made in a way that will last a long time. When players connect deeply with what they create, they are more likely to keep and treasure their work \u2014 thus being far less likely to end up throwing their creations out as waste materials.\nReusability and recyclability\nPlayers will repurpose various pieces of ephemera from their own lives, thereby saving them from turning into waste! \n\nMany of my materials for the Conjurer's Boxes are sourced from local secondhand shops or my own stores of various odds and ends.\n\nAdditionally, many players have collections of journals that they can source from, further reducing the environmental toll of new manufacturing.\nSustainable materials\nPlayers will be sourcing their own journals for play, making impact individual and less impactful.\nEnvironmentally friendly factories\nAll my vendors are based in the United States, and all the vendors I plan to hire for the Illusionist's printing needs are specifically local to my city.\nSustainable Distribution\nAll packaging and shipping materials I will personally use to pack the Conjurer's boxes are made from 100% recycled matter.

Featuring diverse alien societies, advanced technology, epic space battles, and a future worth fighting for.\nTangent Space is set within a nascent utopia where the various alien nations of the galaxy try to come together despite their differences. The year 3025 is a great time to live! The core worlds are peaceful and nobody is poor or homeless. The frontier is dangerous and unknown, begging for exploration and adventure. Grand and powerful factions compete for influence on the ever shifting galactic stage. Mysterious precursors have left treasures and warnings for those they deem worthy successors. The universe of Tangent Space is as limitless as our own galaxy!\nTangent Space was designed to be easy to pick up and play, but also provide increasing complexity as you delve deeper into the possibilities. The rules were crafted with science fiction TV shows and movies in mind. Everything takes places within a scene, which is as long a time period as makes dramatic sense. It could be a single combat encounter, or several days traveling through space. The game moves at the speed of plot.\nTangent Space is played using a custom dice-scaling system. Dice get bigger when things are easier, and dice get smaller when things are difficult. Your chances of success shift as circumstances change from one turn to the next. Moments play out as exchanges of actions and reactions rolling against one another. Teamwork is actively encouraged within the mechanics as allies set each other up for success.\nTen playable species are available. Each comes with four different cultural backgrounds that describe their civilization and offer unique advantages. Species and culture are separate, offering a wide variety of interesting combinations to choose from when making your character.\nThere are no classes and no character levels. Instead, it's the 40 skills that gain levels as characters progress in the four skill categories: Martial, Technical, Social, and Psionic. Archetypes are provided as suggestions to help new players get started.\nEquipment is modular, with a flexible crafting and invention system that lets you customize your kit even further. This modular design extends to vehicles and spacecraft,  which use a modified version of the character rules.\nDownload the demo version from itch.io here:\nTangent Space RPG - Demo Version\nTangent Space has been a passion project of mine for my entire adult life. It's grown and developed in ways that actually surprised me, but it's in a place now where I truly believe it's \"Good.\" The mechanics are complete and, aside from balancing tweaks from testing, won't be changing much going forward. What I don't have is all the professional trappings to make the game come to life: Art, editing, and publishing. All these things are very expensive and make the difference between a game that stands out and one that gets swept aside. I'm hoping that through this Kickstarter, you'll be able to hold a finished copy of Tangent Space in your hands and have memorable adventures in this universe.\nThe game book will be completed in two versions: digital and print.\nThe digital version will be an interactive PDF with bookmarks and hyperlinks for quick navigation. A horizontal layout is planned for easier viewing and it will also be formatted to play nice with screen readers.\nThe print version will be available through DriveThruRPG print-on-demand services, formatted to standard 8.5 x 11 page size. Backers will receive a voucher for \"at cost\" printing. This means they will need to pay the printing and shipping costs separately from their pledge. Reward level pricing for the physical tier has been reduced accordingly.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThe overall quality of the finished product will depend on how well funded it is. The funding goal is the estimated bare minimum to commission enough art to fill the 400+ pages of the finished book. A picture speaks a thousand words and layout can only do so much to glam up a wall of text. The better this campaign does, the more I can afford to put into the project, such as more detailed artwork for vehicles and alien lifeforms.\n\nThe physical books will be fulfilled using DriveThruRPG print-on-demand services. If this campaign does well enough to attract an actual publisher, I'll consider working with them instead.

We stood against the tide of darkness and prevailed, again and again. \nBut our family fell apart. Our shared past is full of shame,  trespasses, and secrets. We parted ways, vowing to never see each other again.\nAnd now, our greatest enemy has returned. Manipulating from the shadows, they grow stronger than ever.  No one else believes the threat is real. Only the Captain has a chance at defeating this enemy, once and for all. But the Captain can't do it alone.\nIt's time for the crew to come together again, just like old times. But will they go into the void once more? Can the crew trust the Captain again, who left disappointment and heartbreak in their wake?\nThe Last Time We Touched\n\nOur Inspirations\nOnce More Into the Void is inspired by the television show Star Trek:  Picard, and the video game Mass Effect 2.  One of the players is a  Captain who must make amends, face the consequences of the past, try to regain the loyalty of their crew, and together take on impossible odds. The rest of the players make up the crew who must learn to believe in the  Captain and in each other again or risk losing it all.  Reminisce about the past, fall in love, get in messy entanglements, and see if you can survive the final mission!\n\n\nOur Game\nOnce More Into the Void is based on the brilliant structure of MOBILE FRAME ZERO: FIREBRANDS by Meguey and Vincent Baker.  This means you don't need to prepare a plot in advance or have a Game  Moderator (GM). Instead, it is made up of mini-games, each one guiding a single dramatic scene or a small group of them. The mini-games are easy to pick up and play, players make interesting choices for their characters and follow evocative prompts while answering laser-sharp questions. Everyone collaborates to tell an emotional and heroic story together. Everything culminates in one final mission,  that may end in tragedy or triumph!\nThe game is best played across two sessions, but this new edition will feature options to play for one session, or up to four sessions! To play you only need tokens to represent the loyalty of each crew member, and a deck of playing cards that help set the scene or introduce an element of risk.\nPlayers choose from six simple playbooks to create a crew. Each playbook gives you a compelling base to start telling your story with...\n The Captain, a leader who must grapple with the burden of redemption\n The Veteran, an old timer who must prove they still have what it takes\n The Reformed, a traitor on the run from those who serve the void\n The Believer, an innocent who has always dreamed of being a hero\n The Broken, a cynic who is consumed by vengeance and pain\n The Strange, an outsider who is pure marvel, wonder, and beauty\n\nMockup of the Broken\nChoose from 9 mini-games to play, starting with the Recruitment Montage and ending with the final mission, Once More Into The Void. \nEach mini-game helps you roleplay your characters, reveal their complex emotions and desires, and drives them towards points of tension and revelation. The game is built on themes of regret, redemption, despair,  hope, loyalty, the complexity of relationships, and what it means to be a  hero. Once More Into The Void is a game that creates compelling and emotionally intense stories, that builds up to a heart-stopping climax.\n \n            The mini-games are:\n Recruitment Montage - getting the crew together\n Just Like Old Times - a battle to prove ourselves\n Only One Shot To Make It Right - a training montage\n Blowing Off Steam - a night out with the crew\n Who Do You Think You Are - a confrontation\n The Last Time We Touched - possible intimacy\n I Never Did Trust You - possible betrayal\n Only If We Have the Time, Captain - loyalty mission\n Once More Into The Void - the final mission\nMinigame - Who Do You Think You Are?\n\n\n\nOur Testimonials\nJay Dragon of Possum Creek Games, creator of Wanderhome:\n\"Nedjadi has done it again: balancing iconic characters,  high-stake scenarios, and tension so thick you could cut it with a knife with a poise and elegance that makes the whole game sing in harmony.\nOnce  More Into The Void doesn't just create characters \u2014 you will have a  found family of misfits and heroes, and by the end you'll have fallen in  love with every single one of those perfect daring foolhardy bastards.\"  \n  Logan Dwight (they/them), Co-Founder and CEO of Role (playrole.com)\n\"Once More Into the Void was my first introduction to Jammi\u2019s work, and soon also became my go-to game for introducing new players to the art of role-playing!   The structure, writing, and ease of play are second to none. For veteran and fresh players alike, everyone has an equal hand in crafting a  thrilling, intimate, heartfelt story.  I still reference this game in work and conversation every week, and it serves are a consistent source of joy and inspiration.\u201d\n\nApril Kit Walsh (she/her or gay/ghem), Creator of Thirsty Sword Lesbians\n\"Once More Into the Void aims for the heart in all the best ways. The prompts are laser-focused on moments that will shape the characters' relationships, and the elegant mechanics add to the tension, excitement, and unpredictability of telling a story with friends. Just reading Once More will make you a better RPG player and  designer.\"\n\nSherri Stewart (she/her), co-host of the Gauntlet Podcast\n\"Once More Into the Void is a familiar story that has never been told before: it's your last chance, your unstoppable foe, your fractured found family, your singular leader. Your disillusionment and your hopes will drive every scene.  With thoughtful questions, the world is created and the players leap straight into the drama. It is always  delightfully and indelibly your story.\"\nOur Rewards\n We want to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to play this game and save the galaxy.

You aren\u2019t very good at it. In fact, you\u2019re pretty terrible. How you\u2019ve survived this long is a  mystery; how the town hasn\u2019t run you out yet is a miracle. You and your  fellow shitty adventurers know you only have each other, so you try your  best to work together, survive, get paid, and make sure tales of your deeds are greatly exaggerated\n\nAfter the War, by Genesis of Legend Publishing ($15 PDF or $50 Print + PDF)\nAll of you came to Polvo looking for a new beginning. You came from somewhere else; the decadence of old Terra, the discipline of Mars, the freedom of the Belt, or an Alien world.  You survived the terrible galactic war which marked your body and soul. A war against an infectious idea, a memetic virus known as The Song.\nYou came to Polvo looking for a refuge, a hope, and an opportunity. You thought you were joining a community of strangers and built a home.  Terrible things lurk in the wreckage of the war and the shadows of your minds. It\u2019s up to you to keep your people safe After the War.\n\n\n\n\nOur Crew\nJamila (Jammi) is the creative force behind Sword Queen Games and they believe in the power and magic of creative play.

This book will contain a total of 9 illustrated mini-games. This our minimal goal to pay for all development costs and basic manufacturing.\n\n Our base goal for this project is the realistic minimum amount to pay for the development expenses for the project. Jammi has worked hard to produce this beautiful game, and we have hired some absolutely stellar artists to present the setting.  Producing the game will also result in some hefty printing and shipping fees.\nIf we reach our base goal, we will compensate Jamilla for the Design ($825), Writing ($1,650), Art  Direction ($165), Layout ($990), and playtesting ($330) for a total of $3,960. \nWe will compensate Avery for her design consultation on the project to make it the best version of itself for $210. \nWe will compensate our in-house editor, Christopher, for his editing work on the project for $825. \nReimbursement for Genesis of Legend\u2019s investment in the fantastic cover by Adrien(ne)  Valdes and two interior illustrations by Camille Chua for $1500. \nCommissioning seven additional interior illustrations by Camille Chua for $1500. \nWe will provide Jason Pitre with a nominal consideration for project management and administration on the project ($1). The standard rates for such labour are higher, but Jason has chosen to waive the additional minimum compensation for this.\nWe will allocate the remaining $6,400 for a minimal print run, and shipping by the most economical methods possible.\n\n Stretch Goal 1 - Extended Edition ($20K CAD)\nThis stretch goal will increase the number of print copies to 500 copies. It will also add three additional illustrated mini-games, bringing the total up to 12 and paying additional development costs.\nCommissioning three additional interior illustrations by Camille Chua for $650 \nAllocating $2950 towards additional printing and shipping costs.\nThe new minigames are titled:\n  Before We Lose It All - An attack on your home\n What We Once Were - A flashback\n What We Built Without You - A look at the years since\n\n\n\n Stretch Goal 2 - Legendary Edition ($25K CAD)\nThis stretch goal will increase the number of print copies to 1000 copies. This stretch goal will include additional art for the book as well as improved production values. It will also add two additional illustrated playbooks and paying additional development costs. \nCommissioning additional interior illustrations by Camille Chua for $650 \nAllocating $3,350 towards additional printing and shipping costs.\nAllocating $500 to buy all crew members copies of Mass Effect, Legendary Edition. For research purposes. \nThe new playbooks are titled:\n The Bound - a member of an ancient order who broke their code.\n The Keeper \u2013 An outsider and a companion in the Captain\u2019s life since the tragedy.\n\nStretch Goal 3 - Collector's Edition ($30K CAD)\nThe COLLECTOR'S EDITION at 30k CAD will allow us to add some additional GM resources and setting information to the book which should increase the book-length by about another signature. This will include information on a variety of different potential types of Enemy that might threaten the galaxy, some sector maps, sketches of certain facilities, and some information on iconic equipment your characters might wield. This will include more development work from Jammi and a pile of additional art from Adrian(ne) Valdes.\n\n\n Additional Funding (Over $30K CAD)\nAll funding above $30k will be temporarily used as contingency funds in case of cost overruns on other components of the project. Any funds not spent on development, manufacturing or fulfillment will be rendered to  Sword Queen Games as profit to support their future game design efforts.\nAny revenue from sales of After the War as an add-on will be provided to Genesis of Legend Publishing.\n\n\nInterviews and Actual Play\nDo you want to learn more about Once More Into The Void?

", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nGenesis of Legend Publishing has successfully kickstarted and fulfilled six roleplaying game kickstarter projects, with the seventh product (Sig: City of Blades) currently in print production. We have extensive experience with managing kickstarter projects and how to mitigate some of the risks associated with them. \n\nThe main text for ONCE MORE INTO THE VOID is complete at this point, as well as some of the illustrations for the product. If personal emergencies prevent our artists from contributing, we have backup options. Both publishers are experienced in graphic design and layout, doing the work in-house at lower risk. \n\nAt our base goal, we may use Print on Demand services (Lightning Source) to produce the books. There can occasionally be quality control issues with their services, but we will replace and substandard books produced. If we secure enough funding, we will be able to afford a proper print run with a well-regarded, professional, and experienced printer, but we have several backup options.\n\nAnything that goes through the mail system can go astray, but we will replace any missing copies at no cost. We will do our best to mitigate these risks and will do our best to work within the existing shipping budget.\n\nRunning a kickstarter campaign during the COVID Pandemic of 2021 is likely to cause unforeseen disruptions or disasters which we will try to adapt to.

He doesn\u2019t have time for (or interest in) complex players\u2019 handbooks and he doesn\u2019t own any \u201cweird dice,\u201d but he\u2019s always one of the best players at my table because he\u2019s a natural storyteller. It\u2019s just a matter of getting the story started, adding some twists, and watching him be surprised by his own creativity.\nPossible Worlds is the culmination of that design ethos. Pulling from years of design & publishing experience, I\u2019ve written these games with first-time, long-time, and diverse players in mind. Each game in this collection is simple enough to be played with zero preparation but robust enough to run hundreds of times and never get the same story twice\u2014all small enough to fit in your back pocket. \n\nprinted proofs of each game as displayed on my front porch\nPossible Worlds is a micro-RPG subscription box with both digital & physical tiers. Digital Subscription backers will receive a new, ~25-page RPG in digital format at the start of each month. Boxed Set backers will similarly receive digital titles at the start of each month as well as a boxed set collecting all six games printed as pocket-sized, wire-bound guidebooks after the digital subscription\u2019s fulfillment.\nsubscription box WIP by Austin Breed, final full-color design is subject to change\n\nLike my first Kickstarter RPG\u2014Beak, Feather, & Bone\u2014the games in this collection are bite-sized experiences with simple, innovative mechanics that can be played in a single sitting or lifted and applied to larger campaign play. No proprietary dice required, and each game includes digital modifications to help facilitate distanced play. The following are 2021's Possible Worlds listed alphabetically, not necessarily in order of release:\nillustrated by Sam Mameli, cover design by Austin Breed\nDATING.SIM: A light-hearted romance RPG that emulates dating simulation video games and visual novels. In round one of play, one player hosts an in-character dating game and picks a winner. In round two, the winning character GMs a first date while the remaining players all share control of the first round's suitor.

(2+ players) Read a deep dive into the game's mechanics!\nillustrated by Eric Lide, cover design by Austin Breed\nSingle Unique Power (SUP): A cast-building, setting-creation RPG where players collaboratively create super-powered characters and factions. Dice dictate the passing of character sheets, while player-generated prompts dictate powers, priorities, and personalities. (2+ players) Read a deep dive into the game's mechanics!\nillustrated by Jimmy Knives, cover design by Austin Breed\nWishless: An RPG where, once upon a time, every living person was given three wishes. You've already used yours, but the rest of the world might still have theirs. In search of unused wishes, barter with the GM to determine which NPC's wishes you\u2019re aware of and which remain a mystery.

It will be sent to backers immediately following funds clearing at the conclusion of this campaign. Itch.io download keys will be delivered via email, but an itch.io account will not be required to redeem your downloads.\nThe remaining 5 games in the subscription are at varying stages of completion. The core mechanics for each title are there, but your funding will provide us with the operating costs needed to make the published product the best it can be\u2014paying for editing, additional illustrations, and additional time dedicated to the project as a whole.\nDigital games will release at the top of each month, but release order is not set in stone. Keep an eye on post-campaign Kickstarter updates for news on which game will be released next.\n Physical copies of the games will be mailed as a boxed set all at once, not piecemeal. This is to save you money by only having to pay for shipping once. Physical backers will also receive all monthly download codes, however, allowing them to read and play each game immediately upon release if they so choose.\nDue to recent fluctuations in shipping costs, we will be charging shipping AFTER the campaign\u2019s conclusion immediately before printing postage. Again, this is to ensure you\u2019re charged the exact, correct amount for shipping, not an inflated projection or inaccurate rate.\nBoxed Set shipping will be charged via BackerKit and is currently estimated to cost ~$10 US and ~$25 international.

Cover design not finalized.\nCoyote and Crow is a tabletop role playing game set in an alternate future of the Americas where colonization never occurred. Instead, advanced civilizations arose over hundreds of years after a massive climate disaster changed the history of the planet. You'll play as adventurers starting out in the city of Cahokia, a bustling, diverse metropolis along the Mississippi River. It's a world of science and spirituality where the future of technology and legends of the past will collide.\n\nThe game is created and led by a team of Native Americans representing more than a dozen tribes and we've built a game that both Natives and non-Natives will thrill to explore and build upon.\nMore than 700 years ago, a bright purple streak shot across the night sky. Over the coming weeks, the Earth fell into a deep winter, the seas raged and ash rained from the sky. The event became known as the Awis. As resources dwindled, winter became longer and summer shorter, people struggled to survive. Wars erupted, people starved, some fleeing their ancestral homes before creeping ice sheets. \nBut people survived. Tribes adapted. And in the wake, people began to notice a strange purple mark appearing on people, plants and animals alike. It became known as the Adahnehdi, the Gift, and many took it as a sign that the Great Spirit had not given up on them. \nEventually, the weather began to ease, the Earth began to heal, and new nations arose. New sciences and technologies, born out of necessity, led to a discovery about the Adahnehdi. It wasn't just a mark, it was a path to abilities and powers, beyond normal human limits. \nThe long walk home. Art by Jennifer Lange\nNow, 700 years after the world was brought to the brink, a new chapter has begun. Your characters enter a world that is healing but is no less dangerous. The ice sheets are retreating and the seas are calming, but what lay out beyond your borders? The treaties and alliances that made so much sense during the long winters are now eroding and old grudges between nations are not so easily forgotten. New technologies arise almost every day and the rate of change is frightening for some. And then there are the stories. Talk of spirits, monsters, beings of legend. For so many they were just tales to be told around the fire. But now there is talk that these legends may be far more literal than you may have previously believed. Has something awakened them?\nthe northern continent of Makasing.\nCoyote and Crow is an original role playing system built around the exclusive use of D12 dice. Outside of the core rule book, all you'll need to play the game is some pencil and paper and some twelve-sided dice. While there is some complexity to the game, we are striving to present a system that will allow players to refer to the rule book during play as little as possible, keeping most or all of the critical information on your character sheet.\nMock up of the front of a character sheet. Design not finalized.\nThe basic rule system is centered around collecting a Dice Pool, usually around 5-7 D12s and rolling them to determine either Success or Failure and degree of effect. For example \"8\" might be the number your Character needs to attempt to do something and every 8 or higher they rolled would be a Success. The more 8's, the more successful they are. \nWhile combat is a part of Coyote and Crow, the game is actually built around the idea of fighting being only one road to story resolution. The game encourages dialogue, building bridges and finding unique solutions to problems that are not always clearly defined by good and evil. \nYour Characters have Stats like Strength and Spirit and Skills like Investigation and Charm that are modified by their Stats. In addition, when you create your Character, you choose a Path. That Path determines both certain Stat bonuses you receive as well as which Abilities you have access to. Abilities are powers beyond normal human capability, but not at a level where characters would be comparable to superheroes. There are 15 Paths in the core rule book available. In addition, you'll choose an Archetype (Whisperer, Healer, Scout, among others) that will give you Stat and Skill bonuses and a general idea of your character's profession, but will not force your Character too deeply down a specific progression.\nThen you'll choose Gifts and Burdens. These allow you to give your Characters specific bonuses or drawbacks and will help you flesh them out in a way that is flavorful and realistic. It's important to note that the rulebook does not dictate whether something is a burden or a gift for a Player. For example, a Player might choose to give their Character a sister. That might be a Burden or a Gift (or both!) depending on how the Player wants their Character to see that relationship.\n\nSample pages from the equipment chapter. Layouts and content not finalized.\n\nThere are no experience points in Coyote and Crow. Instead, it is built on the Legends system. Your Character will have Short Term Goals, which will increase various numbers on your Character sheets or give them new Skills. But you and your group will also have Long Term Goals. When those are completed your legend will grow. You'll write a short story about your adventures, the kind that can be told around the fire for generations to come. These can change your Gifts and Burdens, give you access to new Abilities and more. As you complete more Long Term Goals, your Character's legend will precede them and your stories will spread.\n\nARCHETYPES\nThere are six Archetypes in the game, each acting as a starting point for Character development but not constricting their possibilities. Each Archetype has its own symbol. Here are a few of them.\nThe icons for Warrior, Tinkerer, and Scout (not finalized)\n\n\nPATHS\nIn addition to Archetypes, Players choose Paths for their Characters, which are permanent associations they make with an animal and help define what extra human Abilities they'll be able to choose from, among other effects. There are fifteen basic Paths in the core rulebook.\nThe Path of the Beaver, the Stag and the Spider\n(See our Update for more on this)\nWhile this game was created by a Native-led team, this game is for everyone. We've taken great care to craft a game that Natives and non-Natives alike will be able to engage in and find themselves immersed in. \nFor Natives, we've crafted both story and game mechanics that will allow you to integrate your own tribal customs into your play. For those who aren't Native, you'll have a wealth of options to choose from as well as clear guidelines for understanding the differences between this world and our real one. \nThe game is designed to be your first role playing game or your latest. The core rule book will walk players through every step of how to play Coyote and Crow, but also how to play role playing games in general, including advice on safety and inclusion as well as suggestions on where to find tools outside of the rule book to make your game both easier and more enjoyable.\nEveryone involved in Coyote and Crow is deeply passionate about our game and we felt that it was time for Indigenous folks to have a game that didn't see them as secondary, as adversaries, or intertwined with colonialism.\nCoyote and Crow is not set in a dystopia. The world went through a dark chapter, but the people of these nations rose to the challenge. There's good food and water, education and meaningful work for almost everyone in Makasing. \nBut this world isn't a utopia either. It's place that's growing, where old alliances are strained and past slights are not always forgotten. New technology is putting pressure on old traditions. And with the climate becoming milder, there is a whole world of unknowns out there. On top of all of that, there are rumors that some of the old stories about monsters and spirits might just be a little more real than some originally believed. This is a game where science and the unexplained live side by side and sometimes clash.\nThe Wanderer. Art by Kyle Charles.\n\nTHE CORE RULE BOOK\nWe are producing a beautiful 300+ page hardbound book, loaded with illustrations and containing all of the rules you'll need to play Coyote and Crow. Included in the book (and PDF) will be:\nDetailed history of this alternate world\nDescriptions of daily life and culture in Cahokia, the capital of the Free Lands\nRules for creating and advancing your characters, including 6 Archetypes, 15 Paths and 27 Abilities for a massive variety of options\nDescriptions and stats for mythical creatures, infamous spirits, shadowy organizations and dangerous cults that can challenge players endlessly\nA group of pre-generated characters if you want to jump right into playing the game\nA starter adventure, Encounter at Station 54, that can act as a stand alone adventure or as the start of a larger campaign\nSo much more!\nSHIPPING\nWe will be shipping only to the US and Canada during this Kickstarter. In addition, we will be subsidizing a portion of the shipping costs within the Kickstarter itself to help keep costs down. If you are not in the US or Canada, not to worry. We have already partnered with traditional hobby distribution and the game will be available through your local hobby partners shortly after Kickstarter fulfillment. \nYOUR PLEDGE\n Whisperer: $5  This pledge shows your support for the project and allows you to keep abreast of all the future news about Coyote and Crow. We'll also notify you when late pledges are available after the campaign.\n Tinkerer: $20 With this pledge you get everything the Whisperer gets, plus a full color PDF version of the physical game, including all of the art. This version will be released shortly after we have sent our files to the printer and you'll have access to it before the physical copies have been delivered.\n Warrior: $50 (plus shipping)All of the benefits of both the Whisperer and the Tinkerer plus you'll get one full color hard cover edition and access to all Stretch Goals. You can choose to keep your physical copy of the book or donate it to a reservation library. If you donate, we'll handle the shipping. \n Healer: $100 All of the benefits of Whisperer, Tinkerer, and Warrior, PLUS we'll ship a full hardcover copy of Coyote and Crow to a Native American reservation library in your honor. You pay for the shipping for your copy and we'll pay for the shipping to the reservation copy.\n Scout: $150 (plus shipping) For Friendly Local Games Stores Only. With this pledge you'll receive 6 copies of Coyote and Crow (1 case). You'll receive these at the same time as other Kickstarter backers, in advance of the general release.\n Seeker: $400 (plus shipping) (ALL GONE) For those that really want to support Coyote and Crow! All of the benefits of the Whisperer, Tinkerer, Warrior and Healer pledges, but your book will be signed and numbered by Connor Alexander. You'll also receive three high quality art prints of art used in the book (which ones, to be determined). This level is limited to 50 backers.\nIt still hungers. Art by Jeffrey Veregge\nWe have a diverse team of folks working on this game, most of whom are Native. Additionally, we are striving to bring in other marginalized voices whenever possible. Our team features people from across the LGBTQIA spectrum, including two spirit folks. It's not even a question that this game is political. If you have a problem with a game where there are no people of European descent represented, than this game is probably not for you. That said, we've truly built this game to be played by everyone. It might seem like a big leap, but don't worry, we're going to hold your hand the whole way through and you'll be so happy you stepped off the edge into this vibrant fresh world.\nOUR TEAM:\nCreator, Designer and Taker of Responsibility in the End: Connor Alexander (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Writers and Developers:\nDerek Pounds (Samish)\nWilliam McKay (Manitoba Metis Federation)\nWeyodi Oldbear (Numunu)\nAdditional Native Writers:\nNico Alberts (Cherokee Nation)\nRiana Elliott (Cherokee Nation)\nNative Graphic Artists:\nAl Harris (Lumbee)\nBarbara Schelling (Assiniboine)\nNative Artists:\nElijah Forbes ( Waganakising Odawak)\nJeffery Veregge (S'Klallam)\nKyle Charles (Whitefish Lake First Nation) \nBrian Roanhorse (Navajo)\nJillian Dolan (Metis/Cree)\nKeith Jim (Navajo)\nEmma Flowers (Crow)\nNative Playtest Leader and Consultant:\nShay Snow (Caddo and Plains Cree)\nNon-Native Team Members:\nJade Wesley (Editing)\nJennifer Lange (art)\nAmelie Hutt (art)\nJanice Sheen (cartography)\nChris Likins (website design)\nHeather O'Neill (Kickstarter Management)\n*We are continuing to add Native contributors throughout this project's development, so this list is not final.\n\nI'd also like to add that this is a very personal project for me. While it's the first project I've created, I've been working in the games industry for 7 years and I've been a role player since 1978. For a long time I've wanted to create a game that speaks to my Native heritage in a way that's hopeful and positive. I'm proud of the team I've assembled (and am still adding to) and I'm confident that we have the experience, talent and determination to not only complete this project and deliver, but to bring you a truly memorable role playing experience.   - Connor Alexander, creator\n$20,000   \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED\nWe'll make every copy of Coyote and Crow with a gorgeous spot UV cover!\n$25,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll include a massive 11\" x 17\" detailed and annotated map of the city of Cahokia in the core rule book. \n$55,000  \u2714\ufe0fACHIEVED   \nWe'll make a character name generator, true to the in game language, Kag Chahi, developed by William McKay.

Reaching. Reaching $125K would allow Jenn to begin pre-production on a new standalone short film that will be used as pitch for a feature film. All funds raised after the next stretch goal will go towards production of the next film project, contingent on the final production needs of Death's Diner (edited 4/11/2021).  \n\"The Vagabond and the Sea of Stars\" (work in progress title) is a mystical short film about otherworldly bonds, and going to the ends of the earth to find one missed connection.\nDeath's Diner \nDeath\u2019s Diner follows two patrons who stumble into a diner, one foggy night, and find that their lives have come to an end. It\u2019s through their conversations with one another and their charismatic waiter that the truth is unravelled.\nDeath's Diner was filmed in 3 days at the iconic Twede's Diner, the same location as the Double R Diner in Twin peaks. The story was written and created by Son M. The short film was co-produced and directed by Jenn Ravenna Tran. Jenn is also the cinematographer. Death's Diner will be a 10 minute short film.   \nIt all started with a story thread Son M. had written on Twitter that follows patrons in a diner who have brief conversations about their lives with Death. It was written during a difficult time in their life, past-midnight, and was thought to just be a personal outlet for their feelings. It resonated with a lot of folks, and soon it spread, eventually landing on the timeline of Jenn. Jenn reached out to see if Son wanted to adapt the story into a film, Son replied and the rest was history!\nWith this Kickstarter, we are hoping cover some of the production costs already spent, as well as post production costs. Principal filming was made possible by Jenn's Patreon savings, as well as some private donations. A stretch goal would be to cover all production costs, after all fees, shipping, and merchandise costs. \nHere are estimate costs based on both our current $25K goal, and if the production was fully covered at $85K.\nGreen = Already Spent on Production, Some Out of Pocket + Some Private Donations\nRed = Needed to Finish Production\nBlue = Money We Will Never See\nThe Film and Digital Rewards\nDeath's Brew Enamel Pin by Kevin Jay Stanton \nSIGNED Death's Diner Trio Poster by Bex Glendining \nSIGNED Death's Diner Poster by Cathy Kwan\nSigned Memento Polaroids of Jenn Ravenna Tran's Photography\n Death's Embrace Art Print by Natalie Hall \n1/1 Edition Monotypes of Jenn Ravenna Tran's Photography.

Instead, crossing continental distances, only to reach the wall of a \u2018room\u2019. Passing beyond will only bring yet another room on the other side of it, with new lands stretching off just as far again.\nAlthough all manner of threats exist out in the wilds, such as strange animals and beasts, and other barbaric or dangerous people, the greatest dangers of all, are the Rooks. Huge, hulking stone automatons that patrol, somewhat mindlessly, out in the wilds of the Colostle\u2019s rooms.\nThat is until they are disturbed. Every Rook is different, there are no two the same, and they are the only source of magic in the world. As such, they are something of a target to hunters looking for tech they can scavenge, artefacts they can sell or magic crystals to grant them strange and unpredictable powers.\nThat is if they can bring one down...\nA 'room' stretching out before an Armed adventurer...\nWhat is a solo RPG?\nThink of it like a personal, mindful writing exercise, where the game provides you with prompts to write your own fascinating adventure in this strange world. You will be keeping a journal of your adventures, and the game system is a way to determine what you will encounter along the way, and to dictate the outcome of combat. All the book provides is prompts and inspirations, but it is up to you and your character to flesh out the details and to write about what you discover.\nFirst you need to create a character, someone of this world. This book will guide you through this process, but it is completely up to you. Then the game provides you with an outline of your first adventure. You can decide how to interpret these prompts and what to write, there are no limits to what you can do, this is YOUR adventure.\n\nWhat is in the book?\nThe Colostle book will be a 24 page A5 tome with all the rules required to create and play your own Colostle adventure. The book will have a thick 300gsm cover with foiled lettering, and the internal pages will be on off-white recycled paper for an otherworldly look and feel. The book will also feature black and white illustrations throughout suggesting glimpses of the world and the kind of characters you could create.\nDesign of the interior black and white pages (mockup)\nHow does the game work?\nThe basic principle is that of drawing cards from a shuffled deck of playing cards, and checking their colour, suit or number against tables to see what they represent for your adventure.\nIn the exploration phase of the game cards might stand for meeting another traveller on your journey, finding some abandoned ruins or discovering a mysterious doorway. its up to you to write in your journal what these things are and what they mean for your character. The game simply suggests things, like writing prompts, set against a fantastical world... its up to you what they all mean for your greater story. In the Combat phase, cards stand for attacks with the numbers on the cards showing their strength. Playing the right card at the right time could mean victory for your character!\nAs you play and write you will find ideas for what the mysteries of the Colostle might mean, just falling into your head. I don't provide the answers in the book, every player will discover their own truth and meaning of the world.\nAll you will need is a deck of playing cards, a pen, some rough paper for making gameplay notes and a journal to record your character's adventures in.\nHow to Play Colostle - Example of a typical Exploration and Combat phase in the game\n3 Unique Character classes\nTo play Colostle you will need to create a character, and to that end there are 3 unique classes introduced in the book that will help you do that. They are; The Armed, The Followed and The Helmed. All of them use parts and pieces harvested from Rooks that give them special abilities. I don't want to give everything away, as it is only a small book (!) but you can see an Illustration of The Armed class below.\nThe Armed - wielders of harvested Rook arms\n Rewards + Stretch Goals Breakdown\n Cheaper Shipping Options\nIf you look in the rewards you will notice that some rewards have an identical twin with the added 'Cheaper Shipping' to their title. This is because I found a cheaper shipping cost later in the life of the campaign after these tiers had been already added. If you are a new backer, and you live outside the UK, please make sure you select the 'Cheaper Shipping' version of the tier you would like, to make sure you get the best deal on your shipping.\n(These 'Cheaper Shipping' options only exist for the top 3 tiers, \u00a320 or over. The lower tiers have accurate international shipping as they are, so you don't need to worry about those)\nNew artwork for the 'Oceans' module!\nNew artwork for the 'Battlements' module\nWho am I?\nMy name is Nich Angell and I am a comic book artist, illustrator, writer and game designer. I am one quarter of the stories-and-games company Big Punch Studios, creators of comics such as 7STRING, Afterlife Inc., and Cat and Meringue and the super fun card game Sandwich Masters!\nI have worked on a lot of comics and games, both from an illustrator perspective and a concept/creation one. More than anything I love creating worlds, whether thats a place to hear a story from, or a place to play a game in, making worlds is my thing! So when I found out about solo RPGs and played a few I realised what an awesome thing they were, a small tight rulebook for a brand new world.\nAs someone with a wild imagination I am always coming up with new ideas and Colostle is the latest setting that popped into my head. This time though, I was excited to create a more open ended world so that others can experience the joy I have creating stories, adventures and mysteries.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nI have worked on many graphic novels and as such am extremely familiar with creating books and making artwork printready. I have run a great many Kickstarters both on my own and as part of Big Punch so I am highly confident in the process and know the extent of what is involved.\n\nAs with all of my Kickstarters and those I have been a part of, I believe communication is key. I know to update regularly and keep the backers informed even if unforeseen delays or problems occur.\n\nWith a small book and a small print run like this I don't foresee any issues. The kinds of things might be print delays, quality issues, and delivery but I have plans for all of these issues if and when they appear.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nReusability and recyclability\nThe book will not be packaged in any plastic shrinkwrap or film, and will be delivered in a fully recyclable cardboard book envelope.

Pairing sharp mechanics with unique, breathtaking settings, creators from all across South East Asia are putting out games that challenge the way we think about tabletop gaming and rapidly building a legacy that will undoubtedly change the face of tabletop RPGs forever.\nNow, in collaboration with Sandy Pug Games, four of the biggest names in this community are combining their powers to create a compilation of three amazing games showcasing exactly why RPGSEA is the community to watch right now.\nEvery backer at the core level and above will get digital copies of all three games, and potentially much, much more! See our stretch goals for more details, but for now, let's say hello to the squad, and their games!\nNote: Due to difficulties in working across borders, this project is digital PDF only.\nCheck out the launch party with an extensive interview with the team right here!\nSinta Posadas is a game designer, illustrator and layout artist from the Philippines. They make games about sentient plants, love, revolution and the Apocalypse. They enjoy making games that are often built with themes that explore human connections through sometimes non human lens.\nPam Punzalan is a game designer, writer, editor, sensitivity & cultural consultant, and community organizer from the Philippines. Her games are explorations on the fringe, reclamations of topics and themes that are often barred to her and her own, adaptations of popular tropes and archetypes, and a good mix of sweetness and light that dances on the darker edges of human experiences.\nNavathem's End is a clever kitbash of concepts and mechanics from Powered By The Apocalypse and Forged In the Dark, where you play as Agents of a Tower trying to stop the Apocalypse. Play in a dazzling, chaotic, broken world where you're the last line of defense versus all mayhem breaking loose.\nThe game is grounded by three main attributes: Blood, Crown, and Will. Each attribute then feeds into a dynamic dice pool that players can optimize through their playbook skills to see if they succeed. Following the principles of PBtA, Navathem's End provides players with a roster of moves that can be seamlessly used throughout all phases of the game, ala FItD's game phases. Will you be able to Stay True To Your Name when trouble arises, Agent?\nNavathem's End comes optimized for long campaign play, with smooth character creation options, seven core but customizable playbooks, five optional playbooks for magic users, and a roster of options for expanded play. Levelling up is easy and encourages PC to PC and PC to NPC interactions, rewarding significant connections and discoveries made throughout the game.

When she\u2019s not working on hir next big thing, he\u2019s probably zoning out to k-pop, experimenting in the kitchen, or reading autobiographical comics.\nCapitalites is a slice-of-life, coming-of-age tabletop roleplaying game about young adults living in the big city as they try to find out who they are and get their shit together. Explore real-world themes like ambition, sex, family, and friendships and the sacrifices you make in order to grow up as you navigate an excitingly mundane world of gentrified hipster cafes, skyscraper office blocks, penthouse parties, and late-night drinks at the local bar-and-bistro.  \nCapitalites uses an easy to learn, \"writers-room-esque\", GM-less system (inspired by Good Society, Fiasco, and the Belonging-Outside-Belonging family of games) which focuses on listening, discussing, and asking questions to one another to drive the game forward. It uses no cards, no dice, and no tokens! Instead, everyone takes on equal responsibilities as storytellers to collaborate and resolve the very own conflicts and disasters they themselves create! Draw from your own lived experiences to craft a dramatic, hilarious, and sometimes deeply sad tale that's both funny and painful because it's true.\nThe base game contains 14 playbooks; each with their own sets of labels, careers, and insecurities... such as: \nThe Hot Chick, the woman all the guys wanna fuck and all the girls wanna be.\nThe Zha Boh, the typical Asian girl who doesn't know who she is or what she wants \n The Sensitive Man, the man who's \"not like other men\".\nThe Player, that hot, charismatic dude with washboard abs that's gonna use you and lose you.\nThe Hypocrite, a heavily religious person who lives by totally contradictory standards.\nThe Crazy Rich Kid, a person from a rich family who struggles with having everything in life...and more!  \nEach playbook is directly inspired by real-life people (and friends), looking beyond and beneath the stereotypes they might seem to represent. Sure, some (or most) of them are really flawed and broken people... but that's all part of the fun!

He's obsessed with all things mechanical, military history, and exploring the Filipino and Filipino diasporic culture through art. You can usually catch him wearing some techwear looking like a real Maharlika ready to pilot a Meka.\nMaharlika is a technomystic Science Fantasy mecha RPG inspired by Filipino Mythology, centered around Mekanized Weapons or Meka, and their pilots: the eponymous Maharlika.\nYou will play as these titular spirit-warriors, mavericks, aces, and knights that all swear loyalty to a Datu, one of the CEOs of the Megacorporations, so that you can protect the technospiritual galaxy of Arkipelago. Sometimes, you\u2019re the archetypical noble Maharlika, sworn follower of your Datu and kneeling before their feet. Other times, you\u2019re just an exceptionally skilled person trying to make ends meet, and \u2018loyalty\u2019 is just another word for \u201cwhatever makes the most money.\u201d You are a free person after all.\nAs a Maharlika, you venture out into space where you will take on  dangerous missions, fight for your ideals, hack the spiritual internet that is the Lambat, repel Xenobeings, trade love and resources, and participate in fiestas to survive, thrive, and protect what is yours in the dangerous Starsea.\nIn Maharlika, you will find rules for Narrative Maharlika play and Tactical Meka Combat, fast-paced and heavy metal. Build a Meka by choosing one from 20 \"Baluti\" frames, 4 for each of the 5 Megacorporations, and then customizing that even more with over 160 AGIMAT weapons, systems, modules, protocols, and parts.\nAll of this is set in a dangerous and diverse galaxy known as Arkipelago, inspired by Filipino History, Mythology, Culture, and Folklore. Find the Diwa, the spiritual reality that is actually the smallest part of reality that exists within everything. Interface with powerful fey god-beings known as Diwata, the personified god-spirits of the Universe. Hack and interface with the Lambat, the internet of things that takes advantage of the Diwa. Be caught in the politics of the four Megacorporations, for the actual government is hopelessly incompetent. Upheave the feudal capitalist system of the Lakanate. Travel to the Land of God, in the middle of the Galaxy, where the IMPINITO DIYOS resides, and be the powerful spirit-warriors that pilot the walking giant saint-suits that are the Meka.\nMaharlika is written for both long term play and one-shots, both being enjoyable in their own right. There are five main Megacorporations, each one having five Baluti, Mech Frames, on their own. The Core Rulebook will have everything you need to play, alongside some d20s and d10s, and filled with art from Gio and other Filipino artists! \nCheck out the full beta manuscript for Maharlika below!\nhttps://tadhana.itch.io/maharlika-revised-beta-english-version\nAs well as pulling together some incredible games by incredible creators, the purpose of the Our Shores collection is to help fund the further creation and survival of not only the creators showcased above, but the community at large.

We've listed some highlights below!\nLevel One\nGoal - $35,000\nAt this level, Capitalites will add an additional 5 playbooks, and Maharlika will include an online play kit, including digital tokens and battle maps. Navathem will include portraits for all core heroes!\nLevel Two\nGoal - $41,025\nAt level two, both Navathem and Capitalites will double their pay to various members of their teams, and Maharlika include one new Baluti for each megacorp, with art to match!\nLevel Three\nGoal - $48,250\nCapitalites doubles funding for its creator, layout designer, and collaborators, Navathem will pay for a full, professional grade editor, and Maharlika's creator will receive an investment toward future print runs of the game!\nLevel Four\nGoal - $51,250\nAt this final level, Capitalites will expand to include a novella set in the game's universe a.k.a our real world, and Maharika will include a short graphic novel. Both will be included in all reward tiers! Additionally, Navathem's artists and editor will receive a 100% paybump. ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nSandy Pug Games is publishing this collection, and their head, Liam Ginty, is producing this collection. Liam is an industry vet with tons of large scale, long term projects under their belt. With a digital only release schedule, the only risks stem from the creation of the projects themselves. Most of the games included in the project are nearly text-complete already, and only require art and layout to be released.\n\nThe largest issue that could arise is a problem with the artists or contributors failing to meet deadlines or becoming unable to deliver. In that instance, Sandy Pug Games has a big address book full of incredibly talented artists they could pivot to.\n\nSome risks in international projects are complicated tax processes and lining up schedules. To avoid these, Sandy Pug Games will employ an accountant, and utilize advanced agile project management skills to make sure there's as little impact in the work as possible from the clashing time zones.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "Environmental commitments\nVisit our Environmental Resources Center to learn how Kickstarter encourages sustainable practices.\nSomething else\nYou can't get cleaner than digital!

Within these pages you'll find conversations \u2014 between one creator to another \u2014 where the person behind the books and projects that so many have come to love, adore, and use are given the focus so that they may talk about themselves and the context of their work. These conversations are transcribed into text, and done so in a way to preserve the tone and spirit that each person brings. In the words presented in this book, it is hoped that you will see an image of their soul.\n\nPOLYHEDRAL is, at its core, an 11\" by 11\" book that is currently estimated at around 150+ pages. A digital PDF and screen-reader friendly file will also be available.\nText Only, Screen-Reader Friendly Kickstarter Information.\nA few reasons.\n\nThe first is that I made a joke on Twitter that got severely out of hand.\n\nThe second is that often times when a creator in this industry is interviewed, it is strictly about their most recent project or what they are currently working on, or as part of a panel to get their insight and perspective on a certain narrow field. Rarely do they get to talk about themselves or how they came into this industry, or about their experiences working in this industry.\n\nThe third is that I worked on my own TTRPG book and ran into some troubles and experiences that I couldn't have prepared for. You can't truly prepare for life, and there's no book that can prepare you for the unique stress of making these books. My goal is to make a book that can help prepare people for the stresses of making these books by giving them some measure of forewarning, but also to reassure that they can make what they envision as well.\n\nThe inadvertent fourth is that game designers are oftentimes some fascinating, empathetic people. This should be shown more.\nTeos Abadia\nJustice Arman\nBanana Chan\nKeith Baker\nBeadle & Grimm's\nM\u00d6RK BORG's Johan Nohr and Pelle Nillson\nEmily Care Boss\nStephanie Bryant\nCraig Campbell\nBrandon Dixon\nJoe DeSimone\nRico Evangelho\nCat Evans\nDaniel Fox\nShanna Germain\nMattias Johnsson Haake\n\n\nJames Introcaso\nJaron Johnson\nJon Kelly\nDaniel Kwan\nRich Lescouflair\nMiguel Lopez\nJessica Marcrum\nMatthew Mercer\nWilliam Murakami\nAmit Moshe\nElisa Teague\nChris Spivey\nLucia Versprille\nAndreas Walters\nAshley Warren\nSo. A few people.\nAnd a few unannounced surprises.\nI'm Joshua Mendenhall, also known as HTTPaladin. I'm a freelance graphic designer, writer, and game designer. I specialize in narrative design. You can find me on Twitter where I talk about game design, media, and life. You can also find me on Instagram, but I don't do anything there, so you'd be going there for nothing.\nI'm offering a book that measures roughly 11 x 11 inches big. There is a Standard Edition and then there is a Collector's Edition. The Collector's Edition has a faux leather cover with gold foil.\n\nShipping is collected in the backerkit.\nStandard Edition's Cover\nCollector's Edition Cover\nOnly a sticker, pin and a print currently. Should the appropriate stretch goals be unlocked, this section will fill out with more add-ons. Add-ons may be added in the pledge tier, or in the add-ons selection screen after choosing your tier. This is really important. Some tiers already include add-ons, but you may still add add-ons after selecting a tier. If you select a tier that already has, say, a book and a pin, and you add a pin in the add-on page, you're going to be getting two pins. If you select a tier that has a book and a pin, and you add a print, you're going to be getting the same as if you had gotten a tier that has a book, a pin, and a print.\n2\" tall sticker.\nA black and white, 1.5\" tall pin of the skull used on the covers\nThank You Credits\nThis add-on was added due to feedback from others. It is here if you wish to have your name included in the book as a Thank You, and is entirely optional. If enough people get this tier, I'll even make a pretty word skull.\nIn a state of rushed panic I just started using a skull on a business card back in GenCon 2019, and using skulls and skeletons for my own has just become a thing that I do. I also figure I won't have another book that I can just use a skull for and be satisfied, so if not now, when?\nThe business card. In person, its reflective gold on black.
