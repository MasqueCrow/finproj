Most of the content from the regular hardcover edition is included in this alternate format \u2013 including all rules, races, and classes, and monsters \u2013 using a slightly smaller font size and fewer illustrations. Chapter 12 (plus two brief designer note appendicies) from the regular edition, which provides player and DM guidance, has been omitted to keep the page count (and thus cost) lower.

The 24-page folio includes: a deluxe character sheet with expanded areas for abilities and descriptions; sections for detailing your character\u2019s features, talents, weapons, flaws, spells, items, companions, vehicles, treasure, dice situations, background, family, goals, and personality; and journal pages on which you can record your character\u2019s profile, inner thoughts, group dynamics, secrets learned during each session, and other important game notes. The bonus free PDF version included with the print edition includes fillable text entries as well.\nYou can customise your Anime 5E Kickstarter pledge to your exact specifications by selecting the reward level that most closely matches what you want to receive, and then selecting additional add-ons from the pop-up list of options presented with your pledge level. For example, to add the $25 Anime 5E RPG Pocket Edition to your $50 Gamer Pledge, simply choose the Gamer level and then click the add button for the Pocket Edition. It's that easy! And of course, add-on funds unrelated to shipping count towards qualifying stretch goal pledges as well (so a $50 Gamer Pledge + two $25 Pocket Edition add ons counts as a $100 pledge for stretch goal qualifications). \nIf necessary, you'll later identify any additional funds added to your campaign once we send you the link to our BackerKit survey in April a couple of weeks after the Kickstarter has ended. Note that adding on extra items to your pledge may increase your shipping costs, as indicated in the section below.\nAll funds that you add on NOW during the Kickstarter will contribute towards the campaign's stretch goals \u2013 but not add-ons made after the campaign ends during the BackerKit! \u2013 so be sure you top up your pledge TODAY to create the right package of products for you instead of waiting.\nYou'll get exclusive early access to the digital PDFs in your pledge level when the physical books are sent to press in May 2021.

If you have questions about these shipping fees, please email info@dyskami.ca.\nShipping costs are included in the table below based on the provided pledge levels. Add-ons with your pledge may increase your shipping costs, as indicated in the chart. Of course, shipping cost do not count towards qualify pledge amounts for stretch goal considerations (for example, a stretch goal requiring a $100 qualifying pledge cannot include shipping costs in the amount needed to reach $100).\nPlease note that physical rewards for this Kickstarter are unavailable to ship to the following countries: Brazil, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan.\nThere are many excellent reason to make a pledge during this Kickstarter campaign, and we want to make the decision easy for you.\nEvery pledge for physical book copies also comes with FREE copies of their PDFs from DriveThruRPG as well, which are delivered promptly in May after the Kickstarter ends and you finalise your pledge \u2013 and that adds up to a huge savings!\nSince PDFs of the new releases won't be made available on DriveThruRPG until June/July \u2013 and you'll receive your files in May \u2013 you'll get a month of exclusive early access to the PDFs for your pledge!\nFor physical books, we ship to our Kickstarter backers as soon as the freight arrives in our warehouse \u2013 well before the distribution chain receives their copies.

This pledge locks in your store's access to all physical product available in the Kickstarter, including all add-ons. No further payment is due at this time. We will reach out and work you with you to complete your order in May, so your store will gain early access to the products and stretch goals before they are available through distribution.

Consequently, with our extensive planning and management protocols in place, we believe that the risks and challenges are minimal for this project. Unanticipated COVID-19 pandemic restrictions may result in some delay, though we hope that worldwide vaccination initiatives help control this unpredictable element.\n\nAs always, our goal is to ensure our Kickstarter backers are the first to receive their pledged game rewards. We will post campaign updates regularly from the end of the Kickstarter until we have fulfilled your pledges. After the campaign, we offer a no-questions-asked refund on your pledge (minus the non-refundable Kickstarter and payment processing fees that we cannot recover) until we have closed our BackerKit.

Your mercenaries will be able to pick up tickets that will see them engage in counterinsurgencies, strike operations, train resistance fighters in the wilds, police unruly populations, and take on the heaviest warfighting jobs available.\nEverything is provided in the set for you to do this, from the initial creation of the mercenary unit to the building of tickets for your Travellers to attempt, with specialised units and equipment enhance a unit's capabilities, and enough adventuring material to kickstart any new campaign.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Mercenary set will initially contain three books in a box set, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks and adventures to expand the mercenary experience, covering new tickets, equipment and rival units.\nBook 1: Mercenaries in the Far Future\nBook 2: Running a Mercenary Force\nBook 3: In the Field\nWipeable Unit Roster Card\nThe writing for the Mercenary box set is complete and you can download the first book included in the set, Mercenaries in the Far Future, right HERE.\n\nMercenaries in the Far Future: A full guide on using mercenary units in Traveller, detailing how they operate and fight across a range of environments and Tech Levels, along with rules on how to resolve missions and related incidents in the life of mercenaries. It also deals with larger-scale conflicts and how the focus can shift from a high-level picture of a theatre of war to a crisis point involving a handful of mercenaries. In short, this volume is all about what an existing mercenary unit does.\nRunning a Mercenary Force: This book shows you how a mercenary force is recruited, maintained, expanded and subdivided if necessary. Four key resources are necessary to this process: Personnel, Credits, Materiel and Influence.\nIn the Field: The tickets presented in this volume are intended for use in any Traveller campaign, and are independent of Charted Space and the Third Imperium universe. Some are standalone incidents which can be placed in any suitable location, whilst others form part of a wider conflict or confrontation. In addition to the tickets presented here these situations provide a backdrop for further mercenary operations and adventures.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nThe Mercenary box set brings a new style of campaign to Traveller and contains all the core rules needed to make warfighting a way of life for your group. However, there is no one set way to build a new mercenary unit and each is as unique as the group of Travellers behind it. Clearly, there is an immense amount of ground that can be covered, from new 'toys' to equip your soldiers with to specialist mercenary units and fully fleshed out tickets to kick your campaigns off. Kickstarter gives us the very best opportunity to explore these avenues while constantly getting your feedback on how to present them.\n\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels (Virtual Mercenary, Mercenary Soldier, Mercenary Officer) in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Mercenary in your hands.\nThe Field Commander's Pack\nProspective recruits will be able to purchase a special orientation pack to get them grounded in mercenary life and on their way to earning a fortune - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Mercenary Officer level!\nIn the Field Commander's Pack, you will find:\nA pad of blank Mercenary Unit Roster sheets, ready for your new unit\nSix Mercenary pencils, perfect for your Travellers\nOne Mercenary Officer's pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Enemy Vehicle Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the most dangerous vehicles you are likely to meet on the battlefield - and should be on your unit's shopping list\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Mercenary dice\nThe Premium Weapons Guide, a 16 page addition to the Field Catalogue featuring items made available only to the finest of mercenary units\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\n\nStretch Goals\nWe have lots planned for your Mercenary campaign and, with your kind help and support, we hope we can give you a lot more bang for your pledge!\n\n\n\n\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is growing quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Mercenary to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level.

Explore a fantastic world rebuilding itself after an apocalypse as it marches onward with its industrial revolution.\nThe Iron Kingdoms possess a rich history\u2014and a tumultuous future\u2014full of unique monsters, deities, heroes, and villains.\nMore than a thousand years ago, the land that is now called the Iron Kingdoms was western Immoren, a mire of warring human city-states. Then came the Orgoth, conquest-driven imperialists from beyond the sea who laid low the cities of man with forbidden magic and changed the face of western Immoren forever. The Orgoth Empire occupied the land for six hundred years before the people of Immoren banded together to defeat the invaders and drive them back across the sea from whence they came. While the rebel armies kept the peace, their leaders convened in a city called Corvis. This Council of Ten drafted the Corvis Treaties after weeks of furious debate, and the Iron Kingdoms were born.\nStrictly speaking, the term \u201cIron Kingdoms\u201d refers to the lands of humanity, those five kingdoms that signed the Corvis Treaties: Cygnar, Khador, Llael, Ord, and the Protectorate of Menoth. Other nations of western Immoren are commonly included in that description, although they took no part in the treaties. In the frigid north is the dwarven kingdom of Rhul. To the northeast lies the mysterious homeland of the elves, Ios. The last kingdom informally included when speaking of the \u201cIron Kingdoms\u201d is the hostile island nation of Cryx, ruled over by Lord Toruk, the Dragonfather. All these nations\u2014and many more\u2014share the continent of Immoren.\nThe Orgoth were driven from western Immoren more than four hundred years ago, but the decisions made during the rebellion still echo through the world. There are many strange legends from the last days of that war\u2014tales of dark, mysterious allies who helped drive off the invaders. Some say it would have been impossible to defeat the Orgoth without this help, that the rebel leaders had to make dangerous deals with infernal powers. These tales have proven true, and the Iron Kingdoms have recently been irrevocably changed by the Claiming, an attempt by these infernal creatures to take the payment they have long been owed\u2014an unfathomable number of souls.\n Full.

Iron Kingdoms: Requiem combines this fantastic setting with the newest edition of the world\u2019s most popular roleplaying game.\nInside this book you\u2019ll find the history of the Iron Kingdoms and information describing the current state of the world following the Claiming. Alongside these chapters is an extensive gazetteer providing detailed information on the most notable of the world\u2019s unique and fascinating locations.\nWhen making a character, you\u2019ll be able to choose from many of the familiar countries and cultures of the setting. Whether you want to be a human, gobber, trollkin, Rhulic dwarf, ogrun, Iosan, or Nyss elf, this book provides all the rules that make these different peoples unique. When choosing a class, there are options for many you\u2019re already familiar with, from the stalwart man-at-arms fighter to the free-flowing monk of the Order of the Fist. Beyond these are brand new rules for playing the characters that make the Iron Kingdoms such a memorable setting. These new classes include, among others, gun mages, arcane mechanics, combat alchemists, and warcasters.\nAlongside these options are new feats, spells, and backgrounds to make your characters feel even more a part of the world of the Iron Kingdoms.\nFinally, within the pages of Iron Kingdoms: Requiem are extensive rules for the arcane technologies of the setting. These rules cover subjects from firearms and mechanika, like the galvanic arms and armor of the storm knight, to the mighty warjacks that accompany warcasters into battle.\n\"Before the Iron Kingdoms became a land dominated by industry and machines, it was the monsters that defined it.\"\n\u2014 Professor Viktor Pendrake, author of the Monsternomicon \nIn the Iron Kingdoms peril lurks at every turn, as fearsome and terrifying creatures both great and small look to turn unwary adventurers into their next meal or enslave them beyond death. From ferocious packs of ravenous burrow-mawgs to deadly ethereal pistol wraiths that haunt the back roads and forgotten cemeteries, and the fiendish Infernals that still stalk the shadows, the Monsternomicon is filled with creatures both mundane and supernatural to challenge even the most experienced adventuring parties.\nThis legendary tome includes over 80 monsters, new and old, steeped in over 20 years of worldbuilding, now appearing for the first time with 5th Edition rules.\nClick to go to the Update featuring these two preview pages.\nDiscover the origins of the legend that started it all...\nTwenty-one years ago, the Iron Kingdoms was introduced through an acclaimed series of adventures known as The Witchfire Trilogy. Now, the legend continues in the newest edition of the Iron Kingdoms RPG, written for 5e.\nA girl, a sword, and a secret...\nAs a child, she lost everything when her mother was wrongfully executed for witchcraft and her soul was consumed by the most ancient of all weapons, the black blade known as the Witchfire. Hellbent to spare her mother an eternity of torture, Alexia Ciannor stole the accursed sword and set out to unlock its dark secrets. With the voices of the Witchfire's imprisoned souls raging in her mind, Alexia would eventually unlock the power of the Infernal artifact and command an army of undead to vanquish the villains seeking to use the sword to once again subjugate the Iron Kingdoms.\nNearly two decades later, the veteran of countless wars, Alexia returns to Corvis, the City of Ghosts, in search of help from the malignant forces that seek the return of the coveted sword.

In fact, we have so many that we wouldn't have enough space on this page to feature them all. Instead, we're going to curate a selection of miniatures relevant to Iron Kingdoms Requiem, which we'll make available in the post-campaign pledge manager with special Backer-only pricing. Watch for a forthcoming update soon that will list all of the miniatures that we'll be featuring in the line, and let us know if we missed one that you think should be included.\n\nSHIPPING \nThe European Union, UK, U.S.A., Canada, and Australia will be \u201cShipping Friendly.\u201d Backers from these countries will not pay import taxes.\nShipping will be charged after the Kickstarter has completed based on actual costs to ship the rewards. We will collect your shipping information through our pledge manager once the campaign ends.\nBelow is a list of rough estimates to ship the PAPER GM PLEDGE. Depending on your reward, shipping costs may go up or down. Multiple books will cost more, a single book will cost less.\nIn an effort to keep shipping costs as low as possible, domestic U.S. rewards will be split into two shipments with the books shipping via USPS media mail and any other rewards going in a second shipment at approximately the same time.\nThese estimates are based on current shipping rates and the fulfillment fees of our regional fulfillment service partners. We will do everything in our power to keep shipping costs as low as possible, but costs could vary at the time shipping is charged.\nAs a matter of policy, we do not ship to P.O. boxes, but contact us directly if this presents a difficulty for you.\n(All shipping cost estimates below in U.S. dollars.)\nUnited States - $10+\nCanada - $15+\nAustralia - $20+\nUnited Kingdom - $17+\nEU - $22+\nAsia - $25+\nREST OF WORLD - $70+\nREFUND POLICY\nOur refund policy aims to be as simple as possible\u2014no questions asked. But there are some things you need to know.\nAny pledge can be refunded in full up to 14 days after the Kickstarter campaign has come to a close.\nFor refund requests made more than 14 days after the Kickstarter, we will only be able to refund 85% of the pledged amount. The 15% that cannot be refunded are the irrecoverable fees collected by Kickstarter, our credit card processing company, and our pledge manager for processing your order.\nDuring the course of our production of your rewards, we will make updates announcing pending shipping dates. Once we have begun packing and shipping orders, we will no longer be able to process refund requests.\nIf for any reason we are unable to deliver any part of your order, we will refund the pledged amount for this item in full, regardless of the date.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge and agree to the following:\nThe rewards being created for this project are a \u201cwork-in-progress,\u201d and the appearance, content, and materials of the rewards shipped are subject to change and may differ from what is shown or described during the Kickstarter project.\nYou are obligated to finalize your pledge and pay any shipping fees due by the closing date of the pledge manager. If you do not, then you may not receive your rewards by the expected delivery date, nor will you be entitled to a refund. We may, at our discretion and at the availability of the rewards, ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the pledge manager has closed.\nOnce you have confirmed your pledge in the pledge manager, our obligation is to ship your order as you have entered into the pledge manager system.

Through our Kickstarter experience, we have learned a number of lessons, most important of all that allowing \u201cscope creep\u201d to occur over the course of the campaign leads to extended timelines and threatens the expected delivery dates. For Iron Kingdoms: Requiem, timely delivery of the rewards is absolutely essential for our planned release schedule, and as such, we will not waver from the goals of the project we have presented, nor can we add to what we have planned to deliver. \n\nOur very first product was a d20 OGL adventure, published 21 years ago. We've been making award-winning products ever since, with new products releasing every month for over two decades. We are experienced publishers with a history of timely delivery.\n\nWith that said, stuff happens. No one has escaped being affected by the COVID-19 and there's no way to tell yet how the coming year will unfold. But we have built in allowances for potential delays in our schedule, and we are prepared to do whatever we need to in order to deliver your rewards as close to our expected dates as possible. \n\nBeyond unexpected cosmic forces, our biggest risk is in working with outside vendors where issues beyond our control can occur. However, the vendor we are working with to produce all of Iron Kingdoms: Requiem rewards is someone we have a long history with and who has delivered top-quality products reliably for us for many years. It is always possible a ship breaks or something gets stuck in Customs, though, and this can cause delays. And we are all bracing for what lies ahead in the coming months with the coronavirus, which, of course, caused delays for countless products in production last year. But we will be in close contact with our vendor and we will always keep you updated if any delays occur, with as much notice as possible. \n\nBecause we have endured a variety of setbacks due to external events as well as internal issues, we know there is always a risk of hitting the expected deadline. But in the end, we have always delivered close to our anticipated dates, so our largest risk is simply the delivery timing. After making sure we get you the best quality product and game experience, an on-time delivery is our highest priority and is, in our minds, essential to the success of this project.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 10 or more", "title": "RETAILER RESERVATION", "descp": "Get your customers into the world of the Iron Kingdoms with this special reservation of the retailer bundle!\nYou will receive 3 copies of all 3 books, as well as PDFs, and 3 GM screens!

These cards provide keywords to spark your imagination and example phrases for their use. Written by novelists and organized by dungeon-masters, the cards are designed for quick on-the-fly use and inherently add randomization. The list of monster parts uniquely depicted include, but are not limited to, the following:\n Horns\n   Teeth\n   Claws\n   Protrusions\n   Bodily Forms (Hides, Ears, Eyes, etc.)\n   Tails\n   Wings\n   Tentacles \nBetween great heroes and great monsters lies the pinnacle of drama \u2014 Combat. The unrelenting tension that comes with knowing blood will be spilled, and life may be lost. Monster Description Cards will guide you while you detail these moments, providing keywords and examples for horns that PIERCE, claws that SLASH, tails that BLUDGEON, and more. Hundreds of new ways to describe monster strikes in these familiar categories: \nSlashing\nPiercing\nBlunt\n\nWhat happens when a monster is cornered, heavily injured, or both? What if the creature is smart enough to be deceitful, spiteful, or vindictive in its last moments? How can you subtly share that your monster is on its last legs, but there is still a worrisome hint of malice in their eyes? These questions are all answered by the LAST STAND section of the cards. Where examples help illustrate the response of creatures facing overwhelming odds and perhaps displaying heroism, sacrifice, or wickedness of their own.\n\n\n \u201cWRITERS OF ALL LEVELS LOVE THE IMPACTFUL NARRATIVE EXPERIENCES DESCRIPTION CARDS ADD TO THEIR WORKS\u201d \nThere are common composition principles that ask writers to \"show and not tell .\" That is, allow the reader to experience the story through actions, words, thoughts, senses, and feelings rather than through the author's summarization and cliches. The Monster Description Cards reinforces this principle by providing keywords to spark the imagination and elegant examples chock-full of distinctive story-building concepts.\n\"Cliche Busting Cards\"\nThere are three cliche busting writer's tools within the Monster Description Cards.\n\n 1. Above all else, the \"core descriptions\" provide brilliant creature concepts. They share unique ways to introduce or explain distinct physical features to an audience. These \"core descriptions\" allow writers to stay far away from monsters, terms, phrases, or even ideas that are now unoriginal and thoroughly overused.\n   2. The second tool in the deck is the Combat Sections. These areas focus on drawing an audience into the sheer violence of monstrous combat, exploring unsettling concepts like great height and length, great strength, even preternatural abilities. They touch on the tension that lingers with the threat of a hero's death. These cards collect these concepts and inherently randomize them for writers to literally draw inspiration.\n   3. The LAST STAND is a fresh and new idea for our card tools. Whether you write horror, sci-fi, or fantasy fiction, your creatures and oddities will need to be compelling and memorable, particularly in their last moments. The LAST STAND helps by offering depictions of your monstrosities on the verge of defeat while adding a bit of doubt in the reader's mind with one last defiant moment.\n  AS A STORYTELLER, HAVING A MEMORABLE ANTAGONIST IS A KEY INGREDIENT TO SUCCESS. SO JOIN US! WE BELIEVE YOU WILL LOVE THESE CARDS.\nFor GameMasters (In-game Play)\nThe cards will melt right into your game, and your players will think you are brilliant. They will provide idea after idea on improving monster encounters. But more importantly, they will also drive you to new, full-blown campaign ideas. The type of campaign that players will reminisce about for years to come. The Monster Description Cards archive these feats by offering up concepts over statistical modeled stat-blocks. The cards narrate one-of-a-kind characteristics that you can easily add to existing monsters, creatures, or oddities. \n\nIntroduce extraordinary creatures to your players, giving them clear signs of why they might be unique, even among their kin. \n\nImprove combat by focusing on the right adjectives associated with the body part landing the blow, such as claws, tails, or fangs. Not only are there specific narrations for specific body parts, but they are also broken down by blunt strikes, slashing strikes, and piercing strikes. With these multiple combinations, you can keep your combat fresh game after game. \n\nLastly, there are always moments in the game where a GM would like to subtly provide hope to their players by indicating the monster is nearing defeat. These epic final moments are depicted in the LAST STAND sections of the Monster Description Cards.\nWriting advice on worldbuilding typically leads towards lists of 'rules' and 'tips' which are either too general to be useful or downright wrong. The Monster Description Cards instead provide concepts and implementations of ideas capable of driving your imagination to discoveries about the world you want to create. Alongside the Magic Description Cards, the Monster Description Cards can immerse you in creative ideas and concepts that are anything but clich\u00e9.\n\nIF YOU'RE A GM, THIS IS AN EASY BUY, BUY, BUY DECISION.\n\nFamiliars and Animal Companions: Your Familiars and Animal Companions are cool as hell. Let me make them sound cool as hell. Select a few cards that match the combat style of your familiar or animal companion and hand them to the Gamemaster to describe their attacks with style. Critical hits made by your Familiars or Animal Companion should be magnificent, and these cards provide that strike description that can be so satisfying. You can even have a LAST STAND card ready for your Familiars or Animal Companion just if things come down to that. Moreover, the cards' descriptions can be the basis of the unique features that make your Familiar or Animal Companion distinctively yours. So let\u2019s build something special with these cards.\n\nShapeshifting: In tabletop RPGs, there are thousands of classes/powers/feats/spells that can shapeshift or grow body parts into lethal weapons. Thousands more transform hands to claws, teeth to fangs, arms to tentacles or growing tails, bony protrusions, even wings. Each of these wonderful transformations can benefit from the Monster Description Cards. The Cards will instantly make these transforms unique and unforgettable with clever depictions, separating your character's ability from the crowd of other characters with similar capabilities or sometimes the exact same class ability, power, feats, or spells.\n\nUsing the cards to depict transform spells: Using the Monster description cards to verbally illustrate the results of magical effects that modify a character's body is more than just a way to be unique; it's how you build a legacy. Stylize your character's abilities with these cards, so they are recognized by others, respected, or even feared.\n\nMonster Journal Entries: Commemorate the monsters you've encountered by inserting Monster Description Cards in your monster journal. Flip through cards of unique descriptions to depict the memorable battles along your character's journey. Each card is your personal trophy, a memento of your battle-scars from the most challenging encounters. You can even use these cards to log essential information about certain monsters in your campaign, making every entry a result of your character's meticulous observations during battle. Sing the song better than any bard could with these encounter-defining descriptions. \nBuild a strong visual library with the entire series of description cards from Conflict Games. The entire Description Cards line can be used as a database for ideas, concepts, events, environments, and fight scenes. Not only do these cards bring new ideas to concept art, but the combat styles and descriptions therein can help portray your creation in a way that works and sells a room on the idea.\n\nDuring the Concept art process, Game Design, and Film writing, an artist and designer often craft creative assets like anomalies, monsters, characters, and fight scenes that heavily influence the final work. Our Descriptions Cards have been used during this process for great success. If the goal is to provide realistically visualize ideas for VFX teams, animators, and modelers, then the Magic, Combat, and now Monster Description Cards can be an innovative way to help and become key part of your process.\nUnlike our previous description cards, these cards are double-sided and chock-full of goodness.\nBackers will receive: \n200+ Descriptions and introductions of various monster components\n  300+ Combat descriptions sorted by monster appendage\n  100+ \u201cLast Stand\u201d descriptions, for portraying monsters that are heavily damaged vengeful, desperate, or relentless\n  Printed on heavy card stock (350 gms)\n  Large Format Card (tarot sized cards)\n \nSize: 2.75'' x 4.75'' (70mm x 120mm)\n  Over 100 total cards, including stretch goals\nEach card is organized under the following general categories:\n Horns & Frills\u2014Horns are hard permanent outgrowths, often curved and pointed and typically found in pairs. Frills are upward-curving bony plates typically extending behind the skull.\n\n Fangs & Maws \u2014The Fangs category is considered the mouths, jaws, teeth, and maws of large, small, or odd creatures.\n   Claws & Pincers\u2014The claws category consists of pincers, paws, talons, and hooks. That is, any style of sharp, usually slender, and curved nail at the end of hands and feet.\n   Protrusions & Osteoderms\u2014This category consists of bony deposits that form knots above scales. Protrusions regularly produce sharp structures that can be used offensively, or widen scales and plates that add to the defenses of a monster.\n Bodily Forms\u2014Creature hides, eyes, noses, ears, or other physical oddities that might distinguish a creature from its nightmarish kin are the focus of this group.\n   Tails\u2014The hindmost part of a monster, such as the flexible extension of the backbone in a vertebrate. Tails can be used to whip, constrict, or trip an opponent.\n   Wings\u2014This category focuses on wings of all shapes and sizes, functional or non-functional: Elliptical wings, high-speed wings, long soaring wings, and more. For the cards combat backside, wings will batter with winds, slice with sharp edges, and stab with spiked ends for a unique description style.\n   Tentacles\u2014The tentacles cards help depict any elongated, boneless, flexible organs, limbs, antenna, or barbels of famed monsters.\nPotentially more to come with stretch goals, so please back and share this project.\n\nOne the backside of the cards are Combat Description for the associating Monster part. The cards are divided into three suits, which correspond to the three common attack types of Blunt, Slashing, and Piercing.\n \n\nWe understand that there are a multitude of genres, points-of-views, worlds, rulesets, and games that writers and tabletop gamers choose. That\u2019s why our writing philosophy dictates the following rules which will ensure our content is system-agnosit, narrative Neutral and friendly to writers at all levels of expertise:\n We don\u2019t describe the person perceiving the monster.\n   We don\u2019t give names to monsters.\n   We don\u2019t mention blood specifically, but generalizations like \u201cfluid\u201d are occasionally used .\n   We don\u2019t describe the surface the monster is on.\n   Nothing cheesy, corny, or racy will be accepted.\n   Both Heroes and Antagonists should be cool, so let\u2019s make them sound cool!\n  System Neutral: The card descriptions are not tied to any tabletop ruleset or Genre, meaning they can be used to describe monsters in any of your favorite tabletop-rpgs. If you run multiple games in multiple systems, these cards are great to use in any and all of your games.\nThe cards will help you answer question like these:\nIn a sea of zombies, what if you need one to stand out?\n  In a world of dragons what makes this dragon different? Special? Memorable?\nAnime is all about unique characters and ability, so why not use the cards to create singularity among a crowded field?\nREWARD SUMMARY\nPLEDGE LEVELS\n\n\n\n\n\nTo add an add-on to your Kickstarter pledge, follow these steps:\n1. Press the Manage Your Pledge Button. (If you have not pledged yet it will say Back this Project.) \n2. Increase your pledge in the Pledge Amount box by the total of the add-ons you want to add.\n3. Do not change the tier you are currently pledged at, unless you also want to change it while you are on this screen. You will then need to add the total of your add-ons onto the amount of the new tier you chose. After the end of the Kickstarter campaign you will receive a survey that will ask you questions so that you can explain how you would like the add-on money assigned, and customizations when applicable.\n\nVoice Overs in the App: As mentioned in this Backer Update, The app contains over 200 Voice overs performed by Classically Trained Voice Actors.  You can hear a few examples below.\nNote: Only the Monster Description Cards included \u2191\u2191\n\nAll Cards Included + Voice Overs\nVoice Over Examples:\n\n\n\nMany of the above add-ons are from Previous Kickstarters. You can use the links below to discover more information:\n Combat Description Cards Kickstarter... \n Magic Description Cards Kickstarter... \n Deckboxes Featuring Malay Folklore Kickstarter... \n\"Combat Description Cards\" Contain 120 cards\n\"Storyteller's Deck\" Contain  Contain 80 cards\n\"Magic Description Cards\" Contain  134 Cards\n\"Monster Description Cards\" will Contain 100+ cards (dictated by stretch goals)\nPlease Note for Add-ons: Shipping/handling is included for backers in the US up until a weight of 4 decks. Additional shipping cost will be required if the total weight of the package is above 4 decks.\nThese are targeted milestones for us to hit as a community. If we do hit these goals, each and every backer benefits! Here are a few, not all, of the initial stretch goals.\nUnlocked!\nA protective coating will be placed over each and every card to help guard them against spills, rough handling, and those who regularly have gooey fingers (you know who you are). Your investment will be much better protected with this card coating! We will also increase the density of the paper used in the cards from 250 to 350 gsm. What does that mean? An improvement to the density will increase the appearance of the printing and make the card stock even more substantial and harder to damage. That's right, this reward is both protective and appealing!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\nThis stretch goal adds 2 cards \u2014Unlocked!\n\n\nEmail Mark with any ideas\n\n\nWe've been especially fortunate to find some great partners with whom to collaborate. In December, we will finalize any product design changes as dedicated by stretch goals and backer feedback. Going into January, we will focus our writing and editing teams on completing the product content. The cards will be produced in China by mid-February. By the end of February, decks and accessories will go on freight to U.S. soil. We will prepare the orders, and the very first batch of deck boxes will be ready to ship to the priority shipping backers by the end of March. By the end of April, we will start to fulfill other orders with physical rewards to our domestic backers, then international backers. \nWe will share updates to the estimated schedule via the Kickstarter update page. Please stay tune in there for more information. \nPledge Manager\nAfter the campaign is over, we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to finalize their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection.  BackerKit is the world's most trusted post-crowdfunding platform and we are proud to have them aboard. \nShipping in the USA will be included. International shipping will be between $15 and $25 dollars based on the number of items in your order. If needed, additional shipping for add-ons will be charged via our pledge manager after the Kickstarter campaign ends. Please note these are only estimates. The final cost may increase, or decrease based on the total number of shipments and current postal prices at the time of shipping. Free Shipping in the USA is limited to one reward tier per backer. \nThis campaign will be US-Customs Friendly, CA-Customs Friendly, UK-Customs Friendly, EU-Customs Friendly, AU-Customs Friendly, and NZ-Customs Friendly. If you live in any of the regions listed and receive any additional charges for receiving your package, please send an email to support@conflictgames.com and include a copy of your customs receipt. We will then reimburse you via our Pledge manager (or PayPal).\n\nThank You For Helping Us Run An Amazing Campaign.\nWe're so happy to be here on Kickstarter, building and growing our community. This is our 5th kickstarter. We love the direct engagement with you, the backers, and the opportunity to build projects together and bring them to reality. To that end, we strictly adhere to the Kickstarter Community Guidelines. If you violate the Community Guidelines by being a jerk or spamming the campaign, we will refund in full and cancel your pledge, and you will not be eligible to receive any rewards from the campaign. We encourage open discussion, but we draw the line at abusive language and behavior. \nThank you to the vast majority of our backer community who are respectful and thank you in advance for helping us follow Kickstarter's Community Guidelines and maintain and grow a respectful community on this campaign and across Kickstarter.\nHelp us spread the word\nAfter you\u2019ve backed our campaign, help us spread the word by sharing our campaign page with your friends on Tictoc, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter!\n\nAre you a reporter, blogger, or vlogger?

Fortunately, this is our 5th Kickstarter under the Conflict Games LLC brand and we have consulted on over 20 others. The Monster Description Card Deck is a fairly straightforward product. However, the foreseen risks involved include shipping logistics and the unexpected cancellation of contracted artists, writers, editors or product manufacturers. In the case of contract cancellation, the contractor will need to be replaced. Which in turn, could delay the project's completion but shouldn\u2019t prevent its completion. \n\nIn regard to shipping, logistics could become burdensome. We are unable to control the fact that domestic and out-of-the-US shipping costs seem to be spiraling out of control. However with our target funding goal, we don't foresee this preventing the project from succeeding; although, it may impact delivery dates. \n\nThe one guarantee we can make is that we will be transparent with issues and communicate them to our backers as quickly as we can. We strongly believe our target funding goal is sufficient to complete our vision for the product. \n\nIf you're as excited about this card deck as we are, then help us exceed that goal - we have much more we wish to do for this card series. This is just the first step in an exciting journey so please JOIN US!\n\nPlease Note: The final design of the Monster Description Cards deck and stretch goals may vary as many of the graphics above are digitally produced. Examples of this include, rounded card corners vs squared corners and raised lettering vs flat ink on the final packaging.\n\n\nRequired Attribution Text\nThanks to:\nsolid platonic solids by Dank By Design from the Noun Project\nDeath by rayhan maulana rikzan from the Noun Project\nrating by Flatart from the Noun Project\ndigital by Eucalyp from the Noun Project\nstretch by KEN MURRAY from the Noun Project\nShipping by Gregor Cresnar from the Noun Project\nbooks by Yeong Rong Kim from the Noun Project\nD20 by Lonnie Tapscott from the Noun Project\nCards by Henry Ryder from the Noun Project\ntwo by Laura Reeny from the Noun Project\nfall by Rendra Tri Kusuma from the Noun Project\nUnicorn by Lazar Nikolic from the Noun Project\nStory by Lars Meiertoberens from the Noun Project\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Thank you kind Sir or Madam!", "descp": "You will receive project updates & Mark M.

However, some of the best descriptions are longer than others. This may be a problem for physical cards, but not for the digital products. Therefore, we will be doing another round of selection to ensure only the cream of the crop gets printed. At the same time, we did not want to shortchange you guys on the creative efforts because of trivial physical limitations. Therefore, we have also decided that all 880 descriptions will be published on the Digital products (i.e., API, app, and writer's grid). The physical cards are my favorite, but there is an advantage to digital. With the bulk of the writing work completed, we are now moving on to the project's subsequent two phases.

We are still writing and editing the Monster Description Cards content.  This part of the process should have been completed about 30-40 days ago. However, I have been extraordinarily particular about the descriptions that make the final cut. For that reason, our writing room has created a ton of descriptions, and to guarantee high-quality creativity, we also have many rejections, edits, and rewrites. Each of these steps has gone slower than I anticipated.  I may add writers to the project, but I believe the best solution to the delay is to simply keep writing.

The sad majesty and woeful glory of a tormented goddess, the divine terror and eternal anguish of the departed, mere phantasms of their former conscience... all brought to life by a sculpture devised to match the style and the strength of neoclassical statues as never dared before.\nAs a surprise for the campaign launch, Progenitor God Izanagi has arrived! Izanami's husband and brother has manifested in all his mighty, progenitor of the new generation of gods and ordainer of the universe.\nThe aim of this kickstarter is to produce a limited collector's run called the Fukashi Sekai Run \u4e0d\u53ef\u8996\u4e16\u754c. All models forming part of the Fukashi Sekai Run will be numbered and signed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe models are designed to be incredibly detailed and we are pushing our efforts to bring every detail to the highest point of clarity that is humanly possible!\nDeath Goddess Izanami has been 3D printed by one of the best artisans in the EU in high quality resin to ensure it can be cast smoothly and in great detail.\n*Mana photo depicts a 1:10 example to show what can be done with the STL file. The resin model you can gain as reward for backing is in 54mm scale.\n\nDeath Goddess Izanami is part of the Sankokushin: Five Sacrifices project, the upcoming board game developed by Axis Mundi Games. Death Goddess Izanami campaign inaugurates the Sankokushin resin line, named Fukashi Sekai \u4e0d\u53ef\u8996\u4e16\u754c (Invisible World), that we intend to develop for years to come with more and more models.\nSankokushin: Five Sacrifices is a solo-cooperative campaign game set in a fictional version of medieval Japan planned for Kickstarter in 2021.\n Can the Death Goddess - Izanami/Progenitor God Izanagi model be used in the actual game?\n                                                 Yes.

They rocket through the stars to safeguard diplomats ending a generations-old conflict. They sip tea together and share shy glances at the corner cafe with their old classmates and comrades. Even when swords are crossed, they have the potential to connect more deeply than anyone expects.\nA sword duel can end in kissing, a witch can gain her power by helping others find love, and an entire campaign can be built around vagabond matchmakers piloting their sentient gay spaceship from system to system.\nIf you love angsty disaster lesbians with swords, you have come to the right place.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians by April Kit Walsh is a roleplaying game that celebrates the love, power, and existence of queer people\u2014specifically queer people with swords and a lot of feelings. Flirting, sword-fighting, and barbed zingers all mix together in a system designed for both narrative drama and player safety. This innovative take on the Powered by the Apocalypse engine is a breeze to learn and ensures that no matter how the dice fall, something interesting happens to move the story forward.\nIn this game, you will solve problems with wit, empathy, and style, fight when something is worth fighting for, and redeem (or seduce) at least a few of your adversaries. You\u2019re part of a community that embodies important ideals and you\u2019ll strive to protect it and make your world better.\nPlay as one of nine character types: Beast, Chosen, Devoted, Infamous, Nature Witch, Scoundrel, Seeker, Spooky Witch, and Trickster. Each explores a particular emotional conflict that drives the drama and shapes your character\u2019s story. Are you a Beast, faced with the dilemma of expressing your inner truth versus fitting in to a society that demands you conform? A Devoted, who sacrifices for others while struggling to care for yourself? A Trickster, who craves closeness but fears vulnerability? In long-term play, you may even resolve your initial arc and advance into a different playbook as you continue to change and grow, facing new challenges.\nBackers get immediate access to the playbooks too. They're form fillable!\nThirsty Sword Lesbians provides clear, robust guidance and support for running the game, including how to make appealing adversaries, set the tone, structure play, and create a safe environment at the table. Handy reference sheets help you narrate appropriate twists and drama on the fly, depending on the feelings and character types you have in play.\nWant to jump into a one-shot? The game includes six adventures that can stand alone or kick off a longer series: Sword Lesbians of the Three Houses, Best Day of Their Lives, Constellation Festival, Gal Paladins, and Monster Queers of Castle Gayskull. For even more inspiration, it features The Starcross Galaxy campaign setting along with five more settings from these contributing authors:\n Lesbeans Coffehouse by Dominique Dickey\n Neon City 2099 by Jamila Nedjadi\n The Three Orders of Ardor by Whitney Delaglio\n Les Violettes Dangereuses by Jonaya Kemper\n Yuisa Revolution by Alexis Sara\nWe also provide ample guidance on how to create your own tales of fighting with swords and falling in love, along with a world building worksheet, variant rules, and a set of starting scenario seeds to play with. Because the game focuses on feelings and relationships, it\u2019s a lens you can use to play in a variety of genres. If you like slashfic of characters with swords, you\u2019ll love this game.\nThirsty Sword Lesbians is explicitly designed to tell melodramatic and queer stories; tales fraught with relationship triangles, mystery, intrigue, relationship anarchy, celebration, and revolution. It includes rules to highlight different identities, emotional connections, and setting elements.\nThis game is not for fascists, TERFs, or other bigots. The team behind Thirsty Sword Lesbians supports racial liberation, intersectional feminism, and queer liberation. We love and respect transgender people, nonbinary people, intersex people, and women. This game is a joyous celebration of lives and identities otherwise marginalized. If you don\u2019t agree, fix your heart before sharing a table with other people.\nWhat if... not Thirsty? The game fundamentally assumes that the characters crave connection, but that connection doesn\u2019t need to be sexual or romantic. We offer you options for changing how the game addresses connection in our variant rules section.\nWhat if... not Swords? It\u2019s simple enough to swap out a different hand-to-hand combat option. Your campaign or your character can use a labrys, the double-bladed axe that became a lesbian icon in the late 20th century. You can use different styles of unarmed combat or even grapple using telepathic self-projections. It\u2019s also possible to replace the swords with mecha, starships, or guns, but it requires some thought and the book will help you think about how to ensure that it stays intimate and relationship-focused. The conflict doesn\u2019t have to be physically violent, either; you can use any kind of conflict that\u2019s adrenaline-inducing and close-quarters.\nWhat if... not Lesbians? We\u2019ll let you in on a secret: you don\u2019t have to play a lesbian. The game plays with themes that are common for all sorts of people who are marginalized on the basis of gender and sexuality, as well as feelings that go beyond the queer experience. If you want to play thirsty sword cishets, we\u2019re not going to stop you\u2014just don\u2019t be surprised if the game turns them queer.\nWhat if... I\u2019m not good at flirting or zingers? You don\u2019t have to be witty or good at flirting in real life to play a character with those skills, and not every character in Thirsty Sword Lesbians is good with words. Shy and awkward sword lesbians find love, too. You\u2019ll find them well-represented in this game.\nReady? Let\u2019s Go!\nClick for a PDF of this graph!\nWondering what\u2019s involved in all those delicious bullet-points on that reward tier you\u2019ve been flirting with? Here are your answers (scroll further down to find out about the many stretch goals already unlocked\u2014look for the big glass)!\n\n\n\nAngsty disaster lesbians, here and now! You can find details about the production timeline in the project's FAQ.\nAfter the campaign is over (possibly a few months down the road) we'll launch a BackerKit for this campaign and invite the backers to set up your rewards.\nBackerKit is a pledge manager: a separate website that gives you (and us!) greater control over what happens after the campaign than a simple survey would.\nBased on our average shipping scenario in the USA, we're charging a flat $10 fee (media mail + handling costs) for book shipments to USA addresses.\nBIG NEWS as of October 19th! Thanks to a big show of support from our friends at the UK-based Mongoose Publishing, we are now able to offer shipping outside the USA for this Kickstarter. Right now we have the Smitten (all flavors) and Nice tiers set up to offer shipping for $15 to destinations in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, New Zealand, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. We would be happy to add your location as well! \nPlease contact us at feedback@evilhat.com if it looks like your destination is not yet covered, and we'll add it as an option as soon as we confirm the shipping rate for that country/region.\nIf you end up ordering multiple books for international shipment, we will bill an additional $5 per additional item in BackerKit well after the campaign is done.\nApril Kit Walsh (she/her or ze/zir) writes queer games about feelings, vulnerability, and caring for one another.

We've run over a dozen successful Kickstarter campaigns and we've printed many roleplaying games in a variety of physical formats over the past few years.\n\nThis puts us in a fine position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise. Experience tells us that things don\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nHere's what we can anticipate as potential problems.\n\nThe Text: While Thirsty Sword Lesbians is largely done aside from the art and other polishing touches, it's possible backers will identify some glaring issue that we need to address before we take this fully to publication. That can add time, for sure. Luckily we have several talented writers available if we need a fix, as well as layout and editing people on standby, so any necessary changes should proceed quickly.\n\nPrinting: We have a strong, established relationship with our printers. We\u2019ve got them on tap to print the books in whatever quantity we end up needing. But printers can run into problems all the same: supply shortages, unexpected delays due to company holidays or industry events, shipping problems, printing errors, and so on. We\u2019ve got the experience to stay atop those potential problems and the flexibility to pivot and address them promptly. In the event of defective product, we will send a replacement at no cost to you. We print our books in the USA, so there's less of a chance the economic policies of the current administration will suddenly cause the cost of the book to skyrocket or otherwise introduce problems getting the books from the printer to us.\n\nShipping: Packages get lost. We'll send replacements. Shipping can take longer than expected. We won't put the book on sale until all backer copies are shipped out. Shipping costs can end up higher than expected. We'll absorb the overage.\n\nFinances: While Evil Hat has seen some leaner months more recently, we've made the necessary cuts to our expenses to make sure we can sustain the company throughout 2020 and 2021. Also, we've already invested time and money to get Thirsty Sword Lesbians to this point with no pending expenses on the project outside of the ones we're funding here. Our bank account continues to look plenty healthy. If an unexpected cost arises, we've got the cushion to take the hit.\n\nWe often run a couple Kickstarters per year. This is a carefully planned process based on our 14+ successful Kickstarters in the past. Because Kickstarter fulfillment takes time, these campaigns can overlap. When it happens, that's something we plan for extensively.

When disaster strikes or menace looms, they don\u2019t run from the danger, they run toward it. Whether they claim supernatural abilities or just plain courage, there's a single word that describes such people:\nIn a world that could use a few heroes now more than ever, you can now join their ranks\u2014using the flexible TTRPG mechanics of the Cypher System.\nImagine, for a moment, that you find yourself imbued with powers well beyond those of mere mortals. With great might, you leap into dark and daunting dangers. You stand before the forces of injustice with confidence. You slip the grasp of gravity and soar. You Claim the Sky itself.\nBut what about on the other end of the scale, where we\u2019re all a bit more earth-bound? We can still be heroes. Saving lives amid natural disasters, man-made cataclysms, pandemics, or crises of any sort, we can take on the role of First Responders.\nThese two new Cypher System sourcebooks focus on heroes of all kinds!\nClaim the Sky continues the series of genre-focused books that includes The Stars Are Fire (science-fiction), Stay Alive! (horror), We Are All Mad Here (fairy tales), and Godforsaken (fantasy). Each of those titles dives deep, exploring different aspects and variations of its genre and offering new rules, character creation ideas, equipment, creatures, cyphers, and other elements for making the most of the topic.\nIn this case, of course, the topic is superheroes. Whether your love is comic book superheroes or the blockbuster films of recent years, Claim the Sky will give you step-by-step guidelines for recreating all your favorite characters, building your own heroes from scratch, and sending them out into fun, fast-paced RPG adventures and campaigns.\nBut there\u2019s more. Like the books that came before it, Claim the Sky presents a fully realized, ready-to-use superhero setting: Boundless. In the world of Boundless, your player characters can join the ranks of well-established heroes and face titanic foes: invading alien creatures, horrors from other dimensions, supervillains using their powers for selfish or destructive ends. This setting is like our own world, but superpowers have existed for generations, and the world has adapted accordingly (in sometimes surprising ways!). If you\u2019re looking for a setting with the feel of movies or comics, Boundless will take you there!\nFirst Responders looks at heroism from a different angle. This is a world where the heroes' powers aren't supernatural: our world, where courage, wits, experience, and grit are the tools by which our heroes overcome crises and disaster. Around the globe, the PCs respond to earthquakes and hurricanes, floods and fires, war zones and industrial disasters, plane crashes and pandemics. They're part of an international organization with a mission to save lives and to not just respond to crises, but to end them.\nIn First Responders, you create a campaign with a broad roster of heroes. In one session you might need a paramedic, a trained rescue worker, and a firefighting specialist, while the next mission requires the paramedic, a field researcher, and a pilot, and the one after that you need a rescue worker, a field researcher, and a technician. The players maintain multiple characters, but the unique system advances them all, regardless of which are involved in a given adventure, so that any can be called upon as the campaign progresses and the threats become ever more dangerous.\nFirst Responders also provides exciting rules for mega-challenges, making events like a forest fire or an earthquake into a fully-realized narrative filled with challenges as dynamic and exciting as any battle against monsters or crawl through a dungeon. These large-scale challenge rules will be easily useable in any Cypher System game, so you can incorporate them into your Numenera campaign, or adventures based on Claim the Sky, The Stars Are Fire, or any other Cypher System setting.\nOur world needs heroes. Cypher System fans love new books. We've already unlocked The Origin, a new hardcover setting book. And we're looking forward to reaching the Cypher System Bestiary later in this campaign! What else might we unlock before that title\u2014or beyond it? We have lots of great ideas, and look forward to lots of cool stretch goals!\nThe critically acclaimed, award-winning Cypher System is fast-paced, narrative-focused, flexible, and uniquely easy on the GM. Baked-in mechanics like Effort and player intrusions easily support heroic styles of play\u2014PCs can really push themselves to do amazing things. The Cypher System\u2019s Power Shift mechanic and Power Boost cyphers perfectly portray the way superpowers work. They make it easy to show how a super-strong hero can break down a door without thinking twice or how another hero might briefly try something unique with their powers to get a very specific effect. Both of these mechanics\u2014and more\u2014will be even further developed in Claim the Sky.\nCreating a great Cypher System character is as easy as coming up with a great concept. You build the character you imagine through a quick, fun process that results in a character with depth, nuance, and flexibility.\nCypher System characters are built with a three-part sentence. You might be a Rugged Warrior who Stands Like a Bastion. A Guarded Adept who Keeps a Magic Ally. Perhaps a Graceful Explorer who Moves Like the Wind. Or a Charming Speaker who Bears a Halo of Fire. Each part of your sentence says something about your character\u2014but also provides some of your abilities, skills, and stats. They even offer guidance on your connections to other characters in your party, creating bonds that can be a foundation for an ongoing campaign, or facilitate great roleplaying in one-shot adventures.\nCyphers give characters single-use abilities frequently gained and spent, adding variety to the character\u2019s capabilities and providing exciting new approaches and options. Depending on what\u2019s appropriate for the campaign, cyphers can be subtle, representing blessings, unusual turns of luck or capricious powers, or manifest, in the form of bits of unusual technology, charms, or minor magic items.\nCharacter arcs encourage and reward players for pursuing their characters\u2019 own motivations, in addition to the overall story of the campaign. Just as the heroes of movies, comics, and TV shows grow through their own subplots, Cypher System players may choose arcs to pursue, tying their characters\u2019 personalities more closely to the overall story and engaging the players even deeper into their characters and the campaign.\nNo problem! Every backer level includes a copy of the complete Cypher System Rulebook in PDF. This 448-page book is a $22 value in PDF, but it's free with every reward and delivered early, mere weeks after the campaign closes. (Already have the CSR? You can gift your free PDF to a friend!)\nWant to Check It Out Now?\nDownload the free Cypher System Rules Primer, and have a look at the system's amazing mechanics right now!\nClaim the Sky is a 224-page hardcover (upgraded to include a poster map!) that delves deeply into all aspects of the superhero genre. With a similar look and form, it's a beautiful companion to the recent Cypher System supplements The Stars Are Fire, Godforsaken, Stay Alive!, and We Are All Mad Here. Beautifully illustrated, it explores the many facets and subgenres of superhero comics, movies, and fiction, with rules and options for all of them. It includes the Boundless campaign setting, along with creatures, cyphers, artifacts, equipment, and more.\nFirst Responders is a 128-page hardcover (strike that: we've upgraded the page count through stretch goals!) that presents rules, options, gear, and more for heroes inspired by the real world to take on massive challenges and dangers.\nThe Origin is a 128-page hardcover (strike that: we've upgraded the page count through stretch goals!) setting book. This is a world where superheroes are not a fact of life. Player characters must come to grips with the fact that they can do things normal humans cannot, and then decide what to do with these abilities while facing clandestine government branches, terrorist organizations, and even more mysterious groups that want to study, recruit, or destroy them.\nEvery backer level includes a copy of the complete Cypher System Rulebook in PDF. This 448-page book is a $22 value in PDF, but it's free with every reward and delivered early, mere weeks after the campaign closes. If you already have the CSR, we'll make it easy to gift your free PDF to a friend.\nAre You a First Responder? If you're a firefighter, EMT or paramedic, emergency worker, or other front-line hero, the Real-World Heroes backer level gives you First Responders and the Cypher System Rulebook at a deep discount just for you.\nLooking to Get into the Cypher System? You'll get the Cypher System Rulebook in PDF at any reward level. Prefer it in glorious hardcover? The Brand New Hero level gives you every title funded by this campaign, plus the CSR in print (a $70 value). Or check out Any Character, Any Campaign, which includes four additional genre books at an astounding discount! If you're looking to spend a little less, you can instead choose the CSR as an add-on.\nWant to Playtest\u2014or Just See It Early? Materials for the titles funded by this campaign generally go to playtesters about four months before those titles become products and go out as backer rewards (that's a generalization, though\u2014not a specific commitment). If you'd like to be part of the action, or just have early access to the materials to check them out, or to roll the mechanics into your existing Cypher System campaign, back at any level from The Danger Room up. Backers at these levels may choose to be part of the playtest, or simply to receive the playtest material without providing feedback. It's up to you!\nLove an Incredible Deal? To get your hands on a whole stack of awesome Cypher System products, you can't do better than the Any Character, Any Campaign or THOOOM! reward levels. The savings are so spectacular they're a bargain even if you already own some of the titles. All the levels from The Danger Room and up also get you the Cypher System playmat for free, and early access and playtesting!\nAre You a Retailer? The Secret Base level is a flexible way for you to decide how many of each title is right for your store, and to avoid tying up lots of cash between now and release. Your pledge gets you three copies each of Claim the Sky and First Responders. You may, at a later time, increase the quantity of these titles, and add additional titles funded by stretch goals. You\u2019ll pay for those additional titles, at a retail-friendly discount, at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. For this retail backer level only, MCG covers domestic US shipping\u2014but you must still complete BackerKit and follow our fulfillment process (see Shipping, below).\n\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will ship rewards at several times over the course of many months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\nA few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to BackerKit, our pledge management platform. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything you might have missed. Later, when a reward is ready to fulfill, you'll use the MCG Shop to manage the process. This puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming rewards at your convenience, and ensures we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward. YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS STEP TO RECEIVE YOUR REWARD.\nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works:\n1.  When a reward is ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email.\n2.  You log on to the MCG Shop.\n3.  You go to your Coupons page and click on the coupon for the reward, and it is automatically added to your cart. If you have multiple rewards, or want to make purchases, you can add them all to your cart before checking out.\n4. Check out! You give us your address and pay for shipping (for physical rewards) at that time.\nUPDATING YOUR ADDRESS OR GIFTING YOUR REWARD If you move, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, just enter their shipping address when you check out. If it's not convenient to receive a reward at the time of fulfillment, or to ship multiple rewards together to save on shipping costs, you may delay redemption of a reward for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date. \nSHIPPING All backers pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you can choose. As of this writing, basic domestic shipping is $7 per shipment, but we do not control future postal rates, so that cost is subject to change. International shipping is based on postal and shipping rates at the time of the order, and varies by destination and shipment weight.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. We must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Here are details that apply to your region:\n The Americas: Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). Canadian backers please note that our books are printed in Canada, and thus are not subject to import duties; however, items not printed in Canada, such as decks of cards, are subject to import duties.\n The EU and UK: Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the UK. UK and EU backers will not pay import duties and taxes.\n Australia, New Zealand, the South Pacific, and Asia: Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nMonte Cook Games has run sixteen previous Kickstarter campaigns.

We took great care in adapting them to this new format, so the final result is as amazing as their resin counterparts, and the best part is we can make a LOT of them way faster!\nSo, if you did not get a dragon during the past Kickstarter campaign with limited print runs, or if you wanted to get more but weren\u2019t able to at the time, this is the best chance to get them. Plus, these dragon miniatures will make the final encounters of each adventure in the Great Wyrms of Drakha book truly epic.\nOf course, none of this would be possible without the support of our previous backers from Dragons of the Red Moon and we are committed to keep working hard to deliver all 5 waves. If you are a backer from Dragons of the Red Moon, you will still get your resin cast miniatures, but now you will also get the PDF book of Great Wyrms of Drakha for free.\n We are launching this campaign with 3 dragons already available in plastic version.\n* Elyse model (32mm) for scale reference only. Not included. Each dragon is approximately 200mm tall.\nOur backers will always get the best deal with bundles, experience and perks.\n           As each stretch goal is unlocked, you will receive more content in the book detailing the world of the Red Moon with more key locations and an extended menagerie of creatures to keep their players on their toes. \n  As Drakhan dragons are wont to do, this project can grow in size and content with every milestone reached, until it becomes a full-fledged primer detailing Drakha\u2019s visible face, full of incredible artwork by top talent, new beasts, monsters, regions and magic items for your PCs to discover, fight and conquer.\n           The Azhurmas have already sensed your hunger for power and they all want to oblige you in your defiance to their rule.\n           After all, life would be boring without a worthy challenge. \n Here\u2019s what some of our past backers are saying about the Great Wyrms models in previous campaigns where the STL 3D printing files or resin miniatures for Dragons of the Red Moon were available.\nResin copy of Sivax Magnifex from Dragons of the Red Moon.

Beloved, admired, envied and hated in equal measure, Aureus Fulgen\u2019s Most High Vision took form in The Golden City, the beacon of civilization in Drakha and the seat of his power. But some believe his rule is flawed and the time for change has come.\n\nThe adventurers, recently deputised as members of the Steelclaws, are summoned to a private meeting with Aureus Fulgen and given a mission by His Radiant Majesty himself. They are to follow the clues left by a long-dead sage and retrieve a relic of great power from a place in the middle of the Drakhan desert. Their harrowing and brutal journey will take them right to the heart of the nightmarish territory ruled by none other than Baastherox The Broodless, the Warrior Philosopher\u2026 The Mightiest.\n\nKuxcoatl\u2019s thirst for knowledge raised him above all others and transformed him into the grandest of them all. Still, inside the teeming, cryptic jungle known as The Arcanum Wilds, something has been stirring and it brings uninvited change with it. Is someone following Kuxcoatl\u2019s example and furthering their knowledge to rule over any and all transformations? What lies at the end of the deep, puzzled-riddled maze surrounding the \u201cWhisper of Change,\u201d an object rumoured to unlock the most arcane secrets?\nForged in the fires of a volcano and her own inventiveness, Derhilya raised herself above the weak, malformed shape she was born with and turned herself into The Forge Queen. Toiling at the Flawless Forge, she leaves her brood to tinker and create, amassing objects of mind-defying craftsmanship and intricate beauty. One of these, lying somewhere in the Forge Queen\u2019s lair, is said to have been designed as the great equalizer against a direct threat to the Scalebreakers\u2026 and a map drawn in blood by one of them, shows the way to its whereabouts.\n\nThe adventurers have come into possession of a set of instructions to craft a very  powerful magic item: \u201cThe Cloak of the Myriad Shifting Skins,\u201d but a key component lies in the Eveflux quicksilver pools somewhere in the poisonous canals running deep inside Paradis\u2019 tunnels, the domain of the splendid Sivax Magnifex. Unbeknownst to them, locked in the crystalline tunnels lies a \u201cdormant\u201d golem said to have an unparalleled beauty and rumored to lend the power to breach any wall to whomever controls it. Yet, the galleries leading to the vaults are filled with madness and terror\u2026 a combination Sivax finds most pleasing.\nThe time has come for Rawraxxa to prove to herself she still is the apex huntress, and nothing is safe from her hunger and the Brood Levy. A nomadic group of escaped Valernians has wandered into the low mountains bordering the Shrillling Sands, believing they would find refuge on the caves and long-vacant wurm tunnels\u2026 but now find themselves caught in a cataclysmic battle for survival between a small, dying brood and the unstoppable Rawraxxa who has come to them with her customary demand:\u201cprove you\u2019re fit to join my brood; else.. become prey.\u201d\nValernians are convinced dragons fear nothing... Nixis knows better. In truth, all other dragons fear Her, for she has transcended what her former kind conceive as what\u2019s farthest from them: death itself. Now, the whispers in the wind are carrying tales of a group of \u201cslayers of dragons.\u201d The adventurers, Valernian escapees and survivalists, have earned a reputation as mighty combatants and as \u201cscourge of dragonkind\u201d for themselves... and anything that can kill a dragon, is something Nixis will find some use for to further her own ends\u2026  whether they want to join her or not.\nIn Great Wyrms of Drakha, you\u2019ll find:\n Seven high-level, 4-session adventures; each one dedicated to your players actually fighting one of the Azhurmas as their final challenge\n Maps for all relevant locations used in the adventures and key regions in Drakha\n Bestiary! Statblocks and background for every single creature mentioned in the adventures, with all the detail you need to make them come alive and challenge your players\n Items of Might, Wisdom and Horror. New magic items and relics found only in Drakha, plus technology exclusive to the Valernians captive in the Red Moon.\n Amazing art showcasing Drakhan uniqueness, with its breathtaking landscapes and awe-inspiring creatures.\nExtensive, enticing, but never excessive!\n  We love doing what we do. But even more than that, sharing our work with our passionate backers who are enthusiastic about what we create, is the wind beneath Draco Studios' wings.  We\u2019d be honored if you joined us to make it a reality. However, we are well aware the times are trying and we don\u2019t want you to break the bank.\n    Thus, we\u2019ve created a series of very reasonable pledge tiers and several add-on options, plus stretch goals to enhance the contents in the book, to allow you to tailor your choices to fit your immediate needs.  \n    If you decide you can afford an extra expense at a later time, you\u2019ll be able to do so via the Pledge Manager, and once the campaign ends, you will have the chance to make late pledges via Backerkit for a limited (yet reasonable) time.\nChallenge completed!

But feel free to keep retweeting to increase exposure even more!\nClick to download the free STL file of Baastherox Bust.\n\nWe take great care and are pretty serious with the battlemaps created for you to enjoy and use with your adventures, as battlemaps embellish every gaming table around the world, and everybody loves a great looking gaming table.\n       Everyone knows one of the best things about dragons is their lairs.\n       As part of our Great Wyrms of Drakha Kickstarter campaign, we are releasing all the lair battlemaps as printable 3D STL files as an add-on for $10 USD. The 2D battlemaps are already included in the book, but for those who have access to 3D printers, why not go 3D for a truly epic final battle with the scenery befitting such a momentous occasion?\n       We have partnered with Townsmith to have the modular  lairs available in Townbuilder Unlimited. You will be able to upgrade your tier in Backerkit for $5 extra.\n        As we progress on our Community Goals throughout the campaign, the structures for the rest of 3D battlemaps will be included in the bundle, and these will not be merely the base-level grid. The Titan\u2019s skull from Baastherox\u2019s lair is already included in this initial 3D-printable bundle. By completing social challenges, the rest of the lairs will add yet another layer of greatness to your epic.\n        Are you ready to experience the breathtaking Draconic architecture on their own gaming tables?\nThese STL files are for personal-use only, although a commercial license will be available afterwards. All lairs are OpenLOCK compatible.\nFor group pledges or if you just want to add extra copies for you, as a gift or to grant us additional support to our campaign, you can manage your pledge and modify the amount to add extra copies of any product, be it the printed book or miniature(s) of your choice. You can expect saving on shipping, but it will be mandatory for you to cover shipping on the pledge manager.\n\n\nRetailers\nWe are always happy & willing to offer a good deal to all brick-and-mortar retailers / board-game caf\u00e9s, especially now with the trying times most locales are having given the new normality brought about by the pandemic. Thus, we are willing to provide as much support to the people and businesses doing their best to keep the hobbyists and players well catered for. So, we\u2019re doing this in a couple of ways:\nExcellent profit margins: \nOur retailer and corporate sales teams can provide you with a tailored plan to better tend to your business\u2019 specific needs.\n\nThematic display exhibitors: \nWith Great Wyrms of Drakha, Draco is launching its line of \u201cThematic Display Exhibitors,\u201d designed to make our books and dragons to catch your customers\u2019 eye and embellish your store\u2019s display areas. Then, you don\u2019t need to worry about the number of display units you might need, as we have already devised a system where the display\u2019s size will depend on and easily accommodate the product you order from us.\n        As retailers in Mexico City ourselves, the method we prefer is having a deposit ($5 tier) made during the Kickstarter, placing the full order in the pledge manager and pay for the games and shipping fees just before fulfillment begins.\n        We want you to get your order to you as early as possible; that is: before the products are available with your usual distributors.\n        Cartons come with multiple copies of each product. The discount will be calculated against MSRP of your total order.\n        You are welcome to host pre-orders with your customers and let us know if you would be interested to offer local pickup for any backers in your area, making this the first step in what we would love to become a long and prosperous business relationship with your store.\n\nA NOTE ON OUR STL AND COMMERCIAL LICENSING\n\n       As part of our design and business principles and because several members of our team have always been strong proponents of 3D printing, this Kickstarter campaign also contains several options for backers to obtain our STL files* as add-ons to their main pledge, but these are for personal use only.\n       However, if you run a 3D Printing shop or plan on commercializing any of our models\u2014we get it, why wouldn\u2019t you? They\u2019re great!\u2014you can apply for a commercial license directly with our LAIR division. We are honored and appreciate your willingness to make our products reach more people. We at Draco have made it priority to help your business grow, so drop us a line; let us hear from you so we answer your questions and offer you our dedicated customer support.\nOur plastic products are commissioned to PANDA GM, a prestige manufacturer based in China. After production is completed, the miniatures will be sent from China to multiple fulfillment centers in different regions of the world (USA, Canada, Mexico, UK, Europe, China & Australia) to offer all of our backers fair shipping rates and custom-cleared parcels \u2014Draco will always be an ardent proponent of friendly-shipping projects. We got your back!  \nOnce more, we will be working with Backerkit to manage your pledge orders and make sure we get everything right when sending out your rewards to you!\n\nShipping will be charged once the Kickstarter Campaign for this project ends. This way we can offer you the most competitive shipping rates possible as this allows to make more precise calculations depending on each region\u2019s specific volume of sales.\nTransparency is of paramount importance for us. We are not just creators, we are also avid backers too for other projects and as such, we understand your expectations and your doubts. \nIt is your support what has brought us this far. And we aim for the highest quality. As a group, Draco Studios is parent company of Draco Forge, LAIR 3D, and partner of other great publishers such as Detestable Games or Gnomosapiens. We have made collaborations for other projects with amazing publishers such as River Horse, Jetpack7, Arcane Minis, Townsmith, and many people in the industry that we consider now part of the Draco family.\nOur past projects have been a marvelous learning experience, and all of them are very important for us. We strive for perfection, and we consider to have delivered a ton of extra value for our backers for a fraction of the MSRP. \nCovid19 was a challenge for us in the past months too. However, we are finally in the last stretch for War for Chicken Island (arriving to fulfillment centers with a huge box and ton of miniatures), and for Eldritch Century RPG (we ended producing 2 books instead of 1 because of all the written content we developed, and delivered with amazing art. Production is about to start and digital fulfillment within this week with a Beta preview already available for backers). \nDragons of the Red Moon (70% fulfilled) was the one impacted the most by Coronavirus, but we have always been clear about our plans with Great Wyrms of Drakha; Draco Forge (our resin cast workshop) is recovering speed for the missing waves, with production impacted by this year's events. The response from Dragons of the Red Moon was so positive, that we had to plan for 5 production waves instead of 1 (already fulfilled). Draco Forge has also already fulfilled our very first project for Eldritch Century resin miniatures.\nProjects from LAIR 3D (subsidiary company of Draco Studios) have been fulfilled on time (stretch goals from Dragonbond: Battles of Valerna pending but those were promised at a later date).\nIt is important to note that we have different teams working on each project.\nHere's what the timeline for this and our other projects' fulfillment look like:\nYou can count that we will be always here, in the comments, in direct messages or over e-mail to let you know the status of your rewards and we will not rest until all our promises are fulfilled.\nSivax Magnifex, painted by Angel Giraldez\nDragons\u2026 who doesn\u2019t love or is fascinated by these colossal creatures?\nDraco Studios is a team of people who love dragons, and many of the things we do is with other people who share this love for dragons.\nDraco Studios has been developing the setting for over two years. It was GenCon 2018 when Draco Studios met Tom Babbey and we have been collaborating ever since to bring these fabulous dragons and their homeworld of Drakha to life for all to discover wonder and fear.\n Kickstarter voice video by Jonathan Luhmann.\n\nWant to know more about what we do?

We are working with talented partners to manage this project and campaign based in the universe from Draco Gaming Inc, Great Wyrms of Drakha.\n\nPOLICIES\nThis the fifth campaign for a physical product of Draco Studios. Just as always, we are committed to do everything right and connect with people from around the world who share the love for dragons, RPG, miniatures, and 3D printing.\nWe can refund you within 7 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees and other result-based marketing fees (-25%). This policy lasts until the time when we lock orders in our pledge manager, after that point no refunds are possible. If we realise a component cannot be delivered after many months of trying, we refund that completely at the best of our effort, including fees.\n\nThis will be a transparent campaign, if any issues occur, we will let you know through project updates \u2013 which will be regularly posted after the campaign is funded. At least once per month.\nWe are so committed to publishing our products with the best quality, that we will put money from our pockets if needed in case of any undesired events.\n\nBackerKit is our preferred software to manage the pledges and to ensure a smooth process for our backers for selecting add-ons. Backers should answer their surveys before the indicated deadline to expect to receive their rewards at the promised time. Otherwise, their rewards will be sent on a second wave of deliveries or incur in extra shipping charges.\n\nManufacturing will be held with professional RPG books printers, selection of manufacturer may vary depending on scope. If your product arrives damaged after shipping or has any issues, we will send you a replacement for no extra cost. We might ask you to return the other copy and send proof of the issue with a picture (in case we need to file a claim with the postal service).\n\nAny Kickstarter Exclusives are available by us only on active Kickstarter campaigns and special events such as gaming conventions. Availability of the pledge manager is not mandatory and we reserve the right to take that decision.\n\nPlease note that shipping fees for physical rewards will be collected after the campaign ends via a pledge manager. Reward tiers say \"Ships anywhere in the world\" to indicate that backers anywhere can support the project. It does not mean free shipping.\n\nCHALLENGES\nEven though we are trying to offer you a flawless campaign, we aren\u2019t sure whether we will get enough backers to reach the funding goal. We have a large team that will work on fulfilling this project, and we would like to ask for your help to spread the word with a friend, a local store, or your social media.\n\nRISKS\nThird-party issues happening during shipping will be treated on a case-by-case basis.

Grab the PDF of the Blackstorm Sorcerer and Gravity Domain (cleric)!\nFree 17-page PDF sampler\n\n GET READY FOR ADVENTURE!\nAn infinite number of worlds await your discovery out in the vast chasm of the Blackstorm. Realms of unbelievable power, immeasurable wealth, and enigmatic secrets are waiting for you to visit and explore. Realms are continually created and lost in the turbulent Blackstorm. Meanwhile, the gods and goddesses of multiple realms wage war with an ancient group of beings determined to bring all that exists to heel. \nCustomize your character with an array of fantastic magical devices called Aparatum. Upgrade your magic with an optional advanced magic system. Explore new realms and meet many intriguing races. Get to know something new with our advanced magic system as well as new playable classes and other great features. Face unimaginable perils in the Blackstorm and help save all the realms!\nPlayers and game masters, this book is for you. Blackstorm Realms is all about YOUR worlds. And, it's about character customization options with our optional customization system called Aparatum. It is a playground without boundaries; you'll have fresh lore to invigorate your campaigns and provide new places, and a system of character customization to keep your games and characters from being the same and stale.\n Blackstorm Realms allows you to incorporate your own homebrew realms, well-known official realms, and third party realms into one seamless universe and provides you with the means to move back and forth between all of them. Are there suns and moons and stars in your realm? Then give your players an opportunity to discover what's on them, not just what's beyond the horizon, BUT also what is beyond the BEYOND!\nIn Blackstorm Realms, you are introduced to at least three new realms that exist in a galaxy known as The Celestial Tree. \nDwarven Citadel\nLet's not stop there, though. What else does Blackstorm Realms offer? You'll have new classes and archetypes, races, and spells and magic items at your fingertips. But let's go a bit further, shall we? You'll discover the existence of a hidden, galaxy-spanning enemy that works to dominate realm after realm and intimately tied to a mix of magic-and-material crafting called Aparatum. You'll discover secret societies, factions with intriguing motivations and goals, weapons that can slice through the fabric of reality, ancient celestial leviathans that move through the Blackstorm at breathtaking speed, jaw-dropping wonders between realms to explore, and so much more.\nHere's the best part, too: whatever campaign and/or world you are currently running can continue. Blackstorm Realms is simply opening the door and providing the rules and mechanics for creating a larger, shared universe and the means to explore it all.\n\nIn short:\n1. At least three new realms/worlds for you to explore.\n2. New customization options for your characters called Aparatum. Think of them as mechanisms that can enhance your character's body and mind ...but there are risks that balance out the gifted power.\n3. Complete mechanics for moving between realms, with a solid backstory and explanations that will satisfy fantasy players.\n4. A galaxy-spanning conspiracy with good guys and villains to fight, join, bribe, betray, hide from, and maybe defeat. \nCelestial Leviathan\nView the Google Doc with more information about the worlds.\nSara and I (Aaron) started our journey with Dungeons & Dragons. Not only did we fall in love with the game, but the art of Jeff Easley, Keith Parkinson, Larry Elmore, and the great Frank Frazetta inspired us. We have them to thank for what we are doing today! D&D is such a huge part of our lives that everything we have now, including a happy marriage of 14 years, comes from and is because of a beloved game.\nSince 2016, Jetpack7 has been on a mission to bring great art, creativity, and a whole lot of fun into the world. We have been fortunate to be a part of some well-known and loved titles since our start, such as Legends of Norrath, Just Cause 3, and digitally re-creating the 1980\u2019s \"painterly\" look for the 25th anniversary of G.I. Joe.\nIn 2011 Wizards of the Coast approached our art studio, Conceptopolis, to help visualize 5th edition. Surprised to know that we were competing with larger and more venerable studios who had been in the industry for longer than ourselves, we remained confident and presented our work to WotC. Despite all obstacles and the intimidating competition, we landed the job!\nIt seemed fated that we would work on the same game that made us who we are now.\nFrom 2011 to 2013, we produced over 300 pieces of art, some of which you have already seen if you have thumbed through the Monster Manual and Dungeon Master\u2019s Guide for 5th edition.\nEncouraged by this, we formed Jetpack7 in 2017 to bring our own passion for art and gaming to even more people. Having published comic books before, 5th edition presented us with the opportunity to get back into something we love to do. Our mission is to bring something fresh but familiar to a game we love so much, now that it\u2019s being introduced to so many new players. D&D is enjoying an age of revival.\n However, we recognized something lacking. Except for some notable stand-outs, many of the more popular campaign settings produced for 5e are much the same setting.\nWith so many new players joining the fun and bringing their own fresh and unique worlds to the game, we saw a solution to this \u2018sameness.\u2019 In an effort to bring back the nostalgia of the early days of gaming with a fresh outlook, some new mechanics, and our own unique creative twists on the world\u2019s greatest roleplaying game, we came up with Blackstorm Realms! It's a new way to draw all of your worlds together and create something truly unique and special!\n Ted Sikora of Nerd Immersion YouTube channel. Featured Contributor.\nIn 2014, Ted formed Nerd Immersion as a way to share his love for gaming and nerd culture with the world. With the release of 5th edition D&D, he shifted the focus of Nerd Immersion to D&D live streaming and D&D videos. Since then, the channel has streamed over 13 campaigns and released over 1000 D&D videos.\n\n Celeste Conowitch, Author, Icewind Dale: Rime of the Frostmaiden. @dms_guild Adept.  https://celesteconowitch.com \nCeleste is a full-time RPG writer, podcast producer, and general content creator.

We have since made vendor corrections and the process was much smoother, now working with a printer within the USA.\n\nOther possible risks are scheduling the additional material from stretch goals that may push out the delivery schedule on those items, or that one of our primary contributors encounters a production delay. We're a small, but very experienced team with over 1000 unique projects delivered for dozens of toy and video game corporations. Such an event could possibly delay (but not prevent) publication, or delivery of product. Jetpack7 has no other Kickstarter projects outstanding.

Later his younger brother Ricky would pick up the mantel. For 175 issues it is one of the longest running OEL(Original English  Language) manga to exist and has  influenced many. So much so that fans  and readers began to submit  stories based on the NINJA HIGH SCHOOL  characters and story situations.  This lead the creator of NINJA HIGH  SCHOOL, BEN DUNN, to begin to  collect these stories into annuals or  YEARBOOKS.

During that time we\u2019ve contributed to growing and developing the RPG market in our home country, Italy, marrying our individual creative points of view with the very best production values. We also work on Cypher System supplements, like the Hydra Team's Numenera products: Buried Burdens, Unknown Wonders, and Weird lore.  \nIn addition to our internal designers, Here Be Dragons Games will collaborate with authors, designers, and illustrators from around the world. Tom Cadorette, Robert Schwalb (Schwalb Entertainment), are among the great writers and designers who will help to create, edit and develop the project.\nOur talented illustrators, who will enrich the books with beautiful artwork, include Biagio D\u2019Alessandro (covers), Katerina Ladon, Matteo Spirito, Sergio Cosmai, Melissa Spandri, Roman Kuteynikov, Fabio Gorla, and others.\nAnd, of course, we want to thank Monte Cook! Creator of Arcana Unearthed and Arcana Evolved, Monte is a veteran, hall-of-fame game designer with more than 30 years of professional design experience, much of it on products for Dungeons & Dragons\u2014and particularly as a lead designer of 3E. The setting, lore, and stories he created were an inspiration for us at Here be Dragons, and this new beginning could not come about without his support!   \nHere Be Dragons Games has contracted with Monte Cook Games, LLC, for fulfillment of the Kickstarter rewards from this project.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE \u201cSHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\u201d is Kickstarter\u2019s way of saying that backers anywhere can support our project. It does not mean free shipping. We collect the cost of shipping at the time of reward fulfillment.\n\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will be shipping rewards at several times over the course of several months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\n\n                                        A few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed. Although we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through Monte Cook Games\u2019s online store (the MCG Shop), which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience. It also ensures that we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward.\nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works:\n                                        1. When your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email it is time to redeem a reward.\n                                        2. You\u2019ll log on to your already existing MCG Shop account, or you\u2019ll create an account on the MCG Shop (using the email address you gave us in BackerKit).\n                                        3. You\u2019ll go to your Coupons page at the MCG Shop, where you\u2019ll see coupon code(s) that make your reward(s) free. You simply click on the reward coupon you want to redeem, and it is automatically added to your cart. Once you have everything you want in your cart, you check out.\n                                        4. You\u2019ll decide when to redeem your rewards, and\u2014if your rewards include physical products\u2014to what address to have them shipped. You may delay the redemption of your rewards for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date.\n\n                                        If you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\n\n                                        All backers (domestic and international) will pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We\u2019ll offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you will choose when you redeem your rewards.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. There will be several shipping options from which to choose. Your rewards will ship from our fulfillment center in the United States.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. Please be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item. Please see below for more specific information on shipping to your country.\nSHIPPING IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA (not including the United States) Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). There will be USPS International shipping options from which to choose when you redeem your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United Kingdom. UK backers will not pay import duties and taxes. We hope Brexit will not adversely affect the shipping of books from the UK into the EU, but at this time, we cannot promise that EU backers won\u2019t pay import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees. You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND ASIA Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).

I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll last that long.\nA classic roleplaying game returns. The new retro-apocalypotic edition of Twilight: 2000, published in partnership with Game Designers' Workshop, goes back to the roots of the franchise with a boxed set for sandbox roleplaying in the devastation of World War III. The new edition will be the fourth in the series, the first being released by GDW in 1984. Just like the original version, the new edition is set in a year 2000 devastated by war \u2013 now in an alternate timeline where the Moscow Coup of 1991 succeeded and the Soviet Union never collapsed.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\n\"The first edition of Twilight: 2000 was an iconic game for me back in the '80s, and we are humbled and honored to work with Marc Miller and Game Designers' Workshop to bring a new edition to life. The original game was really ahead of its time. Our goal is to build on the amazing sandbox survival gameplay and develop it further, making it more accessible using the tools of modern game design,\" says lead game designer Tomas H\u00e4renstam.\n\"When I saw this proposal to revisit the Twilight universe, I signed on immediately. As I have seen the work proceed, I have not been disappointed, and I look forward to seeing this project become reality,\" says Marc Miller of Far Future Enterprises and co-founder of Game Designers' Workshop.\nSample Layout Spread \u2013 Texts Are Placeholder Only\nSample Layout Spread \u2013 Texts Are Placeholder Only\nAlso part of the project are Amargosa Press (who have recently announced the new Dark Conspiracy 4th Edition RPG), Polish RPG publisher Black Monk Games (who will act as a consultant on the Poland in 2000 AD game setting as well as publish a Polish edition of the game later on), and Far Future Enterprises (who publishes the fifth edition of the Traveller science-fiction roleplaying game). \nThe Twilight: 2000 Boxed Set\nMaking RPGs in boxed sets is expensive, but we really feel it's right way to go for Twilight: 2000, bringing back the feel of the first edition of the game with that iconic Poland map.\nIf we reach our base funding goal, the boxed set will at the very least include two beautifully illustrated full color books \u2013 a Players' Manual and a Referee's Manual, each of about 100 pages detailing rules, setting, gear and scenarios \u2013 as well as several empty character sheets and a huge, full color travel map (format 864x558mm) of central Poland on one side and southern Sweden on the other.\nIf we exceed our base goal, we will add more content to the boxed set as stretch goals. These include combat maps and tokens, cards for initiative and encounters, custom dice, additional content in the books, and more. Read more under Stretch Goals, below.\nLIMITED EDITION METAL BOX: As a exclusive to this Kickstarter, you can even get your copy of Twilight: 2000 in a limited edition metal box. The inside of the box will have a plastic insert (not seen on the mockup image below) to keep all of the game components in place and make sure they are kept in pristine condition. This deluxe edition of the game will only be available via this Kickstarter and will not be produced again. To get your game in the metal box, choose the LIMITED EDITION reward. All backers of the limited edition will also get an honorable mention in the rulebook.\nMetal Box Design (Work in Progress)\nA Referee's Screen will not be included in the boxed set, but can be added to your pledge \u2013 see the Addons section below.\nReferee's Screen \u2013 Work in Progress\nSome say it didn\u2019t have to be this way. Some say history could have taken a different turn. If the Soviet Union had collapsed back in \u201891 when it was on the ropes. If the Gang of Eight military coup against Gorbachev had failed, the world would have looked very different today. Some say. I think it\u2019s bullshit. This storm was always coming, sooner or later.\nIt doesn\u2019t matter anymore, anyway. Now, all that matters is to survive each day.\nIt\u2019s all up to us now. Our squad. Jonesy. Diaz, manning the M113. That Polish girl Kasia. The men and women around me. No one else will come to our rescue. The final words from division HQ, before they signed off for good, left little doubt.\n\u201cYou\u2019re on your own now.\u201d\nJust like the original game, the new edition of Twilight: 2000 is set in Poland, but the game also offers an alternative Swedish setting, as well as advice on how to place the game anywhere in the world. In the game, players take roles of survivors in the aftermath of World War III \u2013 soldiers or civilians. Their goal, beyond surviving for another day, can be to find a way back home, to carve out their own fiefdom where they are, to find out more about the mysterious Operation Reset, and maybe, just maybe, make the world a little bit better again.\nThe core gameplay builds on the hexcrawling system established in Mutant: Year Zero and Forbidden Lands RPGs (both Silver ENnie winners for Best Rules, in 2015 and 2019), developing it further to fit the gritty world of Twilight: 2000. The characters explore the devastated lands using a large hexagon map of Poland or Sweden \u2013 or wherever in the world you wish to place your campaign.\nPoland Map by Tobias Tranell \u2013 Work in Progress\nSweden Map by Tobias Tranell \u2013 Work in Progress\nMap Detail \u2013 Work in Progress\nRonson carries the SAW. Diaz is like the Professor on Gilligan\u2019s Island, he can build a new carburetor out of a pair of coconuts and some dental floss. Kasia, all of 17, is the closest thing we have to a medic since we lost Doc. Jonesy is a ginger who Diaz says looks like the cat in Aliens which is how a German intel officer got a name like Jonesy. Top\u2019s been in the Marines long enough to have fought in the Tet Offensive\u2026 and me? I\u2019m just a grunt. We\u2019re all trying to get by. Top once called us \u201cthe last family.\u201d He might be right. Kasia made a gagging gesture when he did. But none of us expect to see our actual families again.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nThe core rules of the game build on the Year Zero Engine (used in award-winning RPGs such as ALIEN, Tales From the Loop, Forbidden Lands and Mutant: Year Zero), but heavily adapted to fit Twilight: 2000 and its focus on gear and gritty realism.\nTwilight: 2000 will be crunchier and have less random elements than other YZE games. Twilight: 2000 will get a solid ruleset that captures the gritty, realistic feel of the original, but in a more accessible way and that fully realizes the potential for sandbox gameplay. We aim for a system that retains depth and complexity, but that is less granular and easier to use.\nInstead of a dice pool as in other YZE games, Twilight: 2000 uses a two-dice system. You'll roll one base die for your skill and one base die for the attribute connected to that skill. Base dice range from D6s to D12s. Skills and attributes are rated from A to D, with a better score giving you a better die to roll. Attributes and skills are fairly broad, with specialties used to fine-tune your character. Combat uses battlemaps with 10-meter hexes to regulate movement and ranged attacks. Extensive systems for critical injuries as well as component damage to vehicles give crunch to the system, while keeping it fast and playable.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nTwilight: 2000 is a game with a large and proud community. We want to extend a big thank you to everyone, for your warm welcome to us and the upcoming game since the project was announce a few months back.\nBeside the comments field here on the Kickstarter, we have opened a section dedicated to Twilight: 2000 at our forums, and you're very welcome to join the discussions there. Also, of course you have the pre-existing Twilight: 2000 Facebook group which is an amazing resource and community hub, and the new Facebook group Twilight: 2000 by Free League, created specifically for the new edition.\nWe are very eager to hear your questions, thoughts and requests for the new edition. Even if we might not be able to fulfill every wish, we certainly want to listen to your advice and feedback.\nAfter the Kickstarter concludes, later in the fall, we will share a full Alpha PDF of the game to all backers, so you will be able to playtest the game and  give your feedback on it before it goes to print.\nArt by Niklas Brandt\nWe love friendly local gaming stores all over the world and want to forge an even closer relationship with you. We offer a retailer pledge, including five copies of the Twilight: 2000 boxed set (including printed stretch goals), at a heavily discounted retailer price.\nBy taking part in this Kickstarter as a retailer, you make sure you get the games on time for the official release next year, and you get them at a lower cost than through normal distribution channels.

Several active and retired servicemen from the U.S. military are assigned to the project as consultants.\nTomas H\u00e4renstam has been a roleplayer since his 11th birthday way back in 1985. The first edition of Twilight: 2000 was one of the first RPGs he played and it has stayed with him ever since. In the mid '90s, Tomas spent his one-year mandatory military service as an intelligence officer in the Swedish army. Later, he pursued a career in journalism and worked for over a decade as a foreign news reporter and Middle East correspondent, reporting from places like Gaza, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.\nChris Lites first encountered Twilight: 2000 in a bookstore, prior to having ever played an RPG. A Cold War kid, he was obsessed with all things military and, in particular, WW III. Within the year, he\u2019d played D&D for the first time and soon bought Twilight: 2000 at his local game store. There started a fascination with this game that\u2019s lasted his whole life. Twilight: 2000 is, to Chris, as relevant as ever. Because any way you slice it, the world painted by GDW back in 1984 doesn\u2019t look all that different from what might lay ahead of us in a worst-case scenario. The old is new again.\nAngus Abranson spent many a school lunch hour, back in the '80s, traversing the ruins of Europe trying to make it home.  Since then he has battled dragons, flown battleships, lived, loved and died in countless realities and realms \u2013 only to land back in a wartorn Europe looking, once again, for a way home.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Hellscape pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.  \n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion.

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods.

If you are new to 3D printing and want to get a quickstart into the different technologies. \nWhat you need to know is that with 3D printing you will be able to get everything you need to start playing at home, you will also be able to print multiple copies if you require more for your army, or even if you just want to try a different color scheme. \nAll our sculpts were made with 3D printing in mind, you should be able to get the most out of all our models in both FDM and Resin printing. Thanks to this technology you will be playing in no time, we have also taken care to add all the necessary accessories (such as dials, counters and tokens) needed to get the full experience we hope to achieve once the mass manufactured game is launched. \nWe strive for perfection and will update files and rules to make this game better every time we update it.\n\nPLAY\n\nThis project is meant for personal use only, this means that the files cannot be sold, distributed or shared. However a commercial license will be available at an extra cost afterwards with LAIR (for which you can read more about further down on this campaign) or another platform we decide to use. \nPersonal Use\nPersonal use means you can print as many pieces as you want as long as they are for you or a gift free of charge to close people. \nYou should not distribute or sell the files. Using portions of them and publishing as new content is not allowed.\nYou can cut/resize the files to fit better your printer but you can't share those derivatives.\nYou can't make cast/molds of my models, any kind of mass production is prohibited.\nThe files cannot be used in any other project or crowdfunding platform.\nYou can, of course, take photos, make live streams and video with the models but please give credit to Dragonbond.\nAll copyright belongs to Draco Gaming Inc, no rights are assigned or transferred to the end-user.

For the tabletop miniature wargame in particular, development of a campaign mode and Companion App is considered to take place in 2021.\nThis companion app will allow you to have the Lore from Dragonbond directly on your phone, offer a smooth experience for army building, and keeping track of your games and campaigns. While this app is not a reward of this Kickstarter, we want you to know about it.

First one was Legendary Dragons 3D and while we had some set backs with deploying our pledge manager, we finished Stretch Goals earlier than expected and fulfilled in advance. Everything's on track for fulfillment of the last rewards of that campaign and most backers have received their STL files.\n\nWe can refund you within 7 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (around 15%). This policy lasts until the time when we send surveys in our pledge manager, after that point no refunds are possible. If we realise a component cannot be delivered after many months of trying, we refund the cost for that particular item completely, including fees.\n\nThis is a transparent campaign; any and all issues are stated in our project updates \u2013 which are regularly posted after the campaign is funded\u2014 at least once per month. We are so committed to publishing our products with the best quality, that we put money from our pockets if needed in case of any undesirable events.\n\nLair intends to have its own pledge management system and we will make sure you have a smooth process for selecting add-ons and downloading your files there. Please answer your surveys before the indicated deadline to receive your rewards at the promised time. Otherwise, any rewards might be sent on a second wave of deliveries.\n\nAny Kickstarter Exclusives are available by us only on active Kickstarter campaigns and special events such as gaming conventions.

The portal, called a Crossing, takes you to a world you thought only existed in novels and films: a magical land where dragons roam the skies, orcs and hobgoblins terrorize weary travelers, and unicorns prance through the forest. It is a world where humans join other peoples such as elves, trolls, dwarves, changelings, and the dreaded creatures who steal the night. It is a world of fantasy \u2014 of imagination.\nIt is the Realm.\nIt is Legendlore.\nDrawn from The Realm and Legendlore comics, the Legendlore RPG will whisk characters from our world to a magical fantasy realm filled with dragons, orcs, unicorns, and hobgoblins. With over 60 comics published covering three volume runs, The Realm and Legendlore combined became one of Caliber Comics' most critically acclaimed series.\nIn the Legendlore RPG, players can choose to play as themselves or create a new character employing the 5th Edition Fantasy Rules System.\nTired of being stuck at home? Are you ready for a magical adventure? Here's your chance to find a Crossing and have some adventure in The Realm!\nArt by Gong Studios\nLegendlore was originally a comic called The Realm, first published by Arrow Comics in 1986 and since procured by Caliber Comics, about four people who fall through a Crossing into the Realm. The Realm is home to fantasy creatures from elves to dragons, and the characters discover they too have \u2018fantasy powers\u2019 \u2013 the jock becomes a Fighter, while the bookish one becomes a Wizard, and so on. They go on adventures and some of them eventually find their way back to Earth.\nThis is the basic premise of the Legendlore RPG. You cross into the Realm, where you become a hairfoot Bard, or maybe an elven Sorcerer. You can change any characteristics you like. For example if you have hay fever and glasses, you choose if your Legendlore self keeps or drops those. Your identity might not always match your outward physique, but your Legendlore character does. We've also updated the 1980s setting so Realmborn characters represent all ethnicities, genders, and sexualities. No one in the Realm will bat an eyelash at your agender panromantic self.\nYou are not the first from Earth to encounter the nations of the Realm. The Realm has had Visitors before, and each time these Visitors left something with the Realm: whether it be a new word, or even accidental technology. Some Visitors became stranded and formed their own communities out of an immediate need for survival. These communities can still be found in the Realm, though they tend to be pockets of isolation and have their own customs and concerns even if they are within the boundaries of other nations. Sharp-eyed Visitors may recognize aspects of their world turned into phenomena: in the depths of a forest, they may encounter a glider plane abandoned with vines anchoring it to the soil, its metal rusting, its markings faded under a strange sun its paint was never meant to withstand. These phenomena are considered Strange Things throughout the Realm.\nJust as Earth had impacts on the Realm, the Realm can change a Visitor from Earth. Legends are the destinies Visitors may have when Crossing into the Realm: it is part of their Crossing, part of their destiny.\nEach character has their own Legend, which affects the story and is built up through relatively minor actions as well as through more obviously weighty choices. Legends are things like \u201cAvatar of Peace\u201d or \u201cRegent of Dragons\u201d or \u201cHeir to the Mountain\u201d: they represent the destiny of You (your character) and mechanically can resemble backgrounds. Perhaps the You you want to be in the Realm is trying to not spread any more violence than absolutely necessary for self-defense. As a Player, you might want their destiny to reflect that commitment to peaceful solutions and to avoid continuing cycles of revenge and violence: thus the \u201cAvatar of Peace\u201d Legend. The seeds of that legend are there, but how does that affect You throughout Your adventures in the Realm?\nCurious to hear what a session may sound like? Click HERE to crossover to an Actual Play recording, where three roleplayers are teleported into the Realm, where they must try to find a way home. Hitching a ride thrusts them straight into a missing person\u2019s case, but all is not what it seems. \u2018Into the Realm\u2019 is an introduction to Legendlore, and used as an example of a campaign opening.\nThe Legendlore RPG setting is currently available as a \"Rough Draft\" text-only PDF file from DriveThruRPG.com. We want to take the next steps to turn this into fully-illustrated, beautifully laid out PDF sourcebook that befits the legacy of this setting.\nWe also want to take it a step further - creating an 8.5\" x 11\" hardcover with a beautifully designed, striking cover image printed in four color gloss, with  more than 200 full-color pages and endpapers on high-quality paper stock. Exceptional funding may allow us to add Stretch Goals that further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play, We also want to get at least one print run into traditional distribution and available for sale at game and hobby stores.\nThe Legendlore RPG uses rules based on the 5th Edition of the world's most popular fantasy tabletop RPG system, and comprises three sections (Player, Setting, Game Master) including an introductory adventure!\nDuring this campaign, we will feature spotlight previews of various sections to highlight the different aspects of The Realm and the Legendlore setting. You can download the entire rough manuscript for free from DriveThruRPG.com now!\nThe primary goal of this Kickstarter campaign is to create the best version of the Legendlore RPG possible. Your support allows us to fund the best production, use the most appropriate components, and possibly even contract more art for the core book. We hope to not only deliver a beautiful book to all of our backers but, as noted, also fund at least one print run to be sold through distribution and into book and hobby stores that are so vital to our community.\nBeyond that main goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of Legendlore, possibly expanding into rules companions and other Game Master and player tools and accessories. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our fantasy family.\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target ($15,000), then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick to summon a larger version of this chart.\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nCore Reward Decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only to get the finished, illustrated PDF version (Digital Traveler and First time Traveler Reward Tiers), or go all in with the hardcover (Traveler to the Realm Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Purveyor of Books and Librarian of Isliadril Reward Tiers, which offer 2 or 5 copies respectively as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Legendlore RPG campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Olardellian Trader) will get 5 copies of the Legendlore RPG rulebook (as well as the finished PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE insert which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Legendlore setting or a possible future supplement. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO POST-CAMPAIGN PLEDGE MANAGER \u2013 After this campaign ends, we'll begin the next phase and interaction will occur via BackerKit (see Pledge Manager, below). In the Pledge Manager, you'll be able to upgrade your pledge (should you later decide to switch to the hardcover book), as well as selecting Add On Rewards and confirming your shipping information.\nPDF VERSION - The fully-illustrated and complete digital version of the Legendlore RPG, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. Those participating in our Pledge Manager will receive a redemption link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial \"Backer Version\" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nHARDCOVER VERSION - The ultimate goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful hardcover edition of the game. Note that all Reward Tiers that include the hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Kickstarter, based on your delivery location.\nOPTIONAL \"NEAR COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For the Legendlore RPG, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG\u2019s Print-on-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nFor only +$20, Add On an additional PDF copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list.\nFor only +$10, Add On a PDF copy of the Scarred Lands Player's Guide (5E) to your rewards list. While unrelated to Legendlore, the Scarred Lands setting is another excellent 5E product from Onyx Path ready to add to your digital gaming collection.\nLegendlore started as a comic book, and now our partners at Caliber Comics have made the graphic novels available to the Legendlore RPG kickstarter backers as Add On rewards, to be fulfilled by DriveThruComics.com.\nLegendlore V1 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 1-5; 153 pages.\nLegendlore V2 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 6-7, and the Tales of the Realm mini-series that depicted Lord Darkoth\u2019s assault on the Rainbow Elf Kingdom; 180 pages.\nLegendlore V3 - The Realm Chronicles Graphic Novel PDF collects The Realm \u2013 Volume One issues 8-11; 138 pages.\n PHYSICAL REWARDS \nAll physical items that will require shipping (additional books, screens) can only be added to reward tiers that already include a hardcover copy ofthe Legendlore RPG (Reward Tiers of $50+). Your rewards will be sent in a single shipment when the book becomes available.\nFor only +$20, Add On a sturdy, three-panel screen featuring a collage of Legendlore art on the outer side, and a selection of charts and other reference info on the inside to make running a Legendlore game session a little bit easier.\nFor only +$45, add an additional hardcover copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list. U.S. Residents only.\nFor only +$65, add an additional hardcover copy of the Legendlore RPG to your rewards list. Non-U.S. Residents only.\nFor only +$30, Add On a hardcover copy of the Scarred Lands Player's Guide (5E) to your rewards list. This reward will be sent at alongside your Legendlore RPG hardcover when that reward is complete and ready to go. To add this option on to your rewards list, your reward tier must include a hardcover copy (and, therefore, any additional shipping charges) of the Legendlore RPG (so, reward tiers of $50+).\nAs we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we\u2019re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add a project to the reward list. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement\nACHIEVED! - At $20,000 in funding - Legendlore RPG GM Reference Screen \u2014 We\u2019ll create a Legendlore RPG Reference Screen, which can be added on to any reward tier containing a hardcover book for only +$20.\nACHIEVED! - At $23,000 in funding - Legendlore Player\u2019s Companion: Brought From Earth\u2014 Help us fund a Player\u2019s Companion for the Legendlore RPG. This PDF supplement would feature new and expanded Crossings, Legends, and Strange Things. All backers receiving the Legendlore RPG PDF will automatically have the Player\u2019s Companion PDF added to their rewards list.\nACHIEVED! - AT $25,000 in funding - Digital Wallpaper: An awesome digital wallpaper for your computer desktop featuring art from the Legendlore RPG. All backers will have this automatically added to their rewards list.\nAt $27,000 in funding - Legendlore Player\u2019s Companion: Friends and Foes \u2014 Help us expand the Player\u2019s Companion for the Legendlore RPG. The Player's Companion would grow and feature expanded information (including stat blocks) for important NPCs found in the Realm.\nWhen you pledge to a reward tier that includes a physical item (the Legendlore RPG hardcover rulebook), Kickstarter will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location.\nUnfortunately, international shipping has become increasing expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to  keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $30 First time Traveler reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from DriveThruRPG once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nWait and buy the physical book via your local/preferred game store when it hits distribution.\nBetter yet, contact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill. You can even encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (Olardellian Trader) for this campaign.\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nPledge to the campaign at the $25 Digital Traveler reward tier, and have access to the BackerKit Pledge Manager, where you can upgrade to the hardcover reward tier should your circumstances change.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for the LegendLore RPG is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path.

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal or Stripe. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more promo goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic pledge, with 1 or 3 comics and their related promos. Estimates for 2 comics will fall in the price range between the 1-3 estimates. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates. If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Afghanistan. \nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends. Keep in mind these are just estimates, and the timeline may vary due to circumstances.  \nTo learn about Retail Pledges click HERE.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our 44th Kickstarter, and there are some vagaries in terms of timing when it comes to anything produced in China, such as:\nProduction delays\nShipping delays\nCustoms delays \n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is February 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days). However, if we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card. This project is being funded in USD and any refunds processed will be in USD for the exact amount received in USD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 8 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\n\nTo make sure you have the best gaming experience, all CMON products are warrantied against manufacturing defects for 2 years from the of date purchase from CMON (proof of purchase required).

It builds on the tense, cinematic experience Nemesis is known for, adding even more opportunities for emergent, dramatic gameplay. Become an unlikely survivor, locked in an underground base with something terrifying. Turn up your paranoia, as you try to guess what other players are up to, or what the contingency plan is. Work to learn the weaknesses of your nemesis \u2013 or run like hell. Switch off the lights in someone\u2019s lab section. Take a dangerous trek to the outside bunker. And whatever you do, be ready for unexpected!\nThe game comes with all the components needed for a cinematic Sci-Fi horror experience and doesn't require the Nemesis Core Box.\nNemesis: Lockdown offers 1-5 player semi or full co-op experience that takes around  90-120 minutes and will be different every run! This stand-alone expansion also works with majority of the previous Nemesis content: other Alien races and most of the characters. \nDuring this campaign you can also get classic Nemesis Core Box (only in English) and all the previous expansion (in 6 different Languages)! \n\nClick for more info!\n\n\nNemesis Lockdown previews \nNemesis Core Box\nNemesis: Lockdown setting\nI should have known when they asked us to prepare the landing platform. There are only two reasons to make a night sample transfer. It\u2019s either too urgent to wait, or it\u2019s a black op. Both spell trouble.\nMy survival instinct, honed by twenty years of work in the Sample-Return Receiving Facilities, was screaming, considering the rumours that reached even our remote site.\nMaybe if I bailed right there, I wouldn\u2019t be crouching in a dark lab, sweaty palms clutching a scalpel, and this damned soft voice repeating over my head: \u201cContainment Breach, Containment Breach\u2026\u201d\nThings only got bleaker when they told us there would be human BSL-5-ET subjects coming. Extra-terrestrial samples and living people don\u2019t usually mix. They SHOULD NEVER mix. Something went really bad out there, and we got caught in it.\nWhen Martinsen and Sovich processed the first sample, I only caught a peek from behind the armored glass. There was one word on the container.\n\u201cNemesis.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t there when the actual breach happened. There were screams over the intercom. The main power went out. Soon, I saw Martinsen and one of the human subjects running to me from the isolation ward elevator, as if the devil himself chased them. I\u2019ve seen it for a split second, before they were caught. I\u2019d rather take my chances with the devil, than with the thing that took them.\nNow, it\u2019s been fifteen minutes since I last heard any shots. The pain in my mangled leg subsides. I get up and slowly make my way to one of the security stations. Am I the only one left? No, thank god! Sovich is still kicking. I have her on a live feed from the main terminal. She\u2019s\u2026\nChanging the logs! Switching her name for mine. Frigging rat! When the board learns we had a containment breach, there will be hell to pay, and she wants to make sure the bill is on my name.\nNow, she turns towards the main console. In the middle of it, under the protective glass, is the A3-5 button, a big chunk of red plastic. They told us it enables the \u201cCode Red Emergency Protocol\u201d but we had no clearance to know what the protocol actually is.\nDon\u2019t do it, Sovich. You might just nuke us. Don\u2019t\u2026\nOf course she does. She wants to play the good girl, an upstanding citizen.\nWell, there\u2019s still time to fix everything. No one will call until morning. We\u2019re on a dark side of the planet now, blocking all signals. I need to get topside, to the secondary console in the other building. Re-write the logs, access the classified procedures, and see what new trouble she got us into.\nThe only things between me and my salvation is a broken airlock, a long stretch of hellish surface, and enough gamma radiation to hard-boil an egg. I\u2019m betting these things can\u2019t walk outside.\nThat would be too frigging unfair...\nGameplay details\nThis time, you are trapped inside the laboratory hidden somewhere on Mars. This construction has several floors you will be able to travel through via elevators or stairs.\nEach section of the board will have a separate power supply that can be cut off at any second. When that happens, elevators stop working, and the corridors sink into pitch-black darkness. This offers an interesting way to slow down the alien pursuit \u2026 or to trap other players.\nMovement and space management has a very different, tenser feel in Lockdown!\nLockdown will come with an entirely new mechanic called the \u201cContingency Order.\u201d It represents one of many possible emergency plans (such as \u201cnuke the station\u201d ). The only way to discover which one is active is through investigation and elimination.\nObviously, it\u2019s up to you whether you\u2019re going to share your hard-earned knowledge with other players.\nHaving a detailed energy system for different sectors of the board allowed us to put more emphasis on the light \u2013 or the lack of it. This makes room for more interactions between players and makes controlling the flow of energy through different sections one of the important elements of the game.\nThere are also items that are a source of light, but they won't last long and will require energy. You may always decide to go through the darkness, but this will make card Events more dangerous and incurs other penalties, such as using different (less accurate) die for shooting.\nLockdown comes with a set of new, freshly designed rooms that thematically reflect a secret base on the surface of Mars. It also contains a whole new set of neutral items, character-specific items, and craftable items.\nIn our previous campaign, we loved the experience of working with the community to create a new alien race, or to determine the look and professions of the crew members. This led us down a very creative path, and brought amazing, diverse ideas into the game!\nWith Lockdown, we want to follow up on this experience. In this Kickstarter campaign, you will not only be buying a game, but you'll take part in its creation too!\nNemesis Lockdown comes with high quality, non-essential companion app. It will provide many exciting gameplay modes, a dedicated soundtrack, as well as support for an advanced solo mode.\nThanks to the app, we bring new depth to solo play that will now include the \"traitor\" tension from semi-cooperative games, as you will never know if you can trust what the app tells you.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded nine Kickstarter projects.

Later his younger brother Ricky would pick up the mantel. For  175 issues it is one of the longest running OEL(Original English Language) manga to exist and has  influenced many.

As science and technology draw humanity closer than ever before, certain factions within the masses display gross negligence, undermining the union's work and endangering the world for short-sighted gains. Despite global telecommunications, new frontiers in virtually every field of study, and an understanding of the universe only dreamed of by earlier generations, humanity faces threats on all sides. \nCan you save it?\nClimate change threatens to destroy life as we know it. Religious fundamentalism breeds terror around the globe. Diseases, once eradicated from the developed world through vaccination, have returned due to anti-vaxxer movements. Totalitarian nationalist governments rise, as the masses succumb to fear of the other.\nThe world stands on the brink of destruction, and it is up to the agents and operatives of the Technocratic Union to save it or be its ultimate downfall.  \nTechnocracy Reloaded peels back the curtain and examines the role of the Technocracy in Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. The various future fates presented in Mage 20 are examined, and this book introduces a few of its own.  \nWithin this book you will also find a detailed look at life within the Technocracy; expanded information on the conventions; a wealth of equipment, adjustments, and procedures; a breakdown of the various shadow conspiracies and factions within the Technocratic Union; and tips for running your own Technocracy chronicle. \nArtwork by Michael Gaydos\nTechnocracy Reloaded brings the final playable faction of the Ascension War into Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. The Technocratic Union has historically been presented in various ways. Its members have been shown as the villains of the Ascension War, misguided willworkers seeking to keep humanity safe through control and manipulation, shadowy masters of modern reality, and as heroes forming the only line of defense against unspeakable horrors that seek to destroy all that is. Each of these perspectives is true, from a certain point of view. \nArtwork by Aaron Acevedo\nTechnocracy Reloaded gives the Storyteller all the tools needed to explore these viewpoints and more while incorporating the Technocratic Union into their Mage 20 game. Technocracy Reloaded provides tools and resources to equip and portray the Technocratic Union as antagonists in a Mage 20 game, or to allow the players to step into the role of Technocrats, with the full support of the Union and its immeasurable resources at their fingertips.\nThis Technocracy Reloaded Kickstarter campaign is designed to enable us to create a deluxe hardcover edition of this supplement, designed to match the look and feel of our other 20th Anniversary Editions, and specifically the Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. \nWe want to create a deluxe edition with a leatherette cover featuring the title of the book on the spine, 200+ full color interior pages, and a silk ribbon bookmark. The cover will featured an embossed image of the Technocracy symbol. Exceptional funding will allow us to further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play.\nDesign Not Final\nThe Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Technocracy Reloaded.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nTechnocracy Reloaded features all of the rules options necessary to create and play a Technocratic Union operative within the Mage 20 world. The final book will contain the following chapters:\nUnit 1: The Operative's Handbook provides a detailed overview of life in the Technocratic Union, describing the organization of the Union, the Conventions, and the roles that sympathizers, extraordinary citizens, and Enlightened Operatives play in the overall structure of the Technocracy.\nUnit 2: Targets, Assets, Tactics, and Plans provides a thorough exploration of the operational procedures and standard models used by the Technocracy around the globe and beyond in order to protect the consensus, contain and eliminate Reality Deviance, and bring the world closer to the Union's ultimate goal of Ascension.\nUnit 3: Theaters of Operation examines current Technocratic initiatives on the Front Lines. New initiatives are introduced, old procedures are expanded and clarified, and the Union's global goals are parsed out in localized segments, giving the Storyteller the tools to craft Technocratic tales anywhere in the world.\nUnit 4: Internal Matters provides a detailed view of every aspect of life among the Technocracy. Operatives at all levels of indoctrination and from every imaginable origin are discussed. From Enlightenment, to marriage and child-rearing, to interactions with one's old life, every element of a Technocrat's daily existence is granted meticulous attention. Factions within the Union are also discussed here, including secret cabals with ulterior motives, cross-convention initiatives working together to build a better world, and the Conventions themselves all receive detailed and updated write-ups in this chapter.\nUnit 5: Q Division details the devices, procedures, and hypertech used by the Technocratic Union in all operations great and small. New cutting edge equipment is introduced and old favorites are modernized for compatibility with Mage 20. The Enlightened Science behind these various gadgets and gizmos is also revealed, allowing operatives to apply similar effects in the field, if they have sufficient understanding of the principles that allow these gadgets to function.\nUnit 6: Human Resources provides a comprehensive roster of Extraordinary citizens, cyborgs, operatives, progenitor creations, and allies to populate a Technocracy Reloaded Chronicle.\nUnit 7: Mission Control is a complete guide to Storytelling for the Technocratic Union. A number of story seeds, tips and tricks are provided to ensure that the Storyteller can capture the feel of the Technocracy.\nUnit 8:The Parallax View takes a deep dive into metaplot options, discussing every significant Future Fate that affects the Technocratic Union. Options are provided for incorporating, ignoring, or subverting these metaplot options, and entire new metaplot options are introduced. The tools in this chapter permit the Storyteller and players to shape the Union to their own vision, giving you everything you need to carry your Technocracy Reloaded game into the past, present, or future.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\n\nThe manuscript is written, awesome artists are being contracted, and layout templates are being built. An amazing digital PDF product will be created with this material. With your help we will be able to take it a step further and produce a deluxe hardcover version of Technocracy Reloaded for Mage 20 fans and collectors. The main goal and primary focus of this Kickstarter campaign is the creation of this limited-edition book.\nBeyond that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of the world of the Technocracy, possibly expanding into Storyteller and player tools and accessories, as well as a possible rules companion. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.\nBeyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done \u2014 build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a powerful binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our own secret cabal.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nAll participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. If the campaign meets the funding target, then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your pledge will only be collected if we achieve our funding target.\nIn thanks for your support, we offer rewards based on your level of funding pledged. The Reward Tiers down the right side of the page outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.\nClick here to summon a larger version of this chart\n\nTo help simplify matters, the Reward Chart lists the core reward combinations, as well as the multi-copy tiers and special limited and premium reward tiers. (see Reward Descriptions, below).\nFirst decision: Do you save some shelf space and go digital-only with the PDF version (Extraordinary Citizen and Operative Reward Tiers), or go all in with the deluxe hardcover (Agent Reward Tier)?  Please note that physical rewards may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses \u2014 see Fulfillment & Shipping, below.\nArtwork by Aaron Acevedo\nBackers looking to receive multiple copies should also note the Supervisor Reward Tier, which offers 2 copies as part of the rewards (and may save on shipping per unit!).\nFinally, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don\u2019t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Technocracy Reloaded campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Any retailer who pledges at the Retailer Reward Tier level (Manager) will get 5 copies of the Technocracy Reloaded deluxe hardcover book (as well as the PDF versions)  at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.\nArtwork by Michael Gaydos\nIn addition, a few Reward Tiers offer special limited or premium rewards in addition to the basics, including everything from a BOOK PLATE which will be signed by as many of the creative team as we can wrangle, an option to act as a ART MODEL, as well as a chance to NAME an NPC included in the Technocracy Reloaded setting or a possible future supplement. We also have a limited supply of deluxe hardcover copies of the Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition included in our Deluxe Archivist reward tier. Check each of the Reward Tier descriptions for more details.\nACCESS TO MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW UPDATES \u2013 During the course of the campaign, we will be posting the ENTIRE manuscript for Technocracy Reloaded. These previews will be shared via Backer-Only updates. You must be a backer of this project to receive these updates.\nTECHNOCRACY RELOADED PDF VERSION - The digital version of Technocracy Reloaded, fulfilled by our partners at StorytellersVault.com. Kickstarter backers will receive a reception link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public.

When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your Storytellers Vault and DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.\nMAGE: THE ASCENSION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION PDF - Available from our partners at Storytellers Vault, The M20 rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Technocracy Reloaded. \nTECHNOCRACY RELOADED DELUXE HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful deluxe edition of the game.

All physical rewards will be delivered in one shipment, when the final Technocracy Reloaded deluxe hardcover is completed and distributed to backers.\nOPTIONAL \"AT COST\" PoD VERSION \u2013  For Technocracy Reloaded, you will have the option of using StorytellersVault.com\u2019s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at as close as we can get to the cost of printing and shipping (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your pledge to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from StorytellersVault.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your pledge rewards.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS\nIn addition to the rewards listed in each Reward Tier, backers can increase their overall pledge to add on the following additional rewards. Simply increase your total pledge amount by the value indicated \u2013 we will confirm which add on rewards you\u2019ve chosen via BackerKit surveys after the campaign has run (see Pledge Manager, below).\nNote - these PDF files are the current versions offered by DTRPG.

Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nIf you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:\nPledge to the campaign at the $35 OPERATIVE or $60 DIGITAL ARCHIVIST reward tier to get the PDF version plus a redemption code to purchase the print-on-demand version of the book at a discounted cost (plus shipping) from Storytellers Vault once it's available (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).\nPledge to the campaign at the $5 SYMPATHIZER reward tier to get access to the Kickstarter preview manuscript. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.\nContact your local game store and make sure you're put on a preorder list so they know there's demand for the game that they're being asked to fill, and then encourage them to back at the Retailer Tier (MANAGER) for this campaign!\nLook into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.\nArtwork by Sam Denmark\nAfter the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the backers to set up their rewards via survey. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your reward selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign does not count toward any campaign Stretch Goals, however.\nArtwork by Andy Hepworth\nOnyx Path Publishing has managed more than 40 Kickstarter projects, and the company has learned how to focus during a campaign to maintain manageable projects and achievable goals. To read more about the knowledge that has been applied to this project, you can read the FAQ linked here: http://theonyxpath.com/about/faq/kickstarter/", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nRisk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.\n\nSolution: We have successfully shipped many Kickstarter projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each KS. The text for Technocracy Reloaded is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.\n\nRisk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.\n\nSolution: Kickstarter shipping costs have continued to rise this last year, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.\n\nRisk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.\n\nSolution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous Kickstarters and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a KS project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several KS projects several months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards earlier than estimated.\n\nThat being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Kickstarter as well as in our regular, weekly, Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com\n\nADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS\n\nBy backing this Kickstarter project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:\n\nARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.\n\nREWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.\n\nADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Kickstarter and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we\u2019ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.\n\nDIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support":

We will collect this via our pledge manager after the campaign ends, using PayPal. This is so we can be fair to all our backers as shipping is rarely one size fits all, and also give you more stretch goodies and possibly a choice of carrier options.\nWe will ship your rewards at our cost to our international hubs. Depending on where in the world you are, we will either ship to you from our hub in the EU (EU/UK backers), China (Asia backers), Singapore (Singaporean backers), Canada (Canadian backers), Australia (Australia and New Zealand backers) or Atlanta (USA and the rest of the world). Following is a list of rough estimates for shipping a basic Faithful pledge. Keep in mind these are just estimates and that accurate costs will be calculated in the pledge manager system according to your address. Also keep in mind that costs will likely rise based on optional buys you choose. \n*** For backers in China, please read this update.\n*Latin America, Africa, and ROW estimates are based on USPS rates.  If USPS is not available, these rates may change.\nUnfortunately, different import laws and customs have made it impossible for CMON to ship games to certain specific countries.\nWE DO NOT SHIP TO: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Afghanistan.\nBe aware that any pledges that are confirmed after the pledge manager deadline is considered a \"Late Confirm\" and will be shipped from the USA hub at a later date. For non-US backers, that will likely incur increased shipping costs. Also, note that Late Confirms will not be able to customize the contents of their pledge. They will be offered a single pledge, including most, if not all, Kickstarter Exclusive Optional Buys. We also cannot ship to PO Boxes domestically or internationally. Due to the size of each package there is too great a risk of the package being bounced back to us.\nThe table below gives you a general idea of the full schedule of what to expect once the campaign ends.

Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of no questions asked, though that\u2019s minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back from them after 14 days).

However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 8 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays.

Let\u2019s take a brief look at setup and each of the four pillars now.  \nSetup\nIf this is your first time playing, open the scenario book and follow the directions to setup your first pilot and ship. Take a player board, Modifier deck, Pilot mat, progression sheet, Ship mat, and both pilot and ship miniatures. Choose your starting equipment from you current unlocked equipment. You are now ready for your next mission!\nSpace Exploration\nThe Sparrow travels across the Draconian System in search of a home. Manage your ship\u2019s resources as you explore new regions of space and embark on missions fighting to survive through the unknown. Even if you are out of resources you can continue exploring, but you risk starting your next encounter at a disadvantage.\n  Space Combat\nYou and your squad will launch from the hangars of The Sparrow to battle against various enemies throughout your journey in Stars of Akarios. Thankfully you are equipped with the latest ships powered by modern thrusters and advanced weaponry. Assign your action dice to various attacks and maneuvers as you fight your way to victory. Space Combat is the main component of Stars of Akarios gameplay.\n  World Exploration\nDuring your adventures across the Draconian system in Stars of Akarios, you will need to leave your fighters to explore hostile worlds and ships. World Exploration is discovery-focused, putting your cunning to the test as you seek new home for your civilization. Use your pilots skills to complete the challenges you encounter in the limited time available,\n  Pilot & Ship Customization\nYour Pilot's skills will grow as you test your grit against the enemies in Stars of Akarios. Upgrade you characters unique abilities and skill trees, allowing you to customize your play experience. But what\u2019s a pilot without a ship? Equip your ship with various engine, weapons and technology components for virtually limitless combinations. Re-equip your ships before missions, choosing the best weapon and thruster upgrades for each mission.\n                  Unique End-Game Raid System\nIn each act of the game there is a high-level scenario which combines space combat and world exploration to create a unique experience. These raids require a dedicated squad equipped with the best tech. While a typical scenario would last between 30-60 minutes, raids require 1-2 hours to complete. But it is only in raids that you can find the best equipment and gear for your pilot and ship. These raids are designed to be highly-repayable and are perfect for the squads who want to dig deep in Stars of Akarios. \nEvolving storyline\nThe Story of Stars of Akarios is an evolving narrative which will be shaped by your decisions. Early on in the story you will be faced with decisions which will impact the remainder of your campaign. Each playthrough of Stars of Akarios will feel unique as your choices and squad morality will open/close potential story paths and create unique endings for your group.\nDual-Layered Goodness\nWe have taken cues from the video game world and designed intuitive user-interfaces for the players and enemies. The player boards and enemy card holders allow you to see the status of ships, combat effects and special abilities without flipping through a rulebook. Each of these boards are dual-layered to provide great functionality while guarding against those erratic table-knockers!\nEasy Setup and Teardown\nYour time is valuable and we want to honor it. We are working closely with Game Trayz to provide an optimal storage solution for quick setup and tear-down. Probably the single greatest factor to creating ease of setup is our dedication to removing unnecessary tokens. You will have noticed that we do not advertise \u201c300+ tokens\u201d with Stars of Akarios. It\u2019s not because our game does not have complexity or status effects, we have just found a way to track all of that with our dual-layered boards using universal cubes. No more digging into the bottom of your box to find that one \u201cstun\u201d token.\nDirection-Based Space Combat\nTaking cues from great games such as X-Wing, Stars of Akarios strives to create intense \u201cdog-fights\u201d in space. Enemies respond dynamically to your actions and you must always be thinking about the direction your ship faces. All movement in Stars of Akarios is direction-based and most of your attacks will be too! This means you are going to have to plan how to flank your enemies to get an advantaged attack from behind.\nLeave Your Ship and Explore New Worlds\nOne of our team\u2019s favorite parts of Stars of Akarios is the ability to step off of our ships and explore new worlds in what we call \u201cWorld Exploration\u201d (AKA away missions). The blending of dungeon-crawling esque game-play mechanics in Space Combat with exploration and discovery-focused in World Exploration is an ambitious next-step for what a board game can be. Tie this all together with the meta-experience of controlling The Sparrow in the quest for a new home and you have an epic sci-fi experience.\n                    This project is promoted by Green Inbox\n ", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nFUNDING: We need your help to make Starlight a reality! Only if we hit our funding goal by the end of the campaign will we be able to do this!\n\nSHIPPING: Shipping is charged after the campaign in our Pledgemanager. Shipping will need to be paid in full prior to the close of our Pledgemager. We will be keeping the Pledgemanager open for an extended period to assist those who may need more time to pay the shipping.\n\nDESIGN: While the core mechanics are set and the campaign planned out, there is still a lot of writing and final balancing to occur. How much is based on what all will be included in the final game.\n\nMANUFACTURE: is being handled by Longpack Games, but international shipping always has the potential for delays and complications. Unexpected delays often happen due to; Production delays, Shipping delays, or Customs delays.\n\nCOMMUNICATION: Inevitably, something will occur during the entire process that we were unable to foresee. If things run behind schedule, we think the best approach is to always be up front and communicative with backers. It's our goal to make post-campaign updates part of this experience and we plan to update bi-weekly until production has begun in order to keep backers informed of the progress. We're going to do our best to keep these updates fun for everyone, so join us to follow along!\n\nThe estimated delivery date for this project is August 2021, but keep in mind this is only an estimate. Also, due to the logistics of international shipping, backers in different regions of the world may receive their rewards sooner than others.\n\nWe've done our best to minimize this as much as possible, and we are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game can't be delivered at all.\n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nWe can refund you within 14 days of the campaign\u2019s end, fees included. After that, we have a policy of refunding no questions asked minus Kickstarter and payment processing fees (which we can\u2019t get back after 14 days). If however we\u2019ve begun packaging your pledge for shipment, no refunds are possible. If a component cannot be delivered AT ALL, we refund that completely, including fees.\n\nAll refunds after the 14 days close of the campaign may be processed via PayPal or reversed via Stripe to your credit card at our discretion. Refunds within 14 days are reversed via Stripe to your credit card.\n\nThis project is being funded in CAD and any refunds processed will be in CAD for the exact amount received in CAD, excluding any applicable fees depending on the time of the refund being processed.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nBy pledging to this project, you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards (and the project) are subject to change and may differ substantially from what is presented while the Kickstarter project was active.\n\nThis campaign occurs using Canadian currency (CAD). Any other currency values shown throughout the campaign are estimates at the time of campaigns launch. Other currency values may differ at the conclusion of the Kickstarter based on market fluctuation. Final charges will be based on each currencies exchange rate to CAD at the time of payment processing.\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge within 12 weeks of our notification via email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after the 12 week window has elapsed. Unconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics, and in the past have led to project delays. For this project we do not intend to allow this to happen, which may mean if you confirm your pledge too late, exclusive items may not be produced in sufficient quantity for your pledge.\n\nIf you confirm your pledge within 12 weeks of our notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. We regret we are unable to ship to PO Boxes.\n\nAll backers that have selected \u201cNo Reward\u201d on Kickstarter, that wish to receive a reward for this campaign, must make sure to confirm their order by the Pledge Manager Deadline. We will announce the date for this once the Pledge Manager becomes live. All \u201cNo Reward\u201d pledges will be treated as donations once the Pledge Manager Deadline has passed.\n\nIf you do not accept these terms please do not pledge on this project, but instead wait for the retail release.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge CA$ 1 or more", "title": "Follow Along & Retailer Pledge", "descp": "Follow along with the Starlight Campaign!

Crusaders, charge!\n\n       As you may know, we at Owlcat Games have spent countless hours playing the Pathfinder tabletop RPG. We enjoyed it so much that we decided to bring this experience to the videogame format by creating a classic isometric party-based computer RPG called Pathfinder: Kingmaker. The phenomenal love and support shown for Kingmaker have inspired us to tell another story from the Age of Lost Omens. Today we are thrilled to introduce the adventure we are so passionate and excited about \u2013 Wrath of the Righteous!\nEmbark on a journey to a realm overrun by demons and rise to power by choosing one of six available Mythic Paths. Master their abilities and change the world around you as an Angel, a Lich, a Trickster, an Aeon, a Demon, or an Azata. Each Mythic Path leads to unique skills and appearance, and greatly impacts the game\u2019s story.\nChallenge the mighty Demon Lords and close the portal to the demonic plane of existence known as the Abyss.  \n    Enjoy the flexibility, richness, and depth of the Pathfinder first edition ruleset. Create any character imaginable by choosing one of ten races, picking a particular class out of the 21 available, each with five archetypes for even greater customization. Gain access to more than a thousand spells, feats, and abilities, and select those that suit your playstyle. Take control of your party formation, help set up a camp, and find a way to victory by combining the strengths of your companions.\nLead the armies of the Fifth Crusade to victory in a new strategic layer of gameplay. In addition to the classic CRPG experience, step into the role of the Commander, gather troops, reinforce your stronghold, and send your armies to battle the demonic invasion across the map of the region. Send your crusaders to explore ancient ruins and recover powerful artifacts.\nExperience a non-linear story about the cost of tremendous power that adventurers often seek, with tales of corruption caused by the demonic influence and redemption for those who have stepped on the wrong path.\n  Meet a new diverse cast of characters, including ten companions to recruit to your party and featuring multiple romance options to choose from.\nTake control of five new classes (Arcanist, Bloodrager, Shaman, Oracle, and Witch) and meet a new race\u2013the half-undead dhampir\u2013in addition to the previous roster from Pathfinder: Kingmaker. The number of archetypes per class has increased to five as well.\nDive into the game even if you\u2019re not familiar with the intricacies of the Pathfinder ruleset. Use an enhanced tutorial for newcomers to help you with character creation and get up to speed with the rules of the system.\nExplore the world with updated visuals and a 360-degree rotating camera added for better playability and immersion.\n Current platforms: PC Windows (Steam, GOG)\n Current languages: English, French, German, Chinese, Russian, Spanish (funded by reaching a stretch goal)\nMore platforms and languages may be added in the future.  \nWe want our new game to give you the same feeling as good old Pathfinder: Kingmaker Enhanced Edition. If you enjoyed Kingmaker, you will definitely love Wrath of the Righteous as well. \n        While we have enough budget to bring the concept of Wrath of the Righteous to life, we want this game to provide a truly epic experience. The game is built around the idea of a rise to power via one of six different Mythic Paths, each of which will transform the player\u2019s character into a powerful being with special abilities. They will also significantly affect the story branches, change the world around the character, and impact the player\u2019s relationships with companions and NPCs. This idea can be stretched a lot further than our current budget allows.\nIn order to execute our creative vision in the way it deserves, we need your help. This additional budget will allow the team to develop more complex reactions to progressing on a certain path and expand each Mythic Path into a truly unique experience, with exclusive story branches and character abilities that influence the world around you.\nOur Goal of $300,000 will allow us to make Wrath of the Righteous a game of the scale and quality we\u2019ve been dreaming of. \n     We have also come up with some nice extra perks for hitting our Social Goals. These will be made available to all players if unlocked.

All other goals (follower and backer counters) are for the total overall number.\n         The realm of Sarkoris was destroyed when Areelu Vorlesh, a scholar and practitioner of forbidden magics, opened a rift to the abyssal planes of existence, and hordes of demons invaded Golarion. Led by the evil Demon Lords Deskari and Baphomet, the abyssal forces crushed all who stood against them, turning Sarkoris into a demon-infested land now known as the Worldwound. It fell to the neighboring nations to assemble an army capable of withstanding the demonic assault to protect the world from the flames. Thus the Crusades began.\n    The war has been raging for over a hundred years now with little hope of victory. The enemy forces are numerous and their rage is unmatched. Defeat would be certain if not for the Wardstones\u2014the obelisks of divine power placed along the borders of the Worldwound to hold back the invasion. Created under the guidance of Iomedae's herald, they form a protective barrier that prevents the demons from pushing through.\nIt is no wonder that the Wardstones were the demon armies\u2019 first target. Those villainous forces launched a surprise attack on the frontier city of Kenabres, ripping apart its defenses in mere minutes, corrupting the Wardstone housed there, and scattering the crusaders. In the utter chaos of the burning city, one of the crusaders\u2014to their own amazement\u2014discovers a source of power within themselves. While the origin of the power remains unknown, and the form it takes depends on the person, the purpose is clear: this power may be just what the people of the ravaged city need to survive the assault\u2014and to bring the fight to the enemy.\n       The game tells the story of the monumental conflict between mortals and demons, making you a part of a truly epic adventure. You will confront a variety of demonic adversaries, from lowly dretches to the dreadful Demon Lords themselves. To defeat them, your character will be able to claim mythic power and develop it by choosing mythic spells and abilities according to your tactical preferences and character alignment. The choices you make during your adventure will set you on one of six Mythic Paths, opening the ways to becoming a celestial Angel, a ravaging Demon, a powerful Lich, a cunning Trickster, a lawful Aeon, or a rebellious Azata.\n     Mythic Paths are the main feature of Wrath of the Righteous. Mythic character progression was originally introduced by Paizo specifically for this Adventure Path, but our take on it differs from the tabletop version and is adapted to better fit the CRPG both mechanically and narratively. Each path will follow a specific theme, has a profound impact on the main story of the adventure, grants powerful unique abilities, and affects the character\u2019s appearance. You will be able to become one of the following beings:\nThe Angel is a mighty champion of good, leading the Crusade by example. They move across the battlefield on their mighty wings, smiting the demons with a sword of holy flame. Those who are fighting alongside the Angel are certain that they will be protected and healed\u2014and even resurrected in the case of their untimely demise. In times of dire need the Angel can ask Heaven for help and celestial allies will join them in battle.\nThe Lich is an immortal creature, commanding their own army of undead. Even the mightiest adversaries the Lich defeats can be raised as slaves under the Lich\u2019s command. Eventually, this master of undeath and necromancy can even replace their mortal companions with powerful undead minions they create. They master the art of magic\u2014especially necromancy\u2014and wield an armament of unique and especially powerful spells like death realm.\n The Aeon is a cosmic judge of balance\u2014Judge Dredd meets Merlin on a cosmic scale. They can sense where the balance is broken and fix it, often punishing the perpetrator in the process. The cool thing about the Aeon is that they can detect places where the balance was greatly disturbed in the past and travel back in time to fix it. In doing so, they can change their current timeline, usually for the better.\nThe Trickster is a Loki-type character. They are here to have fun and play jokes on even the mightiest creatures. One of their late-game abilities is an understanding that their fate is determined by random chance, like the roll of a die of destiny. Armed with such knowledge, the Trickster can manipulate those die rolls in their favor. Every time the system rolls a natural 1 for them, the Trickster changes it into a natural 20. And players will be able to see it happening before their eyes.\nImpulsive and irrepressible, Demons do as they please with no regard for the opinion of others. The Demon is the epitome of rage; a little push is all that is needed to break their self-control and turn them into a force to be feared\u2014by enemies and friends alike. It is up to the Demon to decide whether to allow the inner beast to take control, or to fight it, chain it, force it into obedience.\nWhen a war has been raging for over a hundred years such as the crusades have, one must be ready to make unexpected moves to achieve victory. Some may claim that Azatas act first and think later, but tell that to the demon hordes, trampled and fleeing in terror from this unstoppable force for good. The Azata trust their instincts and makes spontaneous decisions. They easily befriend those who don't fit well into even rows of the \"official\" crusade, and inspire their allies to fight rather than command them to do so. That makes Azatas the heroes these demon-ravaged lands so dearly need.\nYou also have the option to decline all celestial powers and walk the path of the Legend\u2014\u0430 human capable of great deeds. The acts of a mortal are sometimes more inspiring than those of any deity. Several gods of Golarion were humans before they ascended to godhood, including the crusade\u2019s patron deity, Iomedae. One need not be a mythic creature, an outsider, or one of the goddesses's chosen to become a hero. This path may be a hard one, full of temptation, but the mortal who treads it rightly earns their title: Mythic Legend. \n        We want you to feel the scale of the conflict in Wrath of the Righteous with the Crusade system\u2014a new strategic layer of gameplay built specifically for this adventure.\nAt a certain point in the game, you will take charge of the Fifth Crusade. As Commander, you will not only be adventuring with your party, but also building your forces, dealing with major challenges, and making critical decisions about the course of the Crusade. You will also be able to recruit an army, send your troops to fight the demonic hordes across the world map, and reclaim the conquered land. On the sites of ancient battles you will be able to discover legendary artifacts, lost in previous crusades, some of them already corrupted. In an ancient forge, they could be redeemed to become powerful items for your character and party members. \n       While building this system we worked hard to ensure that it was not only interesting and fitting for the adventure, but also accessible and understandable to any players. We\u2019ve listened closely to player feedback on the Kingdom Management system in Pathfinder: Kingmaker and acted on that to deliver a system that will be more integrated into the whole experience. We aim to make the consequences of your choices more clear and provide a wide range of tools to deal with any kind of a situation that could arise while leading the Crusade.\nYou will launch your Crusade by setting up an army camp in the Worldwound and making it a fortified headquarters that you can develop further. Each enhancement you make will be vital in the war to come. You will expand the roster of troops available for hire and improve the strength of your existing units. Another thing that will greatly influence your Crusade is your chosen Mythic Path. Depending on your actions and alignment, some allies might join or leave the Crusade, triggering various outcomes later in the game. Relationships with your companions, who are helping you by being your councilors in the Crusade, will be affected as well.\n      Since the release of Pathfinder: Kingmaker, our passion for the genre has only increased. Our team has expanded and gained more experience, and is led by the same people who brought you the previous game:\n     Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous is our second game to be developed in close partnership with Paizo Inc., the creators of the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. It has been a pleasure working together for all these years and we are excited to bring you yet another incredible adventure. Every take on the story and each piece of artwork goes through the Paizo team, who provide us with lore-based advice on how to approach the events taking place in the Age of Lost Omens. They also work with us to preserve the feel of playing Pathfinder in a tabletop setting and to carefully translate it to a digital format. This means that anyone familiar with the first edition ruleset will have a great time with our game mechanics.\n       Support our game by choosing one of the reward tiers! Pledge more if you want to include any add-ons in your tier.

We plan to deliver the game in June 2021 and we are fairly confident about this timeline. But since we aim to significantly extend the game\u2019s features and increase the overall scale of the adventure, we might find out that certain parts of the game require more time to be polished. Our desire to provide the best experience to our backers and the results of alpha and beta testing may delay the final release. The good part is that this should also mean the game ends up being bigger and better than currently planned. Some of the features could also be changed as we move ahead with development and gain feedback from the players during the testing period.\n\nWrath of the Righteous is being developed under the supervision of Paizo Inc., the owners of the Pathfinder IP. That means that all the products presented on this Kickstarter page are subject to change in order to meet the expectations of our licensing agreement with Paizo.\nOur experience delivering rewards in the previous campaign taught us a lot.

Click any of the images for graphics-free text.)\nThe Ptolus Player's Guide  \nIn addition to the two new versions of Ptolus: Monte Cook\u2019s City by the Spire, this campaign will also fund the Ptolus Player\u2019s Guide in print and PDF. This is a 32-page book that gives new players a great overview of the setting and helps them think about the types of characters they might want to play. Like all of Ptolus, it\u2019s steeped in details that bring the setting to life, giving players not just a sense of the geography, events, factions, and important locales that shape the campaign, but also a real sense of atmosphere.  \nClick to download the free Ptolus Players Guide!\nThe Ptolus Player\u2019s Guide in PDF will be free for all players. In fact, you can download a preliminary version of it right now! You can also get it in print as part of this campaign\u2014you get five (enough for each player) if you back at HERO, COMMISSAR, or EMPEROR, and it\u2019s also available singly or in packs of five as an add-on.\nThe new Ptolus Player\u2019s Guide can be used by players of either 5e or the Cypher System. \nIn Ptolus, adventure and opportunity lie not just in the dungeons beneath your feet, but also throughout the city. And above it all looms the Spire, once (and perhaps still) home to a terrible evil. Will your party seek fortune and fame in newly discovered caverns and dank passageways, or in the palaces, temples, markets, and back alleys above ground? And will you gather sufficient strength to one day venture up the Spire itself?\nAs this Kickstarter approaches stretch goals, we'll ask you, the backers, to tell us where you'd like to adventure next. You'll have up to three options: the city streets, the dungeons beneath them, and, with enough experience, the Spire itself. The nature of the stretch goals unlocked depends on the direction you explore. Forays into the city will improve upon the premium features of the Ptolus book. Trips into the dungeon will unlock new treasures. And venturing up the Spire will lead you to entirely new content!\nPay close attention to our Kickstarter updates and the comments; they'll tell you when and how to vote for your stretch goal preference! \nHere's a look at the stretch goals we've unlocked so far:\nBook Upgrades: We are commissioning eight pages of new art. We might have some of it to show off before the Kickstarter ends! We have also expanded the number of physical handouts, game aids, and props in the extras packet that is included with the book.\nGM Screen:  A four-panel, landscape-format screen printed on nice, heavy board stock, filled with useful Ptolus-related GM info on one side, and fantastic Ptolus art on the other. It\u2019s equally useful to GMs of 5e and the Cypher System. Backers at RESIDENT and above get this reward in PDF; those at HERO and above also get it in print! (The print version is also available as an add-on.)\nGrip of the Ebon Hand: An adventure by Monte that pits the PCs against a chaos cult, introducing the players to one of the many major conflicts that make Ptolus such a dynamic, hook-laden setting. Originally run as a Gen Con adventure when Ptolus launched, this adventure presents some of the original campaign PCs as playable characters. In PDF. This reward goes to backers at RESIDENT and above.\nPtolus Character Portfolio: This 24-page, full-color booklet gives you everything you find on a character sheet, plus loads of extra room for notes, ideas, sketches, maps, and so on. Printed on heavy matte paper that takes pencil and eraser nicely. Backers at RESIDENT and above get this reward in PDF (in both print-optimized and screen-optimized, form-fillable versions); those at HERO and above also get a set of five in print! (The print version is also available as an add-on.)\nThe Doctrine of Ghul: A hefty adventure by Bruce R. Cordell. Talk of a newly-uncovered ancient manuscript scribed by the Half God himself swirls around Delver\u2019s Square. Is there any truth to these rumors, and if so, what does this mean for the city of Ptolus\u2014and the entire Empire? In PDF. This reward goes to backers at RESIDENT and above.\nNPC Deck: Scores of personalities from around the city. Each system-neutral card gives you quick access to a PC\u2019s name, appearance, personality, allies and opponents, and related information, and includes the page reference so you can look up further information and stats in the book. In PDF for backers at RESIDENT and above, and in print for HERO and above. (The print version is also available as an add-on.)\nThe Banewarrens: The PCs must act quickly to seal the Banes: a collection of the worst, most nightmarish objects, artifacts, and creatures imaginable. Binding them will involved delving into the dungeons as well as the streets of Ptolus\u2014but who can the PCs trust? A mega-adventure in both Cypher System and 5e versions, included in PDF for backers at RESIDENT and above.\nPtolus dice: Sets for both Cypher System and 5e, made by our good friends at Q-Workshop. See update #20 for a mockup and details. The two sets are both available as add-ons, and the EMPEROR level includes one set (your choice of which). \nThe Night of Dissolution: Picking up from the adventures in the Ptolus book, The Night of Dissolution pits player characters against the darkest foes the city has ever faced. Following the threads of a hidden conspiracy, the characters find themselves up against insane cultists, wild chaos magic, and horrors from the primordial days of the world. The Night of Dissolution will be converted for Cypher System and 5e, and added, in PDF, to the rewards of every backer at RESIDENT level or above. \nMonte Cook Games was founded in 2012 and our first product was Numenera, a standalone science-fantasy RPG and setting. Numenera has won just about every award a tabletop RPG can, and produced a line with dozens of supplements along with a licensed computer game, a board game, a deckbuilding game, and a short film.\nMonte Cook, creator of Ptolus, is our Creative Director and a veteran, hall-of-fame game designer with more than 30 years of professional design experience, much of it on products for Dungeons & Dragons\u2014and particularly as a lead designer of the third edition of that game. Likewise, most of the rest of the design staff at MCG, including Bruce R. Cordell and Sean K. Reynolds, possess decades of design experience with D&D.\nMCG is comprised of nine game-loving, talented, passionate people. In addition to the designers mentioned above, our team includes: Shanna Germain (MCG co-owner and Managing Editor), Charles Ryan (MCG co-owner and COO), Tammie Webb Ryan (Production and Administration Manager), Darcy Ross (Community Relations Coordinator), Jennifer Walls (Customer Support Coordinator), and Bear Weiter (Art Director).\nThe entire team at MCG is dedicated to producing extremely high quality, easy to use products. The nearly 200 products we have produced over the past eight years demonstrate this commitment. Check out some of our free sample products such as Ashes of the Sea and Escape From Jade Colossus.\nThe original Ptolus: Monte Cook\u2019s City by the Spire was published by Monte through his Malhavoc Press imprint in 2006. Although Monte Cook Games didn\u2019t exist at that time, we get frequent requests to bring this title back into existence. Many members of our staff played in the Ptolus world back when it was Monte\u2019s ongoing campaign\u2014some (Sean and Bruce) as regular members of the long-term campaign, and others (Charles, for example) as players in one-shot adventures that linked to that campaign. We all share a sense of connection to the setting. That\u2019s the simple reason we\u2019re doing this Kickstarter: so many people have asked for us to revisit a world we all love. And with Arcana of the Ancients, our first 5e compatible product releasing soon, this seemed like a great time to do it. \nYou might be wondering, \u201cHow do I select an add-on?\u201d It\u2019s easy. Select the Manage Your Pledge button on the right-hand side of the Kickstarter page and increase your pledge by the amount listed for the add-on. For example, if you want Your Best Game Ever, add $50 to your pledge. It\u2019s that easy. After the campaign closes, we\u2019ll be using a service called Backerkit to collect your information, and at that time you can specify the add-on that you\u2019ve already paid for.\nWe have a lot of great rewards in this campaign, depending on what level you choose when you back us.\nHow does one get the stretch goals? If you're interested in PDFs only, the RESIDENT level includes all PDF stretch goals. All higher levels include them, too. If you want stretch goals for new books in print (and similar items, like GM screens and card decks), they start at the HERO level. It's possible that some non-book physical stretch goals might be offered only as add-ons. We'll be clear about that when those stretch goals are announced.\nVISITOR: Just want the PDF? This is your level. You'll actually get both versions (5e and Cypher System) for less than the regular price for either. It's a great Kickstarter-exclusive deal, but don't choose this level without at least considering becoming a RESIDENT.\nRESIDENT: You get all the rewards that a VISITOR gets. But you won't have to wait to start exploring Ptolus, because you also get the existing, 3e version of Ptolus: Monte Cook's City by the Spire in PDF, along with over two dozen other Ptolus-related PDF titles\u2014a total of over 2100 pages, worth over $250. We'll deliver these to you via DriveThruRPG shortly after you fill out your BackerKit survey, which will open a few weeks after this campaign ends. You also get all the PDF stretch goals we unlock during this campaign. \nGUARD: All the PDFs! If you've heard great things about the Cypher System, or just want to give it a try, this level gives you everything you get as a RESIDENT, plus a PDF copy of the 416-page Cypher System Rulebook, which lets you run fast-paced, narrative, easy-on-the-GM games in any genre you can imagine. The Cypher System Rulebook PDF will be delivered to you via the MCG Shop shortly after you fill out your BackerKit survey, which will open a few weeks after this campaign ends. If you prefer print books, consider becoming a MASTER DELVER for a similar deal in print.\nDELVER: This is it! Your big, glorious copy of Ptolus: Monte Cook's City by the Spire in print! You get everything included in the RESIDENT level, plus a print copy of Ptolus for either 5e or the Cypher System. (You'll tell us which version you want when you fill out your BackerKit survey a few weeks after this campaign closes.) And you get every PDF stretch goal unlocked during this campaign.\nMASTER DELVER: The Cypher System is the award-winning game engine that powers Numenera and The Strange. It's fast, flexible, easy to use, and super easy on the GM. This level gives you Ptolus for the Cypher System in print, along with the 416-page Cypher System Rulebook in both print and PDF (a total value of $90). Plus you get everything that a RESIDENT gets. Your CSR will be delivered to you via the MCG Shop shortly after you fill out your BackerKit survey, which will open a few weeks after this campaign ends. \nHERO: This level outfits your entire group\u2014you get everything you find in the DELVER level, along with five copies of the 32-page Ptolus Player's Guide, which introduces players to Ptolus and helps them make their characters. Plus you get all unlocked stretch goals in print. (But note, some physical stretch goals that are not books may not be included in this level.) \nCHAMPION: The ultimate in flexibility and collectibility. You get everything in DELVER, except you don't have to choose which version of Ptolus you get\u2014this level comes with both the 5e version and Cypher System version in print and PDF, at a very nice discount!\nCOMMISSAR: This level gets you all the campaign-readiness of the HERO level along with the flexibility of the CHAMPION. You get both versions (5e and Cypher System) of Ptolus: Monte Cook's City by the Spire, along with five copies of the Ptolus Player's Guide. And all the other goodies from the RESIDENT level, plus every PDF unlocked during this campaign.\nEMPEROR: With this level you get every reward this campaign funds. (That doesn't necessarily include existing products included in lower levels, such as the Cypher System Rulebook.) Plus your print copies of Ptolus: Monte Cook's City by the Spire are autographed by Monte himself. And you get every physical product we unlock via stretch goals. And to top it off you get a beautiful, oversized vinyl poster map of Ptolus\u2014fantastic on your gaming room wall, and useful in play! (See the Add-Ons graphic for details on the map; you can choose either of the two sizes. See the Backer Level graphic above for your precise rewards.)\nIMPORTANT NOTE \"SHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\" is Kickstarter's way of saying that backers anywhere can support our project. It does not mean free shipping. We collect the cost of shipping at the time of reward fulfillment.\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will be shipping rewards at several times over the course of several months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\nA few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed. Although we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which puts you, the backer, in charge of redeeming them at your convenience. It also ensures that we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward.\nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works:\n1.  When your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email it is time to redeem a reward.\n2.  You\u2019ll log on to your already existing MCG Shop account, or\u2014if this is your first MCG Kickstarter/purchase\u2014you\u2019ll create an account on the MCG Shop (using the email address you gave us in BackerKit).\n3.  You\u2019ll go to your Coupons page at the MCG Shop, where you\u2019ll see coupon code(s) that make your reward(s) free. You simply click on the reward coupon you want to redeem, and it is automatically added to your cart. Once you have everything you want in your cart, you check out.\n4.  You\u2019ll decide when to redeem your rewards, and\u2014if your rewards include physical products\u2014to what address to have them shipped. You may delay redemption of your rewards for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nAll backers (domestic and international) will pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We\u2019ll offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you will choose when you redeem your rewards.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. There will be several shipping options from which to choose. Your rewards will ship from our fulfillment center in the United States.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment.\nYou\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. Please be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nPlease see below for more specific information on shipping to your country.\nSHIPPING IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA (not including the United States) Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). There will be USPS International shipping options from which to choose when you redeem your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in the United Kingdom. UK backers will not pay import duties and taxes. We hope Brexit will not adversely affect the shipping of books from the UK into the EU, but at this time, we cannot promise that EU backers won\u2019t pay import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees. You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND ASIA Your rewards will be filled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nEarly reward PDFs fulfilled via DriveThruRPG!\nThis project is promoted by Green Inbox.\nPromotion and fulfillment services provided by BackerKit.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the seventeenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

That game was Dark Tower. We want to bring you that same sense of awe and wonder, pushing the boundaries of what a board game can actually do. After 3 years of painstaking work by a team of two dozen designers, engineers, and artists, we are thrilled to present to you a game with echoes of that long-gone wonder but ultimately unlike any game you've ever experienced.\nReturn to Dark Tower is a game for 1 to 4 heroes who undertake epic quests, fight fearsome foes, and test their mettle against the looming darkness of the titular tower. Now featuring both cooperative and competitive play. Designed by Rob Daviau and Isaac Childres -- designers of the two highest rated games of all time on Board Game Geek -- along with Noah Cohen, Brian Neff, and Justin D. Jacobson, the streamlined rules offer players difficult choices about when to advance their objective, gather resources, deal with threats, or level up.\nEach player controls a unique hero with their own starting inventory and special abilities. Along the way you gain helpful items, powerful virtues, and trusty companions to help you achieve your goal: Find a way into the Tower and defeat a powerful adversary.\nFiguring out the best way to utilize all of these assets is the key to victory. The game actively works to stop you, responding to your decisions and taking advantage of your missteps. Foes, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, will stalk your hero and assault your buildings.\nOur innovative combat system leverages the power of the processor. Within the app, select virtual \"cards\" from each foe's unique deck, revealing the potential consequences of the fight. Then, use your hero's advantages to modify those results. Will you mitigate losses across the board, or focus on one to gain valuable resources for your effort.\nLooming over the board, the Tower itself is the greatest menace you'll face. Each turn, you drop a skull in, representing the threat of corruption. You decide where emerging skulls are placed, making those buildings less useful. At times the Tower itself springs to life, releasing trapped skulls in a single wave or revealing glyphs that sap your will.\nThe path to victory is fraught with peril. Battles and events can give your hero corruption. If you don't cleanse skulls from the buildings to keep them in check, the supply quickly dwindles.  \nTarry too long and face the risk of having all of the seals of the Tower break. Corruption, skulls, and time: Any one of these pitfalls can spell defeat.\nReturn to Dark Tower constantly presents new challenges. The adversary within the tower, the plan to access the tower, and the suite of foes you will face can mix and match in thousands of combinations. Play the same array over again or try something completely new.\nFor complete information on how to play, you can download the draft rulebook: \nOr check out this live playthrough we'll be doing on the Dice Tower:\nWe've also arranged for a how-to-play video by Rodney Smith of Watch It Played! at the time of release. \nCreated by a world-class team of designers and engineers led by Tim Burrell-Saward, an expert in technology-augmented games, the Tower itself is a game component without equal. From its very foundation, it's been devised to play an integral role in the game. Using a collection of magical-yet-reliable technologies, it generates game moments that simply wouldn't be possible without it. The Tower literally and figuratively dominates the table, drawing upon all of these powers to foil you. You will grow to curse its name.\nLearn more about the intense tower development and prototyping process in Tim's designer diary.\nThe game itself is rich and satisfying. But we have a few additional items in this campaign to upgrade your play experience even further.\nFor those of you new to Kickstarter, an \"add-on\" is something that's not included with a regular pledge. If you're interested in getting the neoprene board or any other add-on we might add to the campaign, it's really simple. You have two options:\nYou can manually add the amount of the add-on to your existing pledge. (For the mat, it's $45 including shipping.) If you have already backed and you go to the top of the campaign page, you'll see a button in the top right that says \"Manage your pledge\". Click on it and it will take to you a \"Change your pledge\". Then you can click on the \"Change your pledge\" button. Then, in the box with your \"Pledge amount\" you can manually add the cost of the add-on to your pledge. Click \"Continue\" and your good to go. (NOTE: You can also use this method if you want to upgrade from the Charge the Tower to the Azkol's Fortune level.)\nYou can add any add-ons in BackerKit (our pledge manager) after the Kickstarter campaign is over. I'll talk more about how pledge managers work as we get closer to the end of the campaign, but it might help to think of it as an online store where you \"spend\" the money you pledged in the Kickstarter campaign and where you can add new items too, like the neoprene board.\nThe Alliances expansion offers new rules and components to add further depth and variety to the game. It includes two new heroes, who can be used in any game. The Archwright fortifies buildings to protect the kingdoms; the Haunted Recluse dabbles in forbidden lore to powerful effect. Influence is a new resource that can be used to form alliances with powerful guilds or to thwart the capricious whims of the nobles. It also features new treasures and allies with more intricate abilities for experienced gamers.\nThe Dark Horde box contains stunning sculpts by Punga Miniatures of all the foes in the game. These figures bring the foes to life. (Keep checking back here as we unlock new foes and show off new sculpts.)\n The Coffers box replaces the cardboard resource tokens from the game and the Alliances expansion with top-quality, heat-transfer plastic tokens that have a great feel and durability.\n This 50mm diameter and 5mm thick metal coin signifies the active player. If you signed up for notification before the campaign launched, you will receive this for free if you back the kickstarter and get at least one copy of the game.\nSeriously, folks. This mat is huge and heavy. It's about 80% larger area than the game board. This makes the spaces larger as well of course, which can be a boon if you're playing with the miniature foes from Dark Horde. A real specialty item for those who want to play an epic game on an epic stage.\n Check out this rendered example of a gold foil art print:\nGive all your cards a little extra protection. This add on includes enough high-quality sleeves to cover the cards in Return to Dark Tower and the Alliances expansion. 110 standard card sleeves and 85 mini sleeves (plus some extras for lost or broken sleeves). Most sleeves will have a custom print, but some standard sized sleeves will be completely clear to accommodate the double-sided cards.\n\n\n\nPart of the fun of Kickstarter is achieving new heights and unlocking those sweet stretch goals. We've already packed a ton of content into the game, but we'll manage to find a way to get even more goodies in there. So let's break those seals!\n\nAt PAX Unplugged, we were able to run a number of tabletop media folks through the game. These opinions were freely given and provided without compensation. Here's what they had to say:\nWe know you'll love Return to Dark Tower. But you might be wondering why you should back now. There are four main reasons:\n You can get what you want. The game itself is not exclusive to Kickstarter. We do have a retailer pledge in the campaign, so there are stores who will have the game when it fulfills. However, we are still unsure if we will be able to sell the game into retail distribution, and the add-ons are particularly unlikely to be available widely if at all. Backing is the one way to make sure you get what you want.\n You'll get the game early. Even if the game does ultimately go into retail distribution, we promise to hold the retail street date for at least 90 days after fulfillment is completed. As a thank you for backing, we want to make sure our backers get the first chance to play.\n You'll get the game cheaper. As you can see above, you will pledge less than the suggested retail price. While it is true that some online retailers often sell games for below the regular price, that's less likely in this case. If the game ends up not going into retail distribution, aggressive discount merchants won't have access to it. Even if it does, the discount is likely not be much better than what we're offering in the campaign.\n You get to be a backer. Being a backer means being part of a community. You'll get to speak up on decisions we make during the campaign and share ideas with other backers. Most importantly, you'll help make this game become a reality. Some publishers have taken to using Kickstarter as a pre-order system. That is very much not the case with Return to Dark Tower. We simply could not make the game without the success of this campaign. You'll be a part of that success and part of unlocking stretch goals to make the game even better.\nIf this is your first Kickstarter, welcome! It's easier than it looks, and being a part of the community can be a lot of fun! You can download this PDF file to learn the ins-and-outs of being a backer:\n\nWe are once again using Quartermaster Logistics to oversee the fulfillment process. They have an extremely efficient system, quality packaging, tracking information, and their customer service is second to none. We have key fulfillment partners within each shipping region and will freight the games directly to them, so there will be no surprise charges, such as customs fees or VAT, to the US, EU, Canada, Australia, and China.\nPlease use the chart below to calculate your shipping fees. Due to an error in setting up the Kickstarter page, some countries are charged at the time of pledge, while others will be charged in the pledge manager after the campaign. You will also be charged additional shipping if you order add-ons or multiple copies and at similar rates.\n\n\nWe cannot ship to PO Boxes or to the following countries: Afghanistan, Burma (Myanmar), Cuba, Iran, Kazakhstan, North Korea, Russia, Sudan, Syria, and Ukraine.\nWe are also thrilled to be using BackerKit again. They are a \"pledge manager\", a third-party service that lets us manage our orders and fulfillment. This service starts after the Kickstarter campaign is over. You'll be able to add items to your pledge at that time. If you are unsure about what items you want to get during the Kickstarter campaign, you can back at the \"Map to BackerKit\" level. This will qualify you as a backer for any backer-related goodies and will give you access to the pledge manager to fill out your order later.\nRETAILERS\nWe have a special pledge tier for verified brick-and-mortar stores: For Bazaar Proprietors Only. You pledge only $50 during the campaign. In the pledge manager, you will finalize your order. However, you will not have to pay the remaining balance due until the games are ready to ship. Please click here for detailed information and terms.\n\nRestoration Games was founded in 2016 by Justin D. Jacobson and Rob Daviau on a shared love of all those great board games they played when they were kids. We are dedicated to restoring these games to their rightful glory,  bringing the fun we had to a new generation of gamers.\nSPREAD THE WORD\nA Kickstarter campaign is only as strong as its backers. You will help push this project to be the best it can be. We greatly appreciate anything you can do to let people know about this campaign, whether it's posting to your social media accounts, sending emails to your friends, or letting a co-worker know about us.\nIf you haven't joined the game's facebook group, go do it. We've got a great group of fans, talking about the game, and it's a good place to go to ask questions.\nAnother fun way to spread the word is adopting a social media avatar. Tag yourself:", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is our third Kickstarter, and they just keep getting bigger. So, while we've learned from each one we've done, the challenges keep getting bigger as well. Notably, the tower itself is a complicated component with mechanical and electrical components.

With the print materials locked down, we're looking to refine the data in the app to further balance the game and make it more fun. These playtests will be done in Tabletop Simulator (on Steam) and (unlike prior playtests) will use the actual app (with a built-in Tower simulator). We know some of you signed up for and did some playtesting for us last year. But circumstances can change -- especially during current events these days. So, even if you signed up before, if you're still interested in testing, please sign up again.

Bigger picture, we know that you all have paid a lot of money to get this game. Granted, most of the expense is in that beautiful electronic Tower that will sit in the middle of the table. But we want to make sure the rest of the game meets that high bar. Traditionally, a box bottom serves as a marketing piece to attract the eye of someone browsing at the store, and it also has a number of legal requirements, like safety icons and copyright notices. Fine and necessary, but not pretty to look at. So we made the decision to have the traditional box bottom turn into a separate slip sheet that is placed over the box bottom and held into place by the shrinkwrap. When you open the shrink, you can toss the sheet.

You will be assigning your workers to eleven different locations, such as Tea House, Quarry, Messenger Post, or Barracks, using special Command cards that have additional effects. Production in locations activates ONLY when all their slots are filled with clerks, but filling them all by yourself can result in a penalty. On top of that, players can buy overseers who will give additional output every time a location becomes activated. This creates a lot of involving long- and short-term strategies.\n Each player starts with one unique General, characterized by their asymmetric power, as well as the production level. From there, you will further customize your economic engine and fine-tune your strategy by recruiting advisors who provide additional bonuses.\nEventually, a Wall Defence phase beings, where players place previously build armies on Horde Cards \u2013 earning Honor (Victory points) and looting resources from the defeated troops.

This new co-op game from Corvus Belli involves a deeply immersive narrative component in which you are the protagonist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are a widely recognized company in the world of Wargaming, and after almost 18 years of putting all our love and effort in them, we can say we make the best metal miniatures in the market. \n All of our miniatures are made at our headquarters in Spain, where we have our qualified personnel and all the required tools to make collector quality metal miniatures designed for the tabletop - as we have been doing for flagship Infinity Skirmish Game and previously, for our 15mm historic lines and Warcrow miniatures.\nInfinity Defiance will have the highest quality metal miniatures that we can offer, and we have put the greatest of care to ensure that assembly is as simple and user friendly as possible. \n Players of Infinity Defiance will enjoy a dungeon crawler based in the Infinity Universe whose turnkey miniatures are of exceptional quality unlike any other on the market.\nBased in the Infinity Universe, Infinity Defiance finds a group of heroes gathered by the human nations to stop an imminent assault by Combined Army forces - vicious aliens who have set their sites on the Human civilization. Aboard the Defiance, these heroes of the Human Sphere will fight against the alien invaders in a suicide mission with the sole objective of saving mankind.\nThey must travel through the Acheron wormhole, infiltrate into alien territory, and once there, destroy the new wormhole gate that is being built - which would give the EI the necessary jump stability to launch a full-scale attack.\n\nIn Infinity Defiance, up to four players control a commando unit of four elite soldiers in the Infinity Universe. Through several missions, the Characters will gain new skills and access to the best equipment and armament, until they reach the final mission - when the fate of the Human Sphere will be in their hands.\nEach mission is a survival challenge that\u2019s played on a modular board. \n\nPlayers must choose which Character to play, then draw their Character card and Equipment card.\nCharacter cards have tabs to place the Equipment cards. Players just need to put each similar icon together. If it does not have an icon it means it does not take up space. Additional equipment can be placed in their backpack. \nHeroes will face off against dangerous Enemies, who are controlled by an automatic Artificial Intelligence (AI) deck that is activated using alternating turns. Enemy Units have three difficulty levels, ranging from easy to hard: blue (rookie), red (veteran), and black (character).\nAt the beginning of the Round, you build the Initiative deck which will determine the order in which the enemy units will be activated. Each enemy Unit will draw a card from the AI deck and every Enemy in that Unit will attempt to perform, in order, the actions the card indicates - up to a maximum of 2 actions.\n If there are several options or situations to resolve the Instructions, the Evil AI rule must be applied.\nThe alert level, which represents the status of the Enemy\u2019s defensive systems, will change throughout the game, making the enemies more dangerous. Every time the alert level increases by one level, an immediate effect is applied and it will last until the end of the mission.\nEach time you make a roll, you will obtain a series of symbols from the dice. Equipment cards, Software cards, Specialty cards, and enemies, may spend those symbols to apply Effects via Switches.\nAs the Campaign advances, Characters may improve their combat skills through Specialty cards, which will allow you to choose the specialty best suited to your playing style or personal preferences.\n If you are a store and are interested in selling Infinity Defiance to your customers, you can find all the information you require in this link: https://www.infinitythegame.com/defiance-retail\n Freight costs are not collected in the campaign, but added at the end via the pledge manager.\nThese are some of the expenses estimated by region.

Reaching it is only part of the mission; at Terminus Point the Travellers will face a desperate battle to prevent mass extinction on a galactic scale, and literally go further than any Traveller has gone before.\nWhat is Inside?\nThe Deepnight Revelation box set will initially contain four books, a card deck and a huge poster map, but stretch goals will unlock additional hardbacks to expand the campaign, covering new adventures and regions of space that the Deepnight Revelation will travel through.\nDeepnight Legacy - a 32 page adventure that introduces the Travellers to their mammoth task.\nCampaign Guide - a 104 page book that lays out the immense scope of the campaign.\nReferee's Handbook - a 96 page book that guides the referee gently through the herculean task of running the campaign.\nTerminus Point - a 72 page adventure into the most distant and fantastical realms that forms the great finale of the Deepnight Revelation campaign!\nA giant poster map featuring deck plans of the Deepnight Endeavour, along with crew departments, while the reverse has a huge scale map depicting the expected route of the journey along the Great Rift and known points of interest.\nA deck of cards, covering Mission Briefings, Standing Orders, and Mission Roles.\nMost of the writing for the Deepnight Revelation box set is complete and you can download the first adventure included in the set (a work in progress, but fully playable), Deepnight Legacy, right HERE.\nDeepnight Legacy: The deep-rift outpost at Point XF-1402 has gone silent. Sent to investigate, the Travellers come under attack from the shambling remains of the crew. As the nature of the threat becomes apparent the Travellers face a terrible choice. They must ensure an alien entity never reaches an inhabited planet\u2026 even if it means they can never leave.\nCampaign Guide: A complete guide to the exploration cruiser Deepnight Revelation and her mission. The Campaign Guide details the Deepnight Entity and the ten year voyage to its hiding place at Terminus Point, the route of Deepnight Revelation and the regions of space she will pass through, along with incidents and adventures that will befall the intrepid crew.\nReferee's Handbook: The Referee\u2019s Handbook contains all the rules and information the referee needs to run an epic campaign of exploration at this magnitude. Using a resolution cycle developed specifically for this campaign, along with advanced rules for whole-crew endeavours, the Referee\u2019s Handbook makes resolving large scale tasks quick and simple. Whether the Travellers are decoding alien hieroglyphs, putting down a mutiny aboard their ship, or trying to prevent a critical system breakdown, the Referee\u2019s Handbook covers every eventuality.\nTerminus Point: At the mouth of the Great Rift lies Terminus Point. There, on the very edge of the spiral arm, the Travellers confront something that will consume all life in the galaxy. They have only the resources of their battered ship and weary crew; backup is a decade away even if the Travellers could call for help. They will fight with what they have, treading a thin line between extinction and revelation.\nWhy Kickstarter?\nTraveller veterans will be familiar with the massive Pirates of Drinax campaign. When we came up with the idea for Deepnight Revelation, we knew it had vast potential that could be developed into a truly epic gaming experience with multiple side plots and new areas of space - making it perfect for a Kickstarter project.\nThe box set will contain the beginning and ends of the campaign, along with guidance for the referee to run exploration campaigns as the Travellers make their way along the Great Rift. However, Kickstarter gives us a chance to expand this greatly with specific adventures and regions of space to be encountered along the way, turning this into the greatest voyage made outside of Charted Space!\nThe 'Feels'\nWhen we embarked on this project, we knew we wanted to create something truly special. Your Travellers will be going far, far beyond Charted Space and we wanted to get across to them the true, terrible majesty of the universe. They will encounter and interact with black holes, neutron stars, and nebulae, while visiting hellworlds and planets lit dimly by a brown dwarf. This will be a trip like no other, and we wanted to make sure Travellers remembered it for the rest of their gaming lives, something that is far more than a simple episodic 'five year mission' style of game.\nTo that end, we have drawn upon many sources for inspiration, and recommend referees immerse themselves in the likes of the Cosmos TV series (both new and original), and films such as Sunshine and Interstellar. On a big 4k screen with full surround sound.\nThis is what we want your Travellers to experience during this campaign.\nYou can hear writer Martin Dougherty's thoughts on the campaign and contents of the box right here:\nPledge Levels\nThere are just three main pledge levels in this Kickstarter project - select the one that appeals to you most and we will soon have Deepnight Revelation in your hands.\nThe Deepnight Revelation Commemorative Pack\nCitizens of the Third Imperium will be able to purchase a special commemorative pack to support the Deepnight Revelation mission - and now you can too, simply by choosing to pledge at the Deepnight Revelation Officer level!\nIn the commemorative pack, you will find:\nThe unique Deepnight Revelation cloth mission patch\nA pad of blank Subsector Maps, ready for your exploration\nSix Deepnight Endeavour pencils, perfect for your players\nOne Deepnight Endeavour pen, because referees are worth it\nThe Deep Space Phenomena Recognition Pack, 24 postcard-sized aids picturing and detailing the mysteries of the universe\nA boxed set of 20 brand new Deepnight Endeavour dice\nAll in an official and attractive presentation pack (seriously, if you are a Traveller collector, you will not want to miss this one!)\nStretch Goals\nWe have a multitude of star systems and strange phenomena to explore, and we will be bringing you the deep mysteries of the galaxy via hardback books that explore specific regions of deep space and add additional adventures to the campaign.\n The Riftsedge Transit: We have added a new hardback book detailing the first leg of the mission! The Riftsedge Transit is exploration writ large, in which the Travellers will encounter new alien races and discover wonders never seen before. They will stand amid the ruins of a vanished civilisation and perhaps learn its fate, follow clues to the home of a starfaring species and launch a daring rescue to save new friends, then face a mature Deepnight Entity controlling a whole world, and learn the true power of their enemy.\nThe Near Side of Yonder: A hardback covering a region of 15 sectors directly spinward of Terra has been unlocked, in which the Travellers encounter three starfaring races which stand on the brink of war. The way forward is through their territory and helping one race will antagonise the others, perhaps triggering a devastating conflict, but the Travellers need allies and information. They could tread a careful path through local politics or turn the weapons of Deepnight Revelation upon any who oppose them.  Finally, the Travellers learn of a fleet assembling to tackle an enemy super-warship... and that they are the target. The Travellers' actions will determine if they face overwhelming odds or merely a tough fight.\nThe Crossing: A new hardback book that will see the Travellers searching for a way across the bulge where the Great Rift starts to curve rimward has been unlocked! However, the route is dangerous and a single mistake will doom the crew to a slow death in deep space. They must brave the greatest hazards of deep space; flaring stars, gravitational anomalies, and a deathtrap planet. The Travellers find evidence of those who trod this path before and learn more about the mysterious Leviathan, before reaching the distant shore. What appears to be a safe haven turns out to be even more deadly than the crossing, but there can be no turning back now.\nThe Far Side of Nowhere: The fourth expansion for the Deepnight Revelation campaign has been unlocked now we have reached the heady heights of \u00a365,000. By this time Deepnight Revelation is in poor condition and her crew weary. No sign has been seen of starfaring aliens for months, until a small outpost is discovered. The alien operators seem to find the Travellers familiar. Whilst they are puzzling over this, a trade ship arrives at the outpost. The crew are human. The Far Side of Nowhere represents a change of pace in the Deepnight Revelation campaign; a chance to return to some old-fashioned Traveller adventures. However, the stakes are higher than usual \u2013 a mis-step could terminate the expedition or force its abandonment.\nVoidshore: Voidshore has been unlocked! This book begins with a transit from the Far Side of Nowhere but focuses on exploration of the very fringe of the spiral arm. As the Travellers explore the region they become aware of another expedition in the area, leading to a tense encounter with other explorers. Whether these rivals become allies or enemies depends very much on the Travellers\u2019 attitude to them.\nThe overall theme in Voidshore returns to one of exploration and discovery, with the Travellers piecing together clues to find the route of a Droyne expedition. Finally, all preparations made, the Travellers stand on the edge of the spiral arm and plot a jump out into the unknown. Ahead lies Terminus Point and the final destination of their mission.\nExpeditions: If we reach the appropriately astronomical heights of \u00a3100,000, we will add Expeditions, the sixth Deepnight Endeavour hardback expansion. Expeditions (a working title!) is a set of adventures designed to be slotted into any portion of the mission, where the crew of the Deepnight Endeavour meet new civilisations, explore fascinating stellar phenomenon and, maybe, gain a few things that will aid them in their epic voyage.\nTraveller Packages\nDuring past Traveller Kickstarter projects, we offered various existing Traveller books so backers could fill the gaps in their collections. The Traveller range is starting to grow quite nicely, and so we have put together a range of Traveller Packages that will allow you to add to your pledge and get these books as soon as the Kickstarter is complete (no waiting around for Deepnight Revelation to be printed!).\nSimply choose which packages you are after and add their cost to your current pledge level. After the Kickstarter is complete, you will receive a survey asking you to confirm which packages you added, and we will send you these books within the next four weeks, along with their PDFs!

Each stop along the way unlocks more fun!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhat are the risks and challenges that come with completing your project, and how are you qualified to overcome them?\n\n!! VERY IMPORTANT - PLEASE READ !! \n\nPRODUCTION AND FULFILLMENT\n\nFor a project like ours, the risks and challenges fall into three categories:\n1) Overall Non-completion.\n2) Delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates.\n3) We do not produce a specific model or change/subtract or add a piece to a specific model.\n4) The bulk of our Kickstarter will be made in China. A tariff in excess of 50% or a ban on Chinese imports would seriously delay delivery and/or, in a worse case, shutdown this project entirely. If such an event occurs early on in this project, refunds (less charges and expense payments made) might be possible. If it occurs later in this project (after almost all expenses have been paid) there would be little and possibly no refunds. \n\nConcerning the risk of Overall Non-completion: we've already completed several massive Kickstarters and are fully aware of the pitfalls. Two things that could cause the non-completion of this Kickstarter are either the loss of our inbound shipments (due to an act of God, pirates or war), or a massive disaster (fire, flood) that levels our facility. Either of those events might be disastrous, however we carry full insurance on our facility and insure every shipment against loss or damage.\n\nObviously either of the above tragic events would create delays in meeting our estimated delivery dates, and that brings us to the second category: delays. We have learned a lot from our Kickstarters. However, delays are simply part of the cycle of business and it is our wisdom, training, and experience that helps us mitigate and work through any delay. Some delays, like ones we have control or exercise input over, are easy to solve. Other delays that are out of our control, such as US Customs and Border Protection and Consumer Product Safety Commission inspections and dock yard labor strikes are examples of delays out of our control. In the end we do everything possible to avoid any delay and will always update you as soon as possible.\n\nLastly there is the risk we will not produce a specific model shown. This will only occur if there is not enough interest in a specific model measured by the number of backers that actually pledge for to back it verses the cost to produce it. This event has never occurred in any of our previous Kickstarters, but is nonetheless still a risk. In the event this situation develops you will have plenty of time to adjust your Pledge Manager.\n\nAlso we reserve the right to modify any model or piece of a model shown to meet cost and production requirements. Modifications may include the removal or addition of new parts to a model. \n\nREFUND POLICY\n\nIf it is within 14 days of the closing of this Kickstarter we will refund your entire pledge amount. After 14 days, but before the closing of this Kickstarter\u2019s Reaper Pledge Manager, we will refund your entire pledge minus the 10% Kickstarter and Processing Fees we incur. Once the Reaper Pledge Manager closes, refund requests are subject to review and not all requests may be honored.\n\nYOUR BACKER RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS KICKSTARTER\n\nIf you do not log in and confirm your pledge in the Reaper Pledge Manager by August 31, 2020 you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for payment or donations received. However, we may, at our discretion, refund or ship your pledge if you contact us and confirm your pledge after August 31, 2020.\n\nUnconfirmed pledges make it difficult for us to plan production and logistics. If you confirm your pledge late (after April 30, 2021) some items may not still be available. This means that part, if not all, of your rewards may not be available and/or your pledge may be forfeit.\n\nYou are responsible for all fees associated with the transit and acceptance by you to complete delivery. These include, but are not limited to: import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant and taxing authorities, VAT and GST due and delivery acceptance, brokerage and collection charges.\n\nYou are required to provide correct address information and ensure this address is deliverable by normal methods before your rewards are shipped.\n\nYou must have your address correct and up to date in the Reaper Pledge Manager when we announce shipping is beginning. You may change it at any time until then. There may be a shipping surcharge associated with changing countries.\n\nRewards returned to us as undeliverable will be shipped again postage prepaid by the Backer.\n\nALL OFFICIAL COMMUNICATIONS FOR THIS KICKSTARTER WILL BE VIA KICKSTARTER UPDATES ONLY.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 1 or more", "title": "Wave 2 - United Kingdom (NOT Europe)", "descp": "2019 Bones 5 PLEDGE LEVEL This reward level pledges enough to get you into this Bones 5 Kickstarter.

Resin miniatures are easy to put together, and take paint really well. However, they do sometimes need heating and bending to glue together perfectly, and sometimes have small holes to fill using modelling putty.\nWe always recommend washing the miniatures before assembly, using warm soapy water. If you need to bend any parts (the wings look great if they're bent out in an imposing way), heating them with hot water or a hair dryer will do it!\nYou can glue the miniatures together with superglue.\nYou can paint your miniatures however you like! We always advise undercoating the miniature with a spray coat of paint (either with a can or an airbrush) and then painting them with water-based acrylic paints.\nThe Clear Orange Ether Drake doesn't necessarily need painting though! It looks great as is, although the clear resin also takes paint with no problems, which means you could have translucent wings, a glowing inside, and regular outsides!\nThe 2-Up Ether Drake is a big one! These massive kits will take a little more work to prepare, but make an amazing display piece!\nFin, our in-house painter has put this one together and added some hefty magnets under the wings - that way it's easy to transport if you want to take it somewhere to show off!\nShown with an Infinity Authorised Bounty Hunter, a Games Workshop Primaris Space Marine and one of our own Dropfleet Commander UCM Battleships.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nStellaris\u2122 is owned by Paradox Interactive, and the miniatures in this Kickstarter are produced by TTCombat.

In a nutshell, it\u2019s an epic 1-4 player massive campaign game of adventures, exploration, base building and fierce tactical battles with giant monsters. It\u2019s a fully co-operative, choice-driven boardgame played over multiple sessions, with over 200 hours worth of unique game content (1500+ cards!), a novel\u2019s worth of narrative and a slew of awesome miniatures (some almost 6 inches tall!).\nIt\u2019s a unique experience, merging ideas inspired by video games like XCOM, Dark Souls, Monster Hunter and the jrpg genre with modern tabletop boardgames, like KDM or 7th Continent.\n\nClick on a SG to learn more! \nIf you\u2019re interested in purchasing any add-ons, just click the \u00ab Manage your Pledge \u00bb button on the Aeon Trespass: Odyssey Kickstarter page and add to your current pledge level the amount of the items that you\u2019d like to get in the pledge manager. You don\u2019t need to choose specific add-ons at this stage, you will choose which ones you want after the end of the campaign, in our Pledge Manager.\nSounds simple? It is. If you have any further questions please refer to our FAQ, ask a question in the comment or message us at contact@aeontrespass.com.\nMAP TILES SET\nComes with a luxury version of the  tiles from the Prelude and all 3 Core Game campaigns. This is an optional material add-on. \nAeon Trespass is set in an alternate Antiquity, where a reality-shattering cataclysm killed the Olympian Gods and unleashed the scourge of the otherworldly Primordials. Players become Argonauts, warriors and scholars with the unique ability to control 30-foot tall Titans, the only creatures that stand a chance against these monsters!\nTake control of the greatest ship of the Great Sea  and its crew. Train your Argonauts, explore their veiled past and send them on adventures into the dangerous and mysterious lands of Ancient Greece (and beyond...). Learn the world's secrets and create new technologies that will give you an edge both in combat and outside of it. Manage your resources and develop your base of operations - the floating metropolis of Argo. Build new Facilities, craft new Weapons and equipment. Gather allies and forge political alliances with the world\u2019s factions. And, most important of all, tame the Titans, arm them, evolve them and ride them to battle with the fearsome Primordials.\nThis is a science fantasy setting, where the Ancient World mixes with wondrous technology and mysterious magic. These are mature stories with philosophical underpinnings, touching upon the themes of nihilism, totalitarianism, the cult of man, responsibility for your actions, hope and redemption. What does it mean to live in a world without gods? Do you stand for freedom or order? Do you believe in greater and lesser evils? What are you willing to do to see your vision of the world realized?\nAeon Trespass: Odyssey encompasses three different gameplays: the Strategic , the Narrative and the Tactical.\nThe Strategic\nOn the Strategic scale, you move the Argo on an explorable tile-based Map, gathering resources, finding clues, crafting Weapons, researching Technology, breeding Titans and so much more. Each campaign has its own hand-crafted map (with several interchangeable tiles that can change the layout from playthrough to playthrough or through your decisions) and follows a metroidvania-like style of exploration. On your journey, you\u2019ll visit the labyrinthine Crete, war-torn Sparta and time-locked Delphi and unearth their deepest secrets.\nThe Narrative \nWhenever you stumble upon an adventure hub - or reach a story point by some other means - you embark on an adventure. These are choose your own adventure-style encounters that will shape your characters, your crew and ship and the overall story. Aeon Trespass: Odyssey utilizes dynamic probabilities, a choice chain system and tracks your various decisions with a choice matrix. These are not your typical decisions either, as the game forces you to choose between empathy and strategy, resource management and compassion, the greater good at the cost of personal loss.\nEach adventure ties into the grand narrative of the campaign and the personal stories of your characters. With the Mnemos card narrative experience system you will learn about your Argonauts and develop them in surprising ways through Breakthrough story events.\nBest of all are the dynamic probabilities: as in life, a lot of your choices don\u2019t have a fixed outcome, they only influence it. This means that different combinations of choices lead to different outcomes. Even the same choice in a subsequent playthrough may have new and unforeseen consequences...\nThe Tactical\nFinally, when the monsters come knocking. You will suit up into a flesh-machine hybrid Titan and go to Battle. During these Battles, 1 to 4 players must cooperate to defeat a giant Primordial boss-type monster controlled by a sophisticated AI system.\nNot sold yet? Let\u2019s talk about the unique innovative mechanics and components.\nIn Aeon Trespass: Odyssey, Battles don\u2019t wind down, they heat up. Bruises and wounds don\u2019t make the Titans weaker, they make them soar! Primordials don\u2019t just get beaten, they power up!\nUnlike most games, the Battles in Aeon Trespass: Odyssey have a distinct heroic flow that\u2019s always on the uptake. You are playing heroes facing unimaginable evil. You will not back down and you will not be stopped. Each time you fall, you will stand up stronger. Each time you\u2019re knocked back, you\u2019ll punch harder. Death may be inevitable, but against all odds, you will take the punishing blows of the Primordial and roll with them! Remember how true heroes never stay down? How a beaten Goku finds some inner strength to unleash a locked away power and defeat his opponent? This is it.\nIn Aeon Trespass: Odyssey, there\u2019s no defeat snowball effect, no negative modifiers that keep stacking up, hindering your options and making you a glorified spectator. There is always a chance at a comeback. The closer you are to death, the more powerful you become. This is the heart of the Triskelion system.\n\nFen's First Impressions\n https://www.patreon.com/posts/29800471 \n\n\nFor more information, visit our FB page here and our BGG page here: there\u2019s a lot more art, photos, stories and illustrations there and we update almost daily!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe are confident that we are very well-prepared.

We did everything we could to minimize it, but some things, like testing via home office, isn\u2019t as effective as normal. There\u2019s also \u2018morale losses\u2019, as people just aren\u2019t that productive with a pandemic looming over their heads and it\u2019s true even for the people that usually work remotely, like our artists. We\u2019ve been gathering info from all our partners throughout May, we\u2019ve also been looking at our internal output. The bad news is that it looks like we\u2019re going to have a delay of at least several weeks, which would put the fulfilment date around the end of Q1 2021. The good news is that it\u2019s mostly internal. The game is 99% asset ready \u2014 all the miniatures are sculpted, all the illustrations drawn. We\u2019re finishing up the additional pictograms and the updated UI (see below for new details), and the maps are being drawn as we speak (also see below). Barring a second pandemic outbreak, production will not be affected. We just want to take more time testing, writing and editing, as these are the areas of development that were affected the most. We could push for the original deadline, but I don\u2019t want to compromise the game. I also hope we can catch up with the Timeline, as we\u2019ve developed some useful tools to speed up testing."}, {"status": []}], "comment_no": 15759, "projec_url": "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1492106834/aeon-trespass-odyssey", "project_name": "Aeon Trespass: Odyssey"}}, {"backer": "Rob Bessey", "project_data": {"campaign": {"story": "THE UNTAMED: Still a Fool #1 Canyon Cover by Hyoung.

It proved there was a market for direct-to-video anime films, and paved the way for anime to become not just a niche genre, but a world-wide phenomenon.\nThe team that created Megazone 23 includes a Who's Who of anime legends, including (just to name a few) ISHIGURO Noboru (Macross, Yamato), ITANO Ichir\u014d (creator of the \u201cMacross Missile Massacre\u201d), MIYAO Gaku (Devil Hunter Y\u014dko), MIKIMOTO Haruhiko (Macross, Gunbuster), ANNO Hideaki (Evangelion), YATAGAI Kenichi (Bubblegum Crisis), ARAMAKI Shinji (Appleseed), HOSHIYAMA Hiroyuki (Dirty Pair), ARII Emu (Bubblegum Crash), SAGISU Shir\u014d (Evangelion), MORIMOTO Koji (The Animatrix), Y\u016aKI Nobuteru (Vision of Escaflowne), KAKINOUCHI Narumi and HIRANO Toshiki (Vampire Princess Miyu), UMETSU Yasuomi (Kite), and KITAZUME Hiroyuki (Gundam).\nWith your support, it will be our honor and pleasure to help create the definitive release of the series: the Megazone 23 Omega Edition.\nSynopsis\nYAHAGI Sh\u014dgo is a young man living in Tokyo in the mid-80s, enjoying life during a period of unprecedented peace and prosperity.\nOr so he thinks...\nIn reality he, and everyone he knows, are living in a carefully maintained illusion. Almost all are blissfully unaware that they are aboard a massive spaceship, Megazone 23. Only a few of the inhabitants of Megazone 23 know the truth -- that not only is the city a ship, but that it is controlled by Bahamut, an AI, and is in danger of attack from the mysterious Dezalg.\nWhen Sh\u014dgo stumbles upon the secret of Megazone 23, the military decides that he and his friends need to be silenced before they can interfere with their plans to hack Bahamut. Sh\u014dgo only has two things going for him \u2013 a motorcycle that is much more than it seems, and an acquaintance who is much less so!\nFeatured Artists\nTwo members of the original production team have agreed to provide new materials for this release.\nMIYAO Gaku is a manga artist, character designer, and animator, best known outside of Japan as the creator of Devil Hunter Y\u014dko. He worked on the mecha designs for Megazone 23, and is currently working on the charming manga series Cycle Shop Aoba (which has been running for 20 years and shows no signs of wearing out) and Second Life Animator, a time-travel story set in the anime industry.\nMIKIMOTO Haruhiko is an illustrator, character designer and manga artist, and in the past has also worked as an animator and animation director. He is renowned for his work on influential series such as Macross, Orguss, Gunbuster, Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket, and, of course, for the design of Eve, the sentient computer program that runs Megazone 23. Current works include the original character designs for Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress, and the manga Super Dimension Fortress MACROSS THE FIRST and Mobile Suit Gundam \u00c9cole du Ciel.\nContents of the Set\nThe Omega edition will be a significant superset (with a few minor possible exceptions; see below) of the Japanese Megazone 23 Blu-ray release. The core content (assuming no stretch goals are reached) will include:\nThe complete Megazone 23 saga (Parts I, II and III, using the new Japanese HD transfer) with the original uncompressed Japanese 2.0 and the ADV Films English 5.1 DTS audio tracks. Total runtime: 4h 4m (each is about 80m long).\nThe Megazone 23 Part II International Edition English dub (94m).\nAn assortment of Megazone 23 trailers.\nThe original ADV Films English commentary featuring Matt Greenfield, David Williams and Janice Williams.\nMulticolored non-SDH and SDH subtitle tracks and SDH captions for the Japanese program, SDH captions for the english program, and multicolored SDH subtitles for the commentary tracks.\nAll backers will be listed on the disc in a special feature and in a 9-panel poster insert in the Amaray case.\nExpanded Production Artbook containing significantly more content than the Japanese artbook (Premium set only). The Japanese book was about 64 pages, ours will probably end up over 100 pages long.\nSample settei pages from the Japanese Blu-ray Artbook (our version will be translated into English, of course!)\nIn addition, we are planning to include additional content if certain stretch goals are reached. These include:\nJapanese commentary featuring MIYAO Gaku and our returning champion, SATO Hiroki.\nUse of MIKIMOTO Haruhiko's outstanding new Eve painting.\nNew artwork created by Mr. Mikimoto for this edition.\n8-page Megazone 23 manga created and illustrated by Mr. Miyao.\nFinally, there are several items that we hope to include, but which require additional work to ensure that we have the appropriate rights to use them and usable materials.\nThey include:\nA series of music videos featuring MIYASATO Kumi that were included in the Japanese release.\nThe Streamline Pictures English dub of Megazone 23 Part I.\nThe Manga Entertainment English dub of Megazone 23 Part III.\nOther materials being unearthed by our crack team of combat anime archaeologists.\nWe cannot guarantee that including any these will be possible, so you should consider them to be \"icing on the cake\".\nThe Basic set will consist of 2 BD50 Blu-rays and the poster in a dual-disc Amaray case with reversible cover insert. The discs will not be region locked. The Premium set adds the production artbook and a chipboard case. As with our previous releases, the Omega Edition is a limited-edition and there will be only one pressing.\nThe Basic Set from our Riding Bean project, showing the Amaray case and some of the inserts.\nA Premium Set from our Otaku no Video project - includes the Blu-ray in Amaray case and an artbook in a chipboard collector's case\nReward Levels\nBahamut Backup (Digital Production Materials) - $5\nOnline access to all the art and other production documentation, plus you will be listed on the disc and Amaray poster insert.\nBasic - $60 + shipping\nThe basic set, 2 BD50 Blu-rays + poster insert. Includes all the digital rewards.\nPremium - $90 + shipping\nThe basic set plus the Production Artbook, together in a sturdy chipboard box.\nPatron - $200 + shipping\nIncludes everything in Premium, plus you will be listed as a Patron when the disc loads in addition to your listing in the regular disc feature.\nProminent Patron - $300 + shipping - Limited Reward: 20 Available\nIncludes everything in Patron, plus you will be listed on the first page of the list of Patrons in a larger, more important font.\nPerfectionist Patron - $500 + shipping - Limited Reward: 5 Available\nIncludes everything in Patron, plus you will receive a set of the production check discs. Note that any bugs in the final discs will be your fault! :)\nPortrait Patron - $600 + shipping\nIncludes everything in Patron, plus you will receive a Magnificent Meter of Mikimoto, a 40x30\" (100x75cm) limited edition gicl\u00e9e canvas print of art by Mr. Mikimoto, personally signed by the artist. For backers in the USA, this print comes framed and ready to hang. Due to postal size limitations, international backers will receive the print in rolled form and will have to get it stretched locally.\nIf a stretch goal results in Mr. Mikimoto creating new art for this release, backers will have their choice of that art or the image he created for the Japanese Blu-ray release.\nA smaller (24x18\") digitally-signed version of this reward will also be available as an add-on goodie; see below for more details.\nSmaller 24x18\" test print (Project manager who thinks he's on YouTube included for scale)\nPearlescent Patron - Current Price: $2250 - Limited Reward: 10 Total\nIncludes everything in Prominent Patron, plus Mr. Mikimoto will create a colorful shikishi based on your request and inscribe it to you personally. It must be related to Megazone 23, and it must be personally inscribed; these are not intended for resale.\nThe price of this reward may drop occasionally until it sells out or reaches a reserve price. All backers who select this reward will get the same price as the final backer. \nDue to the way Kickstarter works (we can't change the price of a reward after someone selects it), all backers will be initially be charged whatever the price was when the first person selected this reward ($2500), but we will issue partial refunds shortly after the campaign concludes.\nHere are some samples Mr. Mikimoto has provided us to give you an idea of what he will deliver.\nPurrfect Patron - Current Price: $2250 - Limited Reward: 10 Total\nIncludes everything in Prominent Patron, plus Mr. Miyao will create a colorful shikishi based on your request and inscribe it to you. It must be related to Megazone 23 or one of Mr. Miyao's manga, and it must be personally inscribed; these are not intended for resale.\nThe price of this reward may drop occasionally until it sells out or reaches a reserve price. All backers who select this reward will get the same price as the final backer.\nDue to the way Kickstarter works (we can't change the price of a reward after someone selects it), all backers will be initially be charged whatever the price was when the first person selected this reward ($2500), but we will issue partial refunds shortly after the campaign concludes (currently $250).\nHere are some samples Mr. Miyao has provided us to give you an idea of what he will deliver.\n(You will also receive a personal apology from Robert for inflicting the Purrfect pun on you)\nImportant Shikishi Restrictions\nOnly one character per shikishi. You may make suggestions about situation, pose, clothing, etc., but these are suggestions only; they are not binding on the artist.\nShadowy Junta Leader - Current Price: $6000 - Limit: 1\nAll the rewards of Prominent Patron, 5 copies of the Premium set, one of each of the variants of the signed Mikimoto gicl\u00e9e prints (if we produce multiple options because Mr. Mikimoto creates additional art, you'll get one of each), and 5 of each goodie (except for the 24x18\" gicl\u00e9e prints, since they'd be redundant). Most importantly, you will be listed as the Shadowy Junta Leader on the packaging!\nThe price of this reward will reduce by $100 per day until it is chosen.\nStretch Goals\n$125,000 - Japanese commentary featuring MIYAO Gaku and our returning champion, SATO Hiroki. UNLOCKED on 08/27!\n$150,000 - Use of Mr. Mikimoto's Eve illustration created for the Japanese Blu-ray release, with additional tweaks by Mr. Mikimoto (a notorious perfectionist). This is the illustration we used as a test for the gicl\u00e9e canvas prints.\n$175,000 - New 8-page Megazone 23 manga created by Mr. Miyao. Will unlock 8 special Portrayed Patron rewards ($900), which result in you being depicted as a background character in the manga!\n$200,000 - A new \u201ccell-art\u201d Eve illustration by Mr. Mikimoto. In addition to being used in the packaging, it will be available as a gicl\u00e9e canvas print.\n$225,000 - New Secret History of Megazone 23 featurette by the team at Did You Know Anime?\n$250,000 - Mr. Mikimoto's new art will be upgraded to a painting similar in complexity to what he created for the Japanese release.\n$300,000, $400,000, $500,000: We have no idea! But you have great ideas, so with your help we'll come up with something really cool if need be! \nDetail on 24x18\" canvas gicl\u00e9e test print\nSocial Goals\nUse the hashtag #megazone23 on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook during the campaign period to unlock some extra bonus goodies, as follows:\n 1000 legit mentions: We'll add a Megazone 23 sticker to the set.\n 5000 legit mentions: We'll add an additional 9-panel poster insert to the set.\n 10000 legit mentions: We'll upgrade the sticker to a multiple-sticker sheet.\n 50000 legit mentions: We'll worry about this unlock when we have to! :)\nBy \"legit mentions\" we mean real posts by real people that aren't obviously intended just to inflate the count.\nTo help you out, here's a gallery of images you can use in your postings!\nClick to visit gallery\n\nRegional Availability - Currently USA Only\nCurrently, we only have rights to release Megazone 23 in the United States. We are working with the licensor to expand this to Canada and most of Europe, and may be able to do this during the campaign period. If so, we'll open up ordering outside of the USA.\nShipping Fees\nBasic Sets:\nUS: $7.\nElsewhere: $20. (if we obtain a license expansion)\nPremium Sets / Patrons:\nUS: $9.\nElsewhere: $30. (if we obtain a license expansion)\nShipping is flat-rate. If you subsequently add-on additional sets or goodies, there is no additional shipping charge. If we are able to ship internationally, we will use fulfillment warehouses in Canada / UK / EU to minimize customs fees for backers in those territories.\nGoodies!\nIn our Gunsmith Cats kickstarter, we created a variety of little extra goodies that were available as addons. We are doing the same on the Omega edition, but to keep the Kickstarter part as simple as possible, we'll be handling them as post-campaign add-ons.\nMost of our goodies have their origins in backer suggestions, so if you have a good idea, please let us know.\nCurrently planned Megazone 23 goodies include:\nEmbroidered Patch - $5.00\nChallenge Coin / Keychain - $8.00\nPin - $5.00\n24x18\" canvas gicl\u00e9e print (stretched if shipped to US destinations, rolled if shipped internationally) - $110.00 USA, $130.00 International.\n4\" Embroidered Patch created for Gunsmith Cats\nWith the exception of the gicl\u00e9e print, which is shipped separately, there is no additional shipping fee for goodies since we can include them with the main shipment.\nAll goodies are limited editions, and are only sold to owners of the Omega Edition.\nMultiple Rewards?\nJust like with the goodies, you will be able to addon extra rewards post-campaign using a form on our website. The one tricky issue is if you want multiple rewards that are limited in quantity. In this instance, we recommend that you pick the reward you want the most, and message to tell us about the other reward(s) you want. If they are available at the end of the campaign, you will have the opportunity to snag them at the differential cost. So for example, if you selected Portrait Patron and also wanted Prominent Patron, since both provide the basic Patron rewards, you'd only pay the difference ($100) between Patron and Prominent Patron.\nAddons from other limited-editions\nWe will also give backers the ability to addon items from our previous limited-edition sets (while supplies last) via a form on our website. This option is mostly useful as a convenience to minimize shipping cost, and currently it is largely a moot point since that mostly helps non-US backers (and currently we can't ship to them anyway)!\nWe still have copies available of all our limited-editions except Bubblegum Crisis (which was re-released in single-disc form after the limited-edition went out of print).\nMore information about our previous limited-editions can be found here.\nShout-Outs\nWe would like to thank Janice Williams, John Ledford, Jorden Callaghan, and Brady Hartel for their help providing additional materials for this release. You're the best!\nCopyrights\nMegazone 23 Parts I & II \u00a9 AIC, Inc. Megazone 23 Part III \u00a9 Flying Dog, Inc. Eve art \u00a9 MIKIMOTO Haruhiko.

In particular, one side-effect of the excellent feedback we get from backers is that we expect a certain amount of \"feature creep\" as people come up with great ideas that \"simply must be done\", and these tend to stretch the schedule a bit.\n\nOur policy is that when a critical-path item causes a delay, we use that extra time to try and improve other aspects of the project. All of our previous projects have ended up shipping a few months late (each time for new and \"interesting\" reasons), but what we ended up shipping was better than what it would have been if we'd hit our schedule.\n\nThe bottom line is that we will take the time to get things right, even if that means slipping the release date, and that we will keep you fully informed every step of the way -- we typically post updates every couple of weeks.\n\nSome people tell us that the stories we recount about things going wrong are one of their favorite parts of our projects, but we promise we don't do it deliberately. We don't have to fake incompetence, it just comes naturally.\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": ""}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge US$ 5 or more", "title": "Bahamut Backup", "descp": "Digital download of high-resolution artwork and production materials.\nINCLUDES:\nBahamut Backup (Digital Production Materials)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["108 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more", "title": "Basic", "descp": "International availability not yet confirmed.\nINCLUDES:\n2 x 1080p HD BD50 Blu-rays in Amaray Case\nBahamut Backup (Digital Production Materials)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["409 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 90 or more", "title": "Premium", "descp": "International availability not yet confirmed.\nINCLUDES:\n2 x 1080p HD BD50 Blu-rays in Amaray Case\nChipboard Collector Case with Production Artbook\nBahamut Backup (Digital Production Materials)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Sep 2020"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Only United States"}], "stat": ["849 backers"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 200 or more", "title": "Patron", "descp": "You will be listed as a Patron when the disc loads.

For a very limited time, the datasphere is revealing secrets. Backers only: check out this update to access the vertice and see what secrets the datasphere is revealing!\n\n\nExplore a vast new realm. Uncover never-before-revealed secrets of how the ancients shaped the Ninth World. Face the legacy of those secrets\u2014and, possibly, the utter destruction of the Ninth World.\nThe Numenera: Liminal Shores Kickstarter seeks to fund three thematically linked, hardcover sourcebooks containing all new material for the award-winning phenomenon of the Numenera tabletop RPG. \nOver a billion years into the Earth's future, great civilizations have risen and fallen, each attaining wonders beyond our wildest dreams and furthest imaginings. The remnants of these civilizations shaped the Ninth World into a beautiful but weird place of both wonder and danger. \nYou have explored ruins of the ancient past and found the magic there called the numenera. You have wandered the Steadfast and the Beyond, to discover cities and peoples you never knew existed. You have dived the ocean deeps and found that there, too, lie wonders of the past. Perhaps you have even followed in the footsteps of the prior worlds and voyaged to the stars, or beyond. \nBut the Ninth World still has more unexplored places. One of them is all around us, even now. It\u2019s a network of ancient information, sustained by machines far above our heads circling the world far overhead. And it\u2019s much more than that. It is knowledge and secrets, but it\u2019s also a sort of place. A conceptual space. The datasphere.\nUp until now, people have only caught glimmers of the datasphere. But recently access points, called vertices, have been discovered. Those who find these access points can use them to explore a metaphysical space and plumb the depths of its mysteries. Further, they can use them to learn of new discoveries in the real world. Whole new lands to explore. And even to uncover the mysteries of the prior worlds, and the grand actions that took place aeons ago, affecting the Earth, the Sun, and the other planets. Actions that have an impact\u2014perhaps a massive impact\u2014on our world today.\nNumenera is a game about exploration and discovery. The three new hardcover books offered in this Kickstarter campaign give you all-new methods of exploration and incredible discoveries to be made. They will take your campaign to new heights while embracing the game\u2019s core focus. \nThis Kickstarter will help us launch three new hardcover sourcebooks for Numenera:\nVoices of the Datasphere\nNo other aspect of the Ninth World evokes as much wonder\u2014and generates as many questions from Numenera players\u2014as the datasphere. This hardcover sourcebook delves into the datasphere, making its mysteries yours to command!\nVoices of the Datasphere opens up a whole new aspect of game play, where characters interface with and explore the reaches of the datasphere. This strange new metaspace is not just an ancient alien data network, but in fact multiple such networks\u2014some damaged, incomplete, or aged or evolved past their original purpose\u2014created by myriad civilizations and interacting in unexpected ways. The datasphere offers knowledge to be learned, treasures to be discovered, and wholly new challenges to be overcome. \nLiminal Shore\nThis hardcover Numenera sourcebook offers a new land in the Ninth World, discovered only through clues found in the datasphere. What new people live there? What wonders do they command? Do they know more about the mysterious prior worlds than you do? Do they have cyphers and artifacts never before seen by anyone from the Steadfast or the Beyond? Liminal Shore will offer answers to all these questions, plus new creatures, new NPCs, and new adventures for your Numenera campaign. Be the first to explore a whole new land!\nEdge of the Sun\nThe sun\u2019s luminosity is increasing: a billion years from now, it should have all but swallowed the Earth. So how does the Ninth World even exist? And what happened to the planet Mercury? How, and why, was our world engineered to survive this long?\nThe beings of the prior worlds clearly did . . . something. And now, thanks to discoveries made in the datasphere, the PCs can find out what happened unimaginably long ago, and how those discoveries are vitally important to events transpiring even now.\nEdge of the Sun offers a jaw-dropping, entirely new adventuring locale out in the infinite void, and thrilling, epic, adventures that potentially affect the entirety of the Ninth World itself. Although it can be a part of any Numenera campaign, if you were ever looking for an incredible finale, this would fit the bill!\nAnd perhaps, with stretch goals, we will unlock even more books and additions to the game . . . \n\nWe have a lot of great rewards in this campaign, depending on what level you choose when you back us.\nNEW TO THE NINTH WORLD: This is a great level to take if you're just discovering Numenera and want to give it a try. The Numenera Starter Set has everything you need to start playing, and because it's an existing product, we'll ship your copy within weeks of the close of this campaign. But note: This backer level doesn't include the titles we're funding through this Kickstarter. To get those, you'll need to add them on (see Add-Ons, below). Or for the best deal, choose a different level and then add on the Numenera Starter Set.\nALL THREE PDFS: This is the level to choose if you just want the PDFs of the key titles being funded by this campaign.\nINTO THE DATASPHERE: Choose this level if you want PDFs of the three key titles from this campaign, plus PDFs of the follow-up titles that we hope to unlock through stretch goals. (If you've seen our Kickstarter campaigns in the past, you know we usually unlock a number of additional titles.) For the best deal, though, ONTO LIMINAL SHORES gives you all the same titles in print and PDF.\nALL THREE BOOKS: This is the level to choose if you want the hardcovers of the key titles\u2014plus you also get the PDFs.\nONTO LIMINAL SHORES: Choose this level if you want both the PDF and print versions of three key titles from this campaign, as well as all of the follow-up titles we hope to unlock through stretch goals. Who knows how far the campaign will go and what will get added by the end? (If you've seen our Kickstarter campaigns in the past, you know this will become a great deal.)\nAUTOGRAPHS: The same great deal as ONTO LIMINAL SHORES, but you get a hand-signed autographed bookplate with each book.\nPLAYTEST AND EARLY ACCESS: Just like with the ONTO LIMINAL SHORES level, you get everything this campaign unlocks, but you also get early access to the material and autographed bookplates for each title. Basically, you\u2019ll get the material when the playtesters do, and if you want you can provide feedback from your playtests like they do. You\u2019re not obligated to do so, though\u2014you can also just select this level and gain access to the manuscripts early. \nRetailers: The LIMINAL RETAILER level is a flexible way for you to decide how many Numenera products are right for your store, and to avoid tying up lots of cash between now and release. Your pledge gets you two copies each of the three titles funded by this campaign (Voices of the Datasphere, Liminal Shore, and Edge of the Sun). You may, at a later time, increase the quantity of these titles, and add additional titles funded by stretch goals. You\u2019ll pay for those additional titles, at a retail-friendly discount, at that time. It is likely (but not guaranteed) that you will get them ahead of street date, and you are welcome to begin selling them immediately. In addition to those books, you get a free deluxe Numenera point-of-purchase promo kit. For this retail backer level only, MCG covers domestic US shipping. \n\nAdd-ons are additional items you add to your reward level. Simply increase your pledge by the appropriate amount. After the campaign ends, we\u2019ll get in touch with you about the extra money you pledged and what it was for. Some of these add-on items are only available through this Kickstarter campaign\u2014if you want them, be sure to add them to your pledge now!\nIMPORTANT NOTE \"SHIPS ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD\" is Kickstarter's way of saying that backers anywhere can support our project. It does not mean free shipping. We collect the cost of shipping at the time of reward fulfillment.\nREWARD REDEMPTION AND FULFILLMENT Because we will be shipping rewards at several times over the course of several months, our fulfillment process may be different than other campaigns you\u2019ve backed.\nA few weeks after this campaign ends, we will invite you to review your pledge on BackerKit. This allows you to confirm your pledge and add on anything that you might have missed. Although we use BackerKit to organize backers, pledges, and add-ons, we don\u2019t fulfill rewards through them. Instead, your rewards from this Kickstarter campaign will be fulfilled through the MCG Shop, which ensures that we always have your up-to-date address at the time we ship a reward. It also lets you, the backer, redeem them at your convenience. \nHere\u2019s a brief look at how it works: when your rewards are ready, we\u2019ll notify you by email. You\u2019ll log on to your already existing MCG Shop account, or (if this is your first MCG Kickstarter/purchase) you\u2019ll create an account on the MCG Shop using the email address you gave us in BackerKit. Once you\u2019ve logged on to your MCG Shop account, you\u2019ll go to your Coupons page, and you\u2019ll see coupon code(s) that make your reward(s) free. You\u2019ll decide when to redeem your rewards, and\u2014if your rewards include physical products\u2014to what address to have them shipped. You may delay redemption of your rewards for up to one year after the product\u2019s release date.\nIf you move between reward shipments, you won\u2019t need to tell us, since you\u2019ll simply enter your new address the next time you redeem a reward. If this is a gift and you want to ship it directly to the recipient, simply enter the recipient\u2019s shipping address as the Ship To address when you redeem your reward.\nAll backers (domestic and international) will pay for shipping when they redeem their rewards. We\u2019ll offer a variety of domestic and international shipping methods from which you will choose when you redeem your rewards.\nDOMESTIC SHIPPING You\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. There will be several shipping options from which to choose. Your rewards will ship from our fulfillment center in the United States.\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING International shipping is expensive. We don\u2019t have any control over that, and we can\u2019t accurately predict what shipping rates will be at the time of fulfillment. \nYou\u2019ll pay for shipping when you redeem your rewards. Please be aware that you are responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.\nPlease see below for more specific information on shipping to your country.\nSHIPPING IN NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA (not including the United States) Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in the United States. You will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable). There will be USPS International shipping options from which to choose when you redeem your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPE Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in the UK. United Kingdom backers will not pay import duties and taxes. We hope Brexit will not adversely affect the shipping of books from the UK into the EU, but due to Brexit uncertainty we cannot at this time promise that EU backers won\u2019t pay import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees. You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.\nSHIPPING TO AUSTRALIA, NEW ZEALAND, THE SOUTH PACIFIC, AND ASIA Your rewards will be fulfilled by our shipping center in Australia. Backers in Australia will not pay import duties and taxes; other backers will be responsible for import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees (if applicable).You\u2019ll choose between tracked shipping (more expensive, but with a tracking number) and untracked (more affordable, but no tracking) when redeeming your rewards.", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nThis is the fifteenth Kickstarter campaign for Monte Cook Games.

We call this totally different BG experience a Dream Crawler \u2013 you will dive into surreal and artistically crafted world and follow one of a kind co-op / solo campaign adventure for 1-4 players. Everything you do will change the strange rhythm of the Etherfields dream world, where even the wildest fantasy is possible. \nGameplay created by the Board Game veteran Micha\u0142 Oracz (author of This War of Mine: TBG, Neuroshima Hex or The Edge: Dawnfall and many others), will test not only your logical skills but also your intuition, deduction, and emotional intelligence. Develop your character from scratch using advanced deck-building, travel through the dream-world map and delve deeper into chosen locations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really blown away by my experience with this game so far (\u2026) It\u2019s an amazing well of creativity!\u201d \n  - Rahdo\n\u201cThis one is real puzzler, it\u2019s so vastly different that anything I have played (\u2026) Really excited about this one!\u201d\n  - Ant Lab Games\n\"Etherfields is as a surreal and meaningful journey into a dream world that begs to be discovered.\"\n - Man vs Meeple\n \u201cEtherfields is an immersive experience. The constant state of discovery and the unknown keeps you glued to the table. The game mechanisms are well integrated and just pull you deeper and deeper into this dream world. A dream world I don\u2019t want to leave!\u201d \n- Rolling solo\n\"Etherfields is a magical combination of mechanics, card driven story, and an experience that just draws you in and does not want to let go. \"\n- theMCGuiRE review  \n\"Creative use of components and fantastic art really delivers on the idea of adventures in the dream world; creating an immersive and evocative experience.\"\n - Ready Steady Play \n\u201eAll in all, Etherfields is really, really unique and very, very cool game. Its got intense narrative to it, it got amazing components and amazing artwork!\u201d \n- Crabbok\n\u201cFrom the beginning I liked this a little weird, mysterious, a bit twisted, abstract atmosphere that this game offers.\u201d \n\u2013 ON TABLE \nAmazing gameplay will be accompanied by one of the most striking miniatures and art we have ever made. Our experienced team put their entire artistic skill and hearts into this project, making sure the designs are extremely unique and successfully evoke the fleeting world of dreams. \nEtherfields will be packed with fresh and unique art. Your every skill, action, and even the smallest event will be illustrated with an outstanding craftsmanship. \nYour body has been taken. That's the only thing you know for sure. Your memory has faded away, as you drifted to this strange world of dark dreams. You are an empty vessel now. Looking around, you find masks lying around. Which one will you choose? What story will you follow?\nSomething is coming, and you can feel it \u2013 one dream, consuming all others, leaving a faint smell of poppy seeds. What does the Funeral Witch want of you?\nYour Heroes will be defined by their memory chests. These skills have some of the most surprising rules you ever witnessed in a Board Game \u2013 from literally escaping current reality to your \u201cdream room\u201d for a few turns, up to time modifying time or rewriting the reality. In dreams, no rules are unbreakable!\nThroughout the game, you will very often modify your chest with amazing new cards, but also with curses or filters.\n\nEvery interaction you will have in this strange world leaves a mark \u2013 and may lead to surprising results, as normal rules do not apply in Etherfields. You've managed to finally extinguish the ever-burning Lighthouse in Tideless Port?  This may help you find that key you have been looking for, but now Umbrageous will hunt you down through other dreams.\n\nDuring the game, fighting will never be your only option. Quite often it might actually be the worst option, as in dreams everyone you kill may come back, angrier and weirder. Instead, all characters may interact on two other levels \u2013 through cheating or utilizing their perception.\n Etherfields will test you in many different ways: secret rules that you can discover or deduce by looking closely on the map; drafting cards based on art or name only; guessing the intentions of entities you meet by considering what they do. \nBig, mind-melting concepts are the fuel of Etherfields, and we can't wait for you to discover them!  \n Click here for full version!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWe have currently successfully founded eight Kickstarter projects.

When Brooklynn and I first funded, we were in awe at the reception. We put ourselves out there and we were able to raise nearly $350,000 from an idea that we had no idea anyone even wanted.\n\nWhen you\u2019re just a couple of lowly artists and you see that amount of cash hit your bank account, you think you have all of the money in the world. And we spent it as such.\n\nWe immediately hired on two full-time employees, Brenna and Clayton. Without these two, we could not have made Middara the way that it is today. In retrospect though, we really didn\u2019t have a plan laid out to any degree. Brooklynn and I were poor managers. We threw ourselves into the position of an employer with no previous experience doing so. Full-time employees are expensive and when a project goes 3 years past it\u2019s deadline, calling it expensive is an understatement.\n\nA couple years after the campaign funded, the real gravity of the situation began to hit us. We received an invoice from Panda and our heart\u2019s sank. (And this was before we even saw the shipping quote!) There was no way we could make this happen without help. Many companies would have probably given up at this point, broken the news to their backers, or ghosted them completely. We\u2019ve seen it before. \n\nThe thing is, we knew we had something special. We playtested two times weekly, paying our friends in pizza, coffee, and beer. Everyone raved about the game. We\u2019d take Middara to conventions and people loved it. We\u2019d have regulars year after year, hanging out at our booth wanting to know more. I would sometimes find myself daydreaming about how I\u2019d build my character (I always play Zeke).\n\nPanda believed in Middara as well. It was a showpiece for them. Their employees were proud of the game. So we were able to negotiate a deal with them where they allowed us the our pre-production (PPC) without upfront payment. This was huge for us.\n\nThe game looked incredible, even in its unfinished form.\n\nWe showed this PPC off and the reception was spectacular. Our backers were very impressed!\n\nSo, we finally had something to show off. I started Google searching ideas for where I could raise some capital to finish what we started. There were some local start-up incubators in Salt Lake City that I was able to get in contact with and I applied online to pitch my idea to them. They initially laughed when I told them that I had a board game to bring in, but after they saw Middara, they changed their tune pretty quick. When people think of a board game, they think of Monopoly. This was not Monopoly. \n\nWe would meticulously plan out or pitches but we\u2019d have so much interest from the crowd that the pitch would quickly devolve into a 20 minute Q&A session. We didn\u2019t mind. It was exciting to see the interest.\n\nNot to bore anyone with the details (if you\u2019re interested go ahead and email me at alex@succubuspublishing.com) but we hit the pavement hard. We pitched to EVERYONE. Angel networks, friends and family, VC firms, other board game companies, banks, online creditors\u2026 you name it. Giving up was never an option for us. We probably ended up pitching to over 100 different potential investors / funders.\n\nAfter all this practice, we started getting good at it. We became even more confident in Middara. And when you\u2019re meeting constantly with these types of people, you learn about the real inner workings of a healthy business.\n\nBrooklynn and I joke that we\u2019ve earned our business degrees in the last year and a half from all the things we\u2019ve gone through. All the while, we remained positive and calm with our backers.\n \nWe knew we\u2019d make it happen.\n\nWe built up the confidence to pitch Middara to anyone. We ended up presenting in front of some very high net worth groups in Park City, Utah. Something that would\u2019ve terrified us a year prior.\n\nSo, long story short. We put everything on the line. We were able to recruit an amazing combination of partners on board with us. We were able to raise the capital we needed to fund the manufacturing and fulfillment of Middara and give us a runway to the reprint campaign that you\u2019re seeing today.\n\nI\u2019m not telling you this so that you feel bad for us. I\u2019m telling you this because I want you to feel confident in becoming a backer of Succubus Publishing knowing that we will never give up on you.\n\nWe now have a team behind us that can make a campaign like this one a reality.\n\nTo our returning backers, we love you guys with all of our hearts. You made our dreams come true. Brooklynn and I have struggled but it\u2019s been the best time of our lives.\n\nAnd to our new backers, we hope you\u2019ll join the ride with us.
