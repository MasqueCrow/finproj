What a beautiful mothership!\nHiya! I'm Straton. As a user experience (UX) designer, I'm passionate about the beauty and usability of great design. Naturally, this makes me an Apple fanboy. I'm also a nerdy pin collector.\nLast year, I launched my first Kickstarter campaign for a set of iOS pins. I was blown away by the amount of support from people (in 11 countries!) who are also passionate about Apple. I received a ton of great feedback from my backers and those who have purchased the pins after the campaign. One theme has consistently stood out \u2014 people love feeling the digital world come to life.\nWith that theme in mind, I'd like to introduce you to my second Kickstarter campaign for a set of Mac-inspired pins and a special bonus set for WWDC 2021.\nWear 'em on your jacket, slap 'em on your backpack, jam 'em into your corkboard, or magnetize them to your fridge \u2014 the choice is yours!\n\nThis set of eight (8) unofficial enamel pins pays tribute to historical moments in the life of the Apple Macintosh and commemorates Apple's WWDC 2021 conference.\n\n\u2705 The $5,000 Stretch Goal unlocked June 2, 2021! The Click Wheel pin will be included for free with every \"Complete Set\" reward.\n\u23f3 If the project reaches $10,000, a new 10th pin will be included for free with every Complete Set reward. The twist? You get to decide! Right after the WWDC keynote on Monday, I will send everyone a link to a survey where you can submit your own pin ideas. Shortly after that, you'll get to vote on your favorite finalists. Let your imagination run wild!\nRewards\n1 single pin (your choice of design) - $10 \n1 full pin set (8 pins) - $40 \n2 full pin sets (16 pins) - $60 \n\nAdd-ons\niOS pin set (all 6 pins from my last Kickstarter) - +$25 \nThis add-on set includes all six (6) iOS-themed pins from my last Kickstarter.\nPaint: 3\" x 2\", black dyed, soft enamel with epoxy dome, 3 black rubber clutches or soft fridge magnet\nThe Spinning Beach Ball of Death: 1.0\", silver nickel plated, soft enamel with epoxy dome, 2 black rubber clutches or magnet w/ holder\nPhysical Escape Key: 0.68\" x 0.45\" (SAME SIZE AS THE REAL THING!), black nickel plated, hard enamel, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nSystem 7: 0.9\" x 0.7\", black nickel plated, hard enamel, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nDark Mode: 0.85\" x 0.75\", black nickel plated, hard enamel, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nFinders Keepers: 0.75\" x 0.75\", black nickel plated, hard enamel, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nWWDC21: 1.25\" x 0.37\", black nickel plated, hard enamel, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nGlow and Behold: 0.75\", black nickel plated, hard enamel, 1 black rubber clutch or magnet w/ holder\nClick Wheel (Unlocks at $5,000): 1.18\", matte silver plated, hard enamel, 2 black rubber clutches or magnet w/ holder\nNOTE: The actual designs, materials, and dimensions may vary slightly from what is shown here, depending on if anything needs to be adjusted for the manufacturing process.\nThis is an example of what the back pin clutches will look like.

With that in mind, I will be ordering enough pins to cover a 25% defect rate. Based on my previous orders with my manufacturing partner, the actual defect rate is much lower.\n\n\nManufacturing and shipping delays:\n\nAs we've all learned this last year, it is reasonable to expect that there may be some delays in manufacturing and shipping due to circumstances out of our control. If the quantity of backers exceeds expectations, the larger order may take slightly longer to manufacture. I'll try my darnedest to get all the rewards out on time.

Every track was created using only the sound chips inside of a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and a Gameboy (DMG).\nHere's the first cut of the full album playing on the 'Nintendo Entertainment Turntable' for your listening pleasure while you browse the project details! This is a one-off copy that was lathed so it's a bit crude compared to the polished album. The quality of the sound on the full press will be far superior to what you hear in this example. Additionally, all of the tracks have since been improved upon based on valuable feedback from friends and fellow musicians.\nI've been creating chiptune music for over a decade and have been composing video game style themes since I was a child. I've also played piano for most of my life and have always enjoyed learning how to play songs from my favorite TV shows, movies, video games, and bands. With the possibilities of using a digital audio workstation to create music, I have spent countless hours over the years arranging and composing midi based tracks. This will be my fifth album and second release on vinyl.\nAbout two years ago, backers just like you from around the world pitched in to bring my first vinyl release, \"In The RP2A Over The Sea\",  to life and they were handsomely rewarded for their support and  pledges. As with that project, I will spare no expense to create the  best album I can, complete with plenty of extras!\nA pledge of $12 or more gets you a high quality digital download of \"Soft Bits In\", including a number of digital album cover options. With a pledge of $25 or more, you get three additional full album downloads: After These Messages, Shamroctoroc, & In The RP2A Over The Sea. All digital album downloads will be delivered via email as download codes that can be redeemed at any time.\nThis reward includes an album package containing two expertly pressed black vinyl  LP records in white sleeves in a beautifully designed album jacket, all kept protected by a clear, collector-grade poly bag rather than shrink-wrapped. With this, you also receive a digital download of the album!\nThe Special Edition Vinyl Press has been designed specifically with the collector in mind. In addition to  everything that comes with the \"Vinyl Press\" reward, it includes the Deluxe Digital Album Download and the following:\nFor those interested in the process of creating the album or looking to get into making chiptune music, this two hour long, one-on-one 'master class' session will walk you through it all. I'll share what software & hardware I use, how I work within the inherent limitations, utilize creative techniques, and more! I will answer any questions you have or we can just chat about classic video games, art, music, technology, etc. This reward includes everything that comes with the Special Edition Vinyl Press.\nAfter previous album releases, I've received commissions for chiptune tracks, so I'm offering select backers the same service bundled with the Special Edition Vinyl Press in which I'll create a track just for you using the same setup I used for this album. This can be an original or an arrangement, up to five minutes in length. The recorded track will be sent to you in your preferred format when completed.\nThis is for the ultimate fan of chiptunes and vinyl - a record player built into a classic Nintendo Entertainment System! In addition to getting everything included with the Special Edition Vinyl Press, I'll create a NES Turntable just for you! It may be a novelty item with the internal components of a Crosley Cruiser but it's fully functional with multiple speeds, adjustable volume, component and headphone audio out jacks, built in speakers - and it is one heck of a conversation piece!\nIf you're a collector, you might be interested in picking up an extra copy of the album, or second Special Edition package as a special gift for someone. If you're a true collector, you'll definitely want to grab a test press of the album! For anyone who backs the \"Vinyl Press\" reward or above, you'll be able to add one of these to your pledge! For those who back at any level, you can get the same two-hour chip-tunes 'master class' included with the \"Chiptunes 101\" reward or, if you've already backed the \"Chiptunes 101\" reward, you can add more time to your session (or schedule multiple sessions).\n\nI've done meticulous calculations to determine the outcome of this project whether it barely reaches the goal or maxes out every reward. If the campaign just meets the goal, I will have a small buffer to cover anything that doesn't go according to plan. If it reaches its peak potential, however, I will be upgrading rewards!\nIf the campaign reaches $10,000 then I will be pressing the records in two different colors of vinyl - purple and yellow. Kindercore offers this option for a better cost than many other pressing plants so with just a bit extra, we can make this happen!\nSurpassing $11,000 in funding will get the Special Edition Vinyl Press backers four more 5x7\" pixel art prints with colorful designs inspired by the lyrics of \"The Soft Bulletin\". Can you guess which songs might have inspired these designs?\n$12,000 gets all backers of $40 rewards or more a 4-in-1 sticker strip designed after the Gameboy Printer paper feed. These additional images of the band that inspired \"Soft Bits In\" look like they came fresh off the GBP press and can be cut down to smaller, individual stickers or left intact to resemble the paper strips torn from the thermal paper roll!\nAt $14,000, all albums will be upgraded with gatefold jackets. For the true double album experience, a gatefold is the perfect packaging. With this upgrade, I'll also include  a 'Special Thanks' section on the inside of the jacket where I'll list the names of everyone who backs the campaign!\n$16,000 in funding gets Special Edition Vinyl Press backers a sleek obi strip! Many collectors love these extras that are common to releases in Japan.\nAt $18,000, all Special Edition Vinyl Press albums will include a lenticular cover art insert with an interlaced image that animates an exploding Gameboy when you tilt it up and down! I haven't cemented the design quite yet but I will be working with the  company producing these to come up with the best sequence of images to take full advantage of this unique technology and this is more or less how I want the final effect to look in action.\nFor any backer who pledges $90 or more and will be receiving at least one copy of the album with their reward, I'm offering a unique high pigment color swirl variant of the records! You can read all the details in this update but a few things to note. These are limited to one-per-backer (possible exceptions for high rollers) and their appearance may vary wildly from what you see below - but this is the overall look I'll be going for. Also, if this isn't your thing and would prefer the standard black vinyl instead (or solid yellow/purple color if we reach that stretch goal), you'll have the option to opt out on the survey at the end of the campaign. I know many of you will enjoy this perk but it's not for everyone so I don't want to force it on you if you don't want it!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nEvery Kickstarter campaign has potential risks and many challenges but I've taken every precaution to ensure that whatever funding is raised will be more than sufficient to cover all costs of production and that I am well prepared to take on the challenges of fulfillment. As of now, the tracks are all completed, recorded, mastered and backed up on multiple devices. In addition, all artwork for printing the album packaging, posters, art prints, stickers, etc have been finished, formatted and ready for submission to the printers. In other words, my work here is done and all that's left is for backers to help me reach the funding goal and the production companies to do the rest!\n\nWhile I will be relying on third parties for production needs, nearly everyone that is working on the creation of the physical items is someone I have used in the past. They are reliable, professional, and have done work that exceeded my expectations so I have the utmost confidence in their ability to deliver.\n\nReward delivery dates have been conservatively set to account for unexpected snags so they will likely arrive well ahead of schedule but in the event of delays, updates will be posted regularly and digital downloads will be delivered right after the close of the campaign regardless, so you can start listening to the album right away!\nLearn about accountability on Kickstarter", "env": "", "creator_bio": "Doctor Octoroc\n4 created \u00b7 4 backed\nFreelance artist, animator & musician, professional 3D CAD modeler, illustrator, designer, amateur pianist, classic video game enthusiast ...See more"}, "support": [{"amt": "Pledge without a reward", "title": "Digital Download", "descp": "Digital download of the full album in high quality with HD digital album pixel art.\nINCLUDES:\nSoft Bits In (Download)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["13 backers", "Limited (87 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 12 or more\nABOUT S$ 16", "title": "Deluxe Digital Album Download", "descp": "Digital download of the full album in high quality with HD digital album pixel art, plus digital downloads of my \"After These Messages\", \"Shamroctoroc\", and \"In The RP2A Over The Sea\" albums.\nINCLUDES:\nSoft Bits In (Download)\nAfter These Messages (Download)\nShamroctoroc (Download)\nIn The RP2A Over The Sea (Download)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Jul 2021"}], "stat": ["6 backers", "Limited (94 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 25 or more\nABOUT S$ 34", "title": "Vinyl Press", "descp": "Double LP vinyl press of \"Soft Bits In\", plus digital download of the album.\nShipping is included in the pledge amount for backers in the continental United States (supplemental shipping added for international backers based on location).\nINCLUDES:\nDouble LP Vinyl Press\n(Shipping included within the U.S.)\nSoft Bits In (Download)", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["39 backers", "Limited (61 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 40 or more\nABOUT S$ 54", "title": "Special Edition Vinyl Press", "descp": "Everything included with the \"Vinyl Press\" and \"Deluxe Digital Album Download\" rewards, plus a set of exclusive pixel art prints, album inserts, an assortment of stickers, and as a bonus, a physical copy of my 6-panel digipak \"8-Bit Jesus\" album on CD.\nShipping is included in the pledge amount for backers in the continental United States (supplemental shipping added for international backers based on location).\nINCLUDES:\nDouble LP Vinyl Press\nAlbum Inserts\nArt Prints\nSticker Set\nBONUS: 8-Bit Jesus CD Digipak\n(Shipping included within the U.S.)\nDeluxe Digital Album Download", "time": [{"ESTIMATED DELIVERY": "Dec 2021"}, {"SHIPS TO": "Anywhere in the world"}], "stat": ["57 backers", "Limited (43 left of 100)", "Add-ons"]}, {"amt": "Pledge US$ 60 or more\nABOUT S$ 80", "title": "Chiptunes 101", "descp": "Everything included with the \"Special Edition Vinyl Press\" reward, plus we'll schedule a two hour long 'master class' session where I'll answer questions and show you how I made the album.

We reached our initial goal within 36 hours of launch, and this is an incredible start.\nSo - what happens now, we've still got 6 days left!?\nWell - our next MAJOR GOAL is to actually FINISH MAKING THE FILM in time for launch at festivals like Glasgow Film Festival in March 2022 ...  not an easy task. The average Netflix documentary costs \u00a3300k+. \nSo we still need support.\nWe have some STRETCH GOALS which, should we reach them, will help us make the best film possible \u2013 something that really does justice to the cause, whilst celebrating the music and the incredible bands behind it.\n\n STRETCH GOAL 1 \u2013 20k: This will help us secure AS MUCH PRECIOUS VIDEO ARCHIVE AS POSSIBLE (it can cost up to \u00a33k to clear one minute of archive for theatrical, broadcast and streaming release. Expensive right?)\n   STRETCH GOAL 2 \u2013 25K: This will give us the chance to include a few more tunes, which in turn, also supports the artists... as well as bring an archive producer on board part-time to help with sorting out commercial footage licenses, royalties, publishing fees etc in order to make sure no stone is left unturned...\n   STRETCH GOAL 3 \u2013 30K: This will enable us to enlist the help of an animator full time for 4 weeks to create bespoke content for use in the film where the archive that's sadly already lost would have been, bringing the story to life and providing visual representation for the  'movements that might have been' had these women been given the same  support as their male counterparts.\n  We can\u2019t even imagine being so lucky but to  reach these goals but if we did we could commit to preserving a definitive catalogue of  everything that\u2019s out there, from stills, to audio recordings, rare  interviews, TV appearances, John Peel sessions... and provide the best  possible platform for these bands to tell their stories in their own  words. \nABOUT \n'Since Yesterday: The Unsung Pioneers of Scottish Pop' celebrates the songs,  stories and journey of Scotland's all-female bands from 1960 to 2010. \nThis feature-length documentary seeks to explore the social impact of women making music collectively in a male-dominated industry and rightfully acknowledge their place within the history of popular music.\n\nLungleg, by Graham Gavin\nWith over 40-hours of new footage recorded, we now need your help to push our feature length documentary \u2018Since Yesterday - The Unsung Pioneers of Scottish Pop\u2019 in to a bigger arena. This is our little country's perspective on a global issue.\n\nTHESE STORIES NEED TO BE TOLD; THIS DOCUMENTARY NEEDS TO BE MADE\u2026.\n(TW) There are some incredible things about a legion of undersold Scottish girl bands that might surprise you: John Peel sessions, concerts in prisons, cult followings, opening for The Beatles and The Sex Pistols, world tours, \u2018handbag\u2019 roadies, a little guitar cameo from Jimmy Page, even more John Peel sessions.\nThe Ettes - Scotland's first all girl 'punk' band, Edinburgh 1979 (Photo Courtesy of A. Morrison)\n\nThere are also things that, sadly you won't be surprised to hear; a world of sexual assault, getting fired for becoming a parent, being told you\u2019re too old, too fat, too short, too tall or \u201cthe problem with girl bands is that you all just get pregnant in the end...\u201d\n\nA story is always best when it is told by the people at the heart of it; Strawberry Switchblade, The McKinleys, The Twinsets, The Ettes, Lungleg, Sophisticated Boom Boom, His Latest Flame, The Hedrons and TeenCanteen, plus many more.\nSophisticated Boom Boom, by Simon Clegg\nThe McKinleys\nScotland's musical output is world reknown; yet whenever women work collectively, their output is curtailed, compromised out of existence, or just left unsigned. Why?\n\nThe statistics are hard to stomach. The story doesn\u2019t seem to be changing.\nThere is anger, hurt, desire, determination and fierce passion for change. There are movements, campaigns and hard evidence in report form. #MeToo, Key Change, #womeninmusic and Vick Bain\u2019s report on diversity in the music industry. \nWe started this documentary because we want to shine a light on the issues, but also, as hard as some of the story is to hear, we want to celebrate the determination, the individuality, the occassional success, the history of these incredible women, their music and these brilliant bands. We can\u2019t continue to write women out of the history of music. There will be bands and stories like this in every city and country across the world.\nPlease help us tell this story. It needs to be told.\nTwinsets 2018 EIF\nWHY NOW? \nThe music industry may consider itself culturally progressive but at PRS for Music, only 17% of its 140,000 registered members are female (2018). Similarly, 108 (17.5%) of the 616 songwriters nominated for Best Single Brit Award since 1999 have been women. 14.18% of the 12,040 writers represented by UK publishers are women, while female artists make up 19.69% of the rosters of acts signed to labels. This is also an industry that\u2019s been slower to reckon with its abusers post-#MeToo than other art forms.\nLastly, the festival line ups recently announced for 2021 are woefully under representative of all-female acts. In the sixty years since women demanded equal rights in every sphere, not all that much has changed for women with guitars.\n\nNow it\u2019s time to put us and our story front and centre. The game changers, the rule breakers, the iconoclasts, the ones who never compromised. Why? Because the system is broken and it\u2019s high time, we changed the record\u2026\n\nTHE TEAM / WHERE WE'RE AT: \nCo-directed by musician Carla J. Easton (shortlisted for Scottish Album of the Year; member of all girl band TeenCanteen) and prominent Scottish director Blair Young; produced by producer/filmmaker Miranda Stern (one of Scottish Documentary Institute\u2019s New Voices of 2020) and the award-winning production company The Forest of Black. We\u2019ve been soldiering on for four years now with nothing but blood, sweat and tears to fuel the drive. We have over 40 hours of new footage, having tracked down and interviewed and struck up friendships with these pioneers and trailblazers. They have openly shared the highs, lows, heartbreaks and outrages of their chequered musical history. Now we just need a little help to get it over the finishing line\u2026\nWe have invested 4-years of personal time and money into this project. We now need \u00a325,000 or more to unlock the buried chest of archive that lies in television vaults, and license other material to help colour the film to its best potential.\nWe know the interest is there \u2013 we\u2019ve been selected for In Edit festival and we have interest from broadcasters and distributors.\nWe've just received a development grant from Creative Scotland to develop, research and write this documentary, allowing us to employ key personnel and extend our research professionally; however it is not a production fund, and with the prohibitive cost of rare archive from broadcasters, we can't pay for everything out of our own pocket. \nIf we can obtain this important footage and music for our documentary, it effectively releases it in to the public realm, collated nicely in our film.\n\nWe are seeking to raise \u00a325-\u00a330k to go towards the cost of usage rights and licensing fees for the following:\nUnreleased audio from John Peel sessions\nRare TV appearances from, amongst others, Something Else; Ready Steady Go!; Top of the Pops \nStills\nMechanical royalties and publishing fees\nCost of rewards for our Kickstarter supporters\nREWARDS\nEXCLUSIVE MUSIC, MERCH, TEST PRESSINGS AND EXPERIENCES ALL AVALABLE\nLimited Edition Ettes Cassettes of never before released demos, Signed Debut Album TeenCanteen, Limited Edition The Twinsets 7\" Pink Picture Disc, Lung Leg Screen Printed T-Shirt and 7\" Bundle, Private Screening Tickets for 2, Shout Outs in Credits, your chance to be an Executive Producer, Bands Names T-Shirts and Limited Edition Bespoke Film Poster - loads of items in return for your support to make this film happen. \nEttes Live Review, Mark Hagen (supplied by Lindsay Hutton)\n\nIf funding exceeds our original target, the money will go towards our postproduction costs (we will also be seeking additional finance to cover this). The stories are there, recorded, nearly good to go. We just need to get it out there.\nEvery single donation will help us get closer to getting this story out there. If you can make a contribution and share our Kickstarter then we would be incredibly grateful.\nNeedless to say, you\u2019ll have our thanks and HUGE HUGS when allowed. \n\nIt's time to provide accessible historical context to women making music. It's time to 'normalise' women picking up instruments and forming bands with their friends. Be a part of history. Enact change.  \nTha Van T's by Kat Gollock", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nAll films carry risks and in this case our biggest concerns rest with ensuring the safety of the crew and the people we will be working with in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.

After a lot of product development and so many noodles eaten, we are ready to launch it. Backers of the ABO Ramen product launch campaign will be the first to try it and will also help with:\nLab work - all the tests and analyses that are necessary to distribute a new food product. Think things like shelf-life studies.\nRaw ingredients - while some ingredients we do have in stock for our other product lines, some are entirely new and in order to purchase the quantities needed for mass production, it's a pretty big investment.\nPackage development - we know about jars and pouches, but boxes and sachets are new to us. We are working on the best packaging option for our new product.\n\nThe Problem \nWe get it.\nYou\u2019ve been busy with your 10th Zoom meeting today, the emails are piling up, and you\u2019ve only finished half of what\u2019s on your to-do list. The last thing you want is to spend 45 minutes prepping, cooking, and cleaning the dishes when you\u2019ve had a long, tiring day.\nSo you go to the kitchen and cook 3-minute instant ramen. Now that\u2019s yummy and fast. The problem is, you bought that very unhealthy pack from your grocery store, and for a WFH goal-getter like you, you realized you needed something healthier.\nSo now you wanted to level up your ramen game and decided to go for a healthier option. Still, you needed it ninja fast so you tried looking for a quick and healthy ramen fix. Big Problem: that \u201cdelicious factor\u201d is missing the equation.\nWe see you. And we know just what you need:\nWhat if we reinvent ramen so you can have a meal that\u2019s fast, healthy, and absolutely delicious?\nIntroducing, ABO Ramen! \nABO Ramen is a delicious, easy, 100% GUILT-FREE ramen meal kit! The kit will contain miso-based ramen broth seasoned with our award-winning OKAZU condiment and wheat-free noodles. Umami yum!\nOur new ABO Ramen is a great choice compared to regular instant, or restaurant ramen, which are very high in fat and sodium. ABO Ramen is non-GMO, gluten-free (wheat-free), contains no artificial flavouring, and is completely plant-based.\n\nLet's Talk About Our Souper Healthy Miso-Based Ramen Broth\nYou and ABO Ramen FER-MENT to be!\nIf you don\u2019t know by now, We L-O-V-E miso for so many reasons.\nWe are all about adding depths of flavor to food while loading it up with nutrition to keep you satisfied and nourished even on days when you literally have a few minutes to prepare your meal.\nFor ABO Ramen, we are using a rich, flavorful, and naturally fermented miso soup base to give you that much-needed probiotic boost in the most delicious way. Yes to gut health and improving your overall mental and physical wellness!\nMiso is also rich in essential minerals and is a good source of Vitamins B, E, K, and Folic Acid, so much good stuff for your body. \nSo on those Mondayest-Mondays-that-ever-Mondayed kind of days, you know you have a quick way to power though your day.  ABO Ramen Miso goodness all the way!\n\nGame-Changing Lean Ramen\nHow about we take a peek at that fitness essential checklist of yours?\nYoga mat, check. Adaptogens, check. Now add this: ABO Ramen, check!\nWe\u2019re innovating the reasons why people consume ramen, and we\u2019re doing this, one high-protein ABO Ramen bowl at a time.\nABO Ramen's vegan protein noodles are made from a green lentil base and has at least 22 grams of plant-based protein (the final product may have more) which is equal to a glass of protein smoothie (standard smoothies contain 20g to 25g of protein per scoop of powder). Your post-workout meal will never be the same again! \nImagine enjoying a warm, hearty bowl of ramen after every workout to fuel up, recover and build muscles? Talk about ultimate fitness goals & foodie dream combined!\nSo when they say \u201cabs are made in the kitchen\u201d, now you know ABO Ramen is one solid proof to that!\n\nYou Think You Know Umami\n...until you try ABO Ramen.\nABO Ramen has a rich umami flavour \u2013 the key to any delicious ramen \u2013 but unlike other ramens, we use only plant-based ingredients.\nAside from our incredibly tasty miso-based broth, we are adding our award-winning OKAZU condiment to ABO Ramen to create that delicious complexity of flavour and perfect umami bomb that elevates your entire ramen experience. \nYour dream ramen could finally exist in reality (almost, we need your help to make it happen!)\n\nFlavor In, Sodium Out!\nFACT: We are ramen-obsessed like you, but the truth is, most traditional instant ramen brands out there are loaded with less than ideal ingredients including salt-laden powder packets made in big factories. So harmful for your health.\nNo need to worry, ABO Ramen has 80% less sodium than regular ramen. It is also minimally processed and made only from REAL food.\nBest of all, we didn\u2019t compromise that familiar, satisfying, savory ramen flavor you love coming back to. Ahhh, perfect nourishing meal especially in this difficult pandemic time!\nSo next time your taste buds crave some piping hot ramen brimming with flavor, you can drop the guilt because you can eat ABO Ramen everyday!\n\nUpcycled Ingredients\nAs a company, we\u2019re all about fighting food waste and creating a positive impact to the environment. We are a part of the Upcycled Food Association (UFA), which is an organization that elevates food to its highest and best use.\nAccording to the United Nations, \u201cReducing food losses and waste is essential in a world where the number of people affected by hunger has been slowly on the rise since 2014, and tons and tons of edible food are lost and/or wasted every day\u201d\nLast year, our Instant Miso Soup helped divert 2 tons of sake brewing by-products. This year, we want to do more to help people and the planet.\nThat's why we are tapping into the powerful world of fermentation as a technique to create one of our key ingredients for ABO Ramen\u2014 \u201cSake Lees\u201d\nThe art of fermenting sake lees from our local brewery helps us create a food masterpiece that mitigates food waste.\nTHE RESULT: A product that is filled with new and exciting ferments, highly nutritious, has a unique flavor profile, and helps divert food waste\n\nWhat's in the box?\nEach kit contains two servings of ABO Ramen, complete with:\ntwo portions of ABO Ramen noodles, made with green lentil and quinoa (it tastes waaaay better than it sounds)\ntwo pouches of umami-rich ABO Ramen miso soup broth seasoned with our award winning OKAZU miso chili oil\n\nNutrition Facts\nHere's the nutrition facts for our latest prototype. We know it's already really good, but we're trying to pack in even more protein and nutrients, without compromising the taste, of course.\nIngredients\nGreen lentil, quinoa, Organic  miso paste (ORGANIC SOYBEANS, RICE, SALT), Sakekasu, OKAZU (SUNFLOWER OIL,  SESAME OIL, GARLIC, MISO PASTE {ORGANIC SOYBEANS, RICE, SALT}, TAMARI  SOY SAUCE {NON-GMO SOYBEANS, SALT, SUGAR}, ORGANIC CANE SUGAR, CHILI  POWDER, WHITE SESAME SEEDS, CHICKPEA FLOUR), salt.\n**Some ingredients may not be present in the final product, but no new ingredients will be added to this list.**\nRewards\nAs a company, we are very proud of our products, we consider them our work of art. Our community continues to inspire us to make vegan, gluten-free, non-GMO products that also have a positive impact on the environment.\nAs our thank you for your support, our backers can enjoy our Sofi Gold Award 2020 OKAZU condiment, our food-waste diverting Instant Miso Soup, our wild organic ceremonial grade ABO Matcha and immerse in a special cultural experience called \u201cKintsugi Class\" or the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold.\n\nOur Award-Winning OKAZU CHili Condiment (Chili Miso, Curry and Spicy Chili Miso)\nOKAZU is an umami-rich chili, miso, and sesame oil-based condiment often eaten with rice in Japan, which can also be used to top chicken, burgers, fish, eggs, potatoes, and more.\nUse it as a marinade or as an ingredient in your own homemade salad dressing, this condiment is versatile and we encourage you to experiment.\nOKAZU gained an initial following at farmers' markets in Toronto and has been featured in The Toronto Star, The National Post, Toronto Life, FoodiePages, and is a winner of the Foodie Pick Awards and prestigious gold Sofi Award winner in 2020.\nOur Healthy and Delicious Instant Miso Soup (Original, Black Pepper, Chili)\nOur Instant Miso Soup is made with nutrient-rich sakekasu, the by-product of making Japanese sake. In Japan, miso soup is something we eat everyday, usually in the morning, to keep a healthy and nutritious diet. \nAbo Matcha: Organic, Ceremonial grade Uji matcha\nThis is the best matcha you will every try. It\u2019s not just about an organic certification, but rather it is a philosophy to live with and preserve our Mother Earth.\nABO Matcha is certified organic in Canada, USA, and EU, but it is so much more than \u201corganic matcha\u201d. It is grown in Wazuka town, in the Uji region of Kyoto, Japan where tea farming has an 800 year history, starting during the Kamakura-era (1185-1333AD). The area\u2019s tea became known as \u201cUji-matcha\u201d and is of such high quality that during the Edo-era (1603-1868AD), it was reserved for consumption by the Emperor. Currently, Wazuka produces 50% of all tea produced in Kyoto, also Wazuka produces 40% of Uji-matcha.\nSpecial Collaborator\nWe are offering a very special kintsugi experience as part of our pledge rewards. \nYoshiko sensei was our pottery teacher in Tokyo and she also teaches kintsugi, the Japanese art of mending broken pottery with gold. Supporters who select this pledge for this reward will have a private online class with Yoshiko sensei. All the required materials for the class, including some broken antique pottery, will be supplied to the participant beforehand.\n\nAllocation of funds raised (plus if it's over)\nTo bring ABO Ramen to market we need to do some final testing and scale up production. Your Pledge will be used for necessary lab tests, such as a shelf-life study. It will also help us invest in the ingredients and packaging we need to launch.\nIf this campaign exceeds our target of $10,000CAD, we will also accelerate our wholesale distribution plan, start work on a new flavour, and enhance our community outreach by developing more recipes and other fun ramen-related content.\nDelivery Timeline\nWe expect to start shipping rewards by the end of August 2021.\nAbout Abokichi\nThe launch of ABO Ramen follows our exciting gold Sofi Award in 2020 for our OKAZU chili miso oil!

Abokichi  means \"Fortunate Avocado,\" a coinage from \"abogado\", a South American fruit which has found a place in cuisines all over the world, and \"kichi\" which means fortunate in Japanese, to express the blessing of the diversity of different cultures in the world.\n\nOur Team\nJess, Fumi, and Bobby\nThe Abokichi story story began when we, Jess and Fumi, met in Tokyo, fell in love, and enjoyed eating our way through the city. After relocating to Toronto, we decided to start a business to share some of the delightful tastes and traditions of Japan with a North American market. Abokichi started out selling at farmers markets, then opened a small brick and mortar shop, and eventually focused on delicious and high quality grocery products. Along the way we welcomed Bobby to the team. He is in charge of  production and logistics.\nToday, the three of us entrepreneurs work tirelessly, along with our dedicated team, to deliver you healthy and delicious Japan-inspired food.\nThank you!", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nProject is Delayed or Fails to Launch\nThese are common risks when producing any new product.

I have been running Horror & Opera since 2019. \nOn April 30th 2021, I performed a live Horror & Opera twitch stream where I showcased my original score of Haxan (1922). The event received incredibly flattering feedback, and I decided to organize this Kickstarter campaign in order to create a professional, studio-quality re-scoring of Haxan and offer my soundtrack on DVD together with the film, since Haxan is in public domain. \nWhy so cheap? \nI do everything myself: operatic singing, instruments (cello, bass, drums, synth), production and design. All I need is time, since, like many others, I work full-time to make the ends meet, and I would greatly appreciate time off work to bring this project to fruition.  \nWhat's in it for you?\nA lot of things!

Her film\u2019s breezy wit and pastel color palette disguise dark truths about national identity, gender, and coming-of-age, making it the first essential road movie about the TikTok generation.\nOn the edge of adulthood, Alma leaves her mother's home in the Netherlands and travels to her native Bosnia to visit the father she's never met. From the start nothing goes as planned. Her cousin gives her a frosty reception and mocks her easy life in the West. At the same time undeniable sexual chemistry leads Alma into a passionate affair with her cousins' best friend. As the obstacles mount, Alma stays fearlessly determined to follow her plan and find her father. She just has to figure herself out first. \nIn its breathless series of hotels, cars, buses, and waiting rooms, Take Me Somewhere Nice captures the dreary, fish-out-of-water isolation of the unfamiliar highway. An endearing update of Chantal Akerman\u2019s Les Rendez-Vous d\u2019Anna, fused with the jazzy cynicism of Wim Wenders\u2019 and Jim Jarmusch\u2019s 70\u2019s road movies, and the stark, sunlit despair of a David Hockney painting.\nAbout The Musician\nElla van der Woude is a Swiss-Dutch, Amsterdam-based musician, songwriter and composer. A versatile artist who scores movies,  has performed in bands and immerses herself in a number of projects, including the turbofolk inspired soundtrack for Ena Sendijarevic's debut feature Take Me Somewhere Nice.\nEna Sendijarevi\u0107 and Ella van der Woude in studio\nAbout the Music\nThis Soundtrack EP is comprised of 4 source music tracks and the credits music of the film. The initial idea for the music in Take Me Somewhere Nice was to make use of diegetic music only, creating music for specific scenes and places - a club in Bosnia, a clothing store in The Netherlands and a car ride with our three young protagonists. \n\"We simply let ourselves be inspired by the kind of music that would be played in these places and situations, and slightly exaggerated the features of the genres we were mimicking. Ena\u2019s guideline for the music was to underline the estrangement felt by the protagonists from their environment, amplifying their feelings of detachment from the different worlds they inhabit.\" - Ella van der Woude.\nBeing Ella\u2019s first time making techno and dance music, the music is naturally a little off and detached from its context, which contributes to giving the scenes a comic and surreal tone. \n The Album\nWhy a 10\"? The score to Take Me Somewhere Nice consists of 5 songs, and is approximately 16 minutes long. It is too much music for a 7\" and not enough music to justify a full 12\".\nThe Budget\nThe 10\" vinyl record is an oddity, and not often released these days. As such, a limited number of companies within the United States manufacture this specific size. Luckily for us we've found Pirates Press. \nBased on their minimum order requirement of 250 copies, Dekanalog has set out to produce a limited edition run of the Take Me Somewhere Nice soundtrack. In full transparency, please see our budget breakdown below: \nAdding in a small buffer for taxes and any unforeseen expenses (and because we like even numbers), we've landed at a final funding goal of $4,000.\nAbout Dekanalog\nLaunched in March 2021 with the release of Quentin Dupieux's Keep An Eye Out, Dekanalog is a film and music distribution company with an emphasis on presenting international titles for U.S. audiences; along with vinyl editions of some of our favorite film soundtracks.\nIn theaters June 11th, Take Me Somewhere Nice will be our fifth film release and first soundtrack release.

It sounds basic, but in live action cinema the camera is often moving either left to right, up or down, in or out. In stop motion animation, this is not so simple. It's almost impossible to move the camera during animation, because it would have to move such a tiny amount between each frame that it becomes unrealistic to achieve smoothly by hand. So motion control rigs and mechanisms provide the solution!\nThe motion control rigs that edelkrone manufacture will unlock camera movement for us, meaning beautifully smooth results. The start and end keyframes are set, and as we animate, it moves incrementally, changing tilt, pan, slide and focus. \nCheck out their stop motion product video below:\nExhibition Night! \u00a313,000 \nTo celebrate the film's completion, we'll hold an exhibition night where you can come and see all the models and sets on display before they head to their home planets! We'll have art from the project, from rough scribbles on notepads through to complete designs, and drinks and nibbles too. Every person who has pledged to the film will be invited. We're looking forward to seeing you there!\nWe\u2019re so grateful that you\u2019re here and considering contributing to the project! We hope the perks will be of as much value to you as your donation is to us.\nReally, genuinely, thank you for supporting us. It means the world, and we can\u2019t wait to show you what we make!\nCasting Call! \u00a311,000  - Complete!\nAt the end of Root Note, our four botanical heroes are discovered by a miner, who tries to communicate with them but fails. Root Note is told without words, just music. What we hear from the miner are shapes of sounds, but no meaningful words we can understand. We will cast a named actor to play the role of the miner for these lines. It will be a fun, exciting little easter egg in the film!\nThe Band - Signed Prints\nGroup concept art - Digital art on paper.

Here is the concept art for our five models on offer, Vine, Rocker, Flatcap, Combover and Miner.\nFive physical animation puppets available: Vine, Rocker, Flatcap, Combover and Miner. Models approx. 6-10 inches tall.\n Root Note is a stop motion short film about how finding your passion makes a harsh world more bearable. \nOn the edge of an arid slate mine, four starving plants scavenge to survive, until they accidentally discover something that allows them to thrive - jazz music.\nRoot Note is a film that celebrates difference.\nAs a strange, purple sun beats down on an even stranger landscape, we meet our four heroes on the wall of an abandoned miner\u2019s cottage.\nThey live in a world where flowers shouldn\u2019t grow. It\u2019s lunar, dusty. Stone and concrete has crushed most of what they need to live.\nEvery day, they watch an endless line of miners march to and from the quarry. They steal and scavenge what they can to survive.\nTheir routine is monotonous. Until one day they lift something unusual - a postcard from home. A picture of four happy jazz musicians having the time of their lives. In their element.\nMusicians - storyboard panel\nOur plants are inspired. They steal and cleverly assemble makeshift instruments from rusty mining equipment: a drum from oil barrels, a trumpet from some old piping.\nUsing the trudging drumbeat of footsteps, their jazz comes alive. Finally, the plants play with life and energy they\u2019ve never had before. They\u2019re loud and colourful. They have a place in this world.\nOur protagonists are a ragtag, motley jazz group. They\u2019re psychedelic and unusual - they don\u2019t fit in here at all.\nTheir character design is inspired by real plants that exist on earth (there are some truly mind blowing ones!). Our characters aren\u2019t going to be a single recognisable species of plant - they\u2019re unique. Each will have distinct ways of expressing themselves despite the world around them - with lots of creativity and flair.\n\nVine | Piano\nVine is the leader of our group. They are a tangle of long tendrils - resourceful, and an excellent pickpocket. Their long vines can effortlessly branch out and lift objects from far away. It is this that allows our gang to gather what they need to survive.\n\n Rocker | Double bass \nTall and lanky, Rocker\u2019s main feature is a mushroomy mess of woolly hair. Even though they are the tallest, they are quite shy. Rocker\u2019s expression is in their roots, which act as arms.\n\n Combover | Trumpet \nCombover is the short, rotund member of the group. Their wispy cactus fluff blows over from one side, giving them the appearance of a combover. Two central flowers give them two bright eyes that protrude outwards.\n\n Flatcap | Drums \n Flatcap is the loud, wild member of the bunch. Their distinctive feature is a large, overhanging floral \u2018flat cap\u2019. Two thin branches give them excellent arms for drumming.\n Miners | Ensemble cast \nWe want our miners to be totally alien - we\u2019ll see them through our heroes\u2019 point of view. It should be as difficult to determine their gender, race, as it would be for us to determine that of a flower. Their heavy overcoats, strange machinery and gas masks hide any indication of who they are. Their uniforms strip them of any individual identity.\nOur story is about the joy we feel when, despite a world that doesn't seem to care, we find our passion.\nWhen the world works against you, it wears you down. The path of least resistance is often to change - to fit in. To live up to the weight of others\u2019 expectations.\nRoot Note is a story about doing the opposite. It\u2019s about being loud and passionate and proud when the world wants you to downplay what makes you you. There is a joy in finding your passion - and that deserves to take up space. It deserves to be heard.\nAnd what\u2019s louder than a jazz trumpet echoing around a cavernous slate quarry?\nJazz is about improvising and collaborating - taking turns in the spotlight. Being in sync with one another. It\u2019s also about relying on instinct over language. Our film is told without words. It\u2019s really important to us that anybody can watch it.\nMusic is such a big part of Root Note - we knew we had to find the right musicians to bring our characters to life.\nThe Chineke! Orchestra\nThe Chineke! Foundation was established in 2015 by double bassist Chi-chi Nwanoku OBE with the mission to champion change and celebrate diversity in classical music.\nThe Chineke! Orchestra, Europe\u2019s first majority Black and ethnically diverse orchestra, made its critically acclaimed debut at the Southbank Centre in September 2015, and became an Associate Orchestra at the arts centre in September 2016. Alongside traditional orchestral repertoire, the Chineke! Orchestra enables audiences to discover work by Black and ethnically diverse composers.\nThe Chineke! Orchestra works closely with its sister ensemble, the Chineke! Junior Orchestra, with senior players acting as mentors, teachers and role models to the young musicians. In its brief and pioneering existence, Chineke! has performed at the BBC Proms, premiered works by Black and ethnically diverse composers, helped to launch stellar careers, including that of Sheku Kanneh-Mason, and won the Royal Philharmonic Society\u2019s first ever \u2018Game Changer\u2019 Award in 2019.\nChi-Chi Nwanoku OBE\nAs well as classical music, many of the members are keen jazz players. We\u2019re so excited to be recording live jazz instruments with members of the talented Chineke! Orchestra for Root Note.\nBen Squires | Composer\nBenjamin has recently had his music featured in trailers for Spider-Man: Far From Home, How to Train Your Dragon and His Dark Materials, as well as writing music for brands such as Superdry, HSBC and The Economist. Primarily, Benjamin scores films and TV, including Netflix\u2019s Tiny Creatures, additional writing for MTV's The Shannara Chronicles and countless short films.\nJuan-Miguel Hernandez | Music Consultant \nJuan-Miguel was a founder and member of the Harlem Quartet, which performed at the White House in 2008. In 2016, he was appointed as a professor at the Royal Academy of Music in London.\nHe has regularly performed with jazz living legends Gary Burton, Paquito D\u2019Rivera and Chick Corea, for which his collaborative disc won a Grammy Award. He has also collaborated on Nora Jones\u2019 album \u2018Broken Little Hearts\u2019, and is a close collaborator of five-time Grammy winner Stanley Clarke. He has played regularly as principal viola with the Chineke! Orchestra and Chineke! Chamber Ensemble. He has a strong commitment to educate and engage young people in music, and has taken part in outreach projects across the world.\nWe're animating this film using stop motion animation. That means every little thing you see on screen will be hand-made and painstakingly adjusted between frames to create movement.\nTo make stop motion look real, you need consistent light in the room. The tiniest change in light (e.g. the sun moving through the day) will cause a flickering effect that gives it away. So after a year stuck indoors, we can't wait to black out the windows and spend our summer in the dark!\nWe want to tell this story in stop motion because of the natural charm it brings to a story. There's nothing quite like seeing an object that exists in the real world move as if it's really alive. Stop motion allows for so much imagination that can be more stylised and 'hand-crafted' than CGI - perfect for endearing plants in an alien world!\nCavetown - Green\nWe have a track record animating inanimate objects! In 2019 we released a stop motion music video for Cavetown's single 'Green'. This story had some similar themes to Root Note - emphasising the importance of equal relationships, mutual respect and understanding. We really enjoyed the challenge of bringing these citrus fruits to life, and to create characters people could identify with and feel for.\nWe were overwhelmed by the response. As well as being watched by over five million people, the film also screened at London Independent Film Festival and Encounters, a BAFTA/Oscar qualifying festival in the UK. It won at the Berlin Music Video Awards for 'Best Narrative', and was honoured at The Webby Awards in the Animation category!\nWe're branching out (!) with Root Note when it comes to style and materials, but we hope the heart and emotion of our stories will stay the same.\nWRITER/DIRECTOR | GUY LARSEN\nGuy is a director born in Southend-on- Sea. His style has been described as dark, playful, irreverent and grotesque.\nIn 2016, he founded Penny4, a production company with a keen interest in making artistic, offbeat films for the internet. Combined with his love for illustration, this led him to explore animation. Guy directed and animated the award-winning stop motion film for Cavetown's \u2018Green\u2019. \nPreviously, Guy has collaborated with Roundhouse London, had his films screened on the BBC and worked at Google/YouTube at a top YouTube channel Vsauce, where he received a Streamy Awards nomination for Best Editing. \n\nWRITER/PRODUCER | CAMBRIA BAILEY-JONES\nCambria is a producer and Head of Production at Penny4. She is a member of the 2021 BFI Network x BAFTA Crew cohort as a writer and producer, and has had films screened at multiple festivals around the world. Her last stop motion was screened at Encounters Film Festival and the London Independent Film Festival, was honoured for animation at The Webby Awards and won bronze for Best Narrative at the Berlin Music Video Awards.\nShe has produced, written and directed work for a variety of high-profile filmmakers, creators and musicians in the online community, gaining millions of views online. Before that, she worked for UK production company Maya Vision International, making history documentaries for the BBC and PBS America.\nMODELMAKER & ANIMATOR | MO SOLIMAN\nMo is a stop motion animator and director. He holds a Master's Degree in Stop Motion Animation from the prestigious BAU in Barcelona. He also completed an intensive character animation course with NFTS and Aardman animations. He has worked on stop motion television adverts for the likes of TKMaxx and Homesense, as well as the Netflix/Aardman Shaun the Sheep series and the French television series, Les Kiwis.\n ASSOCIATE PRODUCER | SAMMY PAUL \nSammy is a British-Algerian independent filmmaker and YouTuber. His films, which have been viewed millions of times on YouTube, include Bicycle, Friend Like Me, One Another, Playground and The Fleeting Little Life of Peter Wright. He also directs music videos - notably for musicians such as dodie, Pomplamoose and Tom Rosenthal.  As well as posting many of his films on YouTube, they have been screened at the BFI and at Buffer Festival in Toronto.\n\n VFX | BEN KWOK \nBen is a New York-based VFX Supervisor and Compositor, working across feature films, commercials, music videos and VR content. He has worked for directors such as Darren Aronofsky, Matthew Vaughn and Roland Emmerich and for big brands like Playstation, Porsche and Google.\nDIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY | JAMIE MACLEOD\nJamie is a cinematographer who works across a range of genres from horror, drama, music videos and commercials. He has worked extensively with the BBC on high profile programmes such as The Invictus Games and the BBC Proms.\n\nWe love stop motion. It's magical, crafty, and lets us tell dark, whimsical stories. But it does have a bit of a reputation for being slow and expensive! One shot - sometimes not even a second long - can take a whole day to animate. That's a lot of time and commitment. \nBut we love it! And so we're only fundraising to cover our project expenses as filmmakers. Mostly costs associated with the materials, the kit needed for such a long shoot and to make our music the best version of itself.

We're hopeful that over the summer, we'll have all been vaccinated and case numbers will be low. But on the off-chance we have another wave, we have to be prepared to push the project back. After all, stop-motion requires handling sets and models!\n\nHappily, whilst this would affect timeline, it won't affect whether or not this project happens. We're so lucky to have the Penny4 studio. We can build our sets and characters and keep them safe for a time where we can all bundle in the studio together again.

Not only is it the directorial debut of the extraordinary Aramaki Shinji (Bubblegum Crisis, Megazone 23 III, Appleseed, Ghost in the Shell: SAC 2045, just to name a few), it was also the first title AnimEigo released, well over 30 years ago!\nMADOX is one of our personal favorites because it not only combines action and comedy with realistic mechanical designs, but also delivers a powerful moral lesson -- \"Read the @^#^@ Manual\".\nWe have wanted to release MADOX in HD for many years, but have been unable to do so because suitable film assets were not available. Everyone thought they had been lost, but in reality the original print was at Tokyo Genz\u014dsho, sitting in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying \"Beware of the Leopard Tank\", wondering why all the other OVAs were getting released in HD and it wasn't.\nAs far as we can tell, the only record of its location was mangled by a manically depressed fax machine, and only the heroic efforts of our crack team of Combat Archaeologists managed to uncover the truth.\nAt which point, we emailed Tokyo Genz\u014dsho and the reply was, \"Yeah, sure, we've got it. Also, we like Gojira.\"\nThe TLDR\nWe'll be doing things in much the same way as our previous Anime Kickstarters, so everything should be familiar to you because you backed those, didn't you? As usual, the goal is to do a definitive reference edition of the title. The Basic Blu-ray will be packed with everything MADOX-related we can dig up, and the Premium Set will add a detailed artbook and a chipboard case. We'll be doing one of our embroidered patches, and may do extra goodies if there is enough interest. As with our previous releases, this will be a limited edition, one pressing, and once it's gone, it's gone!\nOVA Synopsis\nIn the first test of a revolutionary personal battle-suit, the MADOX-01, Ace female test-pilot Kusumoto Elle smashes an attacking tank force and humiliates Lt. Kilgore, Japan's most-macho tank-jockey, in the process.\nKilgore swears he'll get even, and he gets his chance when the prototype MADOX literally falls off the back of a truck in the middle of Tokyo.\nMeanwhile, the MADOX, which fell off the back of one truck, off a bridge, and into the back of another truck, has found its way into the hands of college student Sugimoto K\u014dji. Intrigued by the MADOX, K\u014dji makes the big mistake of fooling with it without reading the manual first, and soon finds himself locked in the suit and zooming around downtown Tokyo.\nUnfortunately, the homing signal the now-active MADOX transmits results in a no-holds-barred response by Kilgore; even more unfortunately, even though K\u014dji doesn't know how to fight, the MADOX does a pretty good job on automatic (it's got \"Full Self Driving\" capability), resulting in a firefight the likes of which the local residents haven't seen since the last time Gojira hit town.\nConcerned about the property damage being caused to some of the world's most expensive real-estate, Elle dons a second prototype MADOX and tries to find and rescue K\u014dji before Kilgore's many minions totally trash Tokyo.\nAnd apart from the attempts to destroy the suit (and it's driver), K\u014dji has his own problems: if he breaks his date with his girlfriend, he will lose her forever -- and he's a tad overdressed for the occasion!\nWill K\u014dji be late for his date? Or will Kilgore make him \"the late K\u014dji?\" And more importantly, is it possible to eat Convenience Store shrimp in a battlesuit? The answers to these and many other questions await you in the 41 action-packed minutes of Metal Skin Panic: MADOX-01!\nDisc Contents\nWe're packing the disc with as much content as we can gather, and the contents will almost certainly expand as we go through production. However, at a minimum, you'll get:\nA new HD transfer of MADOX-01, created especially for this edition, in both the original 4:3 presentation (pillarbox) and a 16:9 version approved by Director Aramaki.\nThe original SD \"Weapons of MADOX-01\" featurette, that describes the real-life weapons systems featured in the show.\nEnglish subtitles, both our regular colored subtitles, colored SDH subtitles, and SDH captions.\nOur English dub, with SDH captions.\nColor and Line art galleries.\nAll the bonus features included on the 2003 DVD release,  including a commentary track, two interviews (one of which is mostly Robert embarrassing himself), the original Japanese documentary, and an Easter Egg IMDB describes as a \"disturbing behind the scenes look at AnimEigo.\"\nList of all Kickstarter backers on the disc.\nNew package art designed by Director Aramaki and illustrated by Mercy Rabbit. Director Aramaki will create 3 draft designs and the backers will vote on the one that will be fully realized. Also available as a limited-edition poster in both JIS B1 and B0 sizes (the latter hand signed by the artists).\n6-panel printed insert containing a poster on one side and a list of backers on the other.\nEaster Eggs and other hidden content. Or maybe not. It'll be up to you to find out.\nAs with all our Blu-rays, the disc will not be region-locked.\nDesign sketches for the new artwork\nA frame from the transfer (click for full-resolution version)\nAbout the New Transfer\nThe new transfer of MADOX was performed under the supervision of Director Aramaki at Tokyo Genz\u014dsho from the original print of the film, and clocks in at almost 700GB of uncompressed 2K video. If the project reaches the second stretch goal, we will also perform a digital restoration pass on the film, doing additional color grading, dust and scratch removal, image stabilization, camera flicker reduction and splice removal. Film grain reduction will not be performed, as some of you have strong opinions about that... :)\nIf restoration is performed, both the original transfer and the digital restoration will be included on the disc. All additional work will be supervised by Director Aramaki.\nReward Levels\nThe @^#^@ Manual (Digital Production Materials) - $5\nOnline access to all the art and other production documentation, plus you will be listed on the disc and Amaray poster insert.\nBasic - $30+ shipping\nThe basic set, a region-free BD-25 Blu-ray + poster insert. Includes all the digital rewards.\nPremium - $60 + shipping\nThe basic set plus the Production Artbook (at least 70 pages, hopefully more -- we're still hunting down materials), together in a sturdy chipboard box.\nPatron - $150 + shipping - Limited Reward: 80 Available\nIncludes everything in Premium, plus you will be listed as a Patron when the disc loads in addition to your listing in the regular disc feature.\nProminent Patron - $250 + shipping - Limited Reward: 20 Available\nIncludes everything in Patron, plus you will be listed on the first page of the list of Patrons in a larger font.\nPerfectionist Patron - $250 + shipping - Limited Reward: 4 Available\nIncludes everything in Patron, plus you will receive a set of the production check discs. Note that any bugs in the final discs will be your fault! :)\nGreyscale Shikishi Patron - $1000 + shipping - Limited Reward: 20 Available\nIncludes everything in Prominent Patron, plus Mr. Aramaki will create a greyscale MADOX-related shikishi based on your request and inscribe it to you personally (these are not intended for resale).\nShikishi Patron - $2000 + shipping - Limited Reward: 20 Available\nIncludes everything in Prominent Patron, plus Mr. Aramaki will create a colored MADOX-related shikishi based on your request and inscribe it to you personally (these are not intended for resale).\nThe price of this reward will drop occasionally until it sells out or reaches a reserve price. All backers who select this reward will get the same price as the final backer.\nDue to the way Kickstarter works (we can't change the price of a reward after someone selects it), all backers will be initially be charged what the price was when the first person selected this reward ($2500), but we will issue partial refunds shortly after the campaign concludes.\nExample of Mr. Aramaki's shikishi style. For the colored Shikishi, he plans to use colored markers on top of a greyscale Shikishi..\n\n\nAdd-ons\nWe have a tradition of producing limited-edition bonus \"goodies\" with our sets, available only to backers. They vary from set to set (we tend to do weird things backers suggest), but one thing we always do is a commemorative embroidered patch. For the Unobtainium Edition, we're going to do posters and a \"RTFM\" patch. Is that \"Read the @^#^@ Manual\" or \"Run the @^#^@ Mecha\"? You decide.\nThe patch and posters are available as an add-ons.\nIf you have an idea for a fun item, let us know. If enough of your fellow backers want one, and it won't hasten Robert's inevitable descent into madness (too much), we'll make it!\nStretch Goals\nWe're going to try something a little different this time. We've developed a menu of stretch goals, and each $25,000 raised in addition to the basic goal of $50,000 will allow the backers to collectively allocate a point towards menu selections.\nDuring the campaign, we are running a public poll so everyone can express their preferences and see what menu items are the most popular. Then, after the campaign, we'll have a private vote by the actual backers of the project to decide the final preference order (and since Robert is a voting systems nerd, we'll use his favorite system, Wright-STV)\nRegister your preferences in the poll here\nThe Current Menu\n New Commentary featuring Director Aramaki, Yamane Kimitoshi, and Koizumi Satoshi. (1 point)\n Digital Restoration Pass. The resulting restored version will be included on the disc in addition to the original transfer. (2 points)\n Madox Redux. It turns out there's a scene with an animation mistake that Director Aramaki would like to fix. We'll hire him to do so, and make any other tweaks he deems necessary. These changes will be incorporated into the restored version, and we'll create a special feature that A/B compares the changes. (2 points)\n New Trailer. Director Aramaki wants to create a new 90 second MADOX-01 trailer, with new original music and sound effects. Are we going to have to tell him \"no?\" Well, are we?! (3 points)\n Shipping Fees\nWe have World-wide English-language rights, excluding Japan, including orbits gravitationally bound to the Earth (seriously!). The ongoing drama that is Brexit has made it difficult for us to provide EU-friendly shipping, and we also have to charge VAT on UK sales now. Thus, the situation for International Backers is as follows:\n Canada: We will ship from a Canadian warehouse or direct from the USA using DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping; the shipping fee includes all customs duty, taxes and fees.\n UK/EU: We will ship from a UK warehouse or direct from the USA using DDP (Delivered Duty Paid) shipping; the shipping fee includes all customs duty, fees and VAT (and is higher for this reason). \n Everywhere Else: We will ship from the USA; you will be responsible for any customs duty, taxes and fees.\nCurrently estimated shipping costs for the blu-rays:\n US: $5 for Basic sets, $7 for everything else.\n UK/EU: $25 for Basic sets, $30 for everything else.\n Everywhere Else on Earth, except Japan: $20 for Basic sets, $25 for everything else. \n Everywhere Else not on Earth: contact us for a quote.\n Japan: Don't contact us for a quote. We can't ship to Japan.\nCurrently estimated shipping costs for the posters:\n US: $10 (Priority Mail Service).\n Everywhere Else: contact us for a quote after the campaign; these items are too big to ship by USPS International First Class!\nEU customs rules are changing in Summer 2021, and we're not quite sure right now how this is going to affect shipping logistics. If it turns out we have to ship directly without DDP service, we will refund EU backers the appropriate amount to move them into the \"Everywhere Else of Earth\" category). Similarly, if something happens that significantly reduces our shipping costs, we'll make an adjustment.\nQ&A\nWhy is it the Unobtainium Edition?\nFirst, because for the longest time, the print was unobtainable. Second, because when this limited-edition goes out of print, it will become unobtainable. And finally, to build a MADOX, you need unobtainable materials. \nHow are you making the 16x9 version?\nThe raw resolution of the film transfer is 2400x1743 pixels, but as you can see from looking at a raw frame of the transfer, not all of that is actual image. For the 4:3 version, we find the largest 4:3 region of each film reel that always has image in it and scale it down to 1440x1080. For the 16:9 version, we find the largest rectangle on each film reel that always has image in it, and scale down it so it is 1920 pixels wide. This results in an image that is more than 1080 pixels tall, so for each shot in the film, we pick the 1080 pixel segment that results in the most pleasing presentation. In both cases, the film transfer resolution is higher than Blu-ray resolution, so we are always downscaling, never upscaling.\nThe 4:3 version has the full original presentation of the film, while the 16:9 version crops off a bit at the top and bottom of each frame, but presents the remainder at a higher effective resolution.\nOriginal 4x3 presentation\nFull transfer image with maximal 16x9 centered framing\nFinal 16x9 framing (adjusted vertically to maximize interesting image; in this case, so you see Kilgore's chin)", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWhile we should be able to meet or beat release date, a video production project such as this can suffer unexpected delays. In particular, one side-effect of the excellent feedback we get from backers is that we expect a certain amount of \"feature creep\" as people come up with great ideas that \"simply must be done\", and these tend to stretch the schedule a bit.\n\nOur policy is that when a critical-path item causes a delay, we use that extra time to try and improve other aspects of the project. All of our previous projects have ended up shipping a few months late (each time for new and \"interesting\" reasons), but what we ended up shipping was better than what it would have been if we'd hit our schedule.\n\nThe bottom line is that we will take the time to get things right, even if that means slipping the release date, and that we will keep you fully informed every step of the way -- we typically post updates at least once a month.\n\nSome people tell us that the stories we recount about things going wrong are one of their favorite parts of our projects, but we promise we don't do it deliberately.

BulletVille is going to become a reality thanks to you. \n\nAlthough time left is limited, we prepared a stretch goal for the campaign. \nIf we reach $125k, we will design a hero through a polling system with our backer community!! We are very excited to think about what the result could be!\n * Pre-alpha footage captured in-game.\n\n\nBulletVille is a badass, brutal, fun, fast-paced third-person parkour hero shooter & platformer inspired by the classic team arena shooters of the past, mixed with modern game mechanics, featuring unique parkour movement, hero classes, vehicles, tons of guns and many game modes for unlimited hours of gameplay.\nBulletVille is currently planned for release on PC and Mac, PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and mobile (iOS, Android).\n\nWant to get a feel of the game? \nYou can play a teaser of the Alpha 1.0 on G.ROUND.\n\nAnd join BulletVille's 150,000+ fan base?\nHave a look at our Discord server.\n\n\n\nBulletVille borrows inspiration from many great games to create a new, unique experience.\n\n Frantic shooting gameplay from games like Quake 3 Arena\n   Diverse cast of game modes like Overwatch\n   Character progression from games like Paladins\n   Third-person high mobility from games like Warframe and Infamous 2\n   Vehicle combat from games like Borderlands 2 or Battlefield\n And much more in development to keep your eyes on!\n\nFrom bandits to robots to cats in boxing gloves, vagabonds and marauders of any shape and size are welcome on New Montana! Choose your hero, master their abilities, and blow new holes in your enemies with their unique weapons and play-styles!\n\n\u201cHand over your booze, your money, and your guns. In! That! Order!\u201d\nThe reigning king of the biggest bandit clan this side of the District. Formerly a top surgeon on Earth, Hunter Cassidy\u2019s life came crashing down around him when bandit loan sharks from New Montana killed his wife and daughter. In a drunken rage, he hijacked a shuttle, took his revenge, murdered the bandit clan\u2019s leaders, and assumed command of the whole clan as its new king - just in time to wake up with the worst hangover he ever had!\n\nHunter's Gameplay\nDue to his troubled past, Hunter has learned clever ways of getting revenge. He\u2019ll act as a comfortable place for most players to immediately pick up and play, with Recon capabilities and powerful weapons. His signature Rocket Launcher is his pride and joy, but he might break a bottle over your head instead just for fun.\n\n\u201cA dance costs extra, but I\u2019ll kill you for free.\u201d\nThe sharpest shot to ever sling suds. A troublesome teenage genius, Lacey Rose\u2019s bad attitude and cynicism turned an honest life of jumping between minimum wage jobs into a living nightmare. Her zeal for life returned when she heard of the Treasure Rush on New Montana, where she now works as a saloon dancer and moonlights as a treasure hunter, on the hunt for a fortune or an awesome death.\n\nLacey's Gameplay\nLacey brings her moves from the Saloon to the Battlefield and will dance, roll or slide her way to victory. Before the dust settles, she\u2019ll wrangle her enemies or force them to break out in a boogie before ending their misery with her trusty Shotgun.\n\n\"SOMEBODY GET GEARTOOTH A GUN TO EAT!\"\nGeartooth is the human equivalent of a cannonball-sized bullet shaped like a fist, with a heart of gold to fall back on. Once the most decorated (and most cybernetically-repaired) commando in the entire galaxy, a life without war left Geartooth with a whole in his soul. He\u2019s come to New Montana seeking the thrill of warfare, the bounty of treasure, and the constant sound of gunfire.\n\nGeartooth's Gameplay\nTrue to his backstory, the man really does eat bullets and brushes off explosives like flies. Being in the military, he\u2019s seen some tough things, but always knows how to bring up the morale of his troops. And if he ever gets lonely in the jungle, his AI turret, \u2018Milkshaker\u2019 is there to keep him company and watch his 6.\n\n\u201cWill he scratch? Will he bite? WILLY PUNCH!\u201d\nA cat in boxing gloves with an addiction to monster hunting (yes, you read that right.) Willy\u2019s existence is, in and of itself, a complete head-scratcher. Is he the last in a long line of universally renowned beast-hunting cats? Is he the end result of some mad scientist\u2019s experiments that escaped and embarked on a never-ending quest to rid the universe of monsters? Is he God itself? Nobody knows, and if you ever get close enough to ask him, he\u2019ll put out your lights before you get the chance.\n\nWilly's Gameplay\nWilly is little but he packs one hell of a punch. His weapons are his Left and his Right and he truly only wants to hurt people. Watch out for his pounce and uppercut, but you may as well call the morgue yourself if you piss him off. Sometimes he\u2019s cute and will take a nap anywhere though. Strange fella.\n\n\u201cWould you be willing to fill out a survey regarding your death?\u201d\nThe greatest mind in the universe with the heart of a child and an endless hunger to discover the meaning of life, through the study of death. Born in the heart of a dying star with no known creator, the Angel is a hyper-advanced AI entity based on New Montana for one reason: to satisfy her unexplainable fascination with life itself, by gathering test subjects for her experiments into death.\n\nAngel's Gameplay\nA flying Cyborg with precision aim and a real threat to life as we know it, Angel holds celestial power inside of her waiting to burst out. She has some extra mobility layered in to make her quite agile which helps get into great vantage points to give her Sniper Rifle a deadly angle..\n\n\u201cI was born to murder. I learned to charge for it.\u201d\nThe highest-rated, highest-priced assassin in the universe. The last surviving Mechassassin created by a pseudo-religious terrorist sect called the Order of the Dark Light, K-05 racked up over 1400 kills before they said their first word. Due to a glitch in their programming that causes them to envision the extinction of all life in the universe, K-05 currently plots to fund a campaign of omnicide by working as the galaxy\u2019s most expensive mercenary.\n\n K-05's Gameplay\nA killer that moves in silence, or can disappear in a puff of smoke, K-05 is a master of Murder. His Katana slices through enemies quickly from close, but his Sai can pin targets down at range and pull himself in to get a swift kill. The Premier Assassin in New Montana.\n\n\u201cMurderdogs! Murderdogs! Murderdogs!\u201d\nRunaway child of the universe\u2019s richest man and last of the Murderdogs. Born the last of Tarvos Wayward\u2019s daughters, Orion found an escape from her extremely sheltered and strictly-controlled life by joining the New Montana Murderdogs, a hyper-derby team known for their violence. Soon becoming their star player before she was discovered, Tarvos bought and immediately dissolved the team to spite his daughter, for which she burned down his estate and escaped into the night, vowing to take on her own father and everything with his name on it.\n\nOrion's Gameplay \nOrion has a strong penchant to burn everything!..and skate around peacefully while the fire rages. When you\u2019re on her team, she\u2019ll get you back in the fight quicker in multiple ways and when she\u2019s not burning or smoking the place out, she\u2019s picking up penalties for aggressive behaviour.\n\n\u201cToday is the greatest day since yesterday!\u201d\nThe biggest bucket of bolts that ever blew a hole in the hull of a Hypercruiser. A hobby project by an apprentice roboticist/mechanic, Trax is made of all the scrap her creator Trish \u2018liberated\u2019 from bandit vehicles, with a couple of heavy assault cannons thrown in. His personality upload was interrupted by an invasion of Trish\u2019s workshop, during which the half-baked happy-go-lucky Trax blew away the assailants. He now eagerly jumps at the chance to join in the fun with his murderous friends while Trish is away.\n\nTrax's Gameplay\nExplosive weapons for hands means some great zone control tools at Trax\u2019 disposal. Being made of car parts, Trish made sure to keep power under the hood and some Spy Gadgets just in case. If the rocket hands weren\u2019t enough, he\u2019s got a few more tucked away for the right time.\n\nGrind on rails, climb up walls, commandeer vehicles and mechs\u2014if you\u2019re standing still, you\u2019re doing it wrong! With a million ways to move around the battlefield, you\u2019re sure to find a method of murder that\u2019s right for you!\n\nSlide\nDouble Jump\nHop over rails\nRun on walls\nClimb walls\nSlide down walls\nGrind on rails\nGrapple swing\nGrapple Pull\nGlide\nHang onto ledges\nTeleport using portals\n\n\n\nNew Montana is a beautiful place to live, once you look past the constant death and destruction. Fight in the city, in the desert in the sky, or on the moon, among other scenic vistas! Don\u2019t stop to take in the landscape, or else that castle might be your crypt!\nTarvosham (Old London)\nIn its glory days, Tarvosham was the pet project of Tarvos Wayward, whose love of Victorian aesthetics inspired him to design the entire district of New Montana just a short distance from his front door. Powered entirely by steam (generated by underground nuclear power chambers), Tarvosham was strictly for people of class, sophistication, and proper dress sense. On her way out of the burning Wayward Estate, Orion personally lay waste to Tarvosham until its citizens were forced to evacuate. \n\nHigh Stratos (Sky City)\nUp where the air is clear and the hum of the neutron thrusters lulls you to sleep at night. High Stratos was originally designed to host dignitaries and officials from the Union of Galactic Species on New Montana; with features like luxury accommodation, furnished conference rooms, free WiFi, and a two thousand kilometre vertical separation from the planet\u2019s surface.\n\nOsaka-Ku (Nu Tokio)\nProof that gentrification can happen anywhere, even in space. Osaka-Ku was green-lit as part of a business deal between Tarvos Wayward and macro-industrialist Makemake Gyokai. Gyokai planned to use Osaka-Ku\u2019s economy to buy New Montana for himself, and turned it into a bustling sector for small restaurants and high-rise apartments. However, when Tarvos Wayward began the Treasure Rush and scrapped New Montana\u2019s laws, most of Osaka-Ku\u2019s citizens ditched the planet altogether. \n\nMarauder Mesa (Wild West)\nTechnically not a mesa, but bandits aren\u2019t exactly topography majors. Marauder Mesa started out as little more than a camp for the planet\u2019s first settlers. Once its treasures and history were unearthed, they established Harmony Vale with houses, a general store, and\u2014of course\u2014a brothel.\n\nThe District\nThe District is what happens when the guy who owns the planet you\u2019re building a highway on announces he\u2019s scrapping every law on the planet during your lunch break. The District was originally meant to be an interchange and layover spot along highways across New Montana. When Tarvos Wayward threw all of the already crime-riddled planet\u2019s laws into the fire, the entire construction crew abandoned the site to flee the planet before the carnage began. \n\nThe Golden Wasteland\nBecause of course a planet as worthless as New Montana is half-desert. Don\u2019t let the name fool you; the operative word here is \u2018Wasteland\u2019. You\u2019d be hard-pressed to find a tumbleweed in this arid landscape. But one thing you\u2019ll find plenty of? Bones. Just below the shifting, never-ending surface of the sand dunes is a graveyard of foolish treasure hunters, mercenaries and people who never learned how to use a map.\n\nCastle of Aarrgh (The Frozen Post)\nEither the owner of this castle died while naming it, or they were just a big Monty Python fan. Not even Tarvos Wayward can explain the existence of this random medieval castle built on a random craggy shore. (Or is it a reef? Maybe a delta\u2026?) The only logical conclusion is that some rich asshole with more time than sanity decided they wanted a castle and spent their life building it. It\u2019s a solid castle, but without a king. Or a kingdom. Or any point to its existence. \nWaypoint Station\nThere\u2019s a Waypoint Station on almost every planet in the Union of Galactic Species; a contract between them and the Wayward Group made sure of that. One of Tarvos Wayward\u2019s thousands of interstellar spaceports, New Montana\u2019s Waypoint Station is built on its moon, Helenia. With space fore even the largest commercial vessels, every Waypoint Station is complete with fuelling points, overnight rooms and a members-only commissary, as well as transports to the planet\u2019s surface. \n\nThe Scarlet Temple (Forest Temple)\nThe Scarlet Temple is a dark red stain on the Union of Galactic Species\u2019 history. Before the UGS claimed the planet that would eventually be named New Montana, it was the base of the Order of the Dark Light, a pseudo-religious fanatical sect responsible for the abduction and slaughter of millions of children across the universe. They built the temple to house laboratories, where they spliced the DNA of their victims to create the genetically-perfect Mechassassin. Only one such soldier, K-05, ever left the temple. \n\nAnam-Ka\u2019Rui (Alien Temple)\nA mysterious, unsettling structure in the heart of the Golden Wasteland. Its name is said to have been whispered by its discoverer, after he fainted upon setting foot inside. Tarvos Wayward has yet to formally acknowledge this citadel\u2019s existence, but theories as to its origin continue to pop up on conspiracy networks across the galaxy.\n\n\nKickstarter-exclusive \"Star Hunter\" skin concept - Make it yours!\n\n3D Glass Sculpture of Hunter\nNOWWA (Now, Winners Announced) is an independent studio run by Yohami Zerpa, which develops casual games for mobile platforms. In 2017, after nearly two decades of developing games for other studios, Yohami decided to go indie and create a game that mixed all his favourite influences from media and culture, ranging from victorian horror to futuristic cyberpunk, talking boxing cats and AI androids, ninjas and pirates. A few months and prototypes later BulletVille was born. Yohami is the main driving creative force, art director and manager.\nNOWWA is comprised by an all-stars team:\n\n Robert brings his AAA experience with networking, replication and server side code, and a vast knowlege of the intricacies of the Unreal Engine, supported by Mohamed \n Lewis polishes the locomotion sets and makes sure everything runs smooth and feels smooth for the players, with an obsessive eye for detail\n Phil and Nicola use their genius in marketing and social media to make sure the world knows about BulletVille\n Garrett works as game designer, level designer and keeps an eye on all tasks and brings structure into the project, with a cool head and a calm hand\n Robbin and Blaze are talented level designers that know how to adapt their creations for BulletVille's high mobility. \n Breiner, Aaron and Siavesh do the rigs and animations\n Joshua, Scott, Russ, Dragos, Alexandr bring the very diverse locations of New Montana into life with environment design and stylized textures\n Siavash is an amazing animator who brings our heroes to life! \n AkiraX3, Jesus, Mauro, Arty work on 2D design, interfaces, banners and logos\n Kyle, Joe, Kevin, Romain and Christian turn the concepts into 3D models, characters and props\n Peter, Crackers, Alexis take care of the lighting and shaders\n Stiven is a talented kid who works on UI and game modes\n Nick uses his long experience with SFX design to make our sound palette unique and distinctive\n Jask takes care of our community, especially the huge BulletVille Discord\nEmmy-winner Oscar Fogelstr\u00f6m creates our lush and rich soundtrack, with collaboration from Murray Atkinson \nMega-talented writer / voice actor Reece Bridger brings life to Trax, is writing every line of dialogue & lore and, last but not least, handles casting and management of other voice actors - our illustrious list includes Aimee Smith, Alexis Monteith, Cassie Ewulu, Daniel Dorse, Griffin Puatu, Jenna Kathleen, Lizzie Hofe, Malcolm Ray, P.M. Seymour, Terrance Drye, Thaddeus Walster, Tom Schalk and Yong Yea! \nAnd Tim watches in the back taking care of admin and finance \n\n\n\nBecause we\u2019re an independent game studio with big goals and bigger dreams.\nWe\u2019ve gotten this far bootstrapping the project as a REAL indie game, untarnished by pesky big corporations and dirty publisher tactics, and we\u2019d like to keep it that way!\nWe\u2019ve got private backing that allowed us to get this far, and enough to finish the core game.\n\nHow does this Kickstarter campaign and a backing of 100,000 USD help us? \nWell, the funding will allow us to grow our team and do QA, pay for artists and external developers to speed things up, do more skins, maps, game modes, and heroes.\nEvery dollar above our target will speed up development of the game and extend its scope even more - your pleasure!\nHere\u2019s what you can do to help!\n Like, share and retweet this video (link) recapping our kickstarter to new players!\n   Back our campaign! \nhttps://discord.gg/xP32KCRj", "risks": "Risks and challenges\nWriting highly complex software such as video game code with numerous components has the implicit risk of bugs that cannot be easily identified or fixed. But our indie studio team consists of people all around the world who really know what they're doing. The accumulated experience of certainly more than 100 years in game development and the transparency we always provided on our progress with BulletVille is the insurance that you get your reward in time.\n\nWe are self-funded out of personal income and proceeds from casual games we made so BulletVille will be launched in any case, it's just a question of time and scope - your backing will allow to deliver the beta/full version earlier and with more maps, heroes, modes and skins.\n\nCovid is a risk and could slow down development but will not prevent us from delivering BulletVille and the most impacted part is the time and place of the BulletVille release party due to travel and social gathering restrictions. We will communicate according to the further developments.\n\nBy far the biggest risk, which we are also unable to mitigate completely, is\u2014Tarvos Wayward himself. \nGiven his fortunes, he may snap up all available rewards, just to show he can.

THERE'S NO MARGIN FOR ERROR. AS SCIENTISTS, WE NEED DATA TO KNOW WHAT WORKS.\nRight now, in 2021, that dataset DOES NOT EXIST. \nThe answer? A high-resolution LiDAR scan of the Earth's surface, starting with the areas most threatened. \nCourtesy of Conscious Design // Unsplash\nIT SOUNDS LIKE SCIENCE FICTION, BUT WE ALREADY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO DO THIS.\nAnd, it\u2019s happened before.\nIn 2019, we watched in horror as the Notre Dame Cathedral went up in flames. The iconic spire collapsed and the roof was all but destroyed.\nMiraculously, though, art historians Andrew Tallon and Paul Blaer scanned the Cathedral using LiDAR in 2010.\nImage created by Andrew Tallon & Paul Blaer\nNow, their LiDAR scan is the most comprehensive record of the Cathedral and it\u2019ll be invaluable to the reconstruction.\n WE NEED A SCAN LIKE THAT, BUT FOR THE AMAZON \nWe\u2019ve already lost 50 percent of the world\u2019s rainforests, we\u2019re losing 18 million acres of forest each year, and rising sea levels will make whole cities, countries, and continents unrecognizable.\nUnless we have a record of these places, no one in the future will even know they existed.\nOrganizations like CyArk are doing incredible work to scan historical monuments. But nothing similar exists for the earth\u2019s landscapes \u2013 until now.\nProfile of a LiDAR point cloud from a tropical forest\n\nI\u2019m Dr. Chris Fisher, National Geographic Explorer, archaeologist, husband, and father.\nI was trained as a traditional archaeologist, using methodologies that\u2019ve been around since the 50\u2019s.\nThat all changed in July 2009 in Michoac\u00e1n, Mexico, when I stumbled across an ancient urban megalopolis \u2013 26 square kilometers \u2013 a lost city with thousands of building foundations. An archaeological site so big that it would take me decades, the entire rest of my career, to survey fully.\nInstead, my colleague Steve Leisz, suggested using a new technology, LiDAR, Light Detection And Ranging.\nLiDAR involves shooting a dense grid of infrared beams from an airplane toward the ground. What you get is a high-resolution scan of the earth\u2019s surface and everything on it. Not an image but a dense 3-D cloud of points, like this:\nPLAY\n\nIn just 45 minutes, the LIDAR scan collected the same amount of data as what would\u2019ve taken decades by hand!\nEvery house foundation, road, building, terrace, and pyramid in incredibly high resolution, representing thousands of people who were born, loved, lived, and died in these spaces. And what\u2019s more \u2013 the quality of these data was not comparable to traditional archaeological research \u2013 it was much, much better.\nI knew this technology would change the entire field of archaeology in the coming years, and it did.\nThe next time we used LiDAR in my work, it became the subject of Douglas Preston\u2019s book, The Lost City of the Monkey God.\nCourtsey of Douglas Preston\nThat book became an instant bestseller (maybe you\u2019ve read it!) but most importantly, it showed the potential of LiDAR \u2013 as a tool for archaeologists, ecologists, and geologists. But also, for conservation.\nIt made me wonder -- what if we used LiDAR to scan the entire Earth? It would be one of the greatest data sets in human history. A perfect record of our planet at one moment in time.\nThat idea became The Earth Archive, a non-profit organization & mission I launched from the TED Stage in 2019:\nTHE EARTH ARCHIVE IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SCIENTIFIC EFFORT TO LIDAR SCAN THE ENTIRE SURFACE OF THE EARTH, BEFORE ITS TOO LATE\nIts purpose is threefold:\n1) Create a baseline record of the earth as it is today to more effectively mitigate the climate crisis. The only way to measure change is to compare two sets of data \u2013 a before and an after. Right now, we don\u2019t HAVE a high-resolution \u201cbefore\u201d data set for most of the planet. So we don\u2019t know how things are changing and whether our efforts to combat climate change are making a positive impact. These data can be used by local stakeholders and indigenous groups to help solve issues of land tenure and conservation. Part of our mission is to help build grass roots capacity to store and use these data at the community level. \n2) Build a virtual planet, a digital twin, accessible to any number of scientists so we can better understand our world today. Archaeologists like me can discover undocumented settlements. Ecologists can study forest composition, tree size, age, and distribution. Earth scientists can study hydrology, geology, and ecosystems. And planners can use all this information to design sustainable conservation areas, the best places to put needed infrastructure, and resilient and sustainable communities.\n Preserve a record of the earth for our grandchildren\u2019s grandchildren so they can study & recreate our lost cultural and ecological heritage. As science & technology advance, they\u2019ll apply tools, algorithms, and AI to LiDAR records collected today, ask questions, and analyze them in ways that we can\u2019t currently conceive of. We see this as the ultimate legacy that we can leave for future generations. \nLike Notre Dame, we can\u2019t imagine how these records will be used, but we know that they\u2019ll be critically important.\nWE'RE MAKING THIS DATA AVAILABLE TO SCIENTISTS AROUND THE WORLD -- FOR FREE.\nThe Earth Archive is what scientists need to more effectively fight the climate crisis\nCourtesy of Ryk Porras // Unsplash\nWE KNOW IT WORKS BECAUSE WE\u2019VE DONE IT BEFORE\nSince founding the Earth Archive, we\u2019ve brought together a broad coalition of partners including:\nInstituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais\nInstituto Colombiano de Antropolog\u00eda e Histor\u00eda\nUniversidade de S\u00e3o Paulo\nUniversidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Pereira\nMapBiomas \nLeaning on 30+ years of research experience in Latin America, we\u2019ve cultivated relationships with local government officials, indigenous peoples, scholars, and stakeholders who are eager to get started. We are helping to jump-start local grass roots efforts.  In other words --\nWe have the technology, our team is ready, we have permission to do the scans, and the only thing we need to scan is YOUR support.\n\nAn example of recent deforestation\nImage taken from LiDAR showing deforestation\nHERE\u2019S HOW YOU CAN HELP\nEvery $60,000 we raise covers the cost of scanning a 300 km2 region of the Amazon \u2013 that includes hiring local pilots to fly & operate the LiDAR machine, then transfer, backup, and store the data.\nThe more you fund, the more we scan!\n\u2026 and the more we understand, conserve, and preserve.\nThe more we scan, the cheaper it gets. Scanning the entire Amazon will cost roughly $20 million.

But now, thanks to your incredible help, we have the funds needed to move into production this June, and to do so safely!!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!! \nWE ARE OFFICIALLY SETTING A STRETCH GOAL OF $8,000!!!

It is our hope, that by the end of it, we will have the budget we need to finally share our story.\nVALENTINE is a short film about a couple that heads to the Catskills for a romantic getaway. However, over the course of the night, issues surrounding gender & identity threaten to unravel the seams of the relationship.\nNan Goldin\nI was 26 years old when I realized that I was transgender. My gender had always been a constant source of tension for me. No one explicitly told me that to be trans was to be othered or hated or laughed at, but they didn\u2019t have to -- it was written into the media I consumed.   \nNan Goldin\nWhen I finally came out as nonbinary, I had already been dating my partner Beck, a ciswoman, for about two years -- it was as much a reckoning with her own identity as it was for mine. Based on a true experience, VALENTINE explores how shifting identities can affect a romantic relationship and test the strengths of love between two people. \nBlack Swan (2010)\nToo often do I see movies with this type of story end in total rejection of the trans character. In our film, we hope to show a more nuanced relationship in all of its complexities, one that feels authentic to our own lives.\nEuphoria (2019)\nAs a filmmaker, I am committed to creating stories that center the trans experience, so that the next generation of trans kids searching for validation and affirmation can see themselves and their stories reflected back to them onscreen. To have that in my own childhood would have been everything -- perhaps I could have spent more time just living my life, rather than imagining it.\nPhilip-Lorca diCorcia\nChris McNabb (Co-Writer/Co-Director/Editor)\nCHRIS MCNABB (they/them) is a Brooklyn-based filmmaker, two-time Emmy Award-winning editor, and Sundance Documentary Edit & Story Lab Fellow.
